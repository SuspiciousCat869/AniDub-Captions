00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.208
- [Nana K.] It's hard to
explain,

00:00:05.308 --> 00:00:07.980
but when I was small I
never thought of my mom

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.153
as anything other than my mom.

00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:15.796
Teachers were just teachers,
and cops were just cops.

00:00:15.896 --> 00:00:17.700
That's all I thought they were.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.106
But celebrities were
celebrities.

00:00:21.206 --> 00:00:23.712
They were different from me.

00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:27.686
They lived in a world
I knew nothing about.

00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:31.460
And I still thought that way,
even at 20.

00:00:32.863 --> 00:00:36.203
(upbeat rock music)

00:02:09.557 --> 00:02:11.994
- [Takumi] Man, I'm totally
surprised.

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:13.932
I mean, what are the chances.

00:02:14.032 --> 00:02:15.434
- I know.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.038
Surprised doesn't even begin

00:02:17.138 --> 00:02:19.510
to describe how I'm feeling
right now.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.013
- So where should we go?

00:02:21.113 --> 00:02:22.683
Is it okay for you to stay out
late?

00:02:22.783 --> 00:02:25.856
Tomorrow's Saturday, so I'm
guessing you got the day off.

00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:27.158
- Oh yeah.

00:02:27.258 --> 00:02:29.262
Is this really happening to me?

00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:31.868
- Relax. You don't have to be
so nervous.

00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:34.272
- Right. I didn't mean to.

00:02:34.372 --> 00:02:34.974
I'm sorry.

00:02:35.074 --> 00:02:37.245
- Hey, you don't have
to apologize. It's fine.

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:40.184
- Yeah, but I really
don't know what to say.

00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:41.119
- Okay, now you're startin'

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.956
to make me feel a little
nervous.

00:02:43.057 --> 00:02:44.492
- What? How come?

00:02:44.593 --> 00:02:47.833
- Well, because I never
expected in my wildest dreams

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:49.570
that we'd be meeting
up like this.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.006
I just wasn't prepared for it.

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:53.177
- Wait, that's the kinda
thing I should be saying.

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:56.349
- I was just thinkin' how
nice it'd be to see you again.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.788
- Ah, no way. I
don't believe you.

00:02:58.888 --> 00:03:00.124
- No, really, it's true.

00:03:00.224 --> 00:03:01.794
Why else would I have
found out your number

00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:02.629
and given you a call?

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.369
I don't make the effort
to call people very often.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.508
- [Nana K.] This has got to
be a dream.

00:03:08.608 --> 00:03:11.213
Things like this just
don't happen in real life.

00:03:11.313 --> 00:03:16.089
And even if they do, they
would never, ever happen to me.

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:22.402
(Nana K. gasping)
(seatbelt zipping)

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:26.476
(deep sentimental music)

00:03:26.577 --> 00:03:29.950
(car horn honking)

00:03:30.852 --> 00:03:31.888
- Green already.

00:03:31.988 --> 00:03:34.292
These stop lights are so
impatient.

00:03:36.396 --> 00:03:37.633
And so am I.

00:03:39.737 --> 00:03:43.110
- [Nana O.] Forget about
Takumi, he's a total player.

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.953
- [Nana K.] That kiss
was like out of a dream,

00:03:48.053 --> 00:03:50.625
but really all it did
was wake me up from one.

00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:54.900
This is no fairy tale, and
Takumi isn't a handsome prince.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.207
This is nothing more than
a one night stand for him.

00:03:58.307 --> 00:04:00.211
- Wait here for a second.

00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:05.387
(soft pensive music)
(footsteps clicking)

00:04:05.488 --> 00:04:08.494
- [Nana K.] What should
I do? Get out of here?

00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:11.901
I didn't plan for this
to happen.

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:13.771
- [Woman] Hey,
isn't that guy from Trapnest?

00:04:13.872 --> 00:04:16.878
- [Man] Yeah, cool. He's
so tall.

00:04:16.978 --> 00:04:17.946
- [Nana K.] Then why did I
even get

00:04:18.046 --> 00:04:19.583
in the car with him?

00:04:19.683 --> 00:04:22.021
He'd never seriously consider
going out

00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:23.725
with someone like me.

00:04:26.196 --> 00:04:27.666
I'm not stupid.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:31.406
I knew what going off to have
dinner with him might lead to.

00:04:32.576 --> 00:04:35.615
Maybe a part of me was
hoping for this.

00:04:38.086 --> 00:04:39.255
But why am I hesitating?

00:04:39.355 --> 00:04:41.761
This is a once in a
lifetime chance.

00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:45.234
I don't have a boyfriend, so
there's no need to feel guilty.

00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:46.336
I should just go for it

00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:50.077
and cherish the memory
for the rest of my life.

00:04:50.177 --> 00:04:51.046
(hand clapping)
(Nana K. gasping)

00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:53.383
- [Takumi] Sorry I kept
you waiting.

00:04:54.787 --> 00:04:57.526
(elevator dinging)

00:04:57.626 --> 00:04:58.093
(woman gasping)

00:04:58.193 --> 00:04:59.530
- He's from Trapnest!
- What, you mean Ren?

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.701
- [Woman] No, the guy with the
long hair.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:05.207
- [Nana K.] They saw us, and
he had his arm around me.

00:05:05.307 --> 00:05:09.650
What if the paparazzi, the
tabloids, the talk shows.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.856
- [Takumi] I'm hungry.

00:05:12.956 --> 00:05:14.927
- Um, uh, Mr. Takumi?

00:05:15.027 --> 00:05:16.731
- Mr.? What's with that?

00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:18.066
You usually just call me Takumi.

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:20.872
- Well usually, yeah,
but that's not the point.

00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:21.974
I don't wanna get all weird,

00:05:22.074 --> 00:05:22.676
but do you really want everyone

00:05:22.776 --> 00:05:24.647
to see you taking girls
up to your room?

00:05:24.747 --> 00:05:25.549
What are they gonna think?

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:27.218
I mean, shouldn't you
at least do something

00:05:27.318 --> 00:05:29.222
to try and be a little
less obvious?

00:05:29.322 --> 00:05:31.727
- You mean I should wear
some sort of disguise?

00:05:31.827 --> 00:05:34.800
No way. If I did that,
I'd stick out even more.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.769
(Nana K. laughing)

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:37.338
- It might suit you.

00:05:37.438 --> 00:05:39.075
But seriously, I'm not joking.

00:05:39.175 --> 00:05:40.377
- It's okay. Don't worry.

00:05:40.477 --> 00:05:42.883
The paparazzi don't
usually bother themselves

00:05:42.983 --> 00:05:43.518
with any of us.

00:05:43.618 --> 00:05:45.555
We try not to deal too
much with the media,

00:05:45.655 --> 00:05:47.726
that way we can still
lead a fairly normal life

00:05:47.826 --> 00:05:49.128
without bein' recognized.

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:49.697
- Are you kidding?

00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:52.268
Everyone knows Trapnest,
you guys are really famous.

00:05:52.368 --> 00:05:54.072
- I guess they'd recognize
Reira.

00:05:54.172 --> 00:05:55.942
Maybe she should
try the disguise.

00:05:56.042 --> 00:05:58.581
- I think all four of you are
just as famous as each other.

00:05:58.681 --> 00:06:00.852
- [Takumi] That's only
'cause you're a fan.

00:06:00.952 --> 00:06:01.453
- Huh?

00:06:01.554 --> 00:06:03.357
- A lot of people seem
to recognize Ren too,

00:06:03.457 --> 00:06:05.294
but now he and I are just the
blonde guy

00:06:05.394 --> 00:06:06.631
and the dude with long hair.

00:06:06.731 --> 00:06:07.933
- No, that's not true.

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:10.471
To me you're easily
the best Tak...

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.347
(elevator dinging)

00:06:15.447 --> 00:06:19.924
He must think I'm a complete
idiot, and an easy lay.

00:06:20.024 --> 00:06:22.128
Maybe that's the kinda girl
I am.

00:06:22.228 --> 00:06:23.497
With everything I've
been through,

00:06:23.598 --> 00:06:26.671
I thought I'd become more
cautious when it came to men.

00:06:26.771 --> 00:06:31.246
But nothing has changed since
that summer when I was 17.

00:06:31.346 --> 00:06:34.018
I just want to enjoy the
moment for what it is.

00:06:34.118 --> 00:06:36.724
And I won't worry about
what happens tomorrow.

00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:41.333
Oh my God. This place is huge.

00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:42.936
And there're even two rooms.

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:44.439
It's like we're in a palace.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.548
Is this one of those
pent house suites?

00:06:48.648 --> 00:06:51.621
- So, does that mean
you like the room?

00:06:51.721 --> 00:06:52.522
(knees thumping)

00:06:52.623 --> 00:06:55.528
- I could die a happy
woman right here and now.

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:57.398
It's almost like I've gone to
heaven.

00:06:57.498 --> 00:07:00.070
- If you're gonna die on
me, at least do it in bed.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.538
(Nana K. gasping)

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.613
But first, let's call room
service and get somethin' to
eat.

00:07:04.713 --> 00:07:06.951
(bright upbeat music)
Get whatever you want.

00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:07.519
- Huh?

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:10.290
We're gonna order the food,
then eat it here in the room?

00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:12.663
- Yeah, but we can go out if you
prefer.

00:07:12.763 --> 00:07:13.330
- No.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.100
I've always dreamed of having
room service

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.236
in a hotel like this.

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:17.806
- I hear the duck is one
of their specialties.

00:07:17.906 --> 00:07:20.545
- The duck? I don't think
I've ever had duck before.

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:22.849
- Really? It's good. I
think you'll like it.

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:23.751
What about foie gras?

00:07:23.851 --> 00:07:26.089
- I've never had that
either. Sounds great.

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:27.258
- Let's get some caviar too.

00:07:27.358 --> 00:07:28.594
- Oh, yay!

00:07:28.695 --> 00:07:30.397
- While we wait, why
don't you take a shower?

00:07:30.497 --> 00:07:31.701
Make yourself comfortable.

00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:34.506
There's a spare bathrobe
in there that you can use.

00:07:34.606 --> 00:07:37.979
- Yeah, sure. My own bathrobe?

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.885
He's totally at home here.

00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:45.027
Oh, this stuff's expensive.
I should snag them.

00:07:45.127 --> 00:07:46.964
(water splashing)

00:07:47.064 --> 00:07:50.672
I bet there are dumb girls who
go after Takumi all the time.

00:07:50.772 --> 00:07:55.080
I'm probably just one in
a long line of conquests.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.084
As long as I know what
I'm getting myself into,

00:07:57.184 --> 00:08:00.257
there's no harm in me living
out a dream for one night,

00:08:00.357 --> 00:08:01.660
is there?

00:08:02.696 --> 00:08:04.298
(sparkly music)
This is so good.

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:05.267
- Isn't it?

00:08:05.367 --> 00:08:06.036
But you know something, Nana,

00:08:06.136 --> 00:08:09.643
the food you cooked for us the
other night was even better.

00:08:09.743 --> 00:08:11.312
- I bet you say that to all the
girls.

00:08:11.413 --> 00:08:12.582
- No, I really mean it.

00:08:12.682 --> 00:08:14.853
When we're away on tour
we eat out all the time

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.289
and I get so sick of it.

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:17.124
- So I guess you guys

00:08:17.224 --> 00:08:18.895
are hitting the road again
tomorrow, huh?

00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:21.734
Are you sure you've got
time to hang out with me?

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:22.636
- Oh yeah, it's cool.

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:24.338
We gotta leave super early in
the morning,

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:26.109
so it's hardly worth goin' to
bed,

00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:27.011
but you're welcome to stay here

00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:29.683
and sleep in as late
as you want.

00:08:29.783 --> 00:08:32.656
- [Nana K.] What?
He's gonna leave.

00:08:32.756 --> 00:08:35.360
- Oh, come on Nana,
don't look so sad.

00:08:35.461 --> 00:08:36.997
It'll be hard for me to leave.

00:08:37.098 --> 00:08:38.467
- Oh, right. I'm sorry.

00:08:38.568 --> 00:08:39.570
It's okay, really.

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:42.743
I mean, it's not like I expected
to wake up in the morning

00:08:42.843 --> 00:08:44.913
and find you lying there
next to me or something.

00:08:45.013 --> 00:08:50.792
(Nana K. chuckling softly)
(cutlery clinking softly)

00:08:52.428 --> 00:08:55.334
- Hey, you know when the tour's
over

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:57.539
first thing I'll do is come and
see you.

00:08:57.639 --> 00:09:00.244
Maybe you can cook me up
something good.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.688
- [Nana K.] I shouldn't
fall for this.

00:09:05.789 --> 00:09:12.001
No, I'm okay. I'm not that
stupid. I'm not 17 anymore.

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:13.671
That was delicious, thank you.

00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:16.409
- If you don't mind, I think
I'm gonna go take a shower.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.681
Why don't you warm up while
you're waiting for me?

00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:21.453
- You really are impatient,
aren't you?

00:09:21.554 --> 00:09:23.156
Can't exactly run away
after stuffing myself

00:09:23.256 --> 00:09:26.697
with all this food, so go
ahead and take your time.

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:30.705
I wonder how many girls Takumi
seduced

00:09:30.805 --> 00:09:33.076
by bringing them up to
his room like this.

00:09:33.176 --> 00:09:35.648
Why would he want a plain,
ordinary girl like me

00:09:35.748 --> 00:09:38.386
when he can have
whoever he wants?

00:09:40.491 --> 00:09:43.096
I gotta warm up. I gotta warm
up.

00:09:43.196 --> 00:09:44.499
(phone chiming)
My phone.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.804
Should I just turn it off?

00:09:46.904 --> 00:09:49.375
090? Who's that?

00:09:49.475 --> 00:09:50.410
Hi, this is Nana.

00:09:50.512 --> 00:09:52.248
- Hachiko.

00:09:52.348 --> 00:09:54.018
It's getting late. I've
been worried about you.

00:09:54.118 --> 00:09:56.757
Do you know what time it
is? Where the hell are you?

00:09:56.857 --> 00:09:59.095
- Nana? Where are you calling
from?

00:09:59.195 --> 00:10:00.097
Whose phone is that?

00:10:00.197 --> 00:10:01.634
- Mine, all mine.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:02.702
- [Nana K.] You finally bought
one?

00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:05.775
- Nah, Ren gave it to
me. He forced me into it.

00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:06.911
- [Nana K.] Really? That's
great.

00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:10.050
- To be honest, I haven't
got a clue how to use it.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.319
Like how do you text message?

00:10:11.419 --> 00:10:12.556
- [Nana K.] Didn't it come with
a manual?

00:10:12.656 --> 00:10:16.196
- It's way too long.
I don't wanna read it.

00:10:16.296 --> 00:10:17.264
I was waiting for you to
come home

00:10:17.364 --> 00:10:18.835
and teach me what I
need to know.

00:10:18.935 --> 00:10:21.206
- But if you haven't
got the same model as me

00:10:21.306 --> 00:10:22.474
it'll be completely different.

00:10:22.576 --> 00:10:23.511
- [Nana O.] Really?

00:10:23.611 --> 00:10:25.982
Then you gotta come home
quick, read the manual,

00:10:26.082 --> 00:10:27.184
and then teach me.

00:10:27.284 --> 00:10:27.853
(Nana K. sighing)

00:10:27.953 --> 00:10:29.623
- Where's Ren? Can't he
teach you?

00:10:29.723 --> 00:10:31.527
He's the one who bought
it for you.

00:10:31.627 --> 00:10:33.463
- [Nana O.] He just left.

00:10:34.198 --> 00:10:34.800
- Oh, right.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.706
He's leaving for the tour
early in the morning, isn't he?

00:10:37.806 --> 00:10:38.875
- Yeah, how'd you know that?

00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:41.881
- Uh, 'cause Ren said something
about it yesterday, I guess.

00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:44.051
- He did?
- Yeah. I'm sure he did.

00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:47.626
- [Nana O.] So where are you?
When are you coming home?

00:10:48.426 --> 00:10:49.530
- Yeah, well, the thing is,

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.268
I'm sort of hanging out at
a friend's place right now

00:10:52.368 --> 00:10:53.704
and I might stay the night.

00:10:53.804 --> 00:10:55.942
- Oh, so you have some other
friend

00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:58.113
who lets you sleep over
that I don't know about?

00:10:58.213 --> 00:10:59.348
- Uh.

00:10:59.448 --> 00:11:00.384
- Is it a boy?

00:11:00.484 --> 00:11:02.254
- No, I'm over at Jun's.

00:11:02.354 --> 00:11:03.056
(Nana O. laughing)

00:11:03.156 --> 00:11:05.494
- I'm just teasing. You
don't have to freak out.

00:11:05.595 --> 00:11:06.162
Alrighty then,

00:11:06.262 --> 00:11:08.935
guess I'll just have to figure
out the phone on my own.

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.738
Say hi to Junko for me.

00:11:12.174 --> 00:11:15.715
- [Nana K.] I can't tell Nana.
I don't want her to know.

00:11:17.586 --> 00:11:19.422
I don't want her to think I'm
a slut.

00:11:19.523 --> 00:11:22.127
She'd never look at
me the same.

00:11:22.228 --> 00:11:25.000
(soft dramatic music)

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.637
What I want more than
anything in the world

00:11:26.737 --> 00:11:28.708
is to find true love.

00:11:28.808 --> 00:11:30.678
Just the same as you Nana.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.582
I want to have something as
strong

00:11:32.682 --> 00:11:35.989
as the connection that
exists between you and Ren.

00:11:36.089 --> 00:11:40.063
The truth is that I'm not
okay with what I'm doing here.

00:11:40.163 --> 00:11:42.167
I don't wanna have a one
night stand with Takumi

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:44.205
and get dumped in the morning.

00:11:44.305 --> 00:11:45.708
What should I do?

00:11:45.808 --> 00:11:51.319
Nana, I'm scared, but it's
too late to turn back now.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:54.025
I can't tell him that
I want him to love me.

00:11:56.897 --> 00:11:58.333
This isn't good.

00:11:58.433 --> 00:12:01.707
I could end up getting
hurt all over again.

00:12:06.382 --> 00:12:10.223
- [Junko] So, what do you
think this alibi's all about?

00:12:10.324 --> 00:12:13.798
- I have no idea. Nana's
roommate's a woman, right?

00:12:13.898 --> 00:12:14.131
- Hmm.

00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:16.135
But she's so tough and
protective of Nana

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:17.104
that sometimes I wonder.

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:19.375
Nana seems to be so
totally obsessed with her,

00:12:19.475 --> 00:12:19.943
it wouldn't surprise me

00:12:20.043 --> 00:12:22.414
if there was something
going on between them.

00:12:22.515 --> 00:12:24.352
Not that it makes any difference
to me.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:25.354
- Oh really?

00:12:25.454 --> 00:12:26.991
- Something's fishy.

00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:27.759
- Oh yeah, like what?

00:12:27.859 --> 00:12:31.065
Um, Junko, you haven't had
that much to drink, have you?

00:12:31.165 --> 00:12:33.871
- I think I smell a new
boyfriend in Nana's life.

00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:36.042
I just hope she hasn't
fallen for a guy so dangerous

00:12:36.142 --> 00:12:39.348
that she has to hide
him from her roommate.

00:12:39.448 --> 00:12:40.752
- [Nana K.] As I was lying
there,

00:12:40.852 --> 00:12:44.860
Takumi's long hair rained
down on me, all over my body.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.464
I loved the touch of it
against my skin so much

00:12:47.565 --> 00:12:50.370
I hoped he would never cut his
hair short.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.211
Even though I knew I might
never be able to touch it again.

00:13:03.129 --> 00:13:06.069
(pen scratching)

00:13:07.204 --> 00:13:08.340
(pen clattering)

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.012
(footsteps tapping)

00:13:11.112 --> 00:13:14.820
(door squeaking)

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.857
He said I made it hard for him
to leave,

00:13:16.957 --> 00:13:20.130
but he sure managed to
leave in a hurry.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.232
Always in a rush.

00:13:21.332 --> 00:13:24.706
The prince has many things
to attend to, you know.

00:13:25.508 --> 00:13:26.844
I should get outta here.

00:13:26.944 --> 00:13:30.150
My carriage has turned
back into a pumpkin.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.720
(Nana K. moaning)

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.760
I can't, I don't
have the energy.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.832
It's like I have nothing
left to hold me up.

00:13:42.374 --> 00:13:44.211
I've gotta get it together.

00:13:44.311 --> 00:13:46.784
I've got to return to reality.

00:13:46.884 --> 00:13:49.856
I'll look for a new job
in the morning, any job.

00:13:49.956 --> 00:13:54.298
And this time I'm gonna take
it seriously and work hard.

00:13:54.398 --> 00:13:56.469
Huh? Damn.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:57.739
The last train's already gone,

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:00.778
and I don't have enough
money to take a cab home.

00:14:00.878 --> 00:14:04.385
I guess I'll just have
to spend the night here.

00:14:04.485 --> 00:14:07.592
Anyway, it's the only time
I'm ever gonna get a chance

00:14:07.692 --> 00:14:09.796
to stay somewhere like this.

00:14:09.896 --> 00:14:13.203
(Nana K. gasping)

00:14:15.742 --> 00:14:19.315
(soft emotional music)

00:14:20.484 --> 00:14:24.760
(Nana K. sobbing softly)

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.834
The last day of the tour
is July 8th, here in Tokyo.

00:14:30.972 --> 00:14:34.546
I don't have a ticket, so I'll
just cook something delicious

00:14:34.646 --> 00:14:37.151
and have it ready for you at
home.

00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:40.925
I'll be here waiting,
hoping that you'll come.

00:14:42.662 --> 00:14:43.831
- What? You hung out with Yasu?

00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:46.102
What the hell? Why didn't you
invite me?

00:14:46.202 --> 00:14:49.175
- Shut your mouth, blondie.
I'm trying to read over here.

00:14:49.275 --> 00:14:50.912
- Huh? (Naoki groaning)

00:14:51.012 --> 00:14:52.582
So how's he doin'? Is he okay?

00:14:52.682 --> 00:14:54.018
- He's fine, I guess.

00:14:54.118 --> 00:14:55.888
Hasn't changed a bit
since we last saw him.

00:14:55.988 --> 00:14:58.092
- He's still a skinhead, isn't
he?

00:14:58.193 --> 00:14:58.694
- Yeah.

00:14:58.794 --> 00:14:59.763
- Nose still pierced?

00:14:59.863 --> 00:15:01.365
- Uh huh.
- So, what else?

00:15:01.466 --> 00:15:02.101
What's he up to these days?

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:04.138
- Geez, enough with all the
questions.

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:06.710
I'm tired and I wanna catch some
Zs, okay?

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.046
Anyone wanna switch seats?

00:15:08.146 --> 00:15:11.252
- Sure. I don't mind switching
with Naoki.

00:15:13.591 --> 00:15:14.993
- Hey Take, which side of the
train

00:15:15.093 --> 00:15:16.195
is Mount Fuji gonna be on?

00:15:16.295 --> 00:15:19.201
I wanna get a good look
at it. Come on, tell me.

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:20.872
- Takumi?

00:15:20.972 --> 00:15:24.044
- Yasu, he's a big lawyer
now apparently.

00:15:24.145 --> 00:15:27.752
- Uh huh. That isn't
what I was gonna ask you.

00:15:27.852 --> 00:15:29.923
- But you wanted to know, didn't
ya?

00:15:30.023 --> 00:15:32.595
- You mean they let him practice
law looking like that?

00:15:32.695 --> 00:15:33.531
(Takumi laughing)

00:15:33.631 --> 00:15:34.699
- Lookin' like that.

00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:37.639
- So he really did it.
His dream came true.

00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:38.974
Good for him.

00:15:39.074 --> 00:15:40.645
- Actually, he was a senior in
college

00:15:40.745 --> 00:15:42.247
when he decided to take the
bar exam

00:15:42.347 --> 00:15:44.553
and he still managed
to ace the thing.

00:15:44.653 --> 00:15:46.322
That guy's so smart it's crazy.

00:15:46.422 --> 00:15:47.291
- Wow.

00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:48.426
- Why is that crazy?

00:15:48.527 --> 00:15:49.729
- Sit down and shut up, blondie,

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.934
it's got nothin' to do with you.

00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:54.471
Anyway, he moved to Tokyo so
he could play with his band.

00:15:54.573 --> 00:15:56.844
So now his dream's to become
a professional musician.

00:15:56.944 --> 00:15:59.281
- What? He's in Tokyo playing
with a band?

00:15:59.381 --> 00:16:02.187
- Yeah. It's the same band Ren
was in before he joined us.

00:16:02.287 --> 00:16:04.860
Once they moved here they had
to find a new bass player,

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.433
but they found one so now
they're really goin' for it.

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:09.468
- What the hell is this?

00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:11.773
He always said he could never
take playing music seriously,

00:16:11.874 --> 00:16:13.777
and it would only ever be a
hobby to him.

00:16:13.878 --> 00:16:15.648
I don't understand.

00:16:15.748 --> 00:16:16.349
- I know, it sucks.

00:16:16.449 --> 00:16:18.821
You want me to rough him
up for you or somethin'?

00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:22.762
- What I don't get is why he
decided to change his mind now.

00:16:26.002 --> 00:16:30.778
- Yasu!
(footsteps tapping)

00:16:30.878 --> 00:16:32.949
I thought you quit smoking.

00:16:33.049 --> 00:16:34.719
Oh, whatever. You can finish it.

00:16:34.819 --> 00:16:36.055
I know you've only
been playing along

00:16:36.155 --> 00:16:38.827
with this stop smoking
plan whenever I'm around.

00:16:38.928 --> 00:16:40.865
Just do whatever you want from
now on.

00:16:40.965 --> 00:16:42.735
You're all Mr. Nice Guy
on the surface,

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:45.875
but who knows what you
get up to behind my back.

00:16:45.975 --> 00:16:48.079
What else are you
hiding from me?

00:16:48.179 --> 00:16:49.583
- Uh, nothin' worth mentioning.

00:16:49.683 --> 00:16:51.352
- Nothing? You sneaky bastard.

00:16:51.452 --> 00:16:53.189
This time I'm really pissed
off with you.

00:16:53.289 --> 00:16:56.630
How come you never told me you
used to go out with Reira?

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.968
- Oh, that. I'm sorry.

00:16:59.068 --> 00:17:02.274
- Reira's singing made that
big an impact on you, huh?

00:17:02.374 --> 00:17:03.577
As if you didn't know.

00:17:03.677 --> 00:17:05.715
- I said I'm sorry.

00:17:08.219 --> 00:17:11.425
- I gotta say, she really
was great on stage.

00:17:11.526 --> 00:17:13.496
Watching her, I was so jealous.

00:17:13.597 --> 00:17:15.400
I felt like I couldn't compete.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.872
Has she always been that good?

00:17:17.972 --> 00:17:20.978
Was she a born singer?
A natural talent?

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.519
- Maybe.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:25.655
(Nana O. groaning)

00:17:25.755 --> 00:17:28.727
Well, if nothing else
she's got abs of steel.

00:17:30.998 --> 00:17:34.104
- Huh. I guess if anyone
would know, it'd be you.

00:17:35.942 --> 00:17:38.313
- Where's Hachi? Isn't she
coming today?

00:17:38.413 --> 00:17:41.218
- Nobu, you've been asking
the same thing all night.

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:43.791
- Tell me Nobuo, are you
in love with Hachiko?

00:17:43.891 --> 00:17:44.458
- No way.

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:47.464
It's just weird not havin' our
resident audience member her.

00:17:47.565 --> 00:17:49.536
- But Hahci's just one person.

00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:51.405
- I wanna do a show! Ah!

00:17:52.742 --> 00:17:54.679
I need to sing so bad!

00:17:54.779 --> 00:17:55.347
- Sure, let's go for it.

00:17:55.447 --> 00:17:57.150
We've been offered
the chance to play.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:57.819
- Hmm?

00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:58.954
- What? No way, where?

00:17:59.054 --> 00:18:00.891
- Same place we
played last time.

00:18:00.992 --> 00:18:01.760
We drew a good crowd

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.764
so they asked if we
wanted to come back.

00:18:03.864 --> 00:18:04.766
- Let's do it.

00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:06.435
- [Both] Alright.

00:18:09.843 --> 00:18:12.247
- That morning I applied for
three jobs;

00:18:12.347 --> 00:18:15.186
a dental receptionist,
a supermarket cashier,

00:18:15.286 --> 00:18:18.594
and working the phones at a
pizza place.

00:18:18.694 --> 00:18:20.965
I got rejected by them all.

00:18:21.065 --> 00:18:22.367
Why won't they hire me?
What's wrong with me?

00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:25.407
- Did they ask why you got
fired from your old job?

00:18:25.508 --> 00:18:26.042
- Yeah, I told them it was

00:18:26.142 --> 00:18:28.313
'cause my old boss thought I
was a slacker in the office,

00:18:28.413 --> 00:18:29.983
but I promised I
was gonna shape up

00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:32.555
and take the whole work thing
more seriously from now on.

00:18:32.655 --> 00:18:33.356
- You told them you got fired

00:18:33.456 --> 00:18:34.859
'cause you goofed off and did
nothing?

00:18:34.959 --> 00:18:36.495
How stupid.
(Nana K. gasping)

00:18:36.596 --> 00:18:40.036
Nana, you gotta realize if you
go chasing after any old job,

00:18:40.136 --> 00:18:42.174
the same thing's gonna
happen again and again.

00:18:42.274 --> 00:18:44.612
What you need to do is
find a job that suits you.

00:18:44.713 --> 00:18:46.817
- And what kinda
job would that be?

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:47.384
- Well, I don't know.

00:18:47.484 --> 00:18:49.889
There's gotta be some kind
of work you enjoy doing.

00:18:49.989 --> 00:18:50.958
We've just gotta figure out

00:18:51.058 --> 00:18:52.995
what sort of job suits your
personality.

00:18:53.096 --> 00:18:55.333
When people like their
job, they do better work.

00:18:55.433 --> 00:18:56.770
That's all the
motivation you need.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.876
Like when you worked for
Mr. Mizukoshi at Sabrina.

00:18:59.976 --> 00:19:01.847
You were surrounded
by stuff you loved,

00:19:01.947 --> 00:19:03.316
you could dress all hip
and trendy,

00:19:03.416 --> 00:19:04.886
and you had fun while you
were there.

00:19:04.986 --> 00:19:07.525
Why don't you look
for another job like that?

00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:08.259
(Nana O. slurping)

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:10.598
- Oh, she's right. That
makes total sense.

00:19:10.698 --> 00:19:13.737
Mr. Mizukoshi. I
wonder what he's doing now.

00:19:13.837 --> 00:19:15.541
- Don't start thinkin' about him
again.

00:19:15.641 --> 00:19:17.077
- But I
do wonder.

00:19:17.177 --> 00:19:18.479
I know I never told you before,

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.851
but I kinda had a crush on
him when I worked there.

00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:23.690
- Only kind of? It was
obvious you wanted him.

00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:24.993
So tell me something.

00:19:25.093 --> 00:19:27.832
Mizukoshi and Takumi
both have long hair.

00:19:27.932 --> 00:19:29.636
Do you have a fetish?
- No I do not.

00:19:29.736 --> 00:19:31.205
- Why are you overreacting?

00:19:31.305 --> 00:19:33.443
- Because you're being weird
and it's freaking me out.

00:19:33.544 --> 00:19:34.344
- Why is it weird?

00:19:34.445 --> 00:19:36.516
I like guys with short
hair, it's no big deal.

00:19:36.616 --> 00:19:37.484
Just a preference.

00:19:37.585 --> 00:19:39.789
- I don't have a type.
Takashi had short hair.

00:19:39.889 --> 00:19:40.356
- Takashi?

00:19:40.457 --> 00:19:42.895
- And so did Shoji.
(Nana O. gasping)

00:19:42.995 --> 00:19:45.033
(Nana K. gasping)

00:19:45.133 --> 00:19:47.070
- I don't know what you
classify as short,

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.007
but Shoji's hair looked
long to me.

00:19:49.108 --> 00:19:50.076
- Really?

00:19:50.176 --> 00:19:52.882
- Well, I guess it isn't
exactly a crew cut.

00:19:52.982 --> 00:19:54.384
- While we're on the subject of
Shoji,

00:19:54.485 --> 00:19:57.290
do you feel like
you're over him yet?

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.927
- Hmm.

00:19:59.027 --> 00:20:00.898
- You should hurry up
and get a new boyfriend,

00:20:00.998 --> 00:20:02.367
with long hair.

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:03.771
- [Nana K.] I couldn't bring
myself

00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:05.574
to tell her about me and Takumi.

00:20:05.674 --> 00:20:09.582
And because of who he was,
I couldn't even tell Jun.

00:20:09.682 --> 00:20:11.485
I had no one to talk to.

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:14.626
I'd never fallen in love like
that before.

00:20:14.726 --> 00:20:16.328
And it was painful.

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:22.240
- Hey Shoji, are you really
moving?

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.716
- Shoji's moving in with
Sachiko?

00:20:26.817 --> 00:20:29.756
That was fast. They're quite
the lovey-dovey couple.

00:20:29.856 --> 00:20:31.125
- Well, good for them.

00:20:31.225 --> 00:20:35.500
In a way I'm kinda jealous.
Young love, exciting and new.

00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:36.202
(Junko sighing)

00:20:36.302 --> 00:20:38.406
- Those were the days.

00:20:38.507 --> 00:20:39.509
- Yeah.

00:20:40.644 --> 00:20:42.013
(soft hopeful music)

00:20:42.114 --> 00:20:44.084
- [Nana K.] Eventually
I worked up the guts

00:20:44.184 --> 00:20:45.320
to get in touch with Takumi

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.594
by sending a text message
while he was on tour.

00:20:49.896 --> 00:20:51.398
But he never replied.

00:20:56.408 --> 00:21:00.316
Hey, Nana. I've always adored
you, Nana.

00:21:01.853 --> 00:21:03.690
I wanted to be like you.

00:21:04.826 --> 00:21:05.861
(soft upbeat rock music)

00:21:05.961 --> 00:21:07.598
I still feel that way.

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:12.708
So please, sing for me
one more time.
