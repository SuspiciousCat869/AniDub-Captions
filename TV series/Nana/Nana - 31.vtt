WEBVTT

00:00:02.698 --> 00:00:04.902
- [Nana K.] My wall was faded by
the sun.

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:08.442
You could still see where
the poster used to be.

00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:12.216
(alternative rock music)

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:48.810
- [Nana K.] What?

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:49.678
You're an only child?

00:01:49.778 --> 00:01:51.883
- Yeah, my parents must be
crying

00:01:51.983 --> 00:01:54.454
right now or just pissed off.

00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:54.955
- Oh, 'cause you're supposed

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:57.961
to take over your
family's big hotel, right?

00:01:59.397 --> 00:02:01.468
So just how big is it?

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.640
(upbeat chimes)

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.909
- Hmm? Oh, I get it.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.846
You only remember the important
stuff.

00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:09.217
What's going on in this pretty
head?

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:09.885
(Nana K. laughs)

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:12.323
- But when Blast debuts, I
bet they'll be so thrilled,

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:15.429
they'll forgive you right
away, parents are like that.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.268
So just make sure that happens.

00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:19.772
- I'll do my best for my Hachi.

00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:22.276
- I told you, don't call me
Hachi.

00:02:22.376 --> 00:02:23.212
- But when I hear the name Nana,

00:02:23.312 --> 00:02:26.218
all I can think of is that cat
eyed-queen.

00:02:26.318 --> 00:02:28.021
(meows)

00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:28.590
(Nana K. laughs)

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.324
- Cat-eyed?
- Yeah.

00:02:29.424 --> 00:02:31.629
That's what I've been calling
her since the 10th grade.

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:32.965
Now it's like total reflex.

00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:34.434
- Wow, you guys have been
playing

00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:35.871
in Blast since the 10th grade?

00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.342
- No, we actually formed the
band the summer of my junior

00:02:38.442 --> 00:02:41.616
year but me and Nana knew each
other the year before that.

00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:42.918
- Really?

00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:45.790
Hey, what was Nana like in high
school?

00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:48.395
- Well she didn't talk
much, she never laughed

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:50.567
and she'd give people
all kinds of evil looks.

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:54.240
- What, she wasn't the most
popular girl in high school?

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.042
No way.

00:02:55.142 --> 00:02:56.612
- She was a total goth chick.

00:02:56.712 --> 00:03:00.052
But even so, she was really
pretty, so she stood out.

00:03:00.152 --> 00:03:01.923
But you could never tell
what she was thinking.

00:03:02.023 --> 00:03:05.764
So everyone was too scared
to get close to her.

00:03:05.864 --> 00:03:07.501
But when I look back on
it, it must have been

00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.241
kinda lonely for her, having
no friends to talk to.

00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:12.310
- Huh.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.949
- So I tried to impress
her with my big mouth

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.386
and stunning good looks
but she just ignored me.

00:03:17.486 --> 00:03:20.225
I felt so rejected.
(Nana K. giggles)

00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:23.165
- But you know me, I'm a total
music freak and I thought

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:25.269
if she won't talk to me,
I'll get her with music.

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.507
So I let her borrow some of my
CDs.

00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:31.314
Well I forced them on her,
like 10 or so of my favorites.

00:03:31.414 --> 00:03:35.122
I figured there's bound
to be one she'd like.

00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:38.228
Then one day, she finally
talked to me.

00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:41.001
(students chattering)

00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:43.171
- Terashima.
- Huh?

00:03:44.508 --> 00:03:46.177
- Thanks for letting
me listen to your CDs.

00:03:46.278 --> 00:03:48.616
If you get any new ones,
let me know.

00:03:48.716 --> 00:03:51.354
- She smiled.
- Osaki said something?

00:03:51.454 --> 00:03:51.589
- Sure.

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.991
Hey Nana, wait a minute.
- She can talk after all.

00:03:53.091 --> 00:03:55.362
- So what kind of music are you
into?

00:03:55.462 --> 00:03:57.901
I mean which CDs did you like?

00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:58.670
- Oh, what's it called?

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.840
The crazy one, the band
with the porn name?

00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.646
- The Sex Pistols?
- Yeah, that one.

00:04:03.746 --> 00:04:05.449
- You like punk rock too?

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.854
So do I.
- What a dork.

00:04:07.955 --> 00:04:09.525
- I was so happy.

00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:11.027
She was falling in love with me.

00:04:11.127 --> 00:04:15.537
- It sounds more like you
were totally in love with her.

00:04:15.637 --> 00:04:18.509
- Well, maybe a little bit.
- What the hell?

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:19.745
I hate you.

00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:20.580
(Nana K. weeps)

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.218
- But that was all a long
time ago and besides,

00:04:23.318 --> 00:04:26.224
once we became such close
friends, it was impossible

00:04:26.324 --> 00:04:28.863
for me to even think of
her like that anymore.

00:04:28.963 --> 00:04:30.667
I mean, I'm the one who
introduced her

00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:33.005
to Ren in the first place.

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:35.275
- You're the one who
introduced Ren to Nana?

00:04:35.376 --> 00:04:37.948
- Mm hmm, Nana was so
warped back then

00:04:38.048 --> 00:04:39.618
that she scared all
the guys off.

00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:43.626
I thought Ren might be the only
person she could relate to.

00:04:43.726 --> 00:04:45.029
In those days, I used to look up

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.101
to Ren as some sort of
invincible hero.

00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:51.876
(relaxed piano, electronic
music)

00:04:51.976 --> 00:04:53.045
- And your plan worked.

00:04:53.145 --> 00:04:55.382
- Yeah, but not the
way I expected.

00:04:55.482 --> 00:04:56.117
- What do you mean?

00:04:56.217 --> 00:04:58.923
- Little by little, I
began to realize that Ren

00:04:59.023 --> 00:05:01.796
wasn't as invincible as
I first thought he was.

00:05:01.896 --> 00:05:03.599
I think Nana ended up saving him

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.436
just as much as he saved her.

00:05:06.304 --> 00:05:08.843
(soft rustling)

00:05:08.943 --> 00:05:13.853
(relaxed electronic
ensemble music)

00:05:15.757 --> 00:05:18.395
You know when I was younger,
I used to think that guys

00:05:18.495 --> 00:05:21.167
had to be all strong and
stuff for their girlfriends.

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:23.706
So I tried to act real
tough in front of the girls.

00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:25.810
But now I see just how
stupid that was.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.217
- Why do you think that
was stupid?

00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:31.589
- So what do you think
of these wimpy guns?

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:32.858
Are they strong enough for you?

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.630
- Well yeah, of course they are.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.569
- Oh, ever since I fell
in love with you, Hachiko,

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.644
I've realized what a totally
un-macho girly guy I am.

00:05:42.744 --> 00:05:43.513
- What do you mean?

00:05:43.613 --> 00:05:44.147
You're the guy who promised

00:05:44.247 --> 00:05:46.017
he'd do anything to make me
happy.

00:05:46.117 --> 00:05:48.121
- And I will, as long

00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:52.296
as you're always by my
side to support me.

00:05:52.396 --> 00:05:56.204
I feel like I can do
anything with you by my side.

00:05:57.541 --> 00:05:58.543
- Deal.

00:06:00.446 --> 00:06:03.820
I get it, Nobu's like
a clinging child.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.155
This is new for me.

00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:07.627
I'm usually the one
who's like that.

00:06:08.428 --> 00:06:09.998
What's going on?

00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:13.205
My heart bleeds for him.

00:06:13.305 --> 00:06:15.543
(soft electronic, flute music)

00:06:15.643 --> 00:06:17.012
I want to be with him.

00:06:17.113 --> 00:06:19.283
I want to spoil him.

00:06:19.383 --> 00:06:22.289
I want to be there for
him, I want to hold him.

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.129
I want to do everything
he wants.

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:28.870
In the past, I only
thought about

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.742
having men do those
things for me.

00:06:31.842 --> 00:06:34.180
Maybe that was my big mistake.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.854
(birds chirping)

00:06:37.954 --> 00:06:39.423
- Good morning.

00:06:41.461 --> 00:06:44.233
- Nana, you're back here
again, what about Ren?

00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:46.237
- Ah, he's pretty busy
with work right now.

00:06:46.337 --> 00:06:47.908
So he's hardly ever home.

00:06:48.008 --> 00:06:50.045
You left Misato and you
weren't with Takumi,

00:06:50.145 --> 00:06:52.116
so who were you with?

00:06:53.084 --> 00:06:54.588
- Where is Misato?

00:06:54.688 --> 00:06:55.557
- She's still sleeping.

00:06:55.657 --> 00:06:57.994
- I've got to explain
everything to her.

00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:00.365
But how am I gonna make
her understand?

00:07:00.466 --> 00:07:03.506
I hooked up with Nobu right
after I broke up with Takumi.

00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:06.010
Actually things kinda
overlapped.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.448
I have to think this over.

00:07:08.549 --> 00:07:09.283
I'm working today,

00:07:09.383 --> 00:07:11.589
so I better get changed
and get outta here.

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:12.323
- Oh by the way,

00:07:12.423 --> 00:07:16.030
did you find the record store
where Nobu works yesterday?

00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:16.899
- Oh yeah, thanks.

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:18.936
Sorry, I gotta get outta
here quick.

00:07:19.036 --> 00:07:21.241
- You two seem to get
along pretty well.

00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:22.343
- Huh?

00:07:23.178 --> 00:07:23.980
- Ever since I've known him,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.017
he's always been an
honest and sincere guy.

00:07:26.117 --> 00:07:29.190
You both share similar
values like that.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.392
Of course most of the time,

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:33.231
you're like two little
dogs whining for attention,

00:07:33.331 --> 00:07:35.235
which can get kind of annoying.

00:07:35.335 --> 00:07:38.175
- [Nana K.] Nana totally
understands.

00:07:38.275 --> 00:07:42.082
- It must have been kinda lonely
for her having no friends.

00:07:42.183 --> 00:07:45.957
- Because Nana knows just
how nice Nobu can be.

00:07:46.057 --> 00:07:47.694
Even more than I do.

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:50.199
Nana.
- Hmm?

00:07:50.299 --> 00:07:51.167
(soft piano music)

00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:53.205
You know, me and Nobu...

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:59.183
(Nana K. sobs softly)

00:07:59.283 --> 00:08:02.724
I think I'm head over
heels in love with Nobu.

00:08:04.093 --> 00:08:08.201
(soft piano, violin music)

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:12.076
- Of course you are.

00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:16.184
- [Nana K.] She didn't
say anything after that.

00:08:16.284 --> 00:08:17.721
I didn't say anything else
either

00:08:17.821 --> 00:08:21.529
'cause that would seem
like I was making excuses.

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:24.233
I don't have to explain
anything really.

00:08:24.333 --> 00:08:26.605
All I have to do is
treasure Nobu

00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:29.945
and Nana will always be
watching over us.

00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:33.218
(upbeat violin, piano music)

00:08:33.318 --> 00:08:35.022
Hey look, Kyosuke did this.

00:08:35.122 --> 00:08:36.759
- [Nobuo] Wow, it's amazing.

00:08:36.859 --> 00:08:38.428
Mr. Kyosuke is really talented.

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:41.000
- Don't call him mister,
he's the same age as you.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:41.535
- He seems older to me

00:08:41.635 --> 00:08:43.573
'cause he acts kinda like
a father to you.

00:08:43.673 --> 00:08:45.275
Oh, do you think I
should put on a suit

00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:47.313
and ask him for your hand?

00:08:47.413 --> 00:08:49.952
- Let's just call him
an older brother, okay?

00:08:50.052 --> 00:08:52.323
Look over there, it's
Jun's painting.

00:08:52.423 --> 00:08:55.195
- [Nobuo] That's incredible
in more ways than one.

00:08:55.295 --> 00:08:56.264
(Nana K. laughs)

00:08:56.364 --> 00:08:58.101
- But I don't really
get what it means, Jun.

00:08:58.201 --> 00:08:59.504
- Can you explain it to us?

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:03.378
- I believe I'm the one who
needs an explanation here.

00:09:07.353 --> 00:09:08.689
- [Kyosuke] Huh, Nana and Nobu?

00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:11.895
- Yeah, all lovey-dovey, it
was so gross.

00:09:11.996 --> 00:09:12.831
- What the hell?

00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:15.002
Last I heard, she was into Yasu.

00:09:15.102 --> 00:09:18.008
- Well, I guess that
fling didn't work out.

00:09:18.108 --> 00:09:20.479
- Fine but why didn't
she tell us that before?

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.517
I wonder why she'd
hide it from us?

00:09:22.617 --> 00:09:25.389
- Oh, I think she was
actually hiding some other guy

00:09:25.489 --> 00:09:28.228
and I bet he broke her heart
into pieces.

00:09:28.328 --> 00:09:30.499
At any rate, she was really
depressed about her ex

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.506
and whoever else and Nobu
was just nice to her then,

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:35.877
so she probably just went along
with it.

00:09:35.977 --> 00:09:37.479
- [Kyosuke] Yeah, but
it seemed like

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.252
she'd gotten over her
ex pretty fast.

00:09:40.352 --> 00:09:41.622
- Well, that's true

00:09:41.722 --> 00:09:43.893
but I don't think her ex
had much to offer her.

00:09:43.993 --> 00:09:45.162
I mean just take a look around.

00:09:45.262 --> 00:09:46.966
- There are plenty of fish
in the sea

00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:47.934
that are better than her ex.

00:09:48.034 --> 00:09:51.976
- Hey mister ex, here's the
Jackson burger you ordered.

00:09:52.076 --> 00:09:53.813
- Shut up with all the "ex"
crap.

00:09:53.913 --> 00:09:56.017
- Oh, I didn't see
you there, sorry.

00:09:56.117 --> 00:09:57.554
- You called me to
meet you here.

00:09:57.654 --> 00:10:00.158
- You're always here
whether we call you or not.

00:10:00.258 --> 00:10:02.363
- Even though you moved
to a place farther away.

00:10:02.463 --> 00:10:04.033
- [Koichisato] What, when did
that happen?

00:10:04.133 --> 00:10:06.337
I thought you had to stay
put 'cause you're broke.

00:10:06.437 --> 00:10:08.141
- He was able to get out of
his lease.

00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:10.780
That way he could shack
up with Sachiko.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.552
- He made us help him move
even though we were busy.

00:10:13.653 --> 00:10:15.422
It was such a drag.
- Whatever.

00:10:15.523 --> 00:10:18.161
I didn't even ask, you just
barged in to spy on me.

00:10:18.261 --> 00:10:20.365
- Sachiko's place is
one station away, right?

00:10:20.465 --> 00:10:22.904
- Yeah, but I'll keep
coming here.

00:10:23.004 --> 00:10:24.173
So don't you worry, Koichisato.

00:10:24.273 --> 00:10:25.877
- You don't have to come.
- Why not?

00:10:25.977 --> 00:10:28.415
- After you broke up,
Nana stopped coming around

00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:31.755
for her Jackson burger fix
'cause you're here all the time.

00:10:31.855 --> 00:10:32.122
- Sorry.

00:10:32.222 --> 00:10:34.628
- But she doesn't have to
worry about mister ex anymore

00:10:34.728 --> 00:10:37.466
now that she's all lovey-dovey
with her new boyfriend.

00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:39.838
Why don't you tell him
to drop by sometime?

00:10:39.938 --> 00:10:41.842
I want to see this guy.

00:10:41.942 --> 00:10:42.711
- What, Nobu's never been here?

00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:44.981
But I thought he lived
in this neighborhood.

00:10:45.082 --> 00:10:46.117
- With his band and work,

00:10:46.217 --> 00:10:47.987
he probably doesn't
have time to come here.

00:10:48.088 --> 00:10:50.192
The guru hasn't dropped
by either.

00:10:50.292 --> 00:10:52.262
- What guru?
- Nana's roommate.

00:10:52.363 --> 00:10:53.131
- Oh, right.

00:10:53.231 --> 00:10:54.500
- Is her new boyfriend cool?

00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:56.638
- Eh, he's all right but once
you put a guitar in his hands,

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:59.343
he actually turns into a
pretty cool guy, it's weird.

00:10:59.443 --> 00:11:01.582
- Totally, he's usually
just part of the scenery,

00:11:01.682 --> 00:11:04.387
a bit like ex here.
- No kidding.

00:11:04.487 --> 00:11:06.692
Don't you think Nobu is
a lot like our mister ex?

00:11:06.792 --> 00:11:08.896
- Right, like the stupid
way they both talk.

00:11:08.996 --> 00:11:09.765
- You think so?

00:11:09.865 --> 00:11:10.365
I always thought her new

00:11:10.465 --> 00:11:12.469
boyfriend was a bit on
the pretentious side.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.806
- What, when did you meet him?

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:16.812
- Well I haven't but from
what Nana told me awhile back,

00:11:16.912 --> 00:11:18.749
his parents own a big hotel
and he just

00:11:18.849 --> 00:11:21.622
threw that away to be
in a band in Tokyo.

00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:25.863
I guess that's enough to get
Nana's attention but come on.

00:11:25.963 --> 00:11:29.938
I heard that he said something
to the guru like "I'll be

00:11:30.038 --> 00:11:34.447
happy as long as I'm playing
my guitar and you're singing."

00:11:34.548 --> 00:11:35.482
- Huh?

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:37.486
- I mean, who says things like
that?

00:11:37.587 --> 00:11:38.989
- You wouldn't and that's
why you suck.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.158
- But it's so cheesy.

00:11:40.258 --> 00:11:41.494
- You suck because you can't
allow

00:11:41.595 --> 00:11:43.799
yourself to say cheesy,
romantic things.

00:11:43.899 --> 00:11:44.333
- You make things worse

00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:47.072
by trying to play it cool
all the time.

00:11:47.172 --> 00:11:48.576
- Wait, now I get it.

00:11:48.676 --> 00:11:51.915
I'm beginning to see what it
is that attracts Nana to Nobu.

00:11:52.015 --> 00:11:54.654
He knows what to say and
do to please her.

00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:57.192
- He plays the good friend
who the girl can confide in

00:11:57.292 --> 00:12:00.065
and then when the time's right,
he drops the Romeo lines.

00:12:00.165 --> 00:12:02.537
It's a subtle art that he
seems to have mastered.

00:12:02.637 --> 00:12:05.041
I'd say he's the right
guy for our Nana.

00:12:05.142 --> 00:12:07.412
- This may turn out
good for her.

00:12:07.514 --> 00:12:09.718
(tepid guitar music)

00:12:09.818 --> 00:12:12.389
What do you think, Shoji?
- What do I think?

00:12:12.489 --> 00:12:13.659
I'm fine with it.

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:16.932
All I want is for Nana
to be truly happy.

00:12:17.032 --> 00:12:17.734
- Feeling jealous?

00:12:17.834 --> 00:12:19.470
- [Shoji] Koichisato,
another Jackson

00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:21.742
burger for my
girlfriend Sachiko.

00:12:21.842 --> 00:12:23.746
- Welcome home, Shoji.
- Present for you.

00:12:23.846 --> 00:12:26.150
- Oh, you were at
Jackson's again?

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:26.785
Thank you.

00:12:26.885 --> 00:12:28.689
- Sorry it's not
some designer bag.

00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:30.960
I suck, I already know that.
- Hmm?

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.536
Actually if I had the choice,
I'd prefer a Jackson burger.

00:12:35.636 --> 00:12:37.607
- [Junko] You think we
were too mean to him?

00:12:37.707 --> 00:12:40.212
- Eh whatever, we had
to put him in his place.

00:12:40.312 --> 00:12:41.447
- We succeeded in that.

00:12:41.548 --> 00:12:42.784
- Shoji is never going to admit

00:12:42.884 --> 00:12:45.422
to being jealous under
any circumstances

00:12:45.523 --> 00:12:47.527
but you and I know that
he really is.

00:12:47.627 --> 00:12:49.463
- Men are so selfish.

00:12:49.564 --> 00:12:50.933
Well, it'd probably piss me off

00:12:51.033 --> 00:12:53.304
if he wasn't a little bit
jealous.

00:12:53.404 --> 00:12:57.079
- You know, Shoji was
into Nana in a big way.

00:12:57.179 --> 00:12:59.818
He just loved Sachiko more.

00:12:59.918 --> 00:13:01.555
- [Junko] But don't you think
the reason

00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:05.395
for that is because Sachiko
loved him more than Nana did?

00:13:05.495 --> 00:13:07.099
- You really think so?

00:13:07.199 --> 00:13:07.767
It seemed to me that Nana

00:13:07.867 --> 00:13:09.838
couldn't possibly live
without Shoji.

00:13:09.938 --> 00:13:13.011
- Well, it's impossible for us
to measure who loved who more

00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:17.019
but I'm betting Shoji felt more
loved by Sachiko than Nana.

00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:19.456
Maybe it's the way they
express their feelings.

00:13:19.558 --> 00:13:22.362
Nana is so one-way, it
can be hard to deal with.

00:13:22.462 --> 00:13:24.300
- Yeah, when they were
going out,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.370
Shoji would always come
over to our place

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.210
just so he could get drunk
and complain about Nana.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.380
- "Nana doesn't love me
for who I am.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.886
She just loves me 'cause
I'm in love with her."

00:13:33.986 --> 00:13:37.594
Of course, he was right
but I could never tell him.

00:13:37.694 --> 00:13:40.031
- Well maybe that wasn't
really how Nana felt

00:13:40.131 --> 00:13:43.338
but I can totally see
why he would think that.

00:13:43.438 --> 00:13:44.741
- When she found out
he was cheating on her,

00:13:44.841 --> 00:13:46.845
she immediately said she didn't
want him.

00:13:46.945 --> 00:13:49.551
That had to have been a big blow
to him.

00:13:49.651 --> 00:13:50.720
It confirmed his fears.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.757
"I was right all along,"
he must have thought.

00:13:52.857 --> 00:13:54.059
- But Nana only said that

00:13:54.159 --> 00:13:56.965
because she can't deal with
the painful stuff very well.

00:13:57.065 --> 00:13:59.470
When she gets hurt, she
just runs away from it.

00:13:59.571 --> 00:14:01.040
- Yeah, always.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.777
She runs away, shuts the door

00:14:02.877 --> 00:14:05.048
and just won't deal with the
other person.

00:14:05.148 --> 00:14:06.585
- Have you ever noticed
that when she talks

00:14:06.685 --> 00:14:08.421
to other people, sometimes it
seems like

00:14:08.522 --> 00:14:10.225
she's having a conversation with
herself?

00:14:10.325 --> 00:14:11.193
- Yeah (chuckles).

00:14:11.294 --> 00:14:12.597
- But lately she doesn't seem

00:14:12.697 --> 00:14:14.601
to come crying to you
as much as she used to.

00:14:14.701 --> 00:14:16.538
Maybe it means she's finally
able

00:14:16.638 --> 00:14:18.408
to deal with the guy she's with.

00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:19.276
- Let's hope so.

00:14:19.376 --> 00:14:22.015
If Nobu cheats on her, I
hope she'll be passionate

00:14:22.115 --> 00:14:25.388
enough to kick and scream
at him to get him back.

00:14:25.488 --> 00:14:27.560
- So tell me, if I cheated on
you,

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.598
would you kick and scream to get
me back?

00:14:29.698 --> 00:14:32.069
- No way, I'd beat you to death.

00:14:32.169 --> 00:14:35.075
- Well, I'm glad to hear that.
- You are?

00:14:35.175 --> 00:14:36.210
- [Kyosuke] It's all about

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.782
how we express our feelings,
right?

00:14:38.882 --> 00:14:42.222
(phone ringing)

00:14:42.322 --> 00:14:43.258
- [Operator] The number you have
reached

00:14:43.358 --> 00:14:45.630
does not accept unidentified
calls.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.636
Please activate your
caller ID and try again.

00:14:48.736 --> 00:14:51.808
- Why would someone suddenly
start screening their calls?

00:14:51.908 --> 00:14:54.079
- Maybe 'cause they hate you.

00:14:55.215 --> 00:14:57.954
Ren, turn the page.

00:14:58.054 --> 00:14:59.189
- Welcome home, Ren.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:00.158
Guess what?

00:15:00.258 --> 00:15:02.095
Nobuo and Hachiko are an item.

00:15:02.195 --> 00:15:03.331
- Now she has two guys?

00:15:03.431 --> 00:15:04.567
Way to go, Hachiko.

00:15:04.668 --> 00:15:05.569
- What are you saying?

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.707
There's no way she could
handle two guys at once.

00:15:07.807 --> 00:15:09.511
She broke up with Takumi, dude.

00:15:09.611 --> 00:15:10.513
- Whoa, really?

00:15:10.613 --> 00:15:12.984
Well, that scumbag
deserves it anyway.

00:15:13.084 --> 00:15:15.088
All he thinks about is
getting laid.

00:15:15.188 --> 00:15:16.257
- Look who's talking.

00:15:16.357 --> 00:15:17.660
- Just turn your caller ID on.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.998
- Then she'll just know
who she's ignoring.

00:15:20.098 --> 00:15:20.833
- Oh, you're right.

00:15:20.933 --> 00:15:21.535
- Hachiko?

00:15:21.635 --> 00:15:22.937
I thought you two broke up.

00:15:23.037 --> 00:15:27.179
- Nope, she just screamed
at me over the phone.

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:28.615
Where the hell is the crew?

00:15:28.716 --> 00:15:30.485
What do they take us for?

00:15:30.586 --> 00:15:31.087
(glass shatters)

00:15:31.187 --> 00:15:33.826
- [Band Member] Takumi,
they've still got 10 minutes.

00:15:36.197 --> 00:15:38.001
(door rings)

00:15:38.101 --> 00:15:39.136
- Huh?

00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:41.508
- Stop reading that porn.

00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:43.612
- It was just one page,
you know how manga is.

00:15:43.712 --> 00:15:45.516
- Sachiko doesn't satisfy you?

00:15:45.616 --> 00:15:48.221
- Au contraire, ma petite amie.

00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:49.390
- What, she's that good?

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.025
- When I'm talking to you,

00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:52.530
it feels like I'm
talking to a guy.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.400
- I've gotta hand it to you
Nobuo,

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.170
you finally won Hachiko over.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.974
- It's all thanks to you.

00:15:58.074 --> 00:15:58.542
- Huh?

00:15:58.642 --> 00:16:00.579
- I've always known you were on
my side,

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.882
secretly rooting for me.

00:16:01.982 --> 00:16:05.188
You've got my back 'cause
we're tight like that.

00:16:05.288 --> 00:16:08.796
- You're wrong, it was
never about you, dude.

00:16:08.896 --> 00:16:10.866
- Of course, you did it for
Hachi.

00:16:10.966 --> 00:16:12.336
You thought that of all people,

00:16:12.436 --> 00:16:13.739
I'm the one who could make her
happy.

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:16.945
Well, she will be.
- It's not like that.

00:16:17.045 --> 00:16:20.886
I hate to tell you this
but I just used you.

00:16:20.986 --> 00:16:23.057
- As revenge against Takumi?
- Nope.

00:16:23.157 --> 00:16:25.730
- Then what?
(sharp metallic tones)

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.537
- So that Hachiko could run
unleashed in my own backyard.

00:16:29.637 --> 00:16:32.877
(anxious piano music)

00:16:32.977 --> 00:16:36.518
Just make sure she doesn't
go running away ever again.

00:16:39.524 --> 00:16:40.726
- Nobu!

00:16:41.494 --> 00:16:42.764
Hey, Nana.

00:16:46.538 --> 00:16:49.677
(Nana K. laughs)

00:16:54.788 --> 00:16:57.159
- I guess some people never
really change.

00:16:57.259 --> 00:17:00.031
She's still just as
warped as she was before.

00:17:00.131 --> 00:17:01.635
I thought getting her together
with Ren

00:17:01.735 --> 00:17:03.304
would make her a bit more
normal.

00:17:03.404 --> 00:17:06.745
- Nana is one of those
extremely possessive females.

00:17:06.845 --> 00:17:09.249
I mean she put a padlock
around Ren's neck.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.185
What's that all about?

00:17:10.285 --> 00:17:11.855
- That's just 'cause
she's into Sid Vicious.

00:17:11.955 --> 00:17:14.661
I'm sure it's nothing more
than a fashion statement.

00:17:14.761 --> 00:17:16.397
- I think there's more to it.

00:17:16.497 --> 00:17:18.434
I mean she also got a Ren flower

00:17:18.535 --> 00:17:19.971
tattooed on the side of her arm.

00:17:20.071 --> 00:17:21.641
No matter how much she loves
him,

00:17:21.742 --> 00:17:24.647
isn't that going a little bit
too far?

00:17:24.748 --> 00:17:26.217
But he seems to be into it

00:17:26.317 --> 00:17:28.555
and even after being apart for
two years,

00:17:28.655 --> 00:17:30.158
Ren was still obsessed with
Nana.

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:33.766
Sounds like he's pretty crazy
himself and Hachi's always

00:17:33.866 --> 00:17:36.170
talking about them like
they're the ideal couple.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.709
Maybe I'm wrong to think
they're so messed up.

00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:42.617
- Finding true love, I
love stories like that.

00:17:44.052 --> 00:17:46.725
(phone rings)

00:17:46.825 --> 00:17:49.798
Damn, it's Kako, she is such a
sadist.

00:17:49.898 --> 00:17:51.400
- What, she's a sadist?

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.804
- I won't be crashing here
tonight.

00:17:52.904 --> 00:17:54.674
So you should tell Hachi to come
over.

00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:56.745
I'm stoked that you guys are
together.

00:17:56.845 --> 00:17:58.414
You're good for each other.

00:17:58.515 --> 00:17:59.884
- Shin, tell me the truth.

00:17:59.984 --> 00:18:00.853
Are you happy for us 'cause

00:18:00.953 --> 00:18:02.255
you want to keep her as your
pet?

00:18:02.355 --> 00:18:06.130
You wanted me to go chase
after her as if she was a dog.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.497
(Shinichi chuckles)

00:18:06.598 --> 00:18:10.573
- No way, I just wanted you
to answer your own question.

00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:11.240
- What question?

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.979
- "If a man and a woman
are just objects of desire

00:18:14.079 --> 00:18:17.987
to each other, can they
ever be connected by love?"

00:18:18.087 --> 00:18:19.223
You two connected, right?

00:18:19.323 --> 00:18:22.095
I mean I know you've already
had sex and that's cool.

00:18:22.195 --> 00:18:27.439
It's only natural but are
you connected by love?

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.046
- You're just gonna have to
try it for yourself, dude.

00:18:34.186 --> 00:18:35.656
- Not possible.

00:18:37.292 --> 00:18:39.196
- This is just a temporary
contract.

00:18:39.296 --> 00:18:40.799
When the album's
release date is set,

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.803
we'll draw up an
official contract.

00:18:42.904 --> 00:18:43.839
I'm working around the clock

00:18:43.939 --> 00:18:46.477
to make this happen
as soon as possible.

00:18:46.578 --> 00:18:48.347
But there are many
people involved

00:18:48.447 --> 00:18:50.619
and unfortunately I
don't always get my way.

00:18:50.719 --> 00:18:52.723
- I don't have time
for the details.

00:18:52.823 --> 00:18:53.759
You only need my signature

00:18:53.859 --> 00:18:56.631
and seal on this temporary
contract, correct?

00:18:56.731 --> 00:18:59.236
- Yes, that is all we need.

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.543
- I need you to know
I have concerns

00:19:02.643 --> 00:19:04.346
regarding the
entertainment business.

00:19:04.446 --> 00:19:06.818
- Of course you do,
I have kids as well.

00:19:06.918 --> 00:19:08.321
So I understand
that as a parent,

00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:10.391
you're always worried
about your son's-

00:19:10.491 --> 00:19:11.595
- That is not what I meant.

00:19:11.695 --> 00:19:13.632
Only in show
business is the media

00:19:13.732 --> 00:19:16.036
allowed to dig into
people's personal lives.

00:19:16.136 --> 00:19:17.807
I do not want that
kind of trouble

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:20.779
for me or for my other son.

00:19:23.084 --> 00:19:25.288
- Well, we thought
it would be best

00:19:25.388 --> 00:19:27.894
to keep all the band
member's profiles secret,

00:19:27.994 --> 00:19:29.196
even within the industry.

00:19:29.296 --> 00:19:32.168
We'd be sure to disclose
your son's age as 18.

00:19:32.269 --> 00:19:32.870
That would be enough to-

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.106
- You can do whatever you want

00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:36.678
as long as you keep his
true identity a secret.

00:19:36.778 --> 00:19:37.680
I don't want our family's

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.851
dirty laundry exposed
to the world.

00:19:39.951 --> 00:19:41.555
When you draw up the
official contract,

00:19:41.655 --> 00:19:43.525
send it to me in the mail.

00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:44.226
I don't want to waste any more

00:19:44.326 --> 00:19:47.165
of my time with this kind
of nonsense.

00:19:48.602 --> 00:19:51.407
Now if you'll excuse me.
- Mr. Okazaki,

00:19:51.508 --> 00:19:53.812
even though he's not your
flesh and blood,

00:19:53.912 --> 00:19:56.417
you did raise this
kid for 15 years.

00:19:56.518 --> 00:20:00.759
Are you telling me you
don't feel anything for him?

00:20:00.859 --> 00:20:02.028
- [Mr. Okazaki] Unfortunately
I couldn't bring

00:20:02.128 --> 00:20:05.970
myself to feel any love for
Shinichi, not even once.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.974
(somber violin music)

00:20:08.074 --> 00:20:10.445
Though I tried my best.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.390
(alternative rock music)

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.639
- Hey Miss Hachiko, we're
almost out of paint.

00:20:23.739 --> 00:20:25.441
Is it okay if I open a new one?

00:20:25.542 --> 00:20:25.976
- Sure.

00:20:26.076 --> 00:20:29.082
I hope you don't mind helping
me paint my room, Misato.

00:20:29.182 --> 00:20:31.521
- No, this is a lot of fun.

00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:34.627
Painting the walls white makes
this old room seem brighter.

00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:36.531
It's really nice.

00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:39.136
(relaxed electronic music)

00:20:39.236 --> 00:20:42.543
- [Nana K.] All I want to
do is seal off my memories

00:20:42.643 --> 00:20:46.518
but why do I feel like a
criminal destroying evidence?

00:20:47.385 --> 00:20:49.423
Am I still the same?

00:20:49.524 --> 00:20:52.830
Am I just making another
one of my mistakes?

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:03.150
Hey Nana, the mistakes I
made, the scars I have,

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.025
they won't simply disappear
even if I cover them up.

00:21:07.125 --> 00:21:09.897
So I'm still calling your name,

00:21:09.998 --> 00:21:14.272
no matter how much it
hurts, until you answer me.
