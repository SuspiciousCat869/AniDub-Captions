WEBVTT

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.576
(techno music)

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:28.533
- Nana, I can't believe
you actually came here.

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:36.015
- DJ Matsushita is so
awesome, so cool, and so hot.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.421
- If you like him, then
why don't you tell him?

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.960
If you're lucky, maybe he'll
even agree to go out with you.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.262
- Are you kidding?

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:45.166
You see how popular he is with
the women?

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.838
Rumor has it that he's with a
different woman every night.

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:50.878
He's an enemy to women
everywhere. What a jerk.

00:00:50.978 --> 00:00:52.681
- Then don't fall in love with
him.

00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:55.019
- Hey, I've heard that advice
before.

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:56.956
You know, you sound a
lot like Junko sometimes,

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.492
maybe I should start calling you
Shojun.

00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:01.432
- No one could help giving
a girl like you advice.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.033
- It's interesting,

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.271
but ever since Jun started
going out with Kyosuke

00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:06.475
she doesn't talk to me
the same way anymore.

00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:07.477
She's toned down a bit.

00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:10.984
Guess that's what love can
do, (giggles) but that's okay.

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:13.590
I've got you as my friend now,
Shoji.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.563
- [Shoji] I guess I'm just
a replacement for Junko.

00:01:16.663 --> 00:01:18.767
- So, Shojun, why did you come
and get me?

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:20.838
- I wish you wouldn't call me
that.

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:23.142
I was out having a drink
with Kyosuke and Junko

00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:25.213
and I thought you might wanna
join us.

00:01:25.313 --> 00:01:26.281
I didn't want you to think

00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:28.152
we were leaving you out
on purpose.

00:01:28.252 --> 00:01:31.091
- Yay, let's go!
I'd love a drink.

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.663
- You know what? We always
seem to end up drinking.

00:01:33.764 --> 00:01:36.168
Sometime we should do
something completely different.

00:01:36.268 --> 00:01:37.470
Like go to the beach.

00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:39.307
- The beach?

00:01:39.407 --> 00:01:40.511
- Summer vacation's nearly here.

00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:43.115
Why don't the four of us
take a somewhere?

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:44.619
- [Both] The beach!

00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:48.760
(waves crashing)

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.599
(rock music)

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.695
- Ah, being at the beach is
awesome.

00:03:29.795 --> 00:03:31.331
Reminds me of being a kid.

00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:33.102
I'm bored of seeing
mountains all the time.

00:03:33.202 --> 00:03:34.939
- (giggles) I know what you
mean.

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.576
It's nice to have a change.

00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:39.782
- (yawns) I think I
need to go to bed soon.

00:03:39.882 --> 00:03:41.385
- Oh, really, Jun?

00:03:41.485 --> 00:03:43.657
We'll get going and
see you in the morning.

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:44.525
- What are you talking about?

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:46.094
I thought you were gonna be
sleeping

00:03:46.194 --> 00:03:47.297
in this room with Junko.

00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:48.967
- I've given my bed to Kyosuke.

00:03:49.067 --> 00:03:50.704
I'm sleeping in your
room with you.

00:03:50.804 --> 00:03:53.208
- What! What do you mean
sleep in my room?

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.213
- You really don't get
it, do you?

00:03:55.313 --> 00:03:58.219
- What?
- Hurry up. Let's go.

00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.458
- Well, that was pretty easy.

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.097
I guess there was no
reason to worry about them.

00:04:04.197 --> 00:04:06.703
- I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

00:04:06.803 --> 00:04:08.005
- [Nana] Ah!

00:04:08.105 --> 00:04:10.276
- Okay, you've got some
explaining to do.

00:04:10.376 --> 00:04:12.046
- Everything's gonna be fine.

00:04:12.146 --> 00:04:14.050
You sleep in one bed and
I'll sleep in the other.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.186
I'm not gonna jump you.

00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:17.090
If you like, I can sing you a
lullaby,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.359
just like your grandma does.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.662
- I don't need you to sing!

00:04:19.762 --> 00:04:21.866
You might be fine with this,
but I'm not.

00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:23.670
What if I jump on you?

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.273
- But why would you?

00:04:25.373 --> 00:04:26.643
- Yeah, what do you mean why?

00:04:26.743 --> 00:04:29.180
- [Nana] We're just friends,
right?

00:04:29.281 --> 00:04:32.253
- (sighs) Hey, Nana, you
really haven't caught a clue

00:04:32.353 --> 00:04:34.759
about men and how they operate,
have you?

00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:35.661
A guy can sleep with a girl

00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:38.566
without having any
feelings for her.

00:04:40.938 --> 00:04:43.275
(melancholy music)

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:46.950
- I know that. Only too well.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.419
- Oh.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.922
- [Nana] But I thought you were
different

00:04:50.022 --> 00:04:52.026
from other guys, Shoji.

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:54.230
Jun told me you weren't like
that.

00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:55.801
- I don't know what Junko told
you,

00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:58.472
but I'm a guy and that's
the way that I am.

00:04:58.573 --> 00:05:00.009
Oh, man. What are you crying
for?

00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:01.512
- Because I really like you,
Shoji

00:05:01.613 --> 00:05:04.852
and I don't want you to be
like all those other guys.

00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:08.560
- When you say that you like me,
Nana,

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.166
do you mean like me like me,
or just like me as a friend?

00:05:12.266 --> 00:05:12.901
- As a friend, of course.

00:05:13.002 --> 00:05:16.008
You're the best guy friend
I've ever had in my life.

00:05:16.108 --> 00:05:20.416
I don't see you as just a male.
I see you as a human being.

00:05:20.517 --> 00:05:22.755
But even though he's a human
being, he's still a male.

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:26.128
So maybe it's not a good idea
to sleep in the same room.

00:05:26.228 --> 00:05:28.399
I should never have suggested
it.

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:31.004
It's hard for a guy and a
girl to be just friends.

00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:32.775
Isn't it, Shojun?

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.210
(sighs)

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.781
But we can give it a shot.

00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:38.452
Well, I suppose I should
be getting back to my room.

00:05:38.553 --> 00:05:40.957
- Wait, Nana, that's not a good
idea!

00:05:41.058 --> 00:05:43.228
They're probably, you know...

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:46.335
- Oh, right. What do I do?

00:05:46.435 --> 00:05:48.840
How long do you think
they're gonna be going at it?

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.278
- Don't ask me. I got no idea.

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:54.919
- What are we gonna do?

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:56.254
- Hmm.

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:57.825
All right, listen to me.

00:05:57.925 --> 00:06:00.029
You're gonna sleep there.

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:02.133
And I'll sleep over here in this
bed.

00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:04.104
- No, we can't do that.
It's too dangerous.

00:06:04.204 --> 00:06:05.373
- There's no need to worry.

00:06:05.473 --> 00:06:07.143
- Why not?
- You just said a minute ago

00:06:07.243 --> 00:06:09.715
you don't want me to be like
all the other guys, right?

00:06:09.815 --> 00:06:12.420
So it's obvious I need
to earn your trust again

00:06:12.521 --> 00:06:14.290
for the sake of our friendship.

00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:15.660
Goodnight.

00:06:17.998 --> 00:06:19.367
- [Nana] Shoji.

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:21.572
I love you.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:26.314
♪ Sleep now, little baby ♪

00:06:26.415 --> 00:06:30.056
♪ Sleep, my child ♪
- You don't have to sing.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:31.926
(Shojun laughs)

00:06:32.026 --> 00:06:33.563
I don't see what's so funny.

00:06:33.663 --> 00:06:35.266
I didn't sleep at all last
night.

00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:37.671
- So, Shojun was a good boy?

00:06:37.771 --> 00:06:39.742
- I wish you wouldn't call me
that.

00:06:39.842 --> 00:06:42.781
- Promise me you'll always
take good care of Nana, okay?

00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:43.415
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:43.516 --> 00:06:46.756
But the two of us are
just friends, you know?

00:06:46.856 --> 00:06:47.691
- Now I can go to Tokyo

00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:50.496
knowing there's someone to look
after her.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.839
- Jun!

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:58.847
Aren't you coming in? I
want you to swim with me.

00:06:58.947 --> 00:07:01.853
- [Junko] (sighs) Okay. Okay!

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:05.894
- [Kyosuke] Don't lie in the sun
too long

00:07:05.994 --> 00:07:07.831
or you're gonna regret it later.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.240
- Kyosuke, is Junko really going
to Tokyo?

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.877
- Yeah, you heard about that.

00:07:13.977 --> 00:07:14.578
- What's she going for?

00:07:14.678 --> 00:07:16.448
Is it just a trip or is it long
term?

00:07:16.549 --> 00:07:18.953
- She's applying for art
school there next year.

00:07:19.053 --> 00:07:21.224
If she doesn't get in,
she'll go to a prep school.

00:07:21.324 --> 00:07:23.395
- Junko will get into
art school, no problem.

00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:25.600
But what about you?
Aren't you gonna miss her?

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.470
You seem pretty cool about it.

00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:31.813
- Yeah, I'm cool with it,
'cause I'm going with her.

00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:35.286
(Nana giggles)

00:07:35.386 --> 00:07:39.528
- (wailing) No, no, no, no, no!

00:07:39.628 --> 00:07:41.599
I don't want you to go, Jun!

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:44.337
- What about me? Aren't
you gonna try and stop me?

00:07:44.437 --> 00:07:46.141
- Right, if you decide not to
go,

00:07:46.241 --> 00:07:48.011
then maybe she won't go either.

00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:49.347
Please don't go, Kyosuke!

00:07:49.447 --> 00:07:50.984
Please don't go!
- That's enough, Nana.

00:07:51.084 --> 00:07:54.124
Whether Kyosuke there or not
isn't gonna change a thing.

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:55.627
I'm serious about studying art

00:07:55.727 --> 00:07:57.531
and that's why I'm going
to school in Tokyo.

00:07:57.631 --> 00:08:01.572
It's my life. I don't need
you telling me what to do.

00:08:01.672 --> 00:08:05.446
- (sobs) Sorry, I didn't mean
to.

00:08:05.947 --> 00:08:07.350
(Junko sighs)

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:12.260
She's right, of course.
Everything she says is right.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.732
I'll so lonely without her.

00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:21.077
I'll feel even worse than
did on that snowy night.

00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:33.035
- Hmm.

00:08:35.941 --> 00:08:38.847
You know, Nana, I think I want
to try

00:08:38.947 --> 00:08:41.619
and get into an art school in
Tokyo too.

00:08:44.792 --> 00:08:46.762
Why don't you do the same?

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.206
- No way, this is awesome.

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:55.312
I never knew there were so many
art schools to choose from.

00:08:55.412 --> 00:08:57.283
I mean, there's gotta be
one that'll accept me.

00:08:57.383 --> 00:08:59.955
- Yeah, so why not apply to all
of them?

00:09:00.055 --> 00:09:02.528
- Even if I don't get into
one of the university programs

00:09:02.628 --> 00:09:04.532
I can always try another
technical college.

00:09:04.632 --> 00:09:05.600
- Why would you want to do that?

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.205
If you can't go to
university, what's the point?

00:09:08.305 --> 00:09:09.675
- This is my life we're talking
about

00:09:09.775 --> 00:09:12.013
and I don't need you
telling me what to do.

00:09:12.113 --> 00:09:13.081
Ow!

00:09:13.181 --> 00:09:15.386
(Kyosuke and Shoji groan)

00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:16.556
Why'd you do that?

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:19.160
All I wanna do is go
to Tokyo with you guys.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.229
- You can do what you want.

00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:21.899
It doesn't make any difference
to me

00:09:21.999 --> 00:09:23.101
how your life turns out.

00:09:23.201 --> 00:09:24.304
- (gasps) Oh, Jun!

00:09:24.404 --> 00:09:26.007
- [Junko] Why are you
so happy about the fact

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.312
that I don't give a damn?

00:09:28.412 --> 00:09:29.648
- [Nana] I have to work really
hard.

00:09:29.748 --> 00:09:32.854
No more staying out late.
Farewell Dj Matsushita.

00:09:32.955 --> 00:09:35.627
No time for romance. I gotta get
to Tokyo.

00:09:35.727 --> 00:09:38.533
Besides, there's tons of
guys there and cool shops.

00:09:38.633 --> 00:09:41.037
It's gonna be great.

00:09:41.137 --> 00:09:43.810
This is the start of our
magical Tokyo adventure.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.012
Right, Jun?

00:09:45.112 --> 00:09:47.784
(buzzing)

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:53.696
- [Shoji] I guess life doesn't
always work out as planned.

00:09:53.796 --> 00:09:55.900
- But it's not fair. I studied
so hard.

00:09:56.001 --> 00:09:58.405
How come I couldn't even
get into one school?

00:09:58.506 --> 00:09:59.340
Fate is against me.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.579
- This has got nothing to do
with fate.

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:02.380
- You guys are lucky.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.650
You got into the school you
wanted

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.620
and you'll go to all
kinds of cool parties.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.323
- I didn't apply to university

00:10:07.423 --> 00:10:08.760
just so I could go to parties.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.595
- But, Nana, I thought you said

00:10:09.695 --> 00:10:11.064
it didn't have to be a
university.

00:10:11.164 --> 00:10:14.505
So what happened to enrolling
at a technical college?

00:10:14.605 --> 00:10:16.408
- My parents said they'd
only pay my tuition

00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:17.711
if I was going to university.

00:10:17.811 --> 00:10:20.550
- Then you'll have to wait
another year and apply again.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.886
- I don't really care about art
school.

00:10:21.986 --> 00:10:24.558
I just wanted to stay
in Tokyo with you guys.

00:10:24.658 --> 00:10:26.061
What should I do?

00:10:26.996 --> 00:10:28.065
- Hmm.

00:10:32.206 --> 00:10:34.611
- [Junko] You guys mind if
we head back to the hotel?

00:10:34.712 --> 00:10:35.780
I wanna get up early tomorrow

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.718
and start looking for an
apartment.

00:10:37.818 --> 00:10:39.655
- [Kyosuke] Fine with me.

00:10:47.103 --> 00:10:49.007
- Hey, Nana, we've come
all this way to Tokyo.

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:51.679
We should check out a few of the
sites.

00:10:52.547 --> 00:10:53.750
- Okay.

00:10:54.585 --> 00:10:56.021
Where should we start?

00:10:57.089 --> 00:10:59.160
- Hey, guys, why don't
you go ahead without us?

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.632
- Sure, but you better not drink
too much.

00:11:01.732 --> 00:11:04.872
- Listen to him. Always
worrying about someone else.

00:11:07.544 --> 00:11:08.412
- Tokyo is amazing.

00:11:08.513 --> 00:11:10.015
I can't believe there are so
many people

00:11:10.115 --> 00:11:12.621
still on the streets when
it's so late at night.

00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:15.827
Makes me feel like I'm
a total country girl.

00:11:15.927 --> 00:11:17.229
- Well, you are a country girl.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.902
Speaking of which, I wanted
to make a suggestion.

00:11:20.002 --> 00:11:21.304
Don't you think the best thing
to do

00:11:21.404 --> 00:11:23.976
might be to stay at the art
school back home next year?

00:11:24.077 --> 00:11:27.551
- Are you kidding? I wanna
move to Tokyo no matter what.

00:11:27.651 --> 00:11:29.320
- It's just, I feel responsible

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.557
for putting you in this mess.

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:32.594
I never should have suggested
it in the first place.

00:11:32.694 --> 00:11:34.263
I think maybe you'd be better
off

00:11:34.364 --> 00:11:35.466
if you stayed back at home.

00:11:35.567 --> 00:11:37.169
- Absolutely not!

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:40.910
- Hmm. Do you really wanna
be with Junko that much?

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.581
- Not just her.

00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:45.954
Aren't you going to be
in Tokyo as well, Shoji?

00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:50.997
- Yeah, I was planning to stay
here and go to a prep school.

00:11:51.097 --> 00:11:52.868
Then take the university exams
again.

00:11:52.968 --> 00:11:55.005
- Then I'm coming to live in
Tokyo too.

00:11:55.105 --> 00:11:56.709
If my parents won't give me any
money

00:11:56.809 --> 00:11:59.848
I'll just have to find a
job so I can support myself.

00:11:59.948 --> 00:12:03.088
- (sighs) Do you know what
the hell you're talking about?

00:12:03.188 --> 00:12:03.890
That's totally crazy.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.163
- It's not crazy. I can make
this work, I know I can.

00:12:07.263 --> 00:12:08.031
- But you don't have any money!

00:12:08.131 --> 00:12:09.500
How do you think you're gonna
survive?

00:12:09.601 --> 00:12:11.772
- I already told you, I'll get a
job.

00:12:11.872 --> 00:12:12.741
- What about your rent?

00:12:12.841 --> 00:12:13.676
You're gonna need a lot of money

00:12:13.776 --> 00:12:15.245
to pay your deposit up front.

00:12:15.345 --> 00:12:16.181
You're not a kid anymore.

00:12:16.281 --> 00:12:18.218
I shouldn't have to tell you
this stuff.

00:12:18.318 --> 00:12:20.222
Why don't you get real for once?

00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:22.561
- Then I'll go to prep school
like you.

00:12:22.661 --> 00:12:24.698
If I do that, maybe my
parents would help out

00:12:24.798 --> 00:12:26.736
with some money-
- Just listen to yourself.

00:12:26.836 --> 00:12:29.407
Don't go to prep school for
nothing.

00:12:29.508 --> 00:12:30.877
- Then what should I do?

00:12:30.977 --> 00:12:33.281
- Go back home and stay there.

00:12:34.685 --> 00:12:36.488
- But if I go back home

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.260
aren't you gonna be
lonely here without me?

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.433
- I will not be lonely! I'll be
relieved!

00:12:42.534 --> 00:12:44.872
(gasps)

00:12:47.443 --> 00:12:48.646
What am I to you anyway?

00:12:48.746 --> 00:12:50.550
You get all teary eyed
whenever it suits you,

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.186
but you never stop to
think about my feelings

00:12:52.286 --> 00:12:54.490
or how you might be messing
around with my heart.

00:12:54.591 --> 00:12:56.829
You want some nice guy
to be part of your life

00:12:56.929 --> 00:12:59.133
but only if it's on your terms.

00:12:59.233 --> 00:13:02.072
All this talk of just
being friends with a guy?

00:13:02.173 --> 00:13:03.976
Don't make me laugh!

00:13:16.669 --> 00:13:20.042
(melancholy music)

00:13:23.048 --> 00:13:26.321
- [Nana] I have to get back to
the hotel.

00:13:26.421 --> 00:13:29.127
But I don't know where it is.

00:13:30.229 --> 00:13:31.331
When I was with Shoji,

00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:33.936
I never paid any attention
to where we were going

00:13:34.036 --> 00:13:37.309
because he always led the way.

00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:42.587
I guess it was a mistake
to rely on him that much.

00:13:42.687 --> 00:13:45.693
And now, I don't have a clue
where I am.

00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:48.566
- [Takashi] Nana?

00:13:48.666 --> 00:13:49.935
(gasps)

00:13:50.035 --> 00:13:53.275
- [Nana] That's right. I'm in
Tokyo.

00:13:56.549 --> 00:13:58.151
It can't be.

00:14:01.659 --> 00:14:03.596
- I thought it was you.

00:14:03.696 --> 00:14:04.865
Nana, what's the matter?

00:14:04.965 --> 00:14:07.336
What are you doing here in
Tokyo?

00:14:09.508 --> 00:14:12.647
(shudders, sobs)

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:19.060
- It's over man.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.299
- She drove me to the edge
and I kind of snapped!

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:23.268
I just couldn't help it!

00:14:23.368 --> 00:14:25.640
- I totally understand why
you got upset with her,

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.675
but I can't believe you left her

00:14:26.775 --> 00:14:28.311
in the middle of the city like
that!

00:14:28.411 --> 00:14:29.413
What were you thinking?

00:14:29.515 --> 00:14:30.550
- The streets are well lit

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.253
and there are tons of people
around.

00:14:32.353 --> 00:14:32.988
She should find her way.

00:14:33.088 --> 00:14:35.225
- That is so not the point.
You should just shut up.

00:14:35.325 --> 00:14:37.864
Since you can't figure it
out yourself, let me help.

00:14:37.964 --> 00:14:39.066
Nana's in love with you.

00:14:39.166 --> 00:14:42.874
- What? That's impossible.

00:14:42.974 --> 00:14:44.945
- (groans) Imagine what she
feels like.

00:14:45.045 --> 00:14:47.216
The man she loves telling
her she can't be with him?

00:14:47.316 --> 00:14:49.922
Think of the effect that'd have
on her.

00:14:53.663 --> 00:14:56.835
- I always thought that Nana
might have a thing for me,

00:14:56.936 --> 00:14:59.407
but I just put it down
to wishful thinking.

00:14:59.508 --> 00:15:00.944
- What's with that man?

00:15:01.044 --> 00:15:01.779
You should know by now

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:04.918
if Junko tells you something
like that, it's true.

00:15:07.356 --> 00:15:08.391
- Hmm.

00:15:14.337 --> 00:15:15.072
- [Kyosuke] Hm?

00:15:15.172 --> 00:15:18.713
(sighs) Some people need
to think before they act.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.823
- So you applied to different
art schools.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.829
- Yeah, but I didn't get into
any of them.

00:15:26.929 --> 00:15:29.100
I really don't know what to do
next.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.872
I kind of had my heart
set on moving to Tokyo.

00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:34.210
Oh, don't worry. I'm not
following you or anything.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.347
I would never ever cause you any
trouble.

00:15:36.447 --> 00:15:39.086
I'm not gonna turn into
some crazy stalker.

00:15:39.186 --> 00:15:43.028
- (giggles) You know something,
Nana? You haven't changed.

00:15:43.128 --> 00:15:45.465
- Really? You don't think I've
changed?

00:15:45.566 --> 00:15:46.635
Look at my hair, my clothes.

00:15:46.735 --> 00:15:49.106
I look more like a kid now
than when I was in high school.

00:15:49.206 --> 00:15:52.479
It's pretty embarrassing to
have you see me like this.

00:15:54.283 --> 00:15:56.755
- I think that style
suits you better, Nana.

00:15:56.855 --> 00:15:58.325
- You think so? It looks okay?

00:15:58.425 --> 00:16:01.130
- [Takashi] But the way you
speak hasn't changed at all.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.464
- Oh?

00:16:01.565 --> 00:16:04.303
- I would never ever
cause you any trouble?

00:16:04.403 --> 00:16:08.078
I'm not some crazy stalker?
Don't worry.

00:16:08.178 --> 00:16:10.850
You said that every time we got
together.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.520
It made things difficult.

00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:14.090
- Really? Why?

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.799
(gentle music)

00:16:20.703 --> 00:16:24.143
Well, I'm not the only one who
hasn't changed around here.

00:16:24.243 --> 00:16:27.584
Every time I'd ask what's wrong,
you'd go all silent on me.

00:16:27.684 --> 00:16:29.420
- Hmm.

00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:32.761
- It was hard for me. I never
knew what you were thinking.

00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:35.465
- I guess you're right.
Sorry about that.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.212
- What a strange feeling.

00:16:42.313 --> 00:16:45.285
I thought I really hated
this guy,

00:16:45.385 --> 00:16:50.997
but after seeing him again,
I don't feel that way at all.

00:16:51.097 --> 00:16:54.036
Maybe what we had before
wasn't a lie.

00:16:54.136 --> 00:16:58.813
I really loved him. And I think
he might felt the same way.

00:16:59.548 --> 00:17:01.050
Just a little.

00:17:01.885 --> 00:17:03.923
And that's okay.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.260
I should accept it.

00:17:06.361 --> 00:17:09.901
I don't have to feel
sad about it.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.084
Aha, right! This is great.

00:17:18.184 --> 00:17:19.988
I definitely recognize this
corner.

00:17:20.088 --> 00:17:22.627
- Go straight ahead and
you'll get to your hotel.

00:17:22.727 --> 00:17:24.765
- Mr. Asano, how are you?

00:17:24.865 --> 00:17:26.000
- Huh?

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.904
- What are you doing out so
late?

00:17:28.004 --> 00:17:30.643
Not only that, who's this
young lady you're with?

00:17:30.743 --> 00:17:34.083
I guess I'm gonna have to tell
your pretty wife about this.

00:17:34.183 --> 00:17:36.287
- Then I'll have to buy you
dinner to keep your mouth shut.

00:17:36.387 --> 00:17:38.592
- Well, all right,
we got a deal!

00:17:38.692 --> 00:17:40.563
(giggles) I'll see you later.

00:17:41.932 --> 00:17:43.636
- Shouldn't you have made up
some excuse?

00:17:43.736 --> 00:17:45.940
- Don't worry. He doesn't
suspect a thing.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.644
He was just kidding around.

00:17:47.744 --> 00:17:50.282
If I made some excuse, then
it would've seemed suspicious.

00:17:50.382 --> 00:17:53.088
- I see he dealt with
that guy so smoothly.

00:17:53.188 --> 00:17:56.394
Makes me wonder if he has
affairs all the time, hmm.

00:17:56.494 --> 00:18:00.102
At least now I know you gave
me your real name, I'm glad.

00:18:00.202 --> 00:18:00.402
- What?

00:18:00.503 --> 00:18:02.372
- Nothing. Just talking to
myself.

00:18:02.473 --> 00:18:05.112
I guess I should get back
to my hotel.

00:18:14.898 --> 00:18:18.338
(melancholy music)

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.549
Don't cheat on your wife
anymore.

00:18:23.649 --> 00:18:25.051
- I'll try not to.

00:18:26.487 --> 00:18:28.291
- Glad to hear it.

00:18:28.391 --> 00:18:31.932
Not that I should be the one
telling you this (giggles).

00:18:36.708 --> 00:18:38.946
Goodbye, Takashi.

00:18:39.046 --> 00:18:42.954
It's true. I really
did love you.

00:18:50.837 --> 00:18:54.076
It's all right. No more tears.

00:18:55.813 --> 00:18:57.650
(phone rings)

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:02.326
(sighs) What a stupid ring tone.
I gotta change it sometime.

00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:05.298
Hello! This is Nana!

00:19:05.398 --> 00:19:07.971
- Hey, sounds like everything's
all right.

00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:09.306
- [Nana] Kyosuke?

00:19:09.406 --> 00:19:11.043
- Wow, you sound pretty happy.

00:19:11.144 --> 00:19:12.246
Guess that means he found you.

00:19:12.346 --> 00:19:13.816
- He found me? Who found me?

00:19:13.916 --> 00:19:16.855
- [Kyosuke] So he hasn't found
you. Didn't think he would.

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:18.893
Where are you?

00:19:18.993 --> 00:19:21.330
- For a minute there I thought
he was talking about Takashi.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:25.940
I'm not far from the hotel.
I'll be back there really soon.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.209
- [Kyosuke] Junko and Shoji got
worried

00:19:27.309 --> 00:19:29.548
and started a search
party to try and find you

00:19:29.648 --> 00:19:30.783
about an hour ago.

00:19:30.883 --> 00:19:31.752
- Huh?

00:19:31.852 --> 00:19:32.319
- [Kyosuke] When they find you

00:19:32.419 --> 00:19:35.660
it's gonna be like some bad TV
soap opera.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.666
- You never think about my
feelings!

00:19:44.243 --> 00:19:47.584
- I'm really sorry. I didn't
mean for this to happen.

00:19:47.684 --> 00:19:50.155
- [Kyosuke] It's fine. You
don't have to apologize to me.

00:19:50.255 --> 00:19:53.228
- I just thought... (sobs)

00:19:53.328 --> 00:19:55.031
- Don't waste your tears on me.

00:19:55.131 --> 00:19:55.600
- [Nana] Yeah, but-

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.240
- It's all right. Shoji is
totally in love with you.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.543
- Don't lie to me!

00:20:00.643 --> 00:20:04.016
- [Kyosuke] You're the one
who's lying and you know it.

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:12.734
- Kyosuke, do you have any
idea where Shoji is right now?

00:20:12.834 --> 00:20:13.736
- He could be anywhere,

00:20:13.836 --> 00:20:17.075
though he's probably within
walking distance of the hotel.

00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:19.748
Why don't you come back
up to the room, okay?

00:20:20.883 --> 00:20:22.486
Huh?

00:20:22.587 --> 00:20:25.225
(knocking)

00:20:27.329 --> 00:20:29.433
- No luck, Kyosuke. Can't find
her!

00:20:29.534 --> 00:20:32.507
We better hurry and try and
reach her on her cell phone.

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:35.245
- So you finally figured
that out.

00:20:36.447 --> 00:20:40.055
- [Nana] The truth is,
I've always loved him.

00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:42.794
From the first moment our eyes
met,

00:20:42.894 --> 00:20:46.602
but I was getting over my
previous breakup back then.

00:20:46.702 --> 00:20:49.306
Okay, so I was a bit
selfish playing the victim,

00:20:49.406 --> 00:20:51.444
but the pain inside was real.

00:20:52.212 --> 00:20:53.649
I guess I was afraid,

00:20:53.749 --> 00:20:56.588
afraid of getting close to
someone again.

00:20:56.688 --> 00:21:00.128
But looking back, whenever
I was with you, Shoji,

00:21:00.228 --> 00:21:02.634
I felt like you were healing me.

00:21:02.734 --> 00:21:03.301
I didn't realize it,

00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:05.873
but you had wrapped me
up inside your heart.

00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:09.346
Now I want you to embrace
me with that same warmth.

00:21:09.446 --> 00:21:11.518
All your strength.

00:21:11.618 --> 00:21:14.323
Shoji. Shoji!

00:21:20.268 --> 00:21:25.680
(singing in foreign language)
(gentle music)
