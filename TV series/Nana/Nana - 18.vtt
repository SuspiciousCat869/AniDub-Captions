WEBVTT

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.634
- [Nana K. Voiceover] I can't
believe it took me so long

00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:08.938
to figure it out about Nana and
Ren.

00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:10.709
The clues were all there.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.681
The earrings they wore,
the way they spoke.

00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:15.284
They were so similar.

00:00:15.384 --> 00:00:18.958
I began to feel the weight
of the history between them.

00:01:58.725 --> 00:02:01.864
(birds chirping)

00:02:05.137 --> 00:02:08.544
- "Tell us about that
padlock you always wear."

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.682
"I can't take it off,

00:02:10.782 --> 00:02:13.120
but that's because I lost the
key."

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.124
Hm.

00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:17.194
What if he didn't actually lose
the key?

00:02:17.294 --> 00:02:20.100
And what if Nana's been
holding onto it?

00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:24.208
- [Nana K. Voiceover]
Ever since I found out

00:02:24.308 --> 00:02:26.346
that Ren was Nana's ex-boyfriend

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.518
I've been rereading all
the magazines

00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:31.524
and fan club newsletters
from cover to cover

00:02:31.624 --> 00:02:33.427
over and over again.

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:35.197
I can't believe how much
I'd missed

00:02:35.297 --> 00:02:38.103
'cause I just casually
flipped through them.

00:02:38.938 --> 00:02:39.973
I'm the kind of person

00:02:40.074 --> 00:02:42.411
who will only catch what
interests me.

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:51.664
Right now, all I can think
about is Nana and Ren.

00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:54.068
I can't think about anything
else.

00:02:56.607 --> 00:02:58.243
Well, it's more like

00:02:58.343 --> 00:03:01.282
I don't want to think about
anything else.

00:03:03.554 --> 00:03:06.426
Of course, if I had a new
boyfriend

00:03:06.527 --> 00:03:09.465
I probably wouldn't care
about Shoji anymore.

00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:14.175
I hope that day comes soon.

00:03:15.344 --> 00:03:19.285
- So, are you ready?
(Nana K. gasps)

00:03:20.655 --> 00:03:22.491
We gotta get going.

00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:24.563
- Yeah.

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:27.903
Hey, Nana?

00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:28.771
- Huh?

00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:29.673
- Aren't you getting changed?

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:30.174
- [Nana O.] For what?

00:03:30.274 --> 00:03:32.779
- You mean you're gonna be
wearing that to the concert?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.150
- I thought it was best to
wear something comfortable

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.589
since we're gonna have to stay
overnight.

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:38.457
The shades are cool, huh?

00:03:38.558 --> 00:03:41.095
- Yeah, but this is the big
night out

00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:42.532
we've been looking forward to
for so long.

00:03:42.632 --> 00:03:44.503
I think we should really dress
up for it.

00:03:44.603 --> 00:03:45.505
- [Nana K. Voiceover] It's
the first time you'll see Ren

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:47.909
in two years, at least wear
a skirt!

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.582
- This is your big night
out, not mine, remember?

00:03:50.682 --> 00:03:52.986
Why should I dress up for it?

00:03:53.086 --> 00:03:55.792
Besides, it's only a
Trapnest concert.

00:03:55.892 --> 00:03:58.096
- [Nana K. Voiceover] If she
wears those stupid sunglasses,

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.367
Ren might not recognize her.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.612
Maybe she's doing this
on purpose!

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:06.881
I hate having to bite my tongue.

00:04:06.981 --> 00:04:08.851
There's so much I wanna ask her!

00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:09.786
- [Nana O.] Is this okay?

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:11.256
- Mm-hm!

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:12.124
- [Nana K. Voiceover] But first
of all,

00:04:12.224 --> 00:04:14.763
my main priority is to
get Nana to the concert.

00:04:14.863 --> 00:04:17.769
I gotta be careful not to
drive her crazy before then.

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:20.675
(train whooshing)

00:04:20.775 --> 00:04:24.248
(fun whimsical music)

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:33.634
- [Nana O.] Want another sugar?

00:04:33.734 --> 00:04:34.368
I don't want mine.

00:04:34.468 --> 00:04:36.039
- No, that's okay, but thanks.

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.474
- [Nana O.] Okay.

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:46.459
- [Nana K. Voiceover] Nana and
Ren

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.498
are getting closer to
seeing each other again.

00:04:50.902 --> 00:04:52.471
- I can't wait to see them.

00:04:52.572 --> 00:04:53.106
- What?

00:04:53.206 --> 00:04:54.743
- To see your family.

00:04:54.843 --> 00:04:55.612
- Huh?

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:56.346
- Especially Natsuko.

00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:58.116
I'm one of her biggest fans.

00:04:58.216 --> 00:04:59.252
- [Nana K. Voiceover] I'm kind
of nervous

00:04:59.352 --> 00:05:02.659
about her meeting my folks.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.600
My parents are just boring
old people from the boonies.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.209
My little sis is a total fake
and bake with bleached hair

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:12.913
and my older sister...

00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:13.781
- Nana!

00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:18.123
- [Nana K. Voiceover] She
keeps piling on the pounds.

00:05:18.223 --> 00:05:21.329
- [Nana O. Voiceover] They look
so alike.

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:22.933
- [Nana O.] Thanks for picking
us up.

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:24.836
I'm sorry if it caused you any
trouble.

00:05:24.937 --> 00:05:26.974
- [Nana K. Voiceover]
Sorry for causing trouble?

00:05:27.074 --> 00:05:28.911
- [Nao] Don't worry, today's my
day off,

00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:30.247
so it wasn't a problem.

00:05:30.347 --> 00:05:32.586
Trying to get around
this place is a nightmare

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:33.854
if you don't have a car

00:05:33.955 --> 00:05:34.656
- Actually, about that,

00:05:34.756 --> 00:05:37.361
do you think you could give
us a ride to the show tonight?

00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:37.963
- Sure.

00:05:38.063 --> 00:05:39.232
Where is it?

00:05:39.332 --> 00:05:40.133
- [Nana K.] Idea Hall.

00:05:40.234 --> 00:05:41.537
We wanna get there around 6:00.

00:05:41.637 --> 00:05:44.008
- [Nao] Okay, then we'll
need to leave around 5:30.

00:05:44.108 --> 00:05:45.143
- Yay!

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:47.114
Thanks sis, I love ya.

00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:50.320
(birds chirping)

00:05:52.592 --> 00:05:55.430
(pensive music)

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:58.336
Look, Nana!

00:05:58.436 --> 00:06:01.677
That building over there is
where I used go to school.

00:06:02.812 --> 00:06:04.081
I miss those times.

00:06:04.181 --> 00:06:06.252
- What do you mean you miss
those times?

00:06:06.352 --> 00:06:07.822
Hasn't it only been about a year

00:06:07.923 --> 00:06:08.858
since you stopped going there?

00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.262
- I know, but it feels like
it's been more than 10 years,

00:06:11.362 --> 00:06:12.231
so much has happened.

00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:13.935
- That doesn't surprise me.

00:06:14.035 --> 00:06:15.705
- So, you went to art school
here?

00:06:15.805 --> 00:06:16.840
Was it interesting?

00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:17.341
- It was okay,

00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:20.347
but it didn't take long to
realize art wasn't my thing.

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:21.917
I had a lot of fun though

00:06:22.017 --> 00:06:24.790
doing stuff with Jun and
Kyosuke and...

00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:29.098
(pensive music)

00:06:29.198 --> 00:06:32.204
We hung out every day.

00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:36.513
- [Nao] So, Nana, I wanna
hear all about life in Tokyo.

00:06:36.613 --> 00:06:38.751
Nami says you're living
with your boyfriend.

00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:40.087
Is that true?

00:06:40.187 --> 00:06:40.822
Is it the same guy?

00:06:40.922 --> 00:06:42.726
The one who always
used to come over

00:06:42.826 --> 00:06:43.995
when you were in art school?

00:06:44.095 --> 00:06:45.464
Shoji, wasn't it?

00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:46.032
- No.

00:06:46.132 --> 00:06:47.267
- I think there's been a
misunderstanding.

00:06:47.368 --> 00:06:50.073
You see, I'm Nana's
roommate in Tokyo.

00:06:50.173 --> 00:06:51.075
- [Nao] Oh, really?

00:06:51.175 --> 00:06:51.543
- Yeah.

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:53.113
You should come and visit us
sometime.

00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:54.048
You'd be more than
welcome.

00:06:54.148 --> 00:06:57.555
Then you could see Nana's
Tokyo life for yourself.

00:06:57.656 --> 00:06:58.123
- [Nao] Uh-oh.

00:06:58.223 --> 00:06:59.526
Nami's been making things up
again.

00:06:59.626 --> 00:07:01.997
She sure loves to gossip.

00:07:02.097 --> 00:07:04.402
(pensive music)

00:07:04.503 --> 00:07:06.039
- [Nana K. Voiceover] I'm glad
Nana is with me.

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.682
There are too memories here
for me to cope with on my own.

00:07:14.355 --> 00:07:15.658
- [Nao] Hey mom, we're home.

00:07:15.758 --> 00:07:16.894
Nana's here.

00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:19.933
- Wow, what a fancy house.

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:21.503
You guys must be rich.

00:07:21.603 --> 00:07:22.171
- Not really.

00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:23.039
This is pretty normal.

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:25.077
Property's cheap around here.

00:07:25.177 --> 00:07:28.249
(Nami squeals)

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.151
- Nana, you're home!

00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:30.354
- Holy tan!
- Is that a present?

00:07:30.454 --> 00:07:31.824
A designer handbag?

00:07:31.924 --> 00:07:33.561
- I didn't get you anything.

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:34.663
- Nami!

00:07:34.763 --> 00:07:35.898
Behave yourself.

00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:37.936
Can't you see we've got a guest?

00:07:38.036 --> 00:07:40.374
Hello, I'm Nana's mother.

00:07:40.474 --> 00:07:42.211
Things can get a little crazy
around here,

00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:44.281
but try to make yourself at
home.

00:07:44.382 --> 00:07:45.985
(Nana O. chuckles softly)

00:07:46.085 --> 00:07:46.854
Hm?

00:07:46.954 --> 00:07:48.356
- Oh, my name is Nana Osaki.

00:07:48.456 --> 00:07:49.458
Pleased to meet you.

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:50.795
Thanks for letting me stay.

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:51.630
- Nana, what?

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.801
- Yeah, we both got the same
name.

00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:54.503
Isn't it cool?

00:07:54.603 --> 00:07:56.039
We were fated to be roommates.

00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:58.076
- Wow, she's really pretty and
stylish!

00:07:58.176 --> 00:08:00.915
- You have the same name, but
you're so different from her.

00:08:01.015 --> 00:08:01.784
- Mom, shut up!

00:08:01.884 --> 00:08:02.952
- You poor girl.

00:08:03.053 --> 00:08:03.854
Too bad.

00:08:03.954 --> 00:08:04.556
(Nana O. and Nami laughing)

00:08:04.656 --> 00:08:05.525
- [Nana O. Voiceover] Way to go,
Natsuko.

00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:07.161
- I don't see what's so funny,
Nami.

00:08:07.261 --> 00:08:07.796
- Hey, Nami, by the way,

00:08:07.896 --> 00:08:10.400
I found out you've been making
up a lot of nonsense again.

00:08:10.501 --> 00:08:13.641
This Nana is our Nana's
roommate in Tokyo.

00:08:13.741 --> 00:08:14.576
(Nami gasps)

00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:16.312
- Nana, what happened to your
boyfriend?

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:18.049
- I never said I was
living with him?

00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:19.118
- Are you serious?

00:08:19.218 --> 00:08:20.320
That's so boring.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:20.822
(Nana K. groans)

00:08:20.922 --> 00:08:22.424
- [Natsuko] Why didn't didn't
you tell me this before?

00:08:22.525 --> 00:08:25.030
Then I wouldn't have spent so
much time worrying about you.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.299
- I tried to tell you, mom,

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:27.134
but every time I tried-
- - So, you're living with

00:08:27.234 --> 00:08:28.103
my daughter.
- You never listened and-

00:08:28.203 --> 00:08:29.472
Goodness knows what a pain she
must be.

00:08:29.573 --> 00:08:32.344
I'm so sorry you have to
put up with her every day.

00:08:32.444 --> 00:08:34.649
- No, Nana is the perfect
roommate.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.854
Honest, considerate and
cheerful.

00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:39.526
I'm more than happy to be living
with her.

00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:40.928
She's a really great girl.

00:08:41.028 --> 00:08:43.032
I'm sure it's because she grew
up around

00:08:43.133 --> 00:08:44.335
such a loving family.

00:08:44.435 --> 00:08:45.772
- Oh, you're too fun!

00:08:45.872 --> 00:08:46.405
- Ow!

00:08:46.507 --> 00:08:47.642
- [Natsuko] Come on,
I'll make you some tea

00:08:47.742 --> 00:08:48.544
before the concert.
- Nana.

00:08:48.644 --> 00:08:50.815
- [Nana O.] Oh, here's some
snacks we brought for you.

00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:56.660
(zipper unzipping)

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.633
- [Nana K.] Nana, you'd
make a really good actress.

00:08:59.733 --> 00:09:00.400
- Huh?

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.670
- "Nana's a perfect roommate.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.339
Honest, considerate and
cheerful."

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.241
- That wasn't acting.

00:09:04.341 --> 00:09:05.310
I meant what I said.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.312
- [Nana O. Voiceover] I'm more
than happy

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:08.784
to be living with her.

00:09:08.884 --> 00:09:10.922
- So, we didn't see your dad
yet.

00:09:11.022 --> 00:09:12.525
Does he work on Saturdays?

00:09:12.625 --> 00:09:14.930
- Yeah, he'll be home later on
tonight.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.399
- So, I get to meet him?

00:09:16.499 --> 00:09:17.902
I'm looking forward to it.

00:09:18.002 --> 00:09:18.470
- I don't know why.

00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:20.775
He's not someone who's cool or
anything.

00:09:20.875 --> 00:09:23.213
I'm sorry we're such a crazy
family.

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.716
It's kind of embarrassing.

00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:26.385
- Oh no, I'm having a great
time.

00:09:26.486 --> 00:09:28.824
Your mom is even cooler
than I imagined she'd be.

00:09:28.924 --> 00:09:30.427
I'm glad I got the chance
to meet her.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.264
- You think my mom's cool?

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:33.834
She's just like any other mom.

00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:35.203
- No.

00:09:35.303 --> 00:09:36.439
She's more than that.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.942
She seems like the perfect mom.

00:09:38.042 --> 00:09:38.978
- Really?

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:39.613
What's your mom like?

00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:41.315
You never talked about
her before.

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:44.321
I bet she's beautiful and
cool, right?

00:09:45.323 --> 00:09:46.425
- I don't know.

00:09:46.527 --> 00:09:48.296
I hardly even remember her.

00:09:48.396 --> 00:09:49.265
- What do you mean?

00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:51.970
It's only been about six months
since you moved to Tokyo.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.645
- No, I haven't seen her
since I was four years old.

00:09:55.745 --> 00:09:56.345
- Huh?

00:09:56.445 --> 00:09:57.314
But why not?

00:09:57.414 --> 00:09:59.786
- She decided to run off
with some guy.

00:09:59.886 --> 00:10:00.353
(Nana K. gasps)

00:10:00.453 --> 00:10:03.193
- For all I know, she
could be dead by now.

00:10:03.293 --> 00:10:05.631
Not that I really care
either way.

00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:07.502
- [Nana K.] So then you grew up

00:10:07.602 --> 00:10:09.873
with just your father
raising you?

00:10:10.975 --> 00:10:12.812
Any brothers or sisters?

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:13.948
- No.

00:10:16.185 --> 00:10:17.889
I never knew my father.

00:10:17.989 --> 00:10:20.493
My maternal grandmother raised
me,

00:10:20.595 --> 00:10:22.832
but she died when I was 15.

00:10:25.605 --> 00:10:28.309
It's kind of weird,
but I like it,

00:10:28.409 --> 00:10:30.915
being around a happy
family scene like yours.

00:10:31.015 --> 00:10:33.119
I've never experienced
that before.

00:10:33.219 --> 00:10:34.656
It's interesting.

00:10:34.756 --> 00:10:37.929
- [Nana K. Voiceover] You
like this?

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:41.537
I guess I've always taken
it for granted.

00:10:43.507 --> 00:10:47.447
(emotional music)
- Huh?

00:10:48.383 --> 00:10:49.251
Sorry.

00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:52.124
I didn't mean to be such
a downer.

00:10:52.224 --> 00:10:53.059
- No, I'm sorry.

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:55.463
I just, I had no idea.

00:10:55.565 --> 00:10:58.236
I should never have
brought it up.

00:10:58.336 --> 00:11:00.841
But I'm also happy.

00:11:00.942 --> 00:11:02.545
Oh, wait, sorry, that
came out wrong.

00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:04.516
I'm not happy about
what happened to you.

00:11:04.616 --> 00:11:06.385
I think it's awful and I feel
so bad.

00:11:06.485 --> 00:11:07.889
- Calm down.

00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:11.462
- The thing is, you've
never really opened up

00:11:11.563 --> 00:11:14.536
and told me anything
about yourself before.

00:11:14.636 --> 00:11:16.272
I had no idea why

00:11:16.372 --> 00:11:17.775
and it always made me
kind of sad

00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:20.146
to think you couldn't
confide in me,

00:11:21.883 --> 00:11:25.625
so that's why I'm happy,
because you told me.

00:11:26.593 --> 00:11:27.762
- Really?

00:11:27.862 --> 00:11:28.597
Sorry.

00:11:28.697 --> 00:11:30.801
Nana, it never actually
occurred to me

00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:34.141
that you might be feeling
that way.

00:11:34.241 --> 00:11:37.414
You know, I haven't had a
close female friend before,

00:11:37.515 --> 00:11:38.884
so I'm not sure what to do.

00:11:38.984 --> 00:11:41.289
I'm not that good at talking
about myself

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:42.625
and sharing my feelings.

00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:45.564
So, instead I just end up
keeping everything to myself,

00:11:45.665 --> 00:11:49.606
but it doesn't mean that
I'm trying to shut you out.

00:11:55.518 --> 00:11:57.154
If there's anything
you wanna know,

00:11:57.254 --> 00:11:58.857
just ask and I'll tell you.

00:11:58.958 --> 00:11:59.491
Okay?

00:11:59.592 --> 00:12:01.797
I don't want you feeling
sad about me.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.673
(Nana K laughing)

00:12:06.773 --> 00:12:07.474
Huh?

00:12:07.575 --> 00:12:08.076
And what is so funny?

00:12:08.176 --> 00:12:10.748
- Nana, that I think it's
hilarious

00:12:10.848 --> 00:12:12.652
that you're such a dude
all the time.

00:12:12.752 --> 00:12:14.656
Sometimes you're more like my
boyfriend

00:12:14.756 --> 00:12:16.225
than one of my best girlfriends.

00:12:16.325 --> 00:12:18.162
My heart just totally skipped a
beat.

00:12:18.262 --> 00:12:18.697
- Whatever.

00:12:18.797 --> 00:12:21.469
I don't want you thinking
about me that way.

00:12:22.739 --> 00:12:25.911
- So you'll really tell
me anything I wanna know?

00:12:26.012 --> 00:12:26.479
- Yeah.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.018
- The whole truth and
nothing but?

00:12:29.118 --> 00:12:30.153
- Sure.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.428
- Are you still in
love with Ren?

00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:37.602
(Nana O. gasps)

00:12:41.743 --> 00:12:43.246
- [Nana O.] So you knew.

00:12:45.316 --> 00:12:46.318
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:12:46.419 --> 00:12:48.924
I only just found out, but I-

00:12:49.024 --> 00:12:51.897
- You knew and that's
why you brought me here?

00:12:53.466 --> 00:12:54.769
Thank you, Nana.

00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:00.581
- Oh, Nana.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.624
(funky guitar music)

00:13:28.537 --> 00:13:31.510
Nana, I'm gonna go buy one
of the souvenir programs.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.411
You want one?

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:33.614
- Mm-mm.

00:13:33.714 --> 00:13:36.152
I'm gonna have a quick
smoke, then find my seat.

00:13:36.252 --> 00:13:40.093
I can always take a
look at yours later on.

00:13:40.193 --> 00:13:43.867
- [Nana K. Voiceover] Are
you still in love with Ren?

00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:47.107
Nana never actually
answered my question.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.054
But she didn't need to tell me.

00:13:54.154 --> 00:13:55.858
I could see the answer.

00:14:01.068 --> 00:14:02.204
Love.

00:14:02.304 --> 00:14:03.941
It's a hard word to say.

00:14:04.041 --> 00:14:06.078
If it was easy for her
to come out and say,

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:07.615
"Yes, I love him,"

00:14:07.715 --> 00:14:11.723
then I guess she would've
already gone to see him long
ago.

00:14:27.955 --> 00:14:29.859
Right in front of the guitarist.

00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:32.330
Nana, this seat was
meant for you!

00:14:35.103 --> 00:14:38.577
The stage is much closer
than I thought it would be.

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:40.213
Unbelievable.

00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:42.317
I could almost burst into tears.

00:14:42.417 --> 00:14:44.689
All right, try not to cry.

00:14:51.603 --> 00:14:53.774
- [Yasu Voiceover] Well,
Nana could have gone with Ren

00:14:53.874 --> 00:14:56.813
to Tokyo, but she had
too much pride.

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:03.527
- [Nana K. Voiceover] Nana.

00:15:03.627 --> 00:15:05.698
- [PA Announcement] Ladies and
gentlemen,

00:15:05.798 --> 00:15:08.169
the concert is about to begin.

00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:10.340
We ask that you make
your way to your seats

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.177
as soon as possible.

00:15:13.146 --> 00:15:14.649
Thank you.

00:15:22.732 --> 00:15:24.067
(lighter clicks)

00:15:24.168 --> 00:15:25.905
- Now we put the new band
together,

00:15:26.005 --> 00:15:27.575
we need to think of a name.

00:15:27.675 --> 00:15:28.342
Any ideas?

00:15:28.442 --> 00:15:31.516
- Why don't we just stick with
what we were using before?

00:15:31.616 --> 00:15:32.785
Rude is a cool name.

00:15:32.885 --> 00:15:33.620
- You kidding?

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.822
That's so barbaric.

00:15:34.923 --> 00:15:37.027
- [Yasu] You're the one
who came up with the name.

00:15:37.127 --> 00:15:39.632
- Yeah, I know, but now
we need a fresh start.

00:15:39.732 --> 00:15:41.870
We finally got a pretty girl on
lead vocal

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.742
so we can't have something
that's too barbaric.

00:15:44.843 --> 00:15:46.245
- [Yasu] I guess not.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:49.752
- Then what about Olive?

00:15:49.853 --> 00:15:50.921
Like Popeye's girl.

00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:53.292
- Is Olive the image you wanna
put across?

00:15:53.392 --> 00:15:55.564
- It might suit him, but not me.

00:15:55.664 --> 00:15:56.031
(Nana chuckles)

00:15:56.131 --> 00:15:58.937
- Nana, it'd be nice if you
helped us think of a name

00:15:59.037 --> 00:16:00.975
instead of laughing.

00:16:01.075 --> 00:16:03.279
- Anything you come up
with is fine with me.

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:05.651
- Hey, are you serious
about singing lead vocals

00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:06.653
with us in the band?

00:16:06.753 --> 00:16:09.592
- "Anything you want is fine
with me."

00:16:09.692 --> 00:16:10.794
What fun are you gonna have in
life

00:16:10.895 --> 00:16:12.532
with that kind of
attitude?

00:16:12.632 --> 00:16:15.436
- I never said I didn't care
what the name was gonna be.

00:16:15.538 --> 00:16:16.673
- Then suggest something.

00:16:16.773 --> 00:16:17.942
You wanna be a part of this
band,

00:16:18.042 --> 00:16:19.244
you gotta put something into it.

00:16:19.344 --> 00:16:22.350
- So says the most selfish
member of the band.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.691
(Nobu laughs)

00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:27.294
- How about Blast?

00:16:27.394 --> 00:16:28.195
Sounds good to me.

00:16:28.296 --> 00:16:30.033
- [Nobu] You can't just pick
the first thing you see.

00:16:30.133 --> 00:16:30.868
- [Nana O.] But it's cool.

00:16:30.968 --> 00:16:32.538
Plus, I've never heard of any
other group

00:16:32.638 --> 00:16:33.907
with a name like that.

00:16:34.007 --> 00:16:35.578
- Are those cigarettes any good?

00:16:35.678 --> 00:16:37.548
They've got a pretty distinctive
smell.

00:16:37.648 --> 00:16:38.382
- I like them.

00:16:38.482 --> 00:16:39.418
They're cigarillos.

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:42.290
I made a trade with a
tobacco shop owner for them.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:42.959
- Trade?

00:16:43.059 --> 00:16:44.094
(Ren and Nobu laugh)

00:16:44.194 --> 00:16:44.762
(Nana K. coughs)

00:16:44.862 --> 00:16:45.564
- What the hell?

00:16:45.664 --> 00:16:46.432
What a weird taste.

00:16:46.533 --> 00:16:47.133
- [Yasu] You think?

00:16:47.234 --> 00:16:49.572
- You know, maybe Blast
isn't such a bad name.

00:16:49.672 --> 00:16:52.444
It's easy to remember and easy
to say.

00:16:52.545 --> 00:16:53.312
- Blast.

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:54.214
I like it.

00:16:54.314 --> 00:16:56.085
- [Nana O. Voiceover] That's my
cigarette.

00:16:56.185 --> 00:16:56.720
- Ugh!

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.788
- [Nana O. Voiceover] Serves him
right.

00:16:57.888 --> 00:16:59.057
- There's another level to
blast.

00:16:59.157 --> 00:17:00.928
It also means a strong gust of
wind.

00:17:01.028 --> 00:17:01.830
- [Nana O.] Oh yeah.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:02.698
- That's really cool!

00:17:02.798 --> 00:17:03.332
It totally feels right

00:17:03.432 --> 00:17:05.838
for the image we want to
put across with our music.

00:17:05.938 --> 00:17:07.440
- [Ren] Sounds good to me.

00:17:07.541 --> 00:17:09.211
We will now be known as Blast.

00:17:09.311 --> 00:17:12.417
It's unusual, but
then again, so are we.

00:17:12.518 --> 00:17:13.119
(Nobu laughs)

00:17:13.219 --> 00:17:14.889
- [Nobu] Three cheers for Blast!

00:17:14.989 --> 00:17:16.292
- [Ren] Okay, we have a name.

00:17:16.392 --> 00:17:18.530
How about a celebration
speech from our leader?

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.701
- [Nana O. Voiceover] They
actually went with the idea?

00:17:20.801 --> 00:17:23.774
- Members of the band, as
your leader

00:17:23.874 --> 00:17:25.343
I will issue you an
order.

00:17:25.443 --> 00:17:28.115
From this day on, we will
only smoke this brand.

00:17:28.215 --> 00:17:32.123
- Smoke them yourself.
- Smoke them yourself.

00:17:39.137 --> 00:17:42.444
(emotional music)

00:17:59.277 --> 00:18:05.056
(people cheering)
(energetic music)

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.571
(Nana K. gasps)

00:18:45.671 --> 00:18:46.706
- [Audience] Layla!

00:18:46.806 --> 00:18:47.240
(gunshot ringing)

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:53.085
(audience cheering)
(emotional music)

00:20:19.391 --> 00:20:20.794
- [Nana K. Voiceover] Why?

00:20:20.894 --> 00:20:22.932
Why am I crying?

00:20:23.032 --> 00:20:24.902
It's so overwhelming,

00:20:25.002 --> 00:20:26.539
all the emotions.

00:20:37.026 --> 00:20:38.496
(Nana K. sobbing)

00:20:38.597 --> 00:20:39.599
Nana.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.874
I kept praying over
and over again

00:20:43.974 --> 00:20:46.011
for the outcome of that night.

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:48.950
Prayed that Nana's fate
would be a happy one.

00:20:54.294 --> 00:20:57.300
Almost unknowingly,
we held hands.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.273
I wanted to continue
holding that hand

00:21:01.375 --> 00:21:05.449
all night long and forever.
