WEBVTT

00:00:02.471 --> 00:00:05.344
(gentle music)

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.102
- [Nana Komatsu] It had been
three years

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:10.373
since Trapnest hit the scene.

00:00:10.473 --> 00:00:13.747
Every one of their records had
sold over a million copies.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.218
Their lead singer, Reira, had a
rich tone

00:00:16.318 --> 00:00:18.957
and vocal range that was
unparalleled in Japan

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:22.565
while Ren was the one who
wrote the bulk of the songs.

00:00:27.508 --> 00:00:28.977
Throughout the whole concert,

00:00:29.077 --> 00:00:31.950
I couldn't take my eyes
off of Ren.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.918
I was so fixated on him,

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:36.158
it was like I was watching
him do a solo show.

00:00:37.828 --> 00:00:41.368
I kept sending him telepathic
messages

00:00:41.468 --> 00:00:45.844
hoping he would notice Nana
sitting there in the front row.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.190
There were times when it
seemed like Ren

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.428
was looking right at us

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:58.870
but then his eyes would shoot
in some other direction.

00:01:08.122 --> 00:01:10.828
(rock music)

00:03:28.937 --> 00:03:31.943
- [Nana Komatsu] Why isn't
he getting my messages?

00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:33.747
After we've come this far.

00:04:08.817 --> 00:04:11.623
(crowd cheers)

00:04:13.058 --> 00:04:14.194
- [Reira] Thank you everyone!

00:04:14.294 --> 00:04:15.631
Good night!

00:04:26.184 --> 00:04:27.387
- [Crowd] We want more!

00:04:27.487 --> 00:04:28.757
We want more!

00:04:28.857 --> 00:04:32.430
We want more! We want more!

00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:34.401
- [Naoki] Wow. What a crazy
crowd.

00:04:34.502 --> 00:04:35.403
Those kids are insane.

00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:36.839
You think it's like a regional
thing?

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.077
- It's 'cause they're a
bunch of country bumpkins

00:04:39.177 --> 00:04:40.179
who don't know any better.

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:41.415
This ain't no world tour.

00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:43.419
And don't talk to the
audience when you're on stage.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.857
It exposes them to your
lack of intelligence.

00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.795
- Don't you think we
should add to the Encore?

00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:50.066
I kind of feel like
two songs isn't enough.

00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:51.502
- Without rehearsing it first?

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:53.205
Don't be such an idiot.

00:04:53.305 --> 00:04:54.775
- Anyway, no can do.

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:55.978
Our time limit is almost up

00:04:56.078 --> 00:04:57.748
and renting this hall
isn't free, you know.

00:04:57.848 --> 00:04:59.619
- [Reira] Some manager you are,
Take.

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.556
Always keeping it cheap.

00:05:03.292 --> 00:05:05.998
- Reira, why don't you just grow
up?

00:05:10.707 --> 00:05:12.745
Hey Ren, you know, you
screwed up in the second song.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:14.682
You did a good job trying to
cover it up

00:05:14.782 --> 00:05:16.653
but it was still pretty obvious.

00:05:16.753 --> 00:05:18.055
- Hey, where are you going, Ren?

00:05:18.155 --> 00:05:19.592
- [Ren] Bathroom.

00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:22.330
- What part did he screw up?

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.568
Cause I sure didn't notice
anything.

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.940
Oh, well I guess even
Ren can make a mistake.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.110
- [Takumi] Am I the only one who
heard it?

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.281
What's with this band anyway?

00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:34.421
(crowd chants)

00:05:37.761 --> 00:05:40.601
- Do you think Ren even noticed
you?

00:05:40.701 --> 00:05:41.769
It is a big crowd.

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:44.174
- (laughing) You can't see
anyone

00:05:44.274 --> 00:05:46.946
when you've got all those
lights shining in your face.

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:47.548
- [Nana Komatsu] Really?

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:48.683
- Ah, I don't know.

00:05:48.783 --> 00:05:50.520
I've never performed on a stage
this big.

00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:51.623
- [Nana Komatsu] He couldn't see
us?

00:05:51.723 --> 00:05:52.825
But we are in the front row

00:05:52.925 --> 00:05:54.528
so maybe he could just a
little...

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.601
Oh, the demon Lord strikes
again.

00:05:57.701 --> 00:05:59.505
- I bet it's an awesome
experience

00:05:59.605 --> 00:06:02.310
to sing in such a big
venue like this.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.014
- Huh?

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:07.621
(dramatic music)

00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:10.594
You can do it Nana and you will.

00:06:10.694 --> 00:06:13.733
Blast is gonna be bigger than
Trapnest.

00:06:24.054 --> 00:06:26.893
(phone rings)

00:06:29.297 --> 00:06:30.066
- Yeah?

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:31.569
- Hey Yasu, Nana's here.

00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:33.405
- Hmm.

00:06:33.506 --> 00:06:35.610
Have you guys finished
the concert already?

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:36.445
- [Ren] No, not yet.

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:38.315
Still gotta do the Encore.

00:06:38.415 --> 00:06:39.919
- [Yasu] That's cool.

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:40.486
Have a good one.

00:06:40.587 --> 00:06:42.290
- You knew she'd be here, didn't
you?

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.258
Why didn't you warn me?

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:45.062
- [Yasu] I thought it
would be a nice surprise.

00:06:45.162 --> 00:06:46.031
- Well, it worked.

00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:46.699
I got so freaked out,

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:48.603
I screwed up on stage
and had to cover it up.

00:06:48.703 --> 00:06:51.108
- (laughing) That's perfect.

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:52.243
I couldn't have asked for more.

00:06:52.343 --> 00:06:53.145
- It's not funny, man!

00:06:53.245 --> 00:06:56.251
Why'd she come to the show
way out here and not in Tokyo?

00:06:56.351 --> 00:06:57.020
Doesn't make any sense.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.790
And she's sitting in
the front row.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.261
- [Yasu] You can stage
dive right into her arms.

00:07:01.361 --> 00:07:02.163
- Yeah, right.

00:07:02.263 --> 00:07:02.998
I can't do that.

00:07:03.098 --> 00:07:05.570
- Ren. What are you doing in
there?

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.508
The concert isn't over yet.

00:07:07.608 --> 00:07:09.578
We gotta do the encore.

00:07:09.678 --> 00:07:10.079
- [Yasu] Go on.

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:12.250
I'll send you a text with
the cell phone number

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.218
of the girl Nana's with.

00:07:13.318 --> 00:07:14.588
- Huh?

00:07:14.688 --> 00:07:16.224
- If you wanna meet up with
Nana,

00:07:16.324 --> 00:07:18.095
give her a call on that number.

00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:23.907
- How can I face her again
after all that happened?

00:07:26.144 --> 00:07:28.415
- Cut the crap, Ren.

00:07:28.516 --> 00:07:30.987
I don't want any excuses.

00:07:32.423 --> 00:07:35.429
But if you don't want to see her
again,

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.601
I'll take her for myself.

00:07:39.572 --> 00:07:41.676
- [Takumi] Ren! Let's go!

00:07:41.776 --> 00:07:44.815
(crowd cheers)

00:07:54.234 --> 00:07:55.236
- Welcome back girls!

00:07:55.336 --> 00:07:57.674
I bet you're really hungry!

00:07:57.775 --> 00:07:59.545
Dinner's on the table.

00:08:02.016 --> 00:08:04.120
- [Nana Komatsu] They came
back on for an Encore.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.628
Two songs and Ren didn't
look our way once.

00:08:09.965 --> 00:08:11.669
- I'm so nervous, I'm starting
to sweat.

00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:14.107
Must be from having dinner
with such a cute girl.

00:08:14.207 --> 00:08:15.376
- Cute girl?

00:08:15.476 --> 00:08:16.211
- Geez dad.

00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:17.447
What a weird thing to say!

00:08:17.548 --> 00:08:18.583
You sound like some old pervert.

00:08:18.683 --> 00:08:19.885
- What? You want to talk weird.

00:08:19.985 --> 00:08:21.421
Look at what you're wearing.

00:08:21.522 --> 00:08:22.524
You look like Tarzan.

00:08:22.624 --> 00:08:23.425
- [Nami] Tarzan?

00:08:23.526 --> 00:08:25.196
- [Dad] Yeah, go back to the
jungle.

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:26.999
(girls laugh)

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.270
- [Nana Komatsu] It's time
I wake up from this dream

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.609
and face reality.

00:08:31.709 --> 00:08:33.813
Ren's a famous superstar now.

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:37.588
Because of that, he's
totally inaccessible.

00:08:38.923 --> 00:08:41.629
It makes me feel so powerless.

00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:43.766
- Huh?

00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:44.935
- That feels better.

00:08:45.035 --> 00:08:46.539
Bathroom's free if you want a
bath now.

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:48.242
I left a towel for you.

00:08:49.512 --> 00:08:51.381
- Okay. Thanks.

00:09:00.432 --> 00:09:01.636
- Ooh...

00:09:02.838 --> 00:09:06.211
(blow dryer whirs)

00:09:19.337 --> 00:09:22.511
Oops. I forgot to turn my phone
back on.

00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:23.913
(phone beeps)

00:09:24.013 --> 00:09:25.349
Hm...

00:09:25.449 --> 00:09:27.053
Yasu?

00:09:27.153 --> 00:09:27.855
That's weird.

00:09:27.955 --> 00:09:29.625
I wonder what he wants.

00:09:31.963 --> 00:09:32.598
Huh?

00:09:32.698 --> 00:09:35.804
(dramatic music)

00:09:44.822 --> 00:09:46.659
Nana! Big emergency!

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:47.961
- Hello? What are you doing?

00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:49.899
Can't you see I'm taking a bath
in here?

00:09:49.999 --> 00:09:50.600
- I know but this is serious!

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.069
- Another one of your murder
mysteries?

00:09:52.169 --> 00:09:53.338
- I got a text from Yasu.

00:09:53.438 --> 00:09:54.742
You gotta see what it says.

00:09:54.842 --> 00:09:56.211
- From Yasu?

00:09:57.981 --> 00:09:58.850
- I'm sorry, Nana.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.687
I had to turn my phone off for
the concert

00:10:00.787 --> 00:10:02.758
and I totally forgot to
turn it back on again.

00:10:02.858 --> 00:10:03.358
And now it's so late.

00:10:03.458 --> 00:10:05.764
What if he tried to call
and didn't leave a message?

00:10:05.864 --> 00:10:06.799
- What's going on here?

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:08.235
Why'd Yasu text you?

00:10:08.335 --> 00:10:08.803
- I don't know.

00:10:08.903 --> 00:10:11.474
Maybe Yasu gave Ren my
number and that's why

00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:14.480
but I thought no one was
in touch with Ren anymore.

00:10:14.582 --> 00:10:15.249
I don't get it.

00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:16.451
What should we do?

00:10:20.927 --> 00:10:23.432
- [Nana Osaki] Call Yasu.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.949
(phone rings)

00:10:32.618 --> 00:10:33.085
- [Yasu] Hello?

00:10:33.185 --> 00:10:35.189
- Hi there Yasu. It's me.

00:10:35.289 --> 00:10:35.957
- Oh, hi Nana.

00:10:36.057 --> 00:10:38.696
Sorry I gave out your
number without asking first.

00:10:38.796 --> 00:10:39.932
- [Nana Komatsu] It's all right.

00:10:40.032 --> 00:10:41.468
- So did Ren call yet?

00:10:41.569 --> 00:10:42.069
- [Nana Komatsu] I'm not sure.

00:10:42.169 --> 00:10:43.873
- Hmm. You check your missed
calls?

00:10:43.973 --> 00:10:45.242
- My phone was off for the
concert

00:10:45.342 --> 00:10:47.313
and I forgot to switch it back
on again.

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:49.585
Do you think he tried
to call when it was off?

00:10:49.685 --> 00:10:50.520
- [Yasu] Who knows?

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.423
- [Nana Komatsu] What should I
do?

00:10:52.524 --> 00:10:53.760
- [Yasu] Just hang in there.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.262
I bet he'll call at some point.

00:10:55.362 --> 00:10:56.364
- [Nana Komatsu] Really?

00:10:56.464 --> 00:11:00.472
- Probably. I did light
a fire under his ass.

00:11:00.573 --> 00:11:02.343
- Damn you, Baldy.

00:11:03.178 --> 00:11:04.815
I don't know what you told Ren

00:11:04.915 --> 00:11:06.752
but you should mind your own
business.

00:11:06.852 --> 00:11:09.592
I have got nothing to
say to him right now.

00:11:09.692 --> 00:11:10.794
- Yeah. Okay.

00:11:10.894 --> 00:11:12.029
But let me clear something up.

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:13.365
He was the one who called me

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:15.971
right after he saw you at the
concert.

00:11:16.071 --> 00:11:16.872
- Hmm?

00:11:16.973 --> 00:11:18.275
- I just gave him Nana's number.

00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:18.910
That's all.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.379
If you've got nothing to say to
Ren

00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:22.383
then tell him that yourself.

00:11:22.483 --> 00:11:25.022
You still have the key to the
place where you and Ren lived.

00:11:25.122 --> 00:11:26.892
You still have the key to the
pad lock

00:11:26.993 --> 00:11:28.395
he wears around his neck.

00:11:28.495 --> 00:11:31.134
If you don't want them,
then just throw them away.

00:11:31.234 --> 00:11:34.508
You can put an end to all this
right now.

00:11:34.608 --> 00:11:36.779
Put yourself in his shoes.

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:38.850
His heart forever chained to a
woman

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.687
he can never have again.

00:11:40.787 --> 00:11:43.960
(dramatic music)

00:11:51.542 --> 00:11:52.844
- All right then.

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:56.519
Go ahead and give me his number.

00:11:56.619 --> 00:11:58.455
I'm not waiting any longer.

00:12:09.444 --> 00:12:11.949
(phone beeps)

00:12:12.049 --> 00:12:14.454
- [Yasu] If you don't
want to see her again,

00:12:14.555 --> 00:12:16.157
I'll take her for myself.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:29.718
(doorbell rings)

00:12:29.818 --> 00:12:32.089
(knocking on door)

00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:34.227
- Ren?

00:12:40.607 --> 00:12:42.176
Hmm?

00:12:42.276 --> 00:12:43.579
Hey, what are you smoking?

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:45.482
Give me a drag, will ya?

00:12:46.484 --> 00:12:48.690
- Yeah. As if.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.459
- Oh, well, nevermind.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.862
I'm too awake to fall asleep.

00:12:51.962 --> 00:12:54.333
So I'm going to Takumi's
room to play some cards.

00:12:54.434 --> 00:12:55.102
Wanna come?

00:12:55.202 --> 00:12:56.438
- Playing cards again?

00:12:56.539 --> 00:12:59.444
- Yeah. We're gonna play a game
of sevens.

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:00.045
I know.

00:13:00.145 --> 00:13:01.615
We're such cool rock stars.

00:13:01.716 --> 00:13:03.886
- (laughing) It's okay.

00:13:03.986 --> 00:13:05.255
I'll pass.

00:13:05.355 --> 00:13:05.857
- Mm...

00:13:05.957 --> 00:13:07.126
- Since I'm so punk.

00:13:07.226 --> 00:13:08.462
- Oh, come on Ren.

00:13:08.563 --> 00:13:11.034
It's no fun unless you're there
with me.

00:13:11.134 --> 00:13:12.804
Takumi and Noaki are no good at
cards

00:13:12.904 --> 00:13:15.275
so it's boring playing with just
them.

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:16.812
I hate knowing I'm gonna win all
the time

00:13:16.912 --> 00:13:18.048
against those losers.

00:13:18.148 --> 00:13:19.651
- Sorry, but I'm beat.

00:13:19.752 --> 00:13:21.020
I think I'm gonna crash.

00:13:21.121 --> 00:13:22.724
Nighty, night.

00:13:22.824 --> 00:13:24.327
- So lame.

00:13:24.427 --> 00:13:25.864
Whatever.

00:13:27.968 --> 00:13:28.736
- Reira?

00:13:28.836 --> 00:13:29.772
- What?

00:13:29.872 --> 00:13:31.542
- Your voice sounded rough
tonight.

00:13:31.642 --> 00:13:33.378
Is everything okay?

00:13:34.782 --> 00:13:37.988
- Everything's golden. 16 shows
to go.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.653
(phone rings)

00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:12.924
- Who is it?

00:14:13.024 --> 00:14:14.393
- It's Nana.

00:14:15.028 --> 00:14:18.034
(Ren coughs)

00:14:21.575 --> 00:14:22.911
Hello to you too.

00:14:23.011 --> 00:14:25.550
Glad to hear you're doing so
well.

00:14:26.417 --> 00:14:28.321
- Yeah.

00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:30.459
- [Nana Osaki] There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.629
Can we meet?

00:14:33.298 --> 00:14:34.433
- Sure.

00:14:34.535 --> 00:14:36.539
- [Nana Osaki] Where are you
now?

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:37.974
- In my hotel room.

00:14:38.074 --> 00:14:38.910
- [Nana Osaki] Alone?

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.212
- Yeah.

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:42.183
- [Nana Osaki] Is it okay if I
come there?

00:14:42.283 --> 00:14:42.483
- Sure.

00:14:42.584 --> 00:14:45.690
- [Nana Osaki] Or we can meet
somewhere else if you want?

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.159
- No, here would be better.

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:49.898
It doesn't look like I
can go out right now.

00:14:49.998 --> 00:14:51.434
- Then I'll be right there.

00:14:51.535 --> 00:14:54.240
Just give me your hotel and room
number.

00:15:23.833 --> 00:15:25.068
All those fans.

00:15:25.168 --> 00:15:27.006
I guess they found out
where the band was staying.

00:15:27.106 --> 00:15:29.010
No wonder he couldn't leave.

00:15:51.722 --> 00:15:54.661
(elevator dings)

00:15:57.601 --> 00:15:58.869
- [Nana Komatsu] What's Nana
gonna do

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.540
when she sees Ren again?

00:16:01.274 --> 00:16:03.178
What's she gonna say?

00:16:04.413 --> 00:16:07.253
Sometimes she can be so
stubborn.

00:16:07.353 --> 00:16:09.223
I hope she doesn't screw things
up.

00:16:09.323 --> 00:16:10.459
I'm so worried about her,

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.764
I don't think I can get to
sleep.

00:16:18.743 --> 00:16:21.682
(elevator dings)

00:16:24.153 --> 00:16:25.389
- Hmm?

00:16:30.165 --> 00:16:31.434
Hmm.

00:16:33.238 --> 00:16:34.574
How's it going?

00:16:35.543 --> 00:16:36.745
- Hold on. You work here?

00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:38.649
Where's your pass?

00:16:39.718 --> 00:16:40.920
- Oh, my pass.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.289
I always forget I need it.

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:45.830
It's such a pain to have to
dig it out every single time.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:46.799
- Hmm.

00:16:46.899 --> 00:16:50.840
- Oh, I must have left it
in my room when I went out.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.675
Let me get it.

00:16:51.775 --> 00:16:52.343
- Oh no, you don't.

00:16:52.443 --> 00:16:54.080
This area is off limits to the
public.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.550
The manager warned us.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.554
Said the fans be trying to sneak
in.

00:16:57.654 --> 00:16:59.156
Don't you know how much
trouble you groupies

00:16:59.256 --> 00:17:00.660
caused a band with your
obsessive behavior?

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.864
- [Nana Osaki] I ain't no
groupie.

00:17:02.964 --> 00:17:04.768
- [Worker] Now get out, go home.

00:17:07.206 --> 00:17:09.210
- It's okay. I asked her to come
up.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.178
So let her in.

00:17:10.278 --> 00:17:12.116
Here, let's keep it hush hush.
Huh?

00:17:12.216 --> 00:17:14.655
- Okay. Sorry, man.

00:17:24.941 --> 00:17:27.681
(door beeps)

00:17:37.634 --> 00:17:40.673
- Your security is pretty
intense.

00:17:40.773 --> 00:17:41.374
I'm sorry.

00:17:41.474 --> 00:17:44.246
Maybe I shouldn't have
come here to see you.

00:17:55.235 --> 00:17:56.437
Ren...

00:17:57.874 --> 00:17:58.408
Let me go.

00:17:58.509 --> 00:18:01.014
I didn't come here to get
back together with you.

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:03.251
- [Ren] I missed you so much.

00:18:03.351 --> 00:18:06.391
(gentle music)

00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:16.477
(both sob)

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:25.830
- [Nana Osaki] What am I doing?

00:18:30.372 --> 00:18:32.977
- You sure know how to be
sneaky, Yasu.

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:35.817
You knew that once you put
the idea in Nana's head

00:18:35.917 --> 00:18:36.852
of giving the keys back to Ren,

00:18:36.952 --> 00:18:39.958
she'd go right ahead and
do something about it.

00:18:40.058 --> 00:18:40.593
- Ah that's pon.

00:18:40.693 --> 00:18:41.595
- But if she gives them back,

00:18:41.695 --> 00:18:43.331
it'll be over between them
forever.

00:18:43.431 --> 00:18:45.135
- Yeah. But if she really
thought it was over

00:18:45.235 --> 00:18:48.441
she wouldn't go return the
keys in person, would she?

00:18:48.542 --> 00:18:50.713
And now that they got an
excuse to see each other

00:18:50.813 --> 00:18:51.380
they can go ahead

00:18:51.481 --> 00:18:53.586
and do what men and women
naturally do together.

00:18:53.686 --> 00:18:55.556
- You know, Shin, not that I
care,

00:18:55.656 --> 00:18:57.827
but you're becoming quite a wise
ass.

00:18:57.927 --> 00:18:59.296
So shut it.

00:18:59.965 --> 00:19:00.700
- Oh look, ron!

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.971
Does that mean I win?

00:19:03.071 --> 00:19:03.606
- He's good.

00:19:03.706 --> 00:19:06.077
- No way! You played us for
suckers!

00:19:06.177 --> 00:19:07.580
That's totally not a cool thing
to do.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.785
- I never knew Mahjong was so
much fun.

00:19:09.885 --> 00:19:11.387
Let's play with four people next
time.

00:19:11.487 --> 00:19:13.759
We could ask Nana. Does she
play?

00:19:13.859 --> 00:19:14.661
- Yeah, she does.

00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:17.266
When Ren was around, the four
of us would play together.

00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:19.905
- We should ask Ren over
the next time we play.

00:19:20.005 --> 00:19:20.640
- You're kidding!

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.075
You mean I'd get to meet Ren?

00:19:22.176 --> 00:19:22.911
That's awesome!

00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:24.447
- He's our friend. Not yours.

00:19:24.548 --> 00:19:25.616
It's not fair, Yasu.

00:19:25.716 --> 00:19:28.154
You always get to meet
up secretly with Ren.

00:19:28.254 --> 00:19:30.560
Why am I always the one left
out?

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.198
- [Yasu] Because Ren's afraid to
see you.

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:33.799
- Huh?

00:19:33.899 --> 00:19:38.542
- So he does feel guilty
about leaving Blast.

00:19:38.642 --> 00:19:41.080
- When Trapnest first
approached him with the offer

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.184
he turned them down.

00:19:43.284 --> 00:19:45.656
Then Takumi called and
asked me to talk to Ren.

00:19:45.756 --> 00:19:48.796
I'm the one who persuaded
him he should go for it.

00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:51.869
But he still feels like he
abandoned us.

00:19:54.306 --> 00:19:55.576
- I don't know why it's still
bugging him.

00:19:55.676 --> 00:19:57.446
It's all in the past now.

00:19:57.547 --> 00:19:59.350
That's not like him at all.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.622
- Actually, that's exactly like
him.

00:20:01.722 --> 00:20:02.924
I wonder if someone so sensitive

00:20:03.024 --> 00:20:06.264
is gonna last in the world
of major record labels.

00:20:06.364 --> 00:20:07.901
It worries me.

00:20:08.001 --> 00:20:09.236
- Hmm.

00:20:09.336 --> 00:20:12.510
In that case, I'm gonna
send him an invitation

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.081
to a Mahjong battle against us.

00:20:15.182 --> 00:20:15.983
- Yay!

00:20:16.083 --> 00:20:17.419
- He'll be so happy, he'll cry.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.392
- So Yasu earlier on
the phone, you told Nana

00:20:20.492 --> 00:20:23.198
that you lit a fire
under Ren's butt.

00:20:23.298 --> 00:20:23.899
Was it a trick?

00:20:23.999 --> 00:20:26.605
Tell me 'cause I wanna
learn from myself.

00:20:26.705 --> 00:20:28.007
- I don't really have any tricks

00:20:28.107 --> 00:20:29.243
that are worth mentioning.

00:20:29.343 --> 00:20:31.548
Haven't you figured out
how stupid I am?

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:32.917
- But you're smart.

00:20:33.017 --> 00:20:34.286
Not at all like Nobu.

00:20:34.386 --> 00:20:37.025
- It's not about how
smart you are.

00:20:39.063 --> 00:20:40.833
You're still just a kid, Shin.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.418
- [Nana Komatsu] Back then,

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.391
I thought I'd never want
to fall in love again.

00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:59.136
But that night things
changed for me.

00:20:59.236 --> 00:21:01.842
I decided I wanted
to dream again.

00:21:03.378 --> 00:21:07.185
I wanted to love someone no
matter how painful it might be.

00:21:07.286 --> 00:21:10.593
And while I was praying
for your happiness, Nana,

00:21:10.693 --> 00:21:14.601
I regained my own sense
of hope for the future.
