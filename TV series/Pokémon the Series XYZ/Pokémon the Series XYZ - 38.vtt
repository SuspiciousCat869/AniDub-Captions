Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.553

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.522
MEOWTH: Stomping all over
our feelings, that's what.

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:36.723
JAMES: Since when are you
two cheering for the Twerp?

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.259
MEOWTH: Since we decided
we don't like this!

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:42.896
JESSIE:
The Twerp's our rival, not his!

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.364
If he loses to anybody,
it'll be us, not him!

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.604
JESSIE: From now on,
we're the Twerp's cheerleaders!

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:52.305
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH: Rah!

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.940

CLEMONT: On the other hand,

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.689
Ash's last two Pokémon haven't
even been in a battle yet.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.092
You could say Ash
has the advantage!

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:14.261
SERENA: Yeah. He'll be fine.

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:17.164

battlefield. Use Rain Dance!

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:55.168

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:08.148
