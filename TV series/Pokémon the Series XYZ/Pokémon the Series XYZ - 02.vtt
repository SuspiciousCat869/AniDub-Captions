00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:05.606
ASH: Hey,
Professor Sycamore!

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:08.509
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: It's
really good to see you, Ash.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.409
ASH: We want you to
check something out.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.512
PIKACHU: [GREETING]
BONNIE: Here, look!

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.916
ASH: We just discovered it the
other day, but it's not listed

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.085
in the Pokédex. So we figured
you might know what it is.

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:21.788
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
That is a new one to me

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.292
And you couldn't
find it in the Pokédex?

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:26.426
I wonder if it
might be a new kind

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:29.363
ASH: You really think it could
be?!

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:30.097
CLEMONT: If it is,
that's amazing!

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.234
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Could you
turn it around so I can see

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:34.735
‐it from all sides?
‐BONNIE: 'Kay!

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:38.972
CLEMONT: He's talking
about Squishy, not you.

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:41.341
BONNIE: Oops! I didn't know

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.483
I've never seen it before.

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:51.051
BONNIE: It feels
really squishy..

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.519
That's why I named it Squishy!

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.455
SQUISHY: [HAPPY]

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.124
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
I'll look into it on my end.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:58.258
If I find anything out,
I'll let you know.

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.161
In the meantime,
keep an eye on Squishy.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.130
ASH: Sure, got it!

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.066
JESSIE: So cute!
They call it Squishy.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.669
JAMES: It's the Pokémon
those red suits called Z.

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:10.470
MEOWTH: It's gotta be big
news if they reported it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.773
to Professor Sycamore!

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:15.309
JESSIE: So if it's a new kind of
Pokémon, does that mean

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.244
we'll get to give
it a name once we catch it?

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:18.879
Like
"Beautiful Jess"?

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.614
MEOWTH: Or "Meowth Junior"!

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:21.515
JAMES: "Cool James"
has a certain ring

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.319
‐JESSIE: And now, tally‐ho!
‐JAMES: Let's go!

SERENA: I know!
Just leave it to me!

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.910
I'll make your bag way better!

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.044
BONNIE:
You will?

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:52.012
BONNIE: Yay!

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.755
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.192
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:09.062
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

SQUISHY: [RELAXED]

SERENA: Squishy sure loves
the sun, doesn't it?

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:20.600
CLEMONT: I wouldn't be surprised
if Squishy's actually converting

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.002
sunlight to use as energy.

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:23.003
ASH: Oh, yeah

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.545
ASH: So Squishy must absorb
sunlight instead of eating.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.453
JESSIE: Sunlight for food?
So it lives on an empty stomach!

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:41.822
JAMES: What a
curious little Pokémon.

00:03:43.457 --> 00:03:45.859
MEOWTH: If we research that
rascal, maybe we can figure out

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.027
how to cut out
needing grub, too.

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:50.530
JAMES: No food? How economical!

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.165
JESSIE: But that means
there'll be no more yummy

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.333
chocolate cake for me

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.102
MEOWTH: Yeah. No dessert.

00:03:56.036 --> 00:03:58.672
JESSIE: SO?! Operation Squishy

00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:01.174
Catch is sure to place us in the
Team Rocket legends category!

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.242
JAMES, MEOWTH: Yes, ma'am!

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:05.579

used to everyone.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.519

hard on that.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.301

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.348

before!

POKEDEX: Quilladin. The Spiny
Armor Pokémon, and the

00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:34.167
evolved form of Chespin. The
hard shell covering Quilladin's

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:37.771
body is so tough a direct hit
from a large truck wouldn't even

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:39.873
dent it. Quilladin uses this
shell to deflect foes' attacks,

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:42.742
and it strikes back with its
sharp quills.
