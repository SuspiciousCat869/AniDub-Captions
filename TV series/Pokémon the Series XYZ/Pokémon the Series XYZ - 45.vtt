00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:03.871
NARRATOR: The rebuilding
of Lumiose City continues,

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:06.840
and at the same time,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.142
our heroes are thinking
about what their futures hold...

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:10.477
and of course,
that includes Serena.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:24.358
PALERMO: All right.

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:26.793
PALERMO: Keep on your
journey to your heart's content.

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.896
And once you're all
ready for the next step,

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:30.364
you just give me a call.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.236
BONNIE: Hey, look at that!

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.640
ANNOUNCER: The light of hope
even illuminated Prism Tower!

ANNOUNCER: There are
still many wounds to be healed

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:46.947
in Lumiose City, but I'm
sure this light will guide us

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:49.416
as we continue our recovery!

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.985

Prism Tower was great!

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.721

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:32.993
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:35.529

She's great, isn't she?
CHESPIE: [AGREEMENT]

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:34.574
JAMES: A Pokémon Showcase here?
That is a puzzler, isn't it?

00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:36.877

Now, Gourgeist.
Let's educate them!

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.199

JESSIE: It's like I've
found my true calling!

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:47.407
Perhaps I should
remain here after all...

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.075
and aim for the
title of Kalos Queen!

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.512
JAMES: Don't forget your
day job, your highness...

She's been a big help.

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:53.106
The way she's been taking
care of my boy and girl...

00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:56.676
Serena's so
important to all of us!

00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:59.012

been helping out a little.

SERENA: Mom? Why not
go and relax for a while?

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:01.915
I'll make some dinner.

00:08:03.183 --> 00:08:05.318
GRACE: You'll make it?

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.420
SERENA: That's right.
You might not believe it,

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.823
but I've turned
into quite a good cook.

to do and it's done!

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.565
SERENA: All right.
Clemont, you take in the bread.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.533
CLEMONT: Sure!

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:22.235

MEYER:
So, Grace, Serena's performance,

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:28.675
did you get a
chance to see it today?

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:29.609
GRACE: Yes!

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:34.280
Uh, I've been worried about
how my daughter has been doing

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.316
but I guess there was no reason.
It was wonderful.

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:38.785
MEYER:
And it was all Serena's idea.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.355
GRACE: Her idea?

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.456

You have a wonderful daughter.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.725

heading back to the hotel.

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:02.308
SERENA: Wait! Mom? Can I...

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:04.010
Can I stay with you
at the hotel tonight?

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:21.461
GRACE: Serena?

00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:23.029
Is there something
you'd like to talk about?

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.966
GRACE: Staying in a hotel with
me is not your usual style...

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:31.004
GRACE: What's on your mind?
I'm all ears...

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.273
SERENA: See, Mom...

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:36.543
Today... on stage...

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:41.047
I finally realized why
I truly love performing.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.451
SERENA:
And I understand a little better

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:46.953
what I was missing before.

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:51.157
SERENA: Looking at all
the smiles in the crowd

00:09:53.226 --> 00:09:55.562
and how happy they all
looked made me realize...

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:58.998
what I really want is to
make even more people smile,

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.333
like Aria.

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:04.337
But then, if I do that,

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:05.672
I'm afraid I'll lose
what I gained on my journey.

00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:09.642
GRACE:
Well, I don't agree with that.

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:12.278
Is that all your
journey meant to you?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.817
I can see that you've changed,
but your experiences?

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:19.185
They're always going
to be a part of you.

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:22.188
GRACE: Have more confidence.

00:10:23.857 --> 00:10:25.225
SERENA: Momma.

00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:28.661
GRACE: Don't forget you're
your mother's daughter, right?

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:34.601
GRACE:
Okay, let's get some sleep.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.603
We've got an early day tomorrow!

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.375
CLEMONT:
Are you leaving already?

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:43.209
BONNIE: You should stay longer!

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.446
GRACE: Serena's doing fine.
That's what's important.

00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:50.016
SERENA: Thanks, Mom!

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.151
GRACE: Let me know once you've
decided what we talked about.

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:52.986
SERENA: 'Kay.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.222
GRACE: All right, gang,

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:57.557
come visit me whenever
you're in Vaniville Town.

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:01.027
The door's always unlocked!

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:02.428
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]
ASH: Great!

00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:03.963
BONNIE: Yippee yay!

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:05.965
GRACE: Bye, Serena!

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.338
SHAUNA:
So, should we all head over

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:14.908
to Professor Sycamore's lab?
Whaddya think?

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:16.776
TIERNO: Nope! I'm gonna work
on my new dance with Serena!

00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:20.713
SHAUNA: You promised...

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:23.249
TREVOR: Since all the wild
Pokémon left Lumiose City,

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:25.185
We've been asked to help out.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.220
Which means, we've got
a big job ahead of us!

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.689
ASH: Awesome! You'll do great!

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.824
SHAUNA: Well then,
we'll be heading out, too.

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:33.760
TREVOR: Take care of yourselves,
everyone!

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.363
TIERNO: Ow! Okay, okay!
My ear's gonna fall off!

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:38.731
SAWYER:
All right, I need to go as well.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.501
ASH: So what's next?
Where are you going?

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:44.637
SAWYER: To what's left
of Lysandre's offices.

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:46.072
Steven asked me to help him out.

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:50.710
SAWYER: It seems the Giant Rock
has disappeared before,

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.213
and then reappeared.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.682
So Steven believes
the Giant Rock

00:11:55.682 --> 00:11:58.284
may not have completely
disappeared this time either.

00:11:58.284 --> 00:11:59.552
And that's what he's
working on right now!

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:02.255
SAWYER: See, I got this
Key Stone from Steven.

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:05.592
Maybe we can be
of some use to him.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.695
I'd like to pay
him back for his help.

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:10.096
ASH: Sounds great.

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:10.964
SAWYER: Ash?

00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:14.133
SAWYER: Next time we meet,
let's battle, 'kay?

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:17.804
In the meantime,
I'll keep gaining ex ence!

00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:19.639
ASH: Sure! It's a deal.

00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:22.175
SAWYER: I'm winning next time!

00:12:22.175 --> 00:12:23.309
ASH: Yeah? So am I!

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:27.714
SAWYER: See you.
BONNIE: Bye bye!

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:29.949
CLEMONT: See you soon.

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:30.883
SERENA: Take care of yourself!

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:31.751
SAWYER: Right!

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:40.793
CLEMONT: I guess I should be
heading back to the Lumiose Gym.

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:43.229
I've still got
more cleaning up to do.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.199
BONNIE: I wanna help!
DEDENNE: [EXCITED]

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:47.667
CLEMONT: What about you?

00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:49.369
ASH: Yeah, what should I do...

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:50.837
What are you gonna do?

00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:52.071
SERENA: Me? I don't know.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.941
ASH:
You can stay with me, you know!

00:12:57.944 --> 00:12:58.745
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"Who's that Pokémon?"

00:13:04.217 --> 00:13:05.652
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"It's Hoppip!"

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.261
ASH: No way! All right!

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:18.331
They say they're gonna
reopen the airport soon!

00:13:18.331 --> 00:13:19.899
PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.477
SERENA: Look at that!

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.079
Lumiose City is
almost back to normal!

00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:34.580
ASH: Yeah.

00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:40.086
ASH: Whoa, Serena, check it out!

00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:43.089
SERENA: So cute!

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:57.470
PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:01.074
ASH: MAN this is good!

00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:02.408
SERENA: Lumiose's famous
foods are back, too.

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:04.277
ASH, PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.413
ASH: Serena?

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:10.216
SERENA: What?

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:11.150
ASH: Let's have a battle!

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.686
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]
SERENA: Now?

00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:17.056
SERENA: Wait!

00:14:18.091 --> 00:14:18.825
ASH: Come on, this way!
SERENA: Ash?

00:14:23.663 --> 00:14:25.765
ASH: I remember this.

00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:27.967
When I first
came to Lumiose City,

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.035
I battled with
Clemont right here.

00:14:29.769 --> 00:14:31.371
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:33.439
SERENA:
Right here? What do you know!

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:35.007
ASH:
That was a really long time ago.

00:14:36.142 --> 00:14:38.378
ASH: Thing is, when I'm worried,

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:39.812
having a Pokémon
battle always helps.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.615
Makes me feel great!

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.953
ASH: You'll feel better fast!

00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:48.721
PIKACHU: [ENCOURAGING]

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:49.756
SERENA:
Maybe you're right. Know what?

00:14:50.957 --> 00:14:52.425
I've never had a proper
battle with you before.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:56.629
SERENA: Okay, let's do it!

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:57.997
ASH: Awesome!

00:15:02.535 --> 00:15:04.537
SERENA: Now, Braixen, let's go!

00:15:07.607 --> 00:15:10.676
BRAIXEN: [APPEARING]

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:12.712
ASH: Going with Braixen, huh?
You're up, Pikachu!

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:16.215
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:15:22.722 --> 00:15:24.690
ASH:
'Kay, P hu, use Quick Attack!

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.492
PIKACHU: [QUICK ATTACK MOVE]

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:27.627
BRAIXEN: [IMPACT]

00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:30.863
SERENA: Oh no, Braixen!

00:15:31.564 --> 00:15:32.732
BRAIXEN: [DETERMINED]

00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:34.567
SERENA: Pikachu's so fast...

00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:36.903
ASH: Let's keep it up.
Iron Tail, let's go!

00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:38.638
PIKACHU: [IRON TAIL MOVE]

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:41.307
SERENA: Defense!

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:42.575
BRAIXEN: [EXERTION]

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:45.111
BRAIXEN: [PAINED]

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:49.782
SERENA: Braixen!

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:51.918
BRAIXEN: [DETERMINED]

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:56.889
SERENA: I know what to do.
Just act like we're re‐hearsing!

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:59.859
BRAIXEN: [AGREEMENT]
SERENA: All right, Flamethrower!

00:15:59.859 --> 00:16:01.761
BRAIXEN: [FLAMETHROWER MOVE]

00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:03.663
ASH: Dodge it, quick!
PIKACHU: [EXERTION]

00:16:03.663 --> 00:16:07.934
SERENA: Jump up!
BRAIXEN: [EXERTION]

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:10.136
PIKACHU: [SURPRISED]

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:12.538
SERENA: Braixen, use Scratch!

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:15.274
BRAIXEN: [SCRATCH MOVE]
ASH: Iron Tail, let's go!

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:17.343
PIKACHU: [IRON TAIL MOVE]
BRAIXEN: [EXERTION]

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:19.178
SERENA: Braixen, use Fire Blast!

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:20.279
BRAIXEN: [FIRE BLAST MOVE]

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:21.347
PIKACHU: [SURPRISED]

00:16:22.048 --> 00:16:23.583
SERENA: Yeah. All right!

00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:24.951
BRAIXEN: [EXCITED]

00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:26.319
ASH: Pikachu!

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.154
PIKACHU: [REASSURING]

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:29.989
ASH: Way to go, Serena.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.123
You and Braixen
make an awesome team!

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:33.826
SERENA: Thanks!

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:35.661
ASH: Your Pokémon are strong.

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.897
All of them!
Braixen and Pancham.

00:16:37.897 --> 00:16:38.898
And don't forget Sylveon...

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.502
ASH: 'Cour know...

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:44.237
you know Greninja and I had our
share of problems for a while.

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:46.973
But then I figured it out.

00:16:46.973 --> 00:16:47.974
You can't do
anything by yourself.

00:16:49.275 --> 00:16:50.810
ASH: It's because
you're with Pokémon

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.912
who support you that
really makes you do your best.

00:16:52.912 --> 00:16:54.514
SERENA: Oh, Ash...

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.015
ASH: I'll tell you one thing.

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.383
I'll always be
cheering you on and on!

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.585
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:16:59.585 --> 00:17:01.454
SERENA: Oh, Ash...
Pikachu... Thank you.

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:07.426
PANCHAM: [APPEARING]
SYLVEON: [APPEARING]

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:12.632
SERENA: I'm really not alone.
You're all with me.

00:17:12.632 --> 00:17:14.300
BRAIXEN: [AGREEMENT]
PANCHAM: [AGREEMENT]

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.102
SYLVEON: [AGREEMENT]

00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:17.904
SERENA:
Braixen? Pancham? Sylveon?

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.406
I know it may not
be an easy journey,

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:23.743
but will you take it with me?

00:17:23.743 --> 00:17:25.177
PANCHAM: [AFFIRMATIVE]
BRAIXEN: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:26.746
SYLVEON: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:17:26.746 --> 00:17:27.914
SERENA:
Thanks so much. All of you.

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:32.785
SERENA:
Ash? I know what I want to do!

00:17:39.325 --> 00:17:41.561
PALERMO: So, we meet again.
I've been waiting.

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:43.896
Have you found an answer yet?

00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:46.999
SERENA: Yes, ma'am. I sure have.

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:48.734
PALERMO: All right. What is it?

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.676
SERENA: Forgive me ma'am!

00:17:56.676 --> 00:17:57.577
SERENA:
But‐ I can't go with you.

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:03.382
SERENA: Aria helped me.

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.051
She really taught
me that my smile

00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:06.052
could give other
people strength.

00:18:07.687 --> 00:18:08.854
SERENA: I experienced
that for the first time.

00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:12.091
Even though they'd
been through so much,

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:14.627
people smiled when they
watched my performance.

00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:18.130
That's what made me decide.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.300
I want lots of different
people to see me perform!

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.735
SERENA: That's what I
have to do to really grow.

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:26.138
If I were to go
and study with you,

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:27.873
I'd depend on you too much.
That's not what I need!

00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:32.011
SERENA:
You see? They're my friends.

00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:35.815
I want to see lots of places
with my Pokémon! Other regions.

00:18:35.815 --> 00:18:38.184
And I'm certain we'll all
experience things together

00:18:38.184 --> 00:18:40.820
that will really help
us to grow and mature.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.288
BRAIXEN: [AGREEMENT]
PANCHAM: [AGREEMENT]

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.090
SYLVEON: [AGREEMENT]

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.458
SERENA: It's probably
not what you expected,

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:46.492
but I've made my decision.

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:50.963
PALERMO: Well, that's a shame.
I want the best for you, too.

00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:55.034
You're the very first person who
has ever turned down an offer

00:18:55.034 --> 00:18:56.402
of help from me.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.306
PALERMO: Have you
decided where you'll go?

00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:03.476
SERENA: Uh... No, not yet.

00:19:04.844 --> 00:19:06.646
PALERMO: Well...
how about the Hoenn region?

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.547
SERENA: Hoenn?

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:10.449
PALERMO: There they
have Pokémon Contests,

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:12.752
which are different
than Showcases.

00:19:12.752 --> 00:19:15.187
PALERMO: Pokémon Contests
would be just the thing.

00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:16.489
A great way to
gain good experience.

00:19:18.424 --> 00:19:20.626
SERENA: Great! I'll do it!

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:23.262
PALERMO:
Very good. When you return,

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:24.830
maybe you can show me
everything you learned

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.799
while you were there.

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:28.167
I'm looking forward to seeing
all the ways that you'll grow.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.505
PALERMO: Didn't I tell you?

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:34.640
My dear, I'm a big fan of yours!

00:19:37.977 --> 00:19:39.912
SERENA: Thanks!
I promise I'll come back!

00:19:50.723 --> 00:19:54.193
SERENA:
Ta‐da! Attention, please!

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:56.762
All right,
I've decided I'm going to go

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:57.763
on a performance‐
training journey!

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:01.000
BONNIE:
You're gonna leave us, too?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.334
DEDENNE: [SURPRISED]
CHESPIN: [HEARTBROKEN]

00:20:03.903 --> 00:20:06.505
SERENA: Yeah.
I realize I need to learn a lot

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:07.673
in order to grow as
a Pokémon performer,

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:10.009
so I've gotta go.

00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:11.477
There are so many places to see!

00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:15.081
SERENA: It sounds like the
Hoenn region is a great place

00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:16.916
for Pokémon Contests,
so I'm going there first.

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:20.286
ASH: That's great! Good for you.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.355
SERENA: Thanks, Ash!

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:25.291
I'm not sure where it will
lead me, but I'll do my best.

00:20:26.192 --> 00:20:28.094
We'll do our best!

00:20:28.094 --> 00:20:29.328
BRAIXEN/PANCHAM/SYLVEON:
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:31.163
SERENA: And who knows?

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:33.232
Maybe we can help lots of
other people find their dreams!

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.570
SERENA: I think...
No, I'm sure I can do that!

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.738
ASH: Yeah. Go for it!

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:41.540
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.609
NARRATOR: Following a
Pokémon battle with Ash,

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.911
Serena has decided
what path she will follow.

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.447
And so, the day when Ash,

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:50.716
Clemont and Bonnie set
off to find their own futures

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:53.552
is coming soon,
as the journey continues!
