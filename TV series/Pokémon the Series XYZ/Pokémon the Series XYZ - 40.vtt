00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:07.674
NARRATOR: Lumiose City
is under a vicious attack

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.476
by the sudden appearance

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.111
of destructive
creeping vines everywhere:

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.749
an attack masterminded
by Lysandre and Team Flare,

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.417
using the Legendary
Pokémon Zygarde.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.021
While Clemont, Bonnie,
and Serena were heading over

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.023
to Prism Tower,
Ash was taken captive there!

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.761
And Squishy, seeing the
destruction of Lumiose City,

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.797
has transformed into Zygarde!

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.466
Now, it stands
before the other Zygarde,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.602
who is under
Team Flare's control,

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.204
in order to stop
its vicious rampage.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:41.208
B ZYGARDE 50%/ZYGARDE SQUISHY:
[ROARING]

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.388
ASH: Wow, Squishy... is Zygarde?

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:00.894
ZYGARDE SQUISHY: [ROARING]

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.196
LYSANDRE: Yes.
Zygarde is the Legendary Pokémon

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.299
who watches over the world

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.467
and punishes those who
dare to disrupt its order.

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:12.239
LYSANDRE: You are
witnessing the rage of Zygarde,

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:14.241
as well as Team Flare.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.842
This world will
start over again!

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.680
LYSANDRE: Soon enough,
the other Zygarde

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.748
will come
around to our way of thinking.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.117
Then, it will
turn red with rage!

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:26.587
ASH: No, you're wrong!

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.121
ASH: Squishy would
never think like that!

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.524
PIKACHU: [DEFIANT]

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.859
ASH: Alain! What's going
on with all of this?!

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.728
Say something!

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.166
JESSIE: Look at that!

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.034
At the center of the
vines winding their way

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.503
through Lumiose
are two giant Pokémon!

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.872
It is believed they are Zygarde‐
the Legendary Pokémon!

They said they were
going to Prism Tower.

Not yet. I haven't seen them.

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:30.337

If something bad happened...

worry about Alain and Ash.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.108
You know they're both strong!

worried about Chespie, too...

asleep for quite a while.

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:46.620

Oh no. Mairin, I'm so sorry!

PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Blaziken
Mask, take care of this!

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:50.684
BLAZIKEN MASK: Leave it to me!

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.687
ALIANA: Well then, I guess we'll
just leave them to Celosia.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.689
BRYONY: Then that leaves us to
do our job the way we always do.

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:58.258
CLEMONT: I remind you:

00:05:58.258 --> 00:06:00.393
You're up against the
Leader of the Lumiose Gym!

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.798
JAMES: Lysandre Labs?

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:07.434
MEOWTH: Could that be the
glasses gang's secret base?

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:09.636
JESSIE: Could be.
We don't need glasses to look.

00:06:16.343 --> 00:06:17.711

This is all thanks to you.

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:23.717
The power to control Zygarde.

00:06:30.657 --> 00:06:33.126
LYSANDRE: The Mega Evolution
energy you gathered

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:35.896
is proving to be quite useful in
destroying this imperfect world.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:38.899
LYSANDRE: Just look.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:43.703
LYSANDRE: There is no
tomorrow for this world.

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:47.841
When the sun rises next,
it will be brand‐new.

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:51.278
How beautiful the
end of this world is.

00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:53.780
We are truly taking the
first step towards peace.

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:08.194

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.632
ALAIN: Mairin! Chespie!

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:16.036
Is this the reason I
had all of those battles?!

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.105
All of them for THIS?!

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:25.345
For this?! FOR THIS?!

00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:27.247
MAIRIN: You see...

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:29.215
Chespie's been
asleep for quite a while.

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:31.818
It won't wake up.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:34.120
ASH: That's it.
That's why Alain did this.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:38.224
LYSANDRE: For Chespie's sake.
For Mairin's sake, too.

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:43.463
Your wish had pure intent.
A truly noble wish, indeed.

00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:53.506
JESSIE: Hold on! What are you
doing in such a dangerous place?

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:55.308
MAIRIN: We have to
go to Lysandre Labs!

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.577
My precious Chespie is there!

00:07:57.577 --> 00:07:59.813
JAMES:
You jest! Why, that's terrible!

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.748
MEOWTH: So step on the gas!

00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:03.383
JESSIE: We happen to
be from Lumiose City TV!

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:06.119
Perfect timing!

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:09.456
Where to? We'll whisk you
there in our newscopter!

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:10.323
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
That would be a big help!

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.791
SERENA/MAIRIN: Thanks so much!

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:14.127
JESSIE: Think nothing of it!

00:08:14.127 --> 00:08:15.161
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH: A friend
in need is a friend indeed.

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.970
JAMES:
Blue yonder, here we come!

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.572

And what are we heading for?

00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:27.340
Team Flare's secret base!

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.508
SERENA: Wait. What did you say?

00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:32.345
JESSIE: I said, you've
got flair and a lucky face!

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:46.760

Squishy... I hope it hears you!

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.261

SHAUNA: We can't
just stand by and watch!

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.557
TIERNO:
Yeah we want to help you!

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.025
TREVOR: Please, Diantha?

00:09:21.528 --> 00:09:23.063
DIANTHA: In that case,

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.598
rescuing children and
the elderly comes first!

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:26.266
DIANTHA:
Can you bring them here?

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:29.002
TREVOR: All right!
SHAUNA: We'll take care of it.

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:30.870
TIERNO: All right!

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.338
SAWYER: You can count on us!

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:40.346
JAMES: If we take control...

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:42.682
JESSIE: Of their secret base...

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:44.651
MEOWTH: Team Rocket is
copping the keys to Kalos,

00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:46.319
and then we'll be
running the place!

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:52.759
ZYGARDE SQUISHY: [ROARING]

00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:15.148
XEROSIC: It won't be long
before you become ours as well!

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.184
LYSANDRE: So, Ash...

00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:20.386
I'm going to use
your Bond Phenomenon

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:23.590
in service to my new world!

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.258
LYSANDRE: You're able to
gain that powerful strength

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:27.260
without a Key Stone!

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.262
Purely through your bond!

00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:32.065
When I saw that, I was thrilled.

00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:34.067
LYSANDRE: Ash, you have shown me

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:37.370
there arelimitless possibilities
with Pokémon. Still!

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.372
LYSANDRE: And I want
that power for myself!

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.785
LYSANDRE:
The energy from this light

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:55.221
is powerful enough
to control Zygarde.

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:58.791
But now, Ash! Now, Greninja!

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:01.694
I'm also going to
control your Bond Phenomenon!

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:04.063
ASH: No way...

00:11:04.063 --> 00:11:06.799
LYSANDRE: From this point on...
both of you will answer to me!

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.801

LYSANDRE: You still
don't understand, do you, Ash?

00:11:34.394 --> 00:11:36.763
When the current world
becomes a thing of the past,

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:38.665
you two will
become the chosen ones

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:40.500
who will guide all of humanity!

00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:43.970
ASH: We're never
gonna become any of that!

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.738
We're not ever gonna change.
Alain!

ASH: I don't know
what happened to you,

but you've gotta stop all this,
NOW!

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:54.380

I... I believe in
the Alain I know!

I really care about this world!

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.955
I care about the people

00:12:01.955 --> 00:12:02.789
and Pokémon who
call this world home,

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:05.792
and you won't destroy it!
NO WAY!

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.499

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:18.004

ASH: Alain...

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:10.790
LYSANDRE: Truly brilliant!

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.825
Mega Evolution energy
can't stop your bond!

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:17.430

my head is clear.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.699

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:22.135

think you can defeat me?

ALAIN: We must!
We're going to prove to you

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.295
that protecting
someone takes real strength.

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:51.898
By beating you!

00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:53.333
LYSANDRE:
Alain, you really disappoint me.

00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:56.869
None of you will be needed
in the new world I'm creating.

00:13:58.137 --> 00:14:00.306
ASH: Needed or not needed...

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:01.374
Who are you to
make that decision?!

00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:03.910
LYSANDRE: I've got no choice.

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.486
LYSANDRE: You will be stopped...

00:14:17.657 --> 00:14:19.992
LYSANDRE:
And I'll do it...MYSELF!

has anything to do with this?

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:27.587
LYSANDRE:
What would you know about peace?

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:30.890

when it comes to the
ugly parts of this world!

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:42.568
LYSANDRE: There once was a time

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:44.770
when I reached
out to help people.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.272
People who were in need,
and suffering...

00:16:49.809 --> 00:16:52.478
LYSANDRE: And they rejoiced.

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:53.679
LYSANDRE:
But that didn't last long!

00:16:55.081 --> 00:16:57.316
They all began to
take my help for granted

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:58.751
and expected it like
they had some sort of right!

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:03.956
LYSANDRE: The people
only became louder and louder

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.058
with their demands,

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:08.961
and my help actually
brought about their arrogance!

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:15.067
LYSANDRE:
Foolish, arrogant people...

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:16.836
LYSANDRE: It would
only be a matter of time

00:17:16.836 --> 00:17:18.838
before their world
would be destroyed

00:17:18.838 --> 00:17:21.507
by their entitlement...

00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:23.776
LYSANDRE: That's why I'm
going to create a new world!

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:25.444
A world of peace!

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:28.314
LYSANDRE:
It's time for a new start.

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:31.450
LYSANDRE:
To create my utopian dream!

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:35.521
