Snowbelle City, our heroes have

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.409
decided to camp out for the
evening so they can see the

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.246
Litleonid meteor shower on
the night of the new moon.

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.184

shooting star really soon.

PIKACHU: [HOPEFUL]

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:19.920
CLEMONT: Since tonight's a
new moon,

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.256
I'm sure we'll get to see
a lot of them!

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:26.093
SERENA: Now of course we'll
all have to make a wish.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:27.928
BONNIE: What do you mean?

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:30.030
SERENA: They say if you make a
wish when you see a shooting

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.032
star, your wish will come true.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.967

a whole bunch of wishes!

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.736

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.278
CLEMONT: Relax.
It shouldn't be much longer.

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:48.749
SERENA: Ah, did
you see that one!?

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.484
BONNIE: See what?

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:53.020
ASH: I missed it?
How could that be possible?

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.654

There'll be another soon.

win my third Princess Key!

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:11.004
BONNIE: I hope I become
a Trainer soon. Uh, and also...

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.741
BONNIE: I hope my brother finds
someone who's cute and smart to

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.742
take care of him and SOON!

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.078
CLEMONT: Bonnie?!

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.180
BONNIE: Now you'd better
hurry and make a wish, too!

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.048
CLEMONT: All right.
So then what do I wish for?

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:23.884
How about that
everyone's wishes come true!

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:26.787
BONNIE: Uh Clemont? You
could've come up with something

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.789
a little more original

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.565
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:42.035
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:46.206

I'm so tired! Good night!

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:16.937
ASH: Clemont,
what've you got there?

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:21.008
CLEMONT: Oh this? I invented an
amazing alarm clock that's

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:22.309
guaranteed to wake us all up!

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:25.012
So that way we'll be certain
to make an early start!

00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:27.648

to try it out.

the order of Kalos will

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:50.924
be thrown into disarray!

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:54.427
MEOWTH: I've got no idea what
you're yapping about, pal.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:56.362
PIKACHU: [CONFUSED]

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:57.530

00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:31.764

like Pikachu had a bad dream.

wrong, Pikachu? Hey, stop!

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:55.655
SERENA: I think Pikachu
went to look for Squishy.

00:10:56.923 --> 00:10:58.525

have a look, too! Come on!

going on, old chum??

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:12.705
JESSIE: Have you been
having a bad dream?

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.842
MEOWTH: And how! Squishy
and I were being chased

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:16.843
by some weird fire monster!

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.746
JESSIE: But since it
was a dream,

00:11:19.746 --> 00:11:21.281
why not take a deep
breath and relax?

00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:23.449
MEOWTH: STOP!!

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:25.185
MEOWTH: No way it could've
been a stinkin' dream!

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.452
It was as real as I am!

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.389
MEOWTH: Oh, yeah.
I gotta find Squishy!

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:38.231

Where'd you go?!

PIKACHU: [DETERMINED]

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:50.476
MEOWTH: That place in the dream,
I think it's around here.

PIKACHU: [IMPACT GRUNT]/[DIZZY]

PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

MEOWTH: You see?! I knew it!
PIKACHU: [AMAZED]

00:12:42.729 --> 00:12:44.097
MEOWTH: Now I've gotta figure
out if this

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.132
is a dream or the real deal

00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:48.234
SQUISHY: You!! Where were you?!
We need to run!!

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.071
MEOWTH: So, is that thing
gonna show its flames again?

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:54.474
SQUISHY: Of course!
We have to hurry!

00:12:58.011 --> 00:12:59.045
MEOWTH: Yipes! There's
that big ball of fire!

00:13:01.648 --> 00:13:02.382
PIKACHU: [SCARED]
MEOWTH: MOVE IT!

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.450
MEOWTH: Please, oh please
let this be a dream!

00:13:07.487 --> 00:13:08.521
MEOWTH: Somebody help us OUT!

00:13:16.863 --> 00:13:18.931
MEOWTH: Hey
PIKACHU: [CURIOUS]

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:19.766
MEOWTH: It looks like
it gave up.

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.969
Yes! Now I can
catch up on some breathing.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.338
PIKACHU: [RELIEVED]

00:13:25.338 --> 00:13:25.905

get too comfortable.

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:27.807
Let's get somewhere safe!

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:31.110
SQUISHY: It could come
for us at any time!

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.011
MEOWTH:
You don't relax much, do you?

00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:37.750
MEOWTH: Whoa,
check out that mess

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.193
You think that flaming
lunatic did all of this?

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.196
SQUISHY: I can't believe
it would do this just

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:51.197
to catch me...

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:13.686
MEOWTH: Wow that's crazy?!

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.988

what are you anyway?

00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:19.158
SQUISHY: I am I.

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:21.094
MEOWTH: Well,
you're an amazing I!

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:22.528
SQUISHY: Forget all
that! Let's get moving!

00:14:25.398 --> 00:14:26.599
SQUISHY: Once we
get through the forest,

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:27.700
my home is very close!

00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:29.969
PIKACHU: [RUNNING]

00:14:31.137 --> 00:14:33.373
MEOWTH: We made it out!
PIKACHU: [RELIEVED]

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:42.682
MEOWTH: There's something
suspicious about those clouds

00:14:42.682 --> 00:14:43.916
SQUISHY: Yes, it's coming
without a doubt. Let's hurry!

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.122
MEOWTH: Wait. If that
happens, you can just turn

00:14:49.122 --> 00:14:50.289
into that powerful you...

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.661
MEOWTH: You could beat
it just like it was a

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:57.463
big nothing, right?

00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:59.165
SQUISHY: If I don't get
back home, I can't transform!

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.636
SQUISHY: But as long as we get
there in time, I promise you

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.639
there's nothing to fear!

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:07.774

MEOWTH: It beat us here!
PIKACHU: [NERVOUS]

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:22.655
SQUISHY: We have
no choice but to fight!

MEOWTH: So how are we
supposed to fight fire‐

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:28.761
‐with fire?! There's no
weirdo like a burning weirdo!

JESSIE: I think you
should go back to sleep.

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:24.230
MEOWTH: I DON'T DO SLEEP!!

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.099
MEOWTH: No. I don't
want that dream again!

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:32.872
SERENA: Well I guess it
must've been the sound

00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:34.940
of your alarm clock.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.275
CLEMONT: I don't think
I can handle another failure...

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:39.211
ASH: Wait, it sure would've
woken us up, wouldn't it?

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:41.714
BONNIE: I found Squishy!

00:19:43.783 --> 00:19:44.917
SQUISHY: [DISORIENTED]

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.019
ASH: So that's where you were...

00:19:47.987 --> 00:19:49.121
SQUISHY: [RELIEVED]

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:53.693
BONNIE: Squishy, please don't go
running off like that anymore.

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:58.397
ASH: That's Darkrai!

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:06.605
PIKACHU: [CALLING]

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.575
ASH:Pikachu!

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:11.944
PIKACHU: [RELIEVED]
PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:15.981
DARKRAI: [GROWL]

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:19.318
CLEMONT: Maybe Darkrai was
behind Pikachu's dream.

00:20:20.486 --> 00:20:21.654
Yeah, maybe it created
the whole thing.

00:20:23.756 --> 00:20:25.491
PIKACHU: [RELIEVED]

00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:26.492
ASH: So what was
your dream anyway?

00:20:27.193 --> 00:20:29.195
PIKACHU: [EMBARRASSED]

00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:31.564
SQUISHY: [CONSIDERING]

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.769
PIKACHU: [YAWN]

00:20:38.104 --> 00:20:40.940
NARRATOR: Because of
Darkrai's mysterious power,

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.441
Pikachu and Meowth became part
of Squishy's dream. Thankfully,

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:48.080
they were awakened because of
Clemont's loud, yet effective,

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.383
invention. But now the sun is
up, and the journey continues!
