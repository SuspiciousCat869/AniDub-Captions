Man, Alain's strong.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.538
We're gonna have to
give it all we've got!

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.273
ALAIN: I've really been looking
forward to this battle with Ash.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.609
But I won't let him win it,
no matter what!

I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.299
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:09.570
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.672
Pokémon

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:14.575
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.377

REFEREE: The Kalos League
battle between Ash and Alain

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:46.373
is about to get under way!

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:48.809
REFEREE: When all six of
either Trainer's Pokémon

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:51.745
are unable to continue,
the battle will be over!

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:53.914
In addition,

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:57.150
when three of the Pokémon on
one side are unable to continue,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.819
the battlefield will change.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.556

SAWYER: What do you know?

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.544
Alain's battling
with a Tyranitar!

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:27.648
CLEMONT: And since Tyranitar's
Ability is Sand Stream,

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:29.216
that will make it hard for
Pikachu to see and move around.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:32.919
SERENA:
Don't worry. Ash can handle it!

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.155

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.572
PIKACHU: [EFFORT]

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.378
ASH: That's it! Pikachu, get
to the water and use Iron Tail!

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:00.347

PIKACHU: [PLEASED]
SERENA/BONNIE: All right!

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:16.563
CLEMONT: They cleared the
sandstorm

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.364
with a splash of water!

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.200
SAWYER:
And water conducts electricity,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.768
so using Thunderbolt
was a great strategy!

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:22.936
Ash is doing great!

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:27.207

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:48.762
TYRANITAR: [SURPRISED]

00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:50.497

then use Crunch!

to battle! Pikachu's the winner!

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.123

TIERNO:
Wow, that was a quick victory!

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.468
TREVOR: Having the first win

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.837
totally puts Ash
in the driver's seat!

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:33.607
CLEMONT: If he gets five
more wins, he's the Champion!

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:36.143
DIANTHA: Ash has really been
on fire since the semifinals.

00:04:36.143 --> 00:04:37.177
SYCAMORE: Yeah.

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:42.983
ALAIN: And I can't return.

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:47.387
I lost far too many things
after I left for my journey.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:49.856
Until I can get them back

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:54.694
I have to become much,
much stronger.

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:03.904
SYCAMORE: Alain, what feelings
are you holding inside?

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:07.007
MALVA:
It's the Kalos League finals,

00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:09.576
and the fans are
beside themselves!

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:10.977
However, the battle

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:14.047
MEOWTH: Okay, and cut!

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:15.782

JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH: Right!

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:18.919
JAMES: This battle won't be
a walk in the park, you know.

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:23.156
This kind of battling
would wear out any Pokémon.

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.458
JESSIE: But once they're on
empty, that's when we swoop in.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:32.966

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:34.801
won't know what
they're gonna do!

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:36.236
MALVA: We've got work to do

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.006
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH:
A‐working we will go!

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.444
PIKACHU: [HAPPY]
ASH: Awesome!

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:45.946

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.870
SAWYER: Fighting‐type moves
are especially effective

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.539
against Weavile.
That was a good call.

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.408
CLEMONT: But that's
only if they make contact.

00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:29.909
Weavile's totally
aware of what's going on.

00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:33.480
HAWLUCHA: [KARATE CHOP MOVE]
WEAVILE: [EFFORT]

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:44.691
HAWLUCHA: [UNDERSTANDING]

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.660
ALAIN: Ice Beam, let's go!

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.462
WEAVILE: [ICE BEAM MOVE]

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:50.430

TIERNO: Oh wow!

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.287
CLEMONT: It's using the
ice to reduce any damage!

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:16.256
ALAIN: We'll try this again.
Night Slash!

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:18.024
WEAVILE: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:19.492

ANNOUNCER: And it's a
ferocious attack from Weavile!

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:29.602
Is that it for Hawlucha?

00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:33.673
ANNOUNCER: No, it's standing!
Hawlucha is still standing!

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:37.744
HAWLUCHA: [PROUD]
WEAVILE: [FRUSTRATED]

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.679
ASH: Hawlucha takes
an opponent's attacks

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:41.881
and just keeps on
getting stronger!

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:43.216
ASH: Look out, Alain

00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:46.920
ALAIN: As you wish! Night Slash!

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.488

REFEREE:
Weavile's unable to battle!

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.147
So, Hawlucha's the winner!

00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:15.582
ASH: All right!

00:10:15.582 --> 00:10:17.550
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

SERENA: Hawlucha was great!

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.227
CLEMONT: Ash really used
Hawlucha's fighting style

00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:28.862
to the max!

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:30.463
SAWYER:
Yeah. Hawlucha believes in Ash

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.532
and Ash believes in Hawlucha...

00:10:32.532 --> 00:10:35.268
SERENA: That's for sure!
Trust is what Ash is all about!

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:39.072

Ash has some fine Pokémon.

That was the
powerful move, Guillotine!

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.383
TIERNO:
I thought Ash had the advantage.

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.586
He was up with two wins.

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:01.588
TREVOR: But Alain evened
the score. That guy's tough.

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.724
ASH: Awesome, Hawlucha.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:05.959
You were great.
Now take a good rest.

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.496
ALAIN: Battling against
Ash is a lot of fun.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.367
I don't remember the last
time I've had so much fun!

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:17.303
It allows me to forget
about time completely.

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:20.206

CLEMONT: Three against three

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.383
That means the final
match is all tied up,

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:45.251
which can be tricky.

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:47.253

can turn everything around.

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:49.422

but Ash has never
beaten Alain before.

00:14:56.863 --> 00:14:58.998
SHAUNA:
Alain's really that strong?

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:00.333
SERENA: But that was
the Ash from the past.

00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:03.903
Ash is a lot stronger
now than he was back then.

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:05.805

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.726
Seeing his expression
makes me want to battle

00:15:26.726 --> 00:15:28.861
with everything I've got!

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:31.030
This is why I was so
focused on battling him!

00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:33.266
MAIRIN:
Look at that. He's smiling.

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:35.334

ANNOUNCER: The exciting
Kalos League finals continue!

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:54.120
Our second‐half
battlefield is grass.

00:15:55.655 --> 00:15:57.390
What kind of effect
will this change have

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.091
on our battlers' strategies?

00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:01.060

got that mighty
Metagross on our team!

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.512

have mixed emotions

observing the Pikachu

all of this time.

00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:32.251
A crisis of
Twerpish proportions.

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:34.120
JESSIE:
It doesn't matter who wins.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.355

Thunderbolt from Pikachu!

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:17.430
Can Metagross withstand it?

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:22.034
SAWYER: As long as Pikachu's
on top, Metagross can't attack!

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:24.003
CLEMONT: But will
Metagross go down first,

00:18:24.003 --> 00:18:25.805

get shaken off first?

00:19:11.117 --> 00:19:12.485
CLEMONT:
But he's up against Alain.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.387
He can't lose focus!

00:19:14.387 --> 00:19:16.222

cheering for the Twerp.
