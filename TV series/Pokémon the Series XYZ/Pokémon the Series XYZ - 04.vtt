00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:16.849
BONNIE: See you again!

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:18.350
PIKACHU: [FAREWELL]

00:20:19.018 --> 00:20:20.086
DEDENNE: [FAREWELL]

00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:23.923
LITLEO: [FAREWELL]

00:20:23.923 --> 00:20:24.790
ASH: There's no doubt
that Litleo's gonna become

00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:26.826
an awesome Pyroar someday

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.694
SERENA: I'm glad...

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:30.730
PYROAR: [ROAR]

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.737
NARRATOR: Like everyone, Litleo
will encounter obstacles

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:41.440
along the way, but now it will
surely overcome them.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.876
After all, it has the strength
and power

00:20:43.876 --> 00:20:45.878
to face troubles head on.

00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:47.680
And so, with Litleo's spirit
in their hearts,

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:52.017
our heroes are off once again,
as the journey continues!
