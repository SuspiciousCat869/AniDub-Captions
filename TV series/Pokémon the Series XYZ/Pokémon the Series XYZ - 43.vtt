00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.922
MEOWTH:
If it reaches the sundial, CUT!

00:10:55.922 --> 00:10:57.223
That's a wrap!

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:07.667
ASH: Pikachu... and Greninja...

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:10.703
PIKACHU: [REASSURING]
ASH‐GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:11.671
ALAIN: Charizard,
you're not hurt are you?

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:14.908
CHARIZARD: [REASSURING]

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:16.843
SQUISHY/B CORE:
[QUESTIONING] / [EXERTION]

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:20.980
BONNIE: So what happened?

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.555
CLEMONT/BONNIE: Dad?

00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:30.256
MEYER: Guilty as charged...

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.860
BONNIE:
You all right? Are you hurt?

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.761
MEYER:
Don't worry. I'm just fine.

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:37.497
Are you two all right?

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.471
DIANTHA: It's moving...

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:46.839
ALAIN: How do we make it stop?

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:48.708
CLEMONT: Everyone, listen to me!

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.243
The power that's moving
it has something to do with

00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:51.377
the device on Lysandre's arm!

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:55.248
ALAIN:
Then it must be destroyed, NOW!

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.617
ASH: That will stop it?

00:11:57.617 --> 00:11:58.284
CLEMONT:
We have to try anything.

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:00.987
DIANTHA: We've got to give
it everything we have left!

00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:02.755
It's our only chance!

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:04.190
ALL: Right!

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.562
B CORE: So they will fight?
Against that tremendous evil?

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.765
SQUISHY: Neither humans,
nor Pokémon give up.

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:15.101
B CORE:
But they're far too weak...

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:17.036
SQUISHY:
None of them think they're weak!

00:12:18.004 --> 00:12:19.072
B CORE: [CONSIDERING]

00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:22.475
SQUISHY: You should
have seen this by now.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:28.281
It's true that humans
are weak and powerless.

00:12:28.281 --> 00:12:31.618
But they have dreams,
and they believe in each other.

00:12:31.618 --> 00:12:35.088
They stand together and
feel empathy for each other!

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.522
That is their real strength.

00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:40.059
They have the power to
believe in themselves,

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:41.961
and within themselves,

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.863
they somehow find
the will to succeed!

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:51.771
ALL: [STRUGGLING]

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.773
ASH/PIKACHU: [SCARED]

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:55.708
M CHARIZARD: [PROTECTIVE]
M BLAZIKEN: [PROTECTIVE]

00:13:05.752 --> 00:13:07.153
B CORE:
Then I will believe in them!

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:08.421
SQUISHY: Now you understand.

00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:10.823
B CORE: Yes!

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:12.558
SQUISHY/B CORE: [EXERTION]
BONNIE: Squishy!

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:13.693
MEYER: Bonnie, wait!

00:13:15.328 --> 00:13:17.263
B CORE:
I am Zygarde‐

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:18.464
defender of order!

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:21.901
SQUISHY/B CORE:
We will show them!

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:24.470
Our full power!

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.939
You won't destroy the world!

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:28.808
SQUISHY/B CORE: [SUMMONING]

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:40.987
LYSANDRE: What's this?!

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.111
BONNIE: Oh, Squishy...

00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:06.713
ALAIN: Is that Zygarde?

00:14:07.747 --> 00:14:09.916
OLYMPIA:
Those deep green eyes...

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:11.117
That is it.

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:13.986
OLYMPIA: The Forme
when all has become one.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.791
ASH: Become one?

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.860
LYSANDRE:
And still you hid this Forme.

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.697
You must have been seeing
the world in the same way I was!

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:28.101
LYSANDRE:
The unlimited greed of humans

00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:29.836
has sent the world
spinning into chaos.

00:14:29.836 --> 00:14:31.170
Have you not felt that?!

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:34.907
LYSANDRE: If I had
not raised my objections,

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:36.142
the world would
continue on its warped path.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.579
But now you choose to appear.

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:41.414
What could possibly
be left to defend?

00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:43.182
LYSANDRE: You have no right!

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:48.388
ZYGARDE COMPLETE:
If it is a right you speak of,

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.556
this world belongs to them!

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.759
I have placed my
hopes in humanity!

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:54.761
They have always protected me.

00:14:54.761 --> 00:14:55.595
ZYGARDE COMPLETE:
They kept their promise

00:14:55.595 --> 00:14:56.829
not to leave my side!

00:14:58.097 --> 00:14:59.599
ZYGARDE COMPLETE:
Now it is my turn!

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:01.768
LYSANDRE: I will incinerate you!

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.344
ASH/ALAIN/PIKACHU: [PAINED]

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.559
LYSANDRE: Impudent fool!

00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:29.495
ASH: All right,
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!

00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:31.431
Greninja, use Water Shuriken!

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:32.465
PIKACHU, ASH‐GRENINJA:
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:34.400
ALAIN:
Charizard, use Flamethrower!

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.469
CHARIZARD: [AFFIRMATIVE]
PIKACHU: [THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

00:15:36.469 --> 00:15:37.703
ASH‐GRENINJA:
[WATER SHURIKEN MOVE]

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:39.305
CHARIZARD: [FLAMETHROWER MOVE]

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:45.311
LYSANDRE: It can't be...
It must be a mistake...

00:15:46.646 --> 00:15:48.314
All of my meticulous
planning was... perfect!

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.501
BONNIE: Squishy!

00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:17.510
ZYGARDE COMPLETE:
Kalos! I will protect you!

00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:21.080
BONNIE: Squishy! Go for it!

00:16:28.621 --> 00:16:32.358
LYSANDRE: Not yet!
Move! It's not over yet!

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:04.924
MEOWTH: That... is a wrap.

00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:06.192
JAMES: Take a look!
Look what we did, world!

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.529
JESSIE: That giant
monstrosity is gone,

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:10.863
but we're still standing!

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:14.734
JESSIE:
The threat to Kalos is HISTORY!

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:22.542
OLYMPIA:
The sundial was protected.

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.010
DIANTHA: Thank you, everyone!

00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:27.413
KORRINA: We won. We really won!

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:32.351
STEVEN: Where's Lysandre?

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:34.520
MALVA: Who knows?

00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:38.991
MALVA:
You leave Team Flare to me.

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:43.629
When I'm done cleaning them up,
I'll drop in on Officer Jenny...

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.403
CHESPIE: [SLEEPY]

00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:55.041
MAIRIN: Chespie, you're awake.
You're awake!

00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:57.343
CHESPIE: [AFFECTIONATE]

00:17:57.343 --> 00:18:01.514
MAIRIN:
Alain... Look at Chespie!

00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:02.682
CHESPIE: [GREETING]
ALAIN: I'm so happy for you.

00:18:05.718 --> 00:18:07.153
ALAIN: Mairin?

00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:11.090
ALAIN: Please forgive me.
For everything I did.

00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:15.661
MAIRIN: Stop.

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:16.829
I'm just happy
that you're all right.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.005
BONNIE: Squishy! Thanks a lot!

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.774
ZYGARDE COMPLETE: Bonnie...

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.343
I only did what you
have done for me all along.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:33.980
It is I who should thank you.
I'm so grateful.

00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:10.182
CHESPIE: [STARTLED]

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:11.150
CHESPIE: [EXERTION]
CHESPIE: [CALLING]

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.518
SQUISHY/B CORE: [QUESTIONING]

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:14.153
SQUISHY: It's you!

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.322
I would like to express
my gratitude to you as well.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:17.823
Thank you!

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:19.258
CHESPIE: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:23.496
SQUISHY: Bonnie...

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.831
To have journeyed with you,

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.266
and to have learned
about humans from you...

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.602
SQUISHY: I am grateful.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.538
BONNIE: Is this goodbye?

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.410
SQUISHY: I'm tired. I think
I'd like to rest in the sun.

00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:41.714
SQUISHY:
I'm glad to have met you.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.634
BONNIE: Oh, Squishy...

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.004
I'm glad that I met you, too!

00:20:05.004 --> 00:20:07.106
DEDENNE: [AGREEMENT]

00:20:07.106 --> 00:20:08.541
SQUISHY:
I'll never forget you, Bonnie.

00:20:11.744 --> 00:20:14.547
BONNIE:
I love you, Squishy! I love you!

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.634
NARRATOR: And so, the final
curtain falls on Team Flare

00:20:36.869 --> 00:20:38.003
and their threat
to the Kalos region.

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:43.275
The sun now rises again

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:44.844
on the world that Ash
and his friends protected...

00:20:46.112 --> 00:20:48.247
as the journey continues!
