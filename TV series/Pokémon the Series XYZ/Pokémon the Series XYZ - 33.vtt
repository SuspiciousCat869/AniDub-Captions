WEBVTT

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:03.070
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH:
Kalos League battle heat!

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.673
MALVA:
Malva here. Reporting live.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.475
The Kalos League is under way,

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.711
and we're well
into the battle action!

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:12.346
MALVA: Now, let's all
take a look

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:13.714
at a summary of our
battles up to this point.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:16.917
MALVA: In the first bout,

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:19.820
the action was between
Trevor and his Mega Charizard,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.622
facing off against
Alain and his Mega Charizard!

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.959
Next, there was a riveting
appearance by Ash's Greninja!

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:30.130
MALVA: But, without a doubt,
the highlight of this tournament

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.266
has got to be the Mega‐Evolved
Pokémon competing here!

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.669
Pokémon such as
Astrid's Mega Absol

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:39.740
and Remo's Mega Garchomp

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.576
are bringing a level of mega
excitement to the Kalos League

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:45.145
unlike anything
we've seen before!

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.747
MALVA: I can hardly wait
for more battle action to come!

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:49.016
And, I'm sure you
feel the same way!

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.658
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:01.061
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.732
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.734
Pokémon

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.637
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:13.407
I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:14.908
Pokémon

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.677
Pokémon

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:17.911
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.058
ASTRID: Now, Absol, Psycho Cut!

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:32.259
MEGA ABSOL: [PSYCHO CUT MOVE]

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.795
ASH: Hawlucha, Flying Press!

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.532
HAWLUCHA: [FLYING PRESS MOVE]

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:44.805
MEGA ABSOL: [COLLAPSING]

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.607
ASTRID: Absol, no!

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.208
ANNOUNCER:
Absol is unable to battle!

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.776
Which means Ash is the winner!

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:50.677
ASH: Yeah!

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:54.615
ANNOUNCER: Following his
victory against Astrid,

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:56.617
Ash will be moving
on to the semifinals!

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:02.990
SAWYER: Ash!

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.491
ASH: Hey Sawyer!

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.060
SAWYER:
The semifinals! Congratulations!

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.097
ASH:
Thanks. You're up soon, Sawyer!

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:11.565
SAWYER:
That's right. And I'll win!

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:16.703
SAWYER:
Ash? Remember what you said?

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:20.374
ASH: We'll battle
at the Kalos League!

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:22.009
I'm gonna break
my losing streak.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:24.945
ASH: And then you and
I will even the score.

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:28.815
SAWYER: Yeah. You're on, Ash!

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.886
SAWYER: That's why I'll win!

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:36.256
ASH: Yeah!
But Tierno's really strong!

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:37.758
SAWYER:
Tierno's your friend, isn't he?

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:40.060
ASH: That's right...

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.461
SAWYER: Watching his
first and second battles,

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.130
I know I need to be careful

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.831
against Tierno's
rhythmic battling style.

00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:50.003
SAWYER: I'll mess with
his rhythm, that's all!

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.972
ASH: Yeah, that's the spirit!

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:53.273
SAWYER: So I'll be as
prepared as I can be.

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.376
I also have a
secret weapon all set.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.246
ASH: A secret weapon?

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:01.448
SAWYER: Super‐secret!

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:02.549
SAWYER: See you soon!

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.553
ASH: Ok, good luck!

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:09.022
SAWYER: So Ash made
it to the next round.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.757
I can't lose until
I've kept my promise!

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:14.061
MALVA:
Okay, over here, over here!

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:15.362
Time for another interview!

00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:19.800
MEOWTH: All these interviews...

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.435
Why do we always
have to run around here

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:22.669
like there's no tomorrow?

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.371
JESSIE: I agree.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.440
We don't get a second to steal

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.909
even one of the pickable Pokémon
here at the Kalos League...

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.044
JAMES: Steal them? But how?!

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.780
We can't even figure out
which ones are worth the time!

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.348
MEOWTH: Even Pikachu's
right under our noses.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.186
MEOWTH: This dude needs a nap!

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:42.689
ANNOUNCER: Remo's the winner!

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:45.459
ANNOUNCER:
We now have three competitors

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.394
qualified for the semifinals!

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.429
Which means there's
just one slot left!

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:52.799
SHAUNA: Hi!

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:55.635
SHAUNA: Did I make it?

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.003
SERENA: Shauna!

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:58.505
TREVOR: Yeah, you just did.

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:00.874
Tierno's battle
is about to start!

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:03.376
SHAUNA: That's a relief.
Nice to see you, Serena.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:04.911
How've you been?
SERENA: I'm great.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:05.812
Looks like you're
doing well too.

00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:09.783
SHAUNA: I feel great! How's Ash?

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:11.084
SERENA: He's moving
on to the semifinals.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.386
ASH: Hey, it's Shauna!

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.021
SHAUNA: Hi, Ash!

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.456
I hear you're moving on
to the semifinals,

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:18.058
‐right?
‐ASH: Yeah!

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:20.160
SHAUNA:
Who's Tierno battling against?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.596
TREVOR: He's battling
a Trainer named Sawyer.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:25.465
ASH: Sawyer's pretty strong.
I even lost to him one time.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.636
SHAUNA: He's that strong?

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.171
CLEMONT: Not only is he strong,
he's an impressive analyst.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.540
SHAUNA: Sounds like it's
gonna be a tough battle...

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:37.878
ANNOUNCER: And for our last
battle before the semifinals?

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:41.915
ANNOUNCER:
It's Tierno vs. Sawyer!

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:45.051
ANNOUNCER: And here's where
our competitors will be

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:45.886
battling it out.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.221
A wasteland field!

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.296
REFEREE: Now for your Pokémon!

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.264
SAWYER: Aegislash, let's go!

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.701
AEGISLASH: [APPEARING]

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:02.202
ASH: Check it out.
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:06.573
POKEDEX: Aegislash.
The Royal Sword Pokémon,

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:08.842
and the evolved
form of Doublade.

00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:11.144
Stories say Aegislash
can detect the natural

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.080
qualities of leadership,
recognizing a true king.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.082
SERENA:
So, his Doublade evolved then.

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:17.584
ANNOUNCER: And now,

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:19.286
what Pokémon
will Tierno be using?

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.625
TIERNO:
Ludicolo! It'stime to dance!

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:30.864
LUDICOLO: [APPEARING] [DANCING]

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:34.935
ANNOUNCER: Feast your eyes on
Ludicolo's masterful dancing!

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:39.940
SHAUNA: Wow, look at them go!

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.509
CLEMONT: Tierno and Ludicolo
are in perfect unison!

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.412
BONNIE: Lots of luck, Sawyer!
And you too, Tierno!

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:47.848
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]
DEDENNE: [EXCITED]

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:49.449
SERENA:
I hope they both do well.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.851
REFEREE: Battle begin!

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.495
TIERNO: Now, here we go
with our battling BEAT!

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.965
TIERNO: Rock it with Rain Dance!

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:08.735
LUDICOLO: [RAIN DANCE MOVE]

00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:17.477
SAWYER: Rain Dance, huh?

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.145
That means Water‐type
moves will be stronger now.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.683
Completely textbook.
I know what to do.

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:25.185
Aegislash, use Swords Dance!

00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:30.023
AEGISLASH: [SWORDS DANCE MOVE]

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:37.030
TIERNO: So they're using Swords
Dance to raise attack power.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.799
CLEMONT: Tierno used Rain Dance
to take advantage of the field,

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.334
and then Sawyer
responded brilliantly.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.171
TREVOR: I wonder which
one will come out on top.

00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:47.007
SAWYER:
Use Swords Dance once again!

00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:48.675
TIERNO: Use Hydro Pump!

00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:51.678
LUDICOLO: [HYDRO PUMP MOVE]

00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:52.345
SAWYER: It's fast!

00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.650
SAWYER: Ludicolo's
Ability is Swift Swim.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.185
Rain Dance
increases Water‐type moves,

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:01.021
and Swift Swim boosts Ludicolo's
speed in rainy weather!

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.089
SAWYER: Very nice.

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:06.293
TIERNO:
Now! Finish with Hydro Pump!

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:07.694
LUDICOLO: [HYDRO PUMP MOVE]

00:07:07.694 --> 00:07:08.962
SAWYER: Use Slash!

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:10.597
AEGISLASH: [SLASH MOVE]

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:13.600
AEGISLASH: [FLIPPING]

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.036
SAWYER: Aegislash, you okay?
AEGISLASH: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:18.271
TIERNO: Yo! Yo! Yo!
Are you giving up, bro?

00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:22.142
ANNOUNCER: Aegislash
just can't seem to handle

00:07:22.142 --> 00:07:23.376
Ludicolo's power and speed!

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:29.115
SAWYER:
Ludicolo's so fast and strong!

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:31.952
This doesn't look good...

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.687
ASH:
Ludicolo's really well trained.

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:35.722
Tierno's worked really hard.

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:36.856
CLEMONT: Rain Dance
was skillfully executed.

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.226
I wonder how Sawyer
will deal with all of this.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.029
SAWYER: In that case...

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:44.698
TIERNO:
All right! Hydro Pump again!

00:07:44.698 --> 00:07:46.366
LUDICOLO: [HYDRO PUMP MOVE]

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:47.968
SAWYER: All right,
Aegislash, King's Shield!

00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:49.502
AEGISLASH: [KING'S SHIELD MOVE]

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.176
SERENA:
Aegislash's stance. It changed!

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:57.077
BONNIE: You're right!
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:07:57.077 --> 00:07:57.944
DEDENNE: [QUESTIONING]

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.318
CLEMONT: King's Shield
allows it to change

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.286
so it can defend
against attacks.

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:08.888
CLEMONT: Not only that,

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:10.123
it can also lower its
opponent's attack power!

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.127
ASH: King's Shield. Whoa.

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:18.064
SAWYER: Time to counterattack!
Aegislash, Sacred Sword!

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.434
AEGISLASH: [SACRED SWORD MOVE]

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:24.971
TIERNO: Hydro Pump, go!

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:26.973
LUDICOLO: [HYDRO PUMP MOVE]

which means the
victory goes to Sawyer!

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:39.225
TIERNO:
I guess that's it for us.

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:41.894
TIERNO:
So let's cheer for the winner!

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.830
SHAUNA: Oh, Tierno...

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.499
CLEMONT:
I'd say Sawyer's sheer passion

00:17:46.499 --> 00:17:48.067
overwhelmed Tierno's power.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:50.036
It seems that's the one thing

00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:51.337
that made all the
difference this time around.

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:55.708
SERENA: Yeah. And who knew
that Sceptile could Mega Evolve?

00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:00.880
ASH: Sawyer's trained really
hard to be at the Kalos League.

00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:03.316
I can't wait for our battle!

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:04.183
PIKACHU: [DETERMINED]

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.987
ANNOUNCER: All the semifinal
slots have now been filled!

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:09.855
Starting with the semifinals,

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:13.159
we'll be seeing
full six‐on‐six battles!

00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:14.493
And here's what the
matchups look like!

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:17.563
ANNOUNCER: It's Alain vs. Remo!

00:18:18.898 --> 00:18:20.833
And it's Ash vs. Sawyer!

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:23.936
ANNOUNCER:
There is plenty of battle action

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.838
coming up tomorrow!

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:27.773
The Kalos League is
really getting heated up!

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.914
CLEMONT: Ash,

00:18:34.914 --> 00:18:37.350
what are you going to do about
tomorrow's six‐on‐six battle?

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.986
SERENA: Yeah.
You've only got five Pokémon.

00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:41.520
You've got to
figure something out.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.855
ASH: What time is it?

00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:46.325
ASH: Oh no!

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:48.661
SERENA: What's wrong?
BONNIE: Wait up, Ash!

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.700
ASH:
He should be coming any minute.

00:18:56.202 --> 00:18:57.737
SERENA:
Who are you talking about?

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:01.173
ASH: There they are!

00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:04.210
ASH: Hey, Goodra!
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

00:19:05.378 --> 00:19:07.546
GOODRA: [HAPPY]

00:19:08.748 --> 00:19:10.249
ASH:
Keanan! Thanks so very much!

00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:11.784
This's great!

00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:13.386
KEANAN:
It's my greatest pleasure.

00:19:13.386 --> 00:19:16.055
DEDENNE: [GREETING]
PIKACHU: [GREETING]

00:19:16.055 --> 00:19:18.758
CLEMONT: Goodra. So then
the last Pokémon on your team...

00:19:18.758 --> 00:19:20.226
ASH: Right!

00:19:20.226 --> 00:19:21.894
My sixth Pokémon
is gonna be Goodra.

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:25.798
GOODRA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:19:25.798 --> 00:19:28.000
ASH:
Actually, I'd already decided.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.635
Back when we visited Goodra.

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:36.642
ASH: Almost time
for the Kalos League.

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:39.011
GOODRA: [EXCITED]

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:42.048
ASH: If I can make it to the
semifinals, it'll be six‐on‐six.

00:19:42.048 --> 00:19:44.083
But right now I
only have five Pokémon.

00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:48.454
ASH: I thought maybe
Professor Oak could send me one.

00:19:48.454 --> 00:19:50.122
ASH: Instead,
there's someone else

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:51.190
that I
really wanna battle with...

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:53.559
GOODRA: [DISBELIEVING]

00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:58.330
ASH: And Goodra, that's you!

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:01.801
Please battle by my
side in the Kalos League!

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:06.205
GOODRA: [DELIGHTED]

00:20:09.742 --> 00:20:11.777
ASH: Aw, come on!
You're really too much, Goodra!

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:13.412
GOODRA: [HAPPY]

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.857
ASH: There's no one else who
could win against the Pokémon

00:20:24.857 --> 00:20:26.559
in the Kalos League
like you can!

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.961
You're the best possible team!

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:32.198
ASH: I know we can do it.
We'll beat Sawyer together!

00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:33.032
PIKACHU/GRENINJA/TALONFLAME/
HAWLUCHA/NOIVERN: [CHEERING]

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:37.002
NARRATOR:
Ash and his team of six Pokémon,

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:38.938
now including Goodra,

00:20:38.938 --> 00:20:40.706
are getting ready
for the semifinals!

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:42.074
His opponent?

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:44.777
Sawyer! The winner?

00:20:44.777 --> 00:20:47.546
The answer, along with
lots of heated excitement,

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:49.815
as the journey continues!
