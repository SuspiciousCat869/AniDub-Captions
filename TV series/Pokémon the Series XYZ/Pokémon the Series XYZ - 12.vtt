00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.226
CLEMONT: Wow what a surprise it
evolved into a Sylveon!

00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:51.897
CLEMONT: Eevee can evolve in
many different ways but it has

00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:54.133
to be especially close to its
Trainer to evolve into Sylveon.

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:56.202
SERENA: I didn't know.

00:18:57.403 --> 00:18:58.170

00:18:59.372 --> 00:19:00.706

will let you in on where the
next Pokémon Showcase will be

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:21.761
held! And that exciting location
IS Fleurrh City!

00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:23.863
MIETTE: Serena?

00:19:23.863 --> 00:19:25.197

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:28.000
SERENA: Yeah!

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:32.838

and her Sylveon were

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:33.706
wonderful together!

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:36.509
PALERMO: How
unusual of you to speak

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.678
so highly of someone.

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.914
ARIA: Maybe. But I'm sure you'd
feel exactly the same way

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:45.117
if you'd seen them. They were
dazzling! Right?

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:46.318
Don't you think?
DELPHOX: [AGREEMENT]

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.156
PALERMO: I found someone, too.
ARIA: You did?

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:53.659
PALERMO: It's still too
early to know for sure

00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:56.295
exactly how she'll turn out,
but she's like you once were.

00:19:58.164 --> 00:19:58.964
ARIA: What do you mean?

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:01.200

me. It's time to go.

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:04.537
ARIA: Right away!
Sorry, Palermo.

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:06.505
I'll call you again soon.

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:07.840
PALERMO: Take care.
Do your best.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.344
ARIA: We need
to work hard, too.

00:20:22.488 --> 00:20:23.589

Isn't she?

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:25.357

have taken place: an

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:44.009
unexpected reunion with a rival,
and Eevee's Evolution into

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:47.646
Sylveon! Serena and her Pokémon
are growing closer and closer.

00:20:49.148 --> 00:20:51.383
She's taken another big step
forward as a Pokémon performer,

00:20:52.685 --> 00:20:54.754
as our heroes'
journey continues!
