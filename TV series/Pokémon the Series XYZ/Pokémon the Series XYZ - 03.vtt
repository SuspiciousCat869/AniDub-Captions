00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.173
SERENA: I'm sure
there's a Pokémon Center

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:06.807
somewhere around here...

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.510
BONNIE: Well, I don't see it...

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.611
CLEMONT: I wonder if the
professor's already there.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.180
ASH: Don't worry
about a thing, guys!

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:16.783
SERENA: From over there!

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:17.618
ASH: Let's take a look!

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:26.627
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.464
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.501
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.204
Pokémon

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:39.740

Gotta catch 'em all!

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.676
(I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner)

Pokémon

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:45.812
Pokémon

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:47.481
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:04.243
WOMAN: Somebody!!

00:01:06.144 --> 00:01:08.080
WOMAN: Please help me!!

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.014
ASH: Hey, are you
okay down there?!

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.117
ASH: Hold on! We'll come down!

00:01:18.457 --> 00:01:19.858
WOMAN: My leg.
It's stuck!

00:01:22.194 --> 00:01:23.528
ASH: Kay, grab hold of my hand!

00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:27.899
ASH,SERENA: Okay, PULL!

00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:31.837
SERENA: I can't hold
on much longer!

00:01:33.438 --> 00:01:35.307
ASH: She's in there good.

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:36.208
SERENA: It looks like
her leg's really stuck.

00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:39.544
BONNIE: Clemont, can't you
do something about this?

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.249
CLEMONT: Yes, of course!
I thought we would

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.618
encounter situation
precisely like this one!

00:01:46.618 --> 00:01:48.654
BONNIE: Whatever,
just hurry up!!

00:01:48.654 --> 00:01:50.022
CLEMONT: Now stay still,
and I'll have you out

00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:50.889
of there right away!

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.961
‐CLEMONT: Ash, quick!
‐ASH: Right!

00:02:09.107 --> 00:02:10.042
ASH: You okay?
PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:11.410
WOMAN: Yes, thanks a lot!

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:15.580
SERENA: But how did
your leg get stuck like that?

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.449
WOMAN: I lost my balance.
Searching for this.

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:21.119
ASH, SERENA, CLEMONT, BONNIE:
It's a Mega Stone!

00:02:22.954 --> 00:02:25.657
WOMAN: Right! The truth is I've
been looking for it everywhere!

00:02:25.657 --> 00:02:27.926
SERENA: I can understand
why this happened.

00:02:27.926 --> 00:02:30.262
BONNIE: What about
Professor Sycamore? We're late!

00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:32.064
SERENA: Let's get to
the Pokémon Center!

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:33.699
ASH: Is there a Pokémon
Center around here?

00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:36.635
WOMAN: Now you just
leave everything to me!

00:02:37.736 --> 00:02:40.138
I'll thank you by taking
you right there!

00:02:40.138 --> 00:02:42.074
ASH: Wow! You really mean
it?! Thanks so much!

00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:43.041
PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

00:02:48.513 --> 00:02:49.414
ASH: An ambulance?

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:59.291
CLEMONT: I can't
believe you're Nurse Joy!

00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:00.959
BONNIE: Oh boy neither can I.

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:01.893
PIKACHU: [AMAZED]

00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:04.629
NURSE JOY: Oh I always dress
like that when I'm doing

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.199
fieldwork. Hop on in!

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.666
ASH, SERENA,
CLEMONT, BONNIE: Okay!

00:03:12.838 --> 00:03:14.139
EMILIO: Nurse Joy is so late...

00:03:16.742 --> 00:03:18.176
EMILIO: There she is!
It's about time!

00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:23.248
NURSE JOY: We're here.

00:03:23.248 --> 00:03:24.516
I told you it was okay to
leave everything to me.

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.924
ASH: Thanks for
the lift, Nurse Joy!

00:03:32.924 --> 00:03:33.625
NURSE JOY: And thanks
for your help!

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.363
JAMES: First we hear about
a nutty Nurse Joy who

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:41.066
often leaves her Pokémon Center
unguard‐ ed‐‐which gives us

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:42.501
the perfect chance to
swipe piles of Pokémon

00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:45.137
JESSIE: But who knew the
Twerps and their Pokémon

00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:46.805
would be tagging along?

00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:48.140
MEOWTH: It'll be easy to
grab Pikachu for a song!

00:03:49.474 --> 00:03:50.442
JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH:
We're right, and they're wrong!

00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:51.576
WOBBUFFET: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.184
SERENA: That's great! The
professor hasn't arrived yet.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.988
NURSE JOY: This might be a
good time to have a look

00:04:02.988 --> 00:04:04.656
at your Pokémon.

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:06.458
SERENA: Please!
That would be great!

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:07.893
NURSE JOY: Okay then, please
put your Poké Balls in here.

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.964
SERENA: Nurse Joy,
is something wrong?

00:04:12.964 --> 00:04:13.665
CLEMONT: Let me look.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.034
NURSE JOY: But it's just..

00:04:22.107 --> 00:04:23.675
CLEMONT: It appears that there's
some sort of barricade just on

00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:25.977
the other side of the door.

00:04:25.977 --> 00:04:29.948
NURSE JOY: Well, you see... Open
up, Audino! Did you do this?

00:04:29.948 --> 00:04:31.383
Oh you did, didn't you?

00:04:31.383 --> 00:04:32.851
ASH: Audino?

00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:35.487
BONNIE: Hold on.
An Audino's in there?

00:04:35.487 --> 00:04:38.423
CLEMONT: It's my understanding
that in some other regions,

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:39.758
Audino works as Nurse Joy's
assistant at the Pokémon Center.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.028
NURSE JOY: Audino, open up!

00:04:43.028 --> 00:04:44.196
AUDINO: [UPSET]

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.335
NURSE JOY: You

00:04:50.335 --> 00:04:51.369
SERENA: Are you
two having a fight?

00:04:53.004 --> 00:04:55.373
NURSE JOY: Well Audino's angry
because I didn't say when I was

00:04:55.373 --> 00:04:57.209
going to come back. It
can get really upset.

00:04:58.477 --> 00:04:59.911
And it's going to stay upset
for quite some time.

00:05:01.813 --> 00:05:03.215
NURSE JOY: I'm sorry, but would
you mind letting Audino and me

00:05:03.215 --> 00:05:04.149
speak alone for a moment?

00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:12.123
BONNIE: So what should we do?

00:05:12.123 --> 00:05:14.459
ASH: What should we do?
Well, I'd really like to help

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:16.061
the two of them make up.

00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:17.295
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:18.630
EMILIO: Hey!

00:05:20.165 --> 00:05:21.566
EMILIO:
Can you talk to Audino?

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:22.601
ASH: Who are you?

00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:24.536
EMILIO: I'm Emilio.

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:26.805
ASH: My name is Ash.
And this is Pikachu.

00:05:26.805 --> 00:05:28.106

00:05:36.248 --> 00:05:37.983
SQUISHY: [GREETING]

00:05:37.983 --> 00:05:41.253
EMILIO: Nice to meet you.
Is there any way you can get

00:05:41.253 --> 00:05:43.522
those two to make up?

00:05:43.522 --> 00:05:45.323
They're really close and
they usually get along!

00:05:47.192 --> 00:05:48.093
ASH: You must
know them pretty well then.

00:05:48.093 --> 00:05:48.894
EMILIO: Come on!

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.165
EMILIO: Audino's in here.

00:05:54.165 --> 00:05:55.400
We can get to Audino by
climbing through this window!

00:06:07.445 --> 00:06:08.346
EMILIO: Come on in.

00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:10.849

NURSE JOY: Come on, Audino.
Open up! Let me in,

00:06:22.894 --> 00:06:25.697
Audino, please! I'm really
sorry for not contacting you.

00:06:26.464 --> 00:06:27.832
AUDINO: [UPSET]

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.035
EMILIO: Audino?

00:06:32.504 --> 00:06:34.039
AUDINO: [CURIOUS]
AUDINO: [QUESTIONING]

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.107
EMILIO: Please don't worry.
These nice people

00:06:36.107 --> 00:06:37.042
are just worried about you.

00:06:38.143 --> 00:06:38.777

ZIGZAGOON: [YAWN/LEAPING]

00:06:45.817 --> 00:06:49.321
See, we think it'd be great if
could you make up with Nurse Joy

00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:50.922
SERENA: Everyone who comes to
the Pokémon Center really

00:06:50.922 --> 00:06:51.923
needs the both of you.

AUDINO: [THOUGHTFUL]

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.776

00:07:11.776 --> 00:07:13.778

TRAINER: You've gotta help us,

00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:21.786
Nurse Joy! We really need
your help! Please!

00:07:21.786 --> 00:07:23.755
NURSE JOY: But‐‐what
can I do? This is bad...

00:07:26.524 --> 00:07:27.292
SYCAMORE: Why don't
you let me have a look.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.060
NURSE JOY:
Hey, wait a minute. You're

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:32.397
NURSE JOY: You're
Professor Sycamore...

help right this instant!

00:07:40.338 --> 00:07:42.841
NURSE JOY: Yes. Of
course! Open up, Audino!

00:07:42.841 --> 00:07:44.075
We have an emergency patient!

SYCAMORE: Hello, Ash!
This Makuhita's in trouble!

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.588
Will you help us out?

00:07:57.422 --> 00:07:58.490

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.424

AUDINO: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:10.769

SYCAMORE: We just have
to leave them to their work.

00:08:53.912 --> 00:08:54.713
There's no need to
worry with those two.

00:09:03.455 --> 00:09:04.789

00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:05.457

00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:34.285
NURSE JOY: Take good care!

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:35.754
AUDINO: [FAREWELL]

00:09:39.557 --> 00:09:40.825
NURSE JOY: Audino, what do you
say we straighten things up?

00:09:41.526 --> 00:09:42.494
AUDINO: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:09:45.396 --> 00:09:48.399
SERENA: I'm so glad that
Makuhita's feeling better!

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:51.536
SYCAMORE: Nurse Joy has a lot of
skill. She and Audino are just

00:09:51.536 --> 00:09:52.704
marvelous working as a team.

00:09:54.405 --> 00:09:56.541
EMILIO: You see, I told you
those two really get along.

00:09:56.541 --> 00:09:57.776
BONNIE: So why do they
always fight so much?

00:09:59.677 --> 00:10:00.912
SYCAMORE: There must be
some sort of explanation why.

00:10:02.247 --> 00:10:03.848
CLEMONT: Oh, by
the way, Professor

00:10:03.848 --> 00:10:06.050
What do you know about Squishy?

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.119
SYCAMORE: Right. Squishy.
Of course the situation needs

00:10:08.119 --> 00:10:09.721
to be looked into.

00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:11.956
Would it be possible to
see Squishy right now?

00:10:11.956 --> 00:10:14.626
CLEMONT: Bonnie's been
taking very good care of it.

00:10:14.626 --> 00:10:19.063
BONNIE: Yeah! Here we go. You'll
be nice to the professor, right?

00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:22.400
SYCAMORE: Squishy...Hello!

00:10:24.903 --> 00:10:26.538
SQUISHY: [CAUTIOUS]
BONNIE: It'll be fine.

00:10:26.538 --> 00:10:28.640
SYCAMORE: Fascinating.
It is rather squishy, isn't it?

00:10:29.974 --> 00:10:31.142
BONNIE: That's why
I named it Squishy!

00:10:31.943 --> 00:10:34.045
SQUISHY: [PERTURBED]

00:10:36.147 --> 00:10:36.915
ASH: So, Professor,
what do you think?

00:10:37.849 --> 00:10:38.616
SERENA: Is it a new Pokémon?

00:10:40.084 --> 00:10:42.954
SYCAMORE: Well, I really can't
say yetbut I have been busy

00:10:42.954 --> 00:10:44.522
trying to find answers since
you first contacted me.

00:10:45.824 --> 00:10:47.192
Talking with several
research institutes.

00:10:48.726 --> 00:10:50.295
SYCAMORE: There's no record of
anything like Squishy anywhere.

00:10:52.363 --> 00:10:54.199
SYCAMORE: So, until we
can have a thorough look

00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:55.266
at Squishy's DNA structure...

00:10:57.335 --> 00:10:58.570
SYCAMORE: We won't know
anything for certain.

00:11:00.772 --> 00:11:02.207
BONNIE: Just what are
you anyway, Squishy?

00:11:03.274 --> 00:11:04.342
SQUISHY: [NON‐COMMITTAL]

00:11:05.944 --> 00:11:06.778
NURSE JOY: I told you I told
you I was sorry didn't I?

00:11:07.378 --> 00:11:08.513
AUDINO: [UPSET]

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:12.483
SYCAMORE: My goodness

00:11:12.483 --> 00:11:14.419
ASH: And they're at it again...

00:11:14.419 --> 00:11:16.020
SERENA: Won't the both of
you relax, please?!

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:19.824
CLEMONT: When did you two
start fighting like this?

00:11:21.192 --> 00:11:22.493
NURSE JOY: Well, it started
even before we were sent

00:11:23.261 --> 00:11:23.928
to this Pokémon Center...

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.238
NURSE JOY:
An Audino?!

00:11:33.972 --> 00:11:34.672
AUDINO: [GREETING]

00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:37.308
NURSE JOY: Everybody
else has a Wigglytuff!

00:11:38.576 --> 00:11:39.978
So why am I the only
one with an Audino, huh?

00:11:41.646 --> 00:11:42.614
HEAD NURSE: When you focus on
something, you have a slight

00:11:44.048 --> 00:11:45.683
tendency to forget everything
else that's going on around you.

00:11:49.187 --> 00:11:51.456
HEAD NURSE: So we've decided it
would be best to team you up

00:11:51.456 --> 00:11:53.224
with an experienced veteran
assistant, this Audino.

00:11:54.292 --> 00:11:55.293
NURSE JOY: Aw. Oh no

00:11:57.061 --> 00:12:00.465
HEAD NURSE: This Audino has been
practicing a long time. I think

00:12:00.465 --> 00:12:02.367
you'll agree it's exceptionally
experienced and skilled.

00:12:03.835 --> 00:12:06.004
HEAD NURSE: I'm sure Audino will
be of great assistance to you.

00:12:06.004 --> 00:12:07.138
AUDINO: [HAPPY]

00:12:10.408 --> 00:12:12.777
NURSE JOY: You see, I have my
own way of thinking

00:12:12.777 --> 00:12:14.612
and doing my work. You may
have a lot of experience,

00:12:15.513 --> 00:12:16.981
but it's not going to help me.

00:12:16.981 --> 00:12:17.582
AUDINO: [DISPLEASED]

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.286
CLEMONT: I guess they both
have a very strong sense of

00:12:21.286 --> 00:12:22.320
responsibility, don't they?

00:12:23.922 --> 00:12:25.123
SYCAMORE: Say, there's
something I've been meaning

00:12:25.123 --> 00:12:25.990
to ask you, Nurse Joy.

00:12:28.426 --> 00:12:29.661
SYCAMORE: I believe that
you were the one who

00:12:29.661 --> 00:12:30.395
found this, right?

00:12:32.063 --> 00:12:32.864
NURSE JOY: Why, yes.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.536
NURSE JOY: Look here.
When Audino and I were looking

00:12:38.536 --> 00:12:39.470
for a better method
of treating Pokémon...

00:12:40.405 --> 00:12:41.539
I ran across this book.

00:12:44.075 --> 00:12:45.276
SYCAMORE: You don't
say, that's the book

00:12:45.276 --> 00:12:47.211
I wrote on Mega Evolution.

00:12:47.211 --> 00:12:49.247
NURSE JOY: That's right! And
reading this very book is

00:12:49.247 --> 00:12:50.615
how I learned that Audino
could Mega Evolve!

00:12:52.383 --> 00:12:53.351
ASH: Audino can Mega Evolve?!

00:12:54.552 --> 00:12:55.820
CLEMONT: You wrote about that?

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.722
SYCAMORE: I did.

00:12:57.722 --> 00:13:00.258
NURSE JOY: That's when I got
an idea! If I could somehow

00:13:00.258 --> 00:13:03.361
increase Audino's healing powers
by using Mega Evolution,

00:13:03.361 --> 00:13:04.429
we could use it
to treat Pokémon!

00:13:05.596 --> 00:13:07.498
AUDINO: [SURPRISED]

00:13:07.498 --> 00:13:08.766
ASH: So that's why you were
looking for a Mega Stone, huh!

00:13:09.434 --> 00:13:10.635
PIKACHU: [COMPREHENDING]

00:13:10.635 --> 00:13:11.803
NURSE JOY: That's right.

00:13:11.803 --> 00:13:13.705
AUDINO: [PLEASED]

00:13:13.705 --> 00:13:14.973
SERENA: Well, maybe you
should have talked to Audino

00:13:14.973 --> 00:13:17.075
about that first.

00:13:17.075 --> 00:13:19.577
NURSE JOY: But I wanted to
surprise Audino by secretly

00:13:19.577 --> 00:13:21.279
finding a Mega Stone first,
then presenting it as a gift!

00:13:23.214 --> 00:13:24.549
BONNIE: Like giving someone a
present at a surprise party!

00:13:25.683 --> 00:13:27.251
AUDINO: [SURPRISED]
AUDINO: [HAPPY]

00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:29.387
NURSE JOY: I'm so sorry, Audino.

00:13:29.387 --> 00:13:31.255
SYCAMORE: Good! I'm glad
you've cleared up your

00:13:31.255 --> 00:13:34.559
misunderstanding. Also I
happen to have a miniature test

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:37.495
synchronizer with me. Why don't
we discover just what kind of

00:13:37.495 --> 00:13:39.330
Mega Stone you found? Okay?

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:40.465
NURSE JOY: That
would be wonderful!

00:13:40.465 --> 00:13:41.332
AUDINO: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:13:44.936 --> 00:13:46.404
MEOWTH: There are plenty of
Poké Balls in that room

00:13:48.272 --> 00:13:50.842
JESSIE: So let's go and
grab every last one of them!

00:13:50.842 --> 00:13:52.276
MEOWTH: Sounds to me
like secret weapon time!

00:13:53.544 --> 00:13:54.946
JAMES: Whatever that is.
Turn this thing up!

00:13:56.247 --> 00:13:57.749
SYCAMORE: Let's
see what Mega Stone you have.

00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:59.317
JAMES: A Mega Stone?!

00:13:59.317 --> 00:14:00.051
JESSIE: That's
what the man said!

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.878
SYCAMORE: There's no doubt
about it. It's an Audinite!

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:29.113
NURSE JOY: Can it
really be true?!

00:14:29.113 --> 00:14:29.914
AUDINO: [PLEASED]

00:14:33.051 --> 00:14:34.719
SYCAMORE: Here, Audino.
You should hold on to this.

00:14:36.287 --> 00:14:38.156
AUDINO: [AWED]

00:14:38.156 --> 00:14:38.856
SYCAMORE: I'm sure it will
come in handy someday.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.494
AUDINO: [HAPPY]

00:14:45.163 --> 00:14:46.431
SERENA: What's that?!

00:14:46.431 --> 00:14:46.798
NURSE JOY: It came
from the garden!

00:14:50.101 --> 00:14:51.235
ASH: A Poké Ball?

00:14:51.235 --> 00:14:52.003
PIKACHU: [SURPRISED]

00:14:56.874 --> 00:14:57.708
ASH: What's going on here?!

00:14:59.043 --> 00:15:01.279
NURSE JOY: All
the Pokémon! Oh NO!

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:03.014
JESSIE: Enough to
last a long time.

00:15:03.014 --> 00:15:04.715
JAMES: It's a towering
treasure trove!

00:15:04.715 --> 00:15:06.818
SYCAMORE: You guys again, oh no!

00:15:06.818 --> 00:15:07.518
EMILIO: You'd better
stop it, you bad guys!

00:15:08.986 --> 00:15:11.155
JESSIE: Prepare for trouble,
you Twerps are the creeps!

00:15:11.155 --> 00:15:12.723
JAMES: And make it double;
we're in this for keeps!

00:15:14.058 --> 00:15:16.094
JESSIE: To protect the
world from devastation!

00:15:16.094 --> 00:15:19.263
JAMES: To unite all
people within our nation!

00:15:19.263 --> 00:15:20.498
JESSIE: To denounce the evils
of not getting our share!

00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:23.668
JAMES: Which in this case is
everything; hoarders beware!

00:15:24.635 --> 00:15:25.770
JESSIE: Jessie!

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:26.604
JAMES: And James

00:15:27.605 --> 00:15:28.873
JESSIE: Team
Rocket blasts

00:15:28.873 --> 00:15:30.575
off at the speed of light!

00:15:30.575 --> 00:15:31.943
JAMES: Since
we've got your Poké Balls,

00:15:31.943 --> 00:15:33.344
we've won the fight!

00:15:33.344 --> 00:15:34.312
MEOWTH: Meowth, that's right!

00:15:39.317 --> 00:15:39.917
NURSE JOY:
Who's Team Rocket?

00:15:41.085 --> 00:15:43.387
ASH: Bad guys who
steal people's Pokémon!

00:15:43.387 --> 00:15:44.288
NURSE JOY: So that
means our Pokémon...

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.359
MEOWTH: Say no more, DOPE!
We're catching 'em all and I've

00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:50.194
improved my Mega‐Mega Meoh,
which is even stronger

00:15:50.862 --> 00:15:52.630
than Mega Evolution!

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:53.898
JAMES: Presenting
the all‐powerful

00:15:53.898 --> 00:15:56.000
Giga Evolution Giant!

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.368
JESSIE: It's called
the Giga‐Giga Meowth Machine!

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.806
JESSIE: At first we thought we'd
just take all the Poké Balls in

00:16:01.806 --> 00:16:04.709
the Pokémon Center, but now
we've put your Pikachu

00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:05.943
on our list of
goodies to grab, too!

00:16:07.712 --> 00:16:10.648
JAMES: And all of your Mega
Evolution chatter has also

00:16:10.648 --> 00:16:13.451
convinced us to take that
Mega Stone away from you!

00:16:13.451 --> 00:16:15.019
JESSIE: A catch that's
long overdue! Meowth?

00:16:15.019 --> 00:16:16.220
MEOWTH: Ya‐HOO!

00:16:20.358 --> 00:16:22.193
MEOWTH: Giga‐Giga Meowth
Machine? Do your thing!

00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:28.566
JESSIE: All right, Meowth

00:16:28.566 --> 00:16:29.834
JAMES: Let's reel the Twerp in!

00:16:29.834 --> 00:16:30.601
MEOWTH: Let the fun begin!

00:16:37.542 --> 00:16:38.276
NURSE JOY:
You stop right there!

00:16:39.177 --> 00:16:40.745
AUDINO: [ANGRY]

00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:41.879
MEOWTH:
What's the deal?

00:16:43.147 --> 00:16:45.449
NURSE JOY: Now look.
This is my Pokémon Center!

00:16:45.449 --> 00:16:47.051
You won't get away with this!

00:16:47.051 --> 00:16:48.920
AUDINO: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.888
JESSIE: Pikachu's worth
more to us than to Twerps!

00:16:50.888 --> 00:16:52.523
MEOWTH: You read my mind.

00:16:52.523 --> 00:16:53.591
NURSE JOY: You ready, Audino?!

00:16:53.591 --> 00:16:54.325
AUDINO: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:16:56.594 --> 00:16:57.361
SYCAMORE: I knew it!

00:16:59.263 --> 00:17:00.464
SYCAMORE: Here!
Nurse Joy, take this!

00:17:05.169 --> 00:17:08.339
SYCAMORE: With that, you and
Audino can do this together!

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.775
Mega Evolution will only occur
when two hearts are bound

00:17:10.775 --> 00:17:12.810
together into one!

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:13.744
NURSE JOY: Audino!
AUDINO: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:17:15.513 --> 00:17:16.681
JAMES: Now that they're
together, let's make our move!

00:17:17.782 --> 00:17:19.016
JESSIE: You heard
that, Meowth! Do it!

00:17:19.016 --> 00:17:19.884
MEOWTH: It's a giga gala!

00:17:20.685 --> 00:17:22.720
