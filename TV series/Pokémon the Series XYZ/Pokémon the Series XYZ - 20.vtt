PALERMO: By how you were moving.

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:04.624
PALERMO: I see you can barely
make a fist. You'll need to

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:07.761
forfeit the finals. You can't
put on a proper performance

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.096
like this.
Much less defeat Aria.

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:16.770
SERENA: Forfeit?
But this is our big dream.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:22.208

ambitions, but I finally have

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:24.010
one with my Pokémon.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.379
SERENA: We've made it this far.

I don't want
to stop 'til it's over!

00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:32.218
ARIA: I don't
want to stop 'til it's over!

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.956
PALERMO: Seriously.
You two are so much alike

00:07:38.258 --> 00:07:42.128
PALERMO: Just one performance.
I can make it hold until then.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:45.332
PALERMO: But have a doctor look
at it afterward. Promise that

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:46.733
you'll do that, alright?

00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:49.469

00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:54.474

our reigning Kalos Queen, Aria!

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:20.000

to hold back against someone

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.334
who's that determined, for sure.

00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:26.706

no intention of losing either

00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:53.753
ARIA: All
right, Delphox, Mystical Fire!

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:56.055
ARIA: Vivillon, use Psybeam!

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:58.057

AROMATISSE: [REFLECT MOVE]

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.912
SERENA: She gives
such an awesome performance

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.550
SERENA: Her smile brings
everyone such strength and joy!

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:28.254
SERENA: Funny. I'm
always the one getting strength

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.689
from everybody else.

00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:37.997
‐ARIA: And that's all!
‐ASH: Awesome!

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:40.466
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]
CLEMONT: No surprise there!

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:44.137
PIERRE: So, these two
lovely and talented ladies have

00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:46.039
finished their
exciting performances.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.040
PIERRE: Grab your Glow Casters.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.543
And get ready
to cast your votes.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.278
PIERRE: Everybody ready to go?

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:58.251
PIERRE: Undeuxtrois!

00:11:58.785 --> 00:11:59.919
GRACE: Go!

00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:06.125
PIERRE: Will a new Kalos Queen
be crowned? Or will the reigning

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.360
queen hold onto
her current status?

00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:10.530
The fateful
moment of decision is now!

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:27.680
PIERRE: The revered title
of Kalos Queen belongs to

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:31.517
PIERRE: Performer Aria!

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:33.453
The reigning Queen
has defended her crown!

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.624
BONNIE: Oh no. Aria won.

00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:39.192
CLEMONT: Serena did the
best she could. She was great.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.395
ASH: And she's still
got a dream to hold on to!

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:43.563
CLEMONT: Right!

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.803
PIERRE: And with her brilliant
performance, Aria is still Kalos

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:52.605
Queen! Klefki?
Her tiara, please!

00:12:54.307 --> 00:12:55.642
KLEFKI: [EXCITED]

00:12:56.843 --> 00:12:58.745
KLEFKI: [HAPPY]

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:05.218
SERENA: Aria sure is amazing.

00:13:05.218 --> 00:13:06.286
BRAIXEN: [DISAPPOINTED]

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:09.155

PANCHAM:
[SURPRISED] [EMBARRASSED]

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.163
ARIA: Serena? Wow, that
was fun! Let's perform together

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:18.698
again sometime.

00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:25.438
SERENA: Great! I'm going to keep
working hard. And pretty soon

00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:27.340
I'll become Kalos Queen!

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.608
ARIA: Then bring it on!

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:36.082
PIERRE: And that concludes our
Master Class. Until the next

00:13:36.082 --> 00:13:40.119
time! When we discover who
will be the next performer to

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:45.058
challenge our Kalos Queen Aria!
So, until we all gather around

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:47.660
this beautiful and exciting
stage once again, au revoir!

00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:50.830
DOCTOR: There.
DOCTOR: You'll be fine.

00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:54.033
Just take
it easy and don't overdo it.

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:54.734
‐SERENA: Right.
‐DOCTOR: Take care.

00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:56.602
SERENA: Thanks, doctor.

00:13:59.372 --> 00:14:00.373
PALERMO : How do you feel?

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:04.711
SERENA: I'm feeling fine now.
Thank you so

00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:05.778
PALERMO: Don't ever
push yourself like that again.

00:14:07.647 --> 00:14:09.048
PALERMO: Especially
if you want to beat Aria.

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:12.852
SERENA: Yes, you're right.

00:14:14.554 --> 00:14:18.157
SERENA: You saidI couldn't beat
Aria. I remember it exactly.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:25.631
SERENA: Something Aria has that
I don't I think I know now what

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:27.266
that is after watching
her performance just now.

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:28.868
SERENA: I have lots to learn.

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:32.071
My friends and
Pokémon are always the ones

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:33.239
who are there supporting me...

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:39.379
SERENA: Aria has a gift. She
makes people smile. And she once

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.747
gave me advice even
though she didn't know me.

00:14:41.614 --> 00:14:42.715
She's a giving person

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:48.187
SERENA: I know I've been on the
receiving end until now. But I

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.856
want to become queen
so I can give back to

00:14:49.856 --> 00:14:52.291
everybody else, too.

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:54.894
SERENA: I want to give people
strength, make them smile,

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.796
give good
advice‐‐even give tough love.

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:00.900
SERENA: That means I've
got to work so much harder!

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.169
So I can be a good queen!

00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:08.107
PALERMO: Now that you realize
that, you'll become an even

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.208
better performer.

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:12.545
PALERMO: Would you
like to learn with me?

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:16.649
SERENA:
What are you talking about?

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:18.351
PALERMO:
I'll teach you everything.

00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:19.786
About being a performer

00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:22.488
PALERMO: You don't
have to answer right now.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:24.891
Give it some
thought and let me know.

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.403

BONNIE: Wow,
Serena, you were so close!

00:15:42.008 --> 00:15:44.243
SERENA: Yeah. All of you put
your faith in me, but I lost.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.313
MIETTE:
What are you talking about?

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:49.749
MIETTE: For us, it's
a brand‐new start. You see?

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:51.784
NINI: I'm going to come up
with lots of new performance

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.120
routines. They're
gonna knock your socks off!

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.922
SHAUNA: All my
losing days are over.

00:15:55.922 --> 00:15:56.789
SERENA: Yeah, mine, too!

00:15:57.857 --> 00:16:00.393
MIETTE:
Andthere's you‐know‐who

PIKACHU: [CONFUSED]
SERENA: Miette!

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.234

See you later! Take care, Ash!

JESSIE: Know what I think?
Let's have a feast!

00:16:37.063 --> 00:16:39.065
JAMES: You're not off the rails?

00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:41.834
JESSIE: Of course not! I was
able to make it this far because

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:44.437
of you. It‐‐makes
me want to sing

00:16:44.437 --> 00:16:47.840
MEOWTH: Whoa. Whaddaya know.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.908

GOURGEIST, INKAY : OUR JESSIE!

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:53.779
JAMES: We'll
follow you forever, Jessie!

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:55.448
JESSIE: The feast
is on your wallet, James!

00:16:55.448 --> 00:16:56.182
JAMES: With pleasure.

00:17:00.987 --> 00:17:02.588
SERENA: I tried.
But I came up a bit short.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.758
GRACE: What matters
is you did your very best.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.028
GRACE: Now you simply
move towards your next goal.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.101
GRACE: I've gotta scoot.
Rhyhorn's waiting for me.

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:17.503
SERENA: But Mom!

00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:23.809
SERENA: It's nothing!

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:24.944
GRACE: Right. Bye!

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.947
BONNIE: Bye‐bye!

00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:29.081
CLEMONT: Have a safe trip!
ASH: Take care!

00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:40.993
ASH: What's wrong? Does it hurt?

00:17:42.128 --> 00:17:43.963
SERENA: Oh, no.
I've been sitting here thinking

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:47.600
ASH: Yeah. I'll bet you
were thinking about your next

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.401
performance, weren't you?

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:52.204
SERENA: You could say that.

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:55.308
ASH: Of course! When I lose a
battle, I get so excited about

00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:56.742
what I'm gonna do next time.
My next strategy!

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.946
Then I know I'm gonna win.

00:17:59.946 --> 00:18:01.547
SERENA: It's great
you're always so positive, Ash.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.284
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.788
SERENA: It all seems
to come so naturally for you.

00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:11.757
BRAIXEN: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.526
ASH: Seriously?
I don't always know what to do.

00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:16.028
ASH: But then

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:22.401
ASH: If I really think about it,
I'd rather do stuff! 'Cause

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:25.037
even if I goof up,
I learn something.

00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:26.672
ASH: There's nothing we could
ever do that's a waste of time!

00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:27.607
SERENA: Oh Ash

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:32.144
ASH: Okay, time to hit the sack.
We've got an

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:33.479
early morning tomorrow!

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:34.580
SERENA: Yeah!

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:46.926
SERENA: Ms. Palermo!

00:18:52.365 --> 00:18:55.034
PALERMO: My, you're up early.
I hope you're here to say yes.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.306
SERENA: Thank you. Your
offer has made me really happy.

00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:06.112
SERENA: I just can't go
with you right now. I'm sorry!

00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:09.415
PALERMO: Dear. Why not?

00:19:09.415 --> 00:19:10.516
I think it's a
great opportunity for you.

00:19:12.118 --> 00:19:14.620
SERENA: I know I should accept
it without a second thought,

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.657
but I don't think it's right to
go with you and then leave Ash

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:20.192
and the others behind. It kind
of feels like it wouldn't be the

00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:21.093
right thing to do.

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:22.795
PALERMO: They're your friends?

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:27.967
SERENA: In the beginning, my
journey was just me looking for

00:19:27.967 --> 00:19:29.168
an excuse to get
out of my house

00:19:32.138 --> 00:19:33.572
SERENA: But after
becoming a performer

00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:39.679
SERENA: and
meeting my rivalsand Aria

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:42.515
SERENA: I wanted
to learn everything.

00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:44.817
Everything
about being a performer!

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:46.786
BRAIXEN: [EXCITED]

00:19:46.786 --> 00:19:48.020
PANCHAM: [EXCITED]

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.889
SYLVEON: [EXCITED]

00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:52.058
SERENA: I need to make it
through my journey first.

00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:54.193
And then when I've
finally gotten to that point,

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.528
I'll be ready!

00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:01.834
PALERMO: All right.

00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:05.071
PALERMO: Keep on your
journey to your heart's content.

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:07.540
PALERMO: And once you're
all ready for the next step,

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:09.809
you just give me a call.

00:20:23.089 --> 00:20:25.424
SERENA: All right,
Ash, you're up next.

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:28.461
ASH: Yeah, the Snowbelle Gym.
I'm gonna train hard and WIN!

00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:30.329
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:31.163
CLEMONT: And you know that
we're here for you all the way!

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:34.433
BONNIE: You're
super‐excited, aren't you?

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:35.334
ASH: You bet!
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:38.871
SERENA: Yeah, and
I'll keep moving forward, too!

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:43.342
NARRATOR: Although Serena put
on a spectacular performance in

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:45.211
the Master Class, she
fell short of defeating Aria.

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:49.982
But her future is looking
bright! Her road to becoming

00:20:49.982 --> 00:20:53.085
Kalos Queen still lies ahead,
as the journey continues!
