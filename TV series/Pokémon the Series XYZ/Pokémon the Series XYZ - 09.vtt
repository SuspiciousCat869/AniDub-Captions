continue toward Snowbelle City,

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.793
they now take a detour to see
Terminus Cave, thanks to a

SERENA: I heard this mine
was abandoned years ago,

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:50.417
but now it's home to many
wild Pokémon, so it attracts

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.852
a lot of Trainers.

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.520

it's dangerous!

00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:24.171

worry about it, Bonnie.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.652

simply too advanced for it!

00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:28.267
BRYONY: What a joke.

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:30.002
CELOSIA: Totally.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:32.038
BONNIE: Squishy?!

00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:33.839
ASH: Hey, Squishy?!

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.008
SERENA: Come on out!

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:36.742
CLEMONT: Squishy?!

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:38.944
PIKACHU: [CALLING]

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:41.047
SERENA: Not here.

00:19:41.047 --> 00:19:42.915
ASH: If Squishy got away from
them, it's probably hiding

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:45.151
somewhere around here.

00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:47.219
CLEMONT: Maybe it doesn't want
to cause us any more trouble...

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:48.621
BONNIE: NO WAY!

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.491
BONNIE: Squishy
protected us, right?

00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:57.296
BONNIE: Remember, Squishy's
our friend! I'm sure it's

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:58.898
waiting for us somewhere!

00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:01.033
ASH: Yeah, you're right.

00:20:02.168 --> 00:20:03.069
CLEMONT: I'm
sure it's waiting, too!

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:05.671
PIKACHU: [AGREEING]

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:06.639
DEDENNE: [HELPFUL]

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.141
NOIBAT: [ENCOURAGING]

00:20:09.141 --> 00:20:09.975
BONNIE: Yeah!

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.011
BONNIE: Well find you, Squishy!

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.981
NARRATOR: Our heroes are
being confronted with many

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:20.152
mysteries, one after the other!
Why did Squishy run away from

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:22.254
Bonnieand what exactly
is Squishy all about?

00:20:23.489 --> 00:20:25.391
The answers, as the
journey continues!

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:31.464
XEROSIC: We've
finally got clear footage

00:20:31.464 --> 00:20:33.199
of what Z1 looks like
merged with its Cells!

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.535
LYSANDRE: It appears to
be better able to move.

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:37.903
XEROSIC: It will
require much more study.

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:41.474
I feel we have yet to see
the true power of Z.

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:43.809
LYSANDRE: What about Z2?

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:46.045
XEROSIC: We're in
the process of searching.

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:48.714
But it's only
just a matter of time...
