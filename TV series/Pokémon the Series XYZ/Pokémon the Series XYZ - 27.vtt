little bit cold sitting on

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.030
the ice like that?

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.501
WULFRIC: You know what? When you
get to the point where I'mat,

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:57.337
you can feel a heated heart
even sitting on ice. So being

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:59.005
here is
absolutely comfortable for me.

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.175
WULFRIC:
I remember you from before...

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.979

PUPIL: All right! This Snowbelle
City Gym battle is

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:48.288
about to begin! Each side will
have the use of three Pokémon,

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.091
and the battle will be over when
all three of one Trainer's

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:54.528
Pokémon are unable to continue!
Only the challenger will be

00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:56.129
allowed to make
substitutions during the battle!

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:02.569
WULFRIC: Y'know what? Ice is
extremely hard and fragile at

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.471
the same time.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.439
WULFRIC: So depending on what
Pokémon you choose

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.542
and their moves,

00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:11.144
I could be you're most
challenging opponent yet, or a

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.513
total pushover
which is as it should be.

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:16.249

entire battlefield!
And that hail can cause a

it takes is slowly healed.

00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:50.130
ASH: Slowly healed?!
PIKACHU: [CONCERNED]

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.832
SERENA: I see...So that's why
Wulfric used Abomasnow first.

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.100
ASH: Keep it up! High Jump Kick!

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.537

00:09:23.196 --> 00:09:24.297
HAWLUCHA: [STUNNED]

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:28.935
PUPIL: Hawlucha is unable to
battle! Avalugg is the winner!

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:30.570
BONNIE: Oh no...

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.604
CLEMONT: The hail really worked.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.207
SERENA: So now it's one to one.

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:35.108
SAWYER: Yup. Even!

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.578
ASH: Hawlucha,
you were awesome. Thanks.

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:50.290
ASH: All right,
Talonflame I choose you!

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.261
TALONFLAME: [APPEARING]

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.963
ASH: Okay,
Talonflame, make sure you watch

00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:57.931
out for that hail!

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:01.000
ASH: Use Flame Charge, go!

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.535
TALONFLAME: [FLAME CHARGE MOVE]

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:04.404

That was a great hit!

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.509
SAWYER:
Super effective. What a hit!

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:10.677
AVALUGG: [PAINED]

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:15.181
BONNIE: Avalugg's still healing!

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.282
CLEMONT: Then this
could still go either way!

00:10:18.318 --> 00:10:19.552
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:20.987
WULFRIC: Use Avalanche!

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.689
AVALUGG: [AVALANCHE MOVE]

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:23.590
ASH: Heads up!
TALONFLAME: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:25.625
AVALUGG: [AVALANCHE MOVE]

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:29.129
ASH: No, Talonflame!

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.197
TALONFLAME: [PAINED]

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.400
ASH: Talonflame, you okay?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.402
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:38.605
SERENA: What power...

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:41.174
CLEMONT: You see, Avalanche
becomes more powerful

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:43.910
when it's used against a Pokémon
that has attacked the user.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.978
SERENA: So even if Ash
is faster than his opponent...

00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:49.082
CLEMONT: Wulfric will
use that speed against him.

00:10:49.082 --> 00:10:49.849
ASH:
You've gotta get up, Talonflame!

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.719
PIKACHU: [ENCOURAGING]
TALONFLAME: [DETERMINED]

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:54.721
WULFRIC: Avalugg, Stone Edge!

00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:55.655
AVALUGG: [STONE EDGE MOVE]
ASH: Dodge it!

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.924
TALONFLAME: [DODGING]

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.326
ASH: Way to go!

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.761
CLEMONT: As things are,

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:03.029
Ash will have to be very
careful when he attacks!

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:07.033
SAWYER: Or Wulfric
will counter with Avalanche.

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.701
ASH: But...we can't
win unless we attack.

00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:12.739
ASH:
Talonflame, use Flame Charge!

00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:15.041
TALONFLAME: [FLAME CHARGE MOVE]

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:16.876
AVALUGG: [IMPACT] [DEFLECTING]

00:11:16.876 --> 00:11:17.710
WULFRIC: Use Avalanche!

00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:19.746
AVALUGG: [AVALANCHE MOVE]

00:11:19.746 --> 00:11:20.980
TALONFLAME: [PAINED]

00:11:22.215 --> 00:11:23.583
ASH: Talonflame!

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:24.584
PIKACHU: [CALLING]

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:26.486
TALONFLAME: [IMPACT]

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:30.156
PUPIL: Talonflame
is unable to battle!

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:31.357
So Avalugg is the winner!

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.429
ASH: Avalugg...is so strong...

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:41.568
SERENA: What can Ash do?
How can he beat Avalanche?

00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:43.036
SAWYER: And,
Ash has only one Pokémon left.

00:11:45.672 --> 00:11:46.873
ASH: Thanks, Talonflame.
Take a good rest...

00:11:50.343 --> 00:11:52.579
ASH: NowGreninja! I choose you!

00:11:58.685 --> 00:11:59.485
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"Who's that Pokémon?"

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:06.793
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE: "It's
Bergmite!"

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.002
BONNIE:
Greninja's his last chance!

00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:19.606
CLEMONT: This tension.
If Ash can use that energy

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:22.542
SAWYER: Then it'll
transform into Ash‐Greninja!

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.144
GRENINJA: [QUESTIONING]

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:26.546

about the hail, Greninja!

SERENA: Hey,
what just happened, Clemont?

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:41.688
CLEMONT: It appears that when
the water from Greninja's Water

00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:43.656
Shuriken hit
Avalugg's body, it froze!

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.158

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:45.992

say I'm quite surprised.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.602

say we give them a little taste

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:58.304

Greninja takes a hit, Ash can

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:51.090
feel it, too! Is that possible?

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.859

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:16.502
flexible? Some adapt
like water without changing,

00:17:16.502 --> 00:17:18.905
but I'm stubborn.
I love Ice Types.

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:20.773
WULFRIC: So.
What about youyoung man?

00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:29.382
WULFRIC: How far you go depends
on how much you believe in your

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:33.553
Pokémon. The fact is you haven't
earned your badge quite yet.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:53.272
ASH/PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:56.108
ASH: How's Greninja?

00:17:56.108 --> 00:17:57.310
NURSE JOY: I'm afraid your
Greninja has taken

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.412
a substantial amount of damage.

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:01.013
But it'll
be fine. I'll make sure of it.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.459
ASH: You're leaving now?

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:15.494
SAWYER: Yeah. I need to get my
Pokémon all ready

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:16.596
to go for the Kalos League.

00:18:19.332 --> 00:18:21.100
SAWYER: Bye, Ash.
I'll be waiting for you.

00:18:22.068 --> 00:18:23.169
ASH: Yeah.

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.577
SAWYER: Okay then,
everybody, see you around.

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:32.678
BONNIE: Bye bye!

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:34.180
DEDENNE: [FAREWELL]

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.247
SERENA: You take care!

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:43.756
SAWYER: It's all gonna work out.
The person I admire so much

00:18:43.756 --> 00:18:48.794
will win in the end. And I'll
be waiting. I'll be waiting.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.298
Bye, Ash.
See you in the Kalos League.

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:04.644
ASH:
Sorry about today, Greninja.

00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:07.346
If I had just been stronger...

00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:11.617
ASH: I should've been able
to draw out your true power.

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.254
ASH: If only I was stronger...

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:20.793
SERENA/CLEMONT/PIKACHU:
[QUESTIONING]

00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:23.095
SERENA: Ash...

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:31.170
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:34.540
ASH: I wanna be by myself...

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.342
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:37.176
CLEMONT: Out in the
cold at this time of night?

00:19:38.711 --> 00:19:41.447
ASH: It's okay. I'll
be back soon. Sorry, Pikachu.

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:45.618
PIKACHU: [SAD]

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:09.775
SERENA: He still
hasn't come back yet.

00:20:09.775 --> 00:20:11.177
CLEMONT: Yeah.
But there's really nothing we

00:20:11.177 --> 00:20:13.446
can do about it.

00:20:13.446 --> 00:20:17.616
BONNIE:
Good morning! Hey, where's Ash?

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:19.051
DEDENNE: [QUESTIONING]
SQUISHY: [QUESTIONING]

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:20.986
SERENA: Ash, he needed
to be alone for a little bit.

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:24.423
CLEMONT: Don't worry. He'll get
hungry and come back when it

00:20:24.423 --> 00:20:25.357
gets close to lunchtime...

00:20:32.832 --> 00:20:34.166
SERENA: Ash...

00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:41.807
NARRATOR: After losing his
Snowbelle City Gym battle, Ash

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:45.611
is off by himself, looking for
answers. How will he handle the

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:48.647
situation he now finds
himself in? The answers to come,

00:20:49.782 --> 00:20:51.183
as the journey continues.
