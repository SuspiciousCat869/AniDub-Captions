SHINOBU: I realize that
I look very young

by having a battle with me

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:34.361

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.190
SANPEI: Greninja!

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.192
IPPEI: That's it!

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.560
SANPEI: Greninja, be strong!

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.229
ASH: Hang in there!

00:08:49.229 --> 00:08:50.363
PIKACHU: [CONCERNED]
FROGADIER: [CONCERNED]

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:51.865
GRENINJA: [GROAN]

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:55.435
SANPEI: I didn't stand a chance
against him. Not a chance.

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:57.003
HANZO: Indeed.

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:00.640
HANZO: You two left far too many
openings to beat him.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.509
Against anyone else you
should have been able

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:03.910
to claim victory with your

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.011
very first Night Slash.

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:09.315
SANPEI: Chief? I guess
I don't understand.

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:13.820
IPPEI: You must not have
noticed. Venusaur skillfully

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.522
blocked your Night Slash mere
moments before it made contact.

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.327
SANPEI: It blocked
it that fast?!

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.131
NIHEI: We took the least amount
of damage and waited for an

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.500
opportunity to counterattack.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.770
ASH: Guess I should expect that
from the number two ninja

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.573
HANZO: That said, you still
battled well against Venusaur,

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.076
who has a type
advantage over Greninja.

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.678
Quite commendable. You've grown!

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:40.513
SANPEI: Thank you!

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:43.149
IPPEI: It's easy to see that
you've trained very hard

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:45.118
with Greninja. And I hope you'll
keep up the good work.

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:46.920
SANPEI: Right!
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:55.929
JESSIE: Who would've
thought ninja boy's

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:58.498
home would be in that place?

00:09:58.498 --> 00:10:00.867
JAMES: Greninja and Venusaur
ey I'll bet there are more

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:03.369
skilled Pokémon
in residence, too.

00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:05.805
MEOWTH: And, if we get our paws
on that bunch, we can form a

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:07.307
Team Rocket nifty
ninja squad! Yeah!

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.510
JAMES: Creative. Strengthening
ourselves with ninja power!

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:14.781
Conquering Kalos will be like
a walk in the ninja park!

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.149
MEOWTH: Catching them
all is where it's at.

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:18.852
Creativity's my middle name!

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:20.920
JESSIE: We're going to show our
strength to the citizens

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.522
of Ninja Village, won't we?!

00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:24.090
JAMES, MEOWITH : Yeah!

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.291

HEIDAYU, NINJA GROUP: Sir!

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.110
ASH, SERENA, CLEMONT, BONNIE :
"Who's that Pokémon?"

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:50.950
ASH, SERENA, CLEMONT, BONNIE :
"It's Venusaur!"

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:08.568
BONNIE: This is like a secret
base. It's so exciting!

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:11.271
DEDENNE: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:12.272
SERENA: So you have these
natural caves for your homes!

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:15.408
CLEMONT: They sure look
like really comfortable

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:16.643
places to live.
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:18.711
SANPEI: Here!
Welcome to my room.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:21.347
SANPEI: Please,
come right on in.

00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:24.617
BONNIE: Wow, it's
really normal in here.

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.656
SANPEI: There's nothing
like being home.

00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:30.456
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:32.525
FROGADIER: [CURIOUS]

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:35.762
ASH: Look
at that! It's Froakie!

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.299
ASH: You took
this before you left?

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:40.733
DEDENNE: [PLAYING]
SANPEI: Yes.

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:41.401
To remember
things as they were then.

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:46.306
SANPEI: My goal is to become
the best Pokémon trainer in the

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:49.676
village. But‐‐I couldn't defeat
my brother Nihei. It's clear I

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:52.478
won't stand a chance
against Ippei, either.

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:56.382
I still need to
train a lot more!

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:59.786
CLEMONT: So what
are your plans now, Sanpei?

00:11:59.786 --> 00:12:01.888
SANPEI: I'm going to stay
here and train hard.

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:03.723
And help my
brothers out as well.

00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:06.359
SERENA: Help them how?

00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:08.228
SANPEI: Well, it's
been decided that Ippei

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.095
will become the next chief.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.397
ASH: The chief?!

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:13.399
SANPEI: Yes. Hanzo's going to
retire

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.768
after tomorrow's village
festival.

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:18.171
SANPEI: From now on, my
brothers and I

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:21.407
will be combining forces in
order to protect Ninja Village.

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:23.543
ASH: Awesome. I know the
three of you will be great!

00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:25.044
PIKACHU: [ENCOURAGING]
SANPEI: Thanks!

BONNIE: Dedenne? Squishy?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.967
BONNIE:
That's weird

00:12:49.402 --> 00:12:50.770
Dedenne? Squishy?

00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:53.640
ASH: What's wrong, Bonnie?

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.674
SANPEI: Do you think
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.345
CLEMONT: A trap door!

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:02.115
SANPEI: It's possible they
went through here and

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.082
got into the secret passageway.

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:04.851
BONNIE: I've gotta find them!

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:08.521
CLEMONT: Wait! It's too
dangerous! Sanpei!

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:09.689
What's down there anyway?!

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.094
ASH: Let's go down, too!

00:13:32.345 --> 00:13:33.279
SQUISHY: [IMPACT REACT]
Got you.

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:45.658
SANPEI: I thought they'd be
here. I'm so glad we found you!

00:13:46.793 --> 00:13:47.794
NIHEI: Oh. So they came
from your room then.

00:13:49.462 --> 00:13:51.097
BONNIE: I was so worried!

00:13:51.097 --> 00:13:52.131
DEDENNE, SQUISHY :
[APOLOGETIC RESPONSE]

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:53.232
CLEMONT: Excuse me.
That's my line.

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:58.471
SERENA: What an amazing place!

00:14:01.574 --> 00:14:02.642
ASH: And it's
all inside a cave

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.545
NIHEI: This is a
monument dedicated to the hero

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:07.080
of the village.
CLEMONT: Hero?

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.481
IPPEI: Yes.
Let me show you.

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:22.862
ASH: Look at that!

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.132
SERENA: Wow.
I think that's a Pokémon!

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:30.336
ASH: Does that mean the
village hero is a Pokémon then?

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:34.607
IPPEI: Correct. There's a legend
that states a fierce battle

00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:37.276
broke out between all the
ninja in our village.

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:39.579
BONNIE: Yeah? The ninja
were fighting other ninja?

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:41.681
SERENA: Why were they fighting?

00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:43.383
IPPEI: WellThere's no way to
find out what caused it now,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.452
but we do know the ones
who defended the village

00:14:46.452 --> 00:14:49.222
back then were Pokémon.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.591
IPPEI: And this Greninja was the
leader of those Pokémon.

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:57.096
IPPEI: Honestly? I chose Froakie
as my partner because I admired

00:14:57.096 --> 00:15:00.066
the village hero.
I raised Froakie, who evolved

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.868
into Frogadier, and
then into Greninja

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:05.071
SANPEI: Yeah. It's the
same story for me, too.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:05.772
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:15:06.873 --> 00:15:08.274
BONNIE: But that Greninja
looks different

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:09.475
than ones I've seen before.

00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:12.445
CLEMONT: Maybe you're right.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.191
SHINOBU: You're
really making that sparkle.

00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:32.465
HANZO: Yes. But in the end,
this is merely an accessory.

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.235
What really matters is having
the trust of all our villagers.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.305
I'm certain Ippei will be fine.

00:15:41.741 --> 00:15:44.944
HANZO: Oh my! No one makes
tea as delicious as you do,

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.679
dear Shinobu.

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:47.880

so much Hanzo.

them all, executing our plan
