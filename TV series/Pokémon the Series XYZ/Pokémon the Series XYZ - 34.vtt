SHAUNA: Clemont,
didn't you tell me

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:15.215
Ash lost to Sawyer a while back?

00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:18.718
CLEMONT:
I did. Never count Sawyer out!

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:20.620
TIERNO: Wait till you see this.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.322
Their battling
styles are different

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.890
still, he reminds me of Ash.

00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:26.726
TIERNO: It's like the
same sort of battle vibe

00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:28.328
is inside both of them.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.729
TREVOR: Wow. You think so?

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:32.899
CLEMONT: Sawyer's been
analyzing Ash's style

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.135
in order to catch up to him.

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:36.970
I would say that's exactly what
you're referring to, Tierno.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.372
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Interesting,

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:41.107
a match between a
Trainer like Ash,

and Sawyer,

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:43.977
who operates using
cool and calm analysis

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:47.080
DIANTHA: In a way,
they're exact opposites.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.782
I'm really looking forward

00:05:48.782 --> 00:05:50.083
to seeing what kind
of battle this will be.

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:52.619

much will win in the end.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.883
And I'll be waiting.

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:59.586

It gets up and moves only when

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:11.418

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:17.524
CLEMONT:
Slaking has quite a disadvantage

00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:19.893
against Hawlucha, though.
I wonder what Sawyer's planning

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:24.464
REFEREE:
All right, battle begin!

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:31.404
ASH: Let's go, Hawlucha!
Make the first move!

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.506
Use Karate Chop!

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:35.075
HAWLUCHA: [AFFIRMATIVE]
HAWLUCHA: [KARATE CHOP MOVE]

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.811
HAWLUCHA: [CHALLENGING]

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.183
SLAKING: [YAWNING]
HAWLUCHA: [SURPRISED]

00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:45.385
ASH: Now use High Jump Kick!

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:46.286
HAWLUCHA: [JUMPING]

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:49.656
HAWLUCHA: [HIGH JUMP KICK MOVE]

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:51.825
HAWLUCHA: [CHALLENGING]

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:54.194
ANNOUNCER: Really?

00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:55.862
While Hawlucha
aggressively attacks,

00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:57.464
Slaking's doing nothing at all!

00:09:58.398 --> 00:09:59.966
ASH: Use X‐Scissor!

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:01.734
HAWLUCHA: [X‐SCISSOR MOVE]

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.640
HAWLUCHA: [FRUSTRATED]

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.043
CLEMONT: Whenever
Hawlucha's having a battle,

00:10:10.043 --> 00:10:13.246
it usually gets worked up by
trading blows with its opponent.

00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:15.181
But if its
opponent doesn't move

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:17.383
SERENA: Things get difficult.

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:19.686
TIERNO: Just keep attacking!
If it's not gonna move,

00:10:19.686 --> 00:10:21.287
you'll eventually win the match!

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.323
ASH: Now, Karate Chop!

00:10:23.323 --> 00:10:27.627
HAWLUCHA: [KARATE CHOP MOVE]

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:31.431
SLAKING: [YAWNING]

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:33.900
ASH:
Hawlucha, use Karate Chop again!

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.702
HAWLUCHA: [AFFIRMATIVE]
HAWLUCHA: [KARATE CHOP MOVE]

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:37.704
ANNOUNCER: Hawlucha
unleashes fierce attacks!

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:39.372
Slaking must be feeling that!

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.407
HAWLUCHA: [PLEASED]

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.777
ANNOUNCER: Slaking is unfazed!

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.779
TIERNO: I think
Slaking's just acting tough.

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:48.715
BONNIE: Tough? What do you mean?

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:50.517
SAWYER:
Now, Slaking, use Slack Off!

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:52.619
SLAKING: [SLACK OFF MOVE]

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:54.187
CLEMONT: Right now?!

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.257
CLEMONT:
Slack Off is a move that

00:10:57.257 --> 00:11:00.460
allows the user to recover
its strength simply by relaxing!

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.962
TREVOR: Even so, if Slaking
keeps on taking hits like that,

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:04.397
it will eventually lose.

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.800
SERENA: I wonder what
Sawyer's strategy is.

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:16.442
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE, ACT
BREAK: "Who's that Pokémon?"

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:23.516
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"It's Slaking!"

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:38.498
ASH: No doubt about it.

00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:40.733
Sawyer's got something
up his sleeve.

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:42.936
If so, I've gotta beat
him before he acts on it!

00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:44.137
ASH: High Jump Kick, go!

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:47.006
HAWLUCHA: [HIGH JUMP KICK MOVE]

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:50.009
ASH: Now use X‐Scissor!

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:53.012
HAWLUCHA: [X‐SCISSOR MOVE]

00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:55.982
HAWLUCHA: [LANDING]

00:11:55.982 --> 00:11:57.183
HAWLUCHA: [SHOCKED]

00:11:57.183 --> 00:11:58.618
ASH: All right, Flying Press!

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:03.423
HAWLUCHA: [FLYING PRESS MOVE]

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:06.159
SAWYER:
Slaking, Counter! Let's go!

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:10.263
SLAKING: [COUNTER MOVE]

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:11.898
HAWLUCHA: [PAINED]

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:17.370
ASH: Hawlucha, no!

00:12:18.972 --> 00:12:20.039
BONNIE: Hawlucha!

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:21.407
DEDENNE: [WORRIED]

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.510
REFEREE:
Hawlucha is unable to battle!

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.012
SLAKING: [PLEASED]

00:12:26.012 --> 00:12:27.947
REFEREE: Slaking's the winner!

00:12:27.947 --> 00:12:30.149
ANNOUNCER: It looked like
Hawlucha had the upper hand,

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:32.151
but in one shot,
it's out of contention!

00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:37.090
ASH: Great job. You were
awesome. Now, take a good rest.

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:40.793
So that's what you
were after all along!

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:42.562
SAWYER: I always thought about
using Slaking against Hawlucha.

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:46.366
I knew Hawlucha wouldn't
have such an easy time

00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:47.967
if its opponent didn't defend.

00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:51.471
ASH: I'm impressed.

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:55.141
You took Hawlucha's battling
style and used it against it.

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:57.543
SERENA: Who would have
thought of such a tactic?

00:12:57.543 --> 00:12:59.312
CLEMONT: Looks like Sawyer
thought through his strategies

00:12:59.312 --> 00:13:01.714
much more than we anticipated.

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:04.217
ANNOUNCER: Now, who will
be Ash's second Pokémon?

00:13:04.217 --> 00:13:06.019
ASH: Talonflame, I choose you!

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:10.356
TALONFLAME: [APPEARING]

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:13.893
ASH: 'Kay t's do this.
Use Steel Wing!

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:14.627
TALONFLAME: [STEEL WING MOVE]

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:21.301
SAWYER: Slaking, use Slack Off!

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:22.435
SLAKING: [SLACK OFF MOVE]

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.675
BONNIE:
Look! It healed itself again!

00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:29.942
SERENA:
Maybe they're dragging it out,

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:32.445
so it can win it
again with one attack!

00:13:32.445 --> 00:13:34.480
ASH: Slaking's gotta be
feeling Hawlucha's attacks!

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.582
ASH: Keep it up!

00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:38.384
Use Flame Charge and
don't let Slaking recover!

00:13:39.352 --> 00:13:41.421
CLEMONT:
Even if Slack Off works,

00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:44.424
it doesn't change the fact
that Slaking has taken damage.

00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:46.526
And eventually, that will
be an opportunity to strike!

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:49.495
SAWYER: Use Hammer Arm!

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.198
SLAKING:
[HAMMER ARM MOVE]

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:54.133
SLAKING: [COLLAPSE]

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:56.169
TALONFLAME: [FLAME CHARGE MOVE]
SLAKING: [HAMMER ARM MOVE]

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:57.637
SLAKING: [PAINED]

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:00.773
ASH: Yess! Use Brave Bird!

00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:03.543
TALONFLAME: [BRAVE BIRD MOVE]

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.244
SLAKING: [PAINED]

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:08.414
SLAKING: [STUNNED]

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:09.816
REFEREE:
Slaking is unable to battle!

00:14:09.816 --> 00:14:11.884
Talonflame's the winner!

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:13.686
ANNOUNCER:
And Talonflame gets that win

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:14.754
with a barrage of attacks!

00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:16.322
ASH: All right!

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:18.991
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:21.194
SAWYER:
You were amazing, Slaking.

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:23.229
You did exactly what I
was hoping you would do.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.238
SAWYER: Alright Clawitzer,
you're up next. Now Go!

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.876
CLAWITZER: [APPEARING]

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.178
CLEMONT:
Clawitzer. It's a Water type,

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:41.414
battling Talonflame,
who's a Fire type

00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:43.182
TREVOR: He's going by the book.

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:45.485
SAWYER: Clawitzer, use Aqua Jet!

00:14:45.485 --> 00:14:47.387
CLAWITZER: [AQUA JET MOVE]

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:48.054
ASH: Dodge it, quick!
TALONFLAME: [DODGING]

00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:51.357
ASH: It's following Talonflame!

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:54.127
CLAWITZER: [AQUA JET MOVE]
TALONFLAME: [DODGING]

00:14:54.127 --> 00:14:56.929
SHAUNA: I had no idea you
can use Aqua Jet like that!

00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:58.865
TREVOR: Sawyer's strategies
are out of the box!

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:01.567
TIERNO:
Yeah, kind of reminds me of Ash.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.803
SAWYER: I've been
inspired by your ideas

00:15:03.803 --> 00:15:05.638
and trained hard to
think in a different way.

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:07.907
ASH:
Awesome. Talonflame, dive in!

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:10.710
SAWYER: All right!
Clawitzer, use Ice Beam!

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.779
CLAWITZER: [ICE BEAM MOVE]
TALONFLAME: [PAINED]

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:14.247
ASH: Use your smoking
hot Flame Charge!

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:17.383
TALONFLAME: [FLAME CHARGE MOVE]

00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:25.124
CLEMONT: Look at the way that
Flame Charge melted the ice!

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:26.793
BONNIE: Yippee!
DEDENNE: [CHEERING]

00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:27.760
SAWYER: Aqua Jet, let's go!

00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:29.896
CLAWITZER: [AQUA JET MOVE]

00:15:29.896 --> 00:15:30.830
TALONFLAME: [FLAME CHARGE MOVE]

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:40.540
TALONFLAME: [STUNNED]

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.276
ASH: Talonflame, no!
PIKACHU: [SURPRISED]

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:46.212
REFEREE: Talonflame is unable to
battle! Clawitzer's the winner!

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:50.082
ANNOUNCER: And Clawitzer comes
out on top in an aerial battle!

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:53.686
ASH: Thanks a lot, Talonflame.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:57.890
SAWYER: Talonflame's
best known for its speed.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.893
If I could make it stop just for
a moment, I knew we could win.

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:11.804
JESSIE: What do you know?

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.706
The Twerp's looking
rather twerpish.

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:15.308
JAMES: The pressure's on.

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:17.777
MEOWTH:
You think he's gonna lose?

00:16:17.777 --> 00:16:20.146
JESSIE: For some strange
reason that stinks.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:22.381
CLEMONT: It feels
like everything is going

00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:24.550
according to the way Sawyer
planned it from the beginning.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.185
SERENA: It seems that way.

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:28.154
Sawyer really has
Ash all figured out.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.823
CLEMONT: Yeah.

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.058
CLEMONT: Like Sawyer's
taken everything he's learned

00:16:32.058 --> 00:16:32.792
from Ash to heart.

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.328
CLEMONT:
All his hard work is paying off.

00:16:37.864 --> 00:16:39.265
SERENA: Know what?
Ash isn't going to lose.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.135
SERENA: Nobody could ever
duplicate the Ash we all know.

00:16:46.873 --> 00:16:49.108
ASH: Let's see

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:51.344
ASH:
'Kay, P hu, I choose you!

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.412
PIKACHU: [CHALLENGING]

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:54.914

SAWYER:
So now it's time for Pikachu

00:16:58.818 --> 00:17:00.686

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:01.954

CHESPIN: [CHEERING]

00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:06.993
ASH: It's all up to you, buddy!
Use the forest for cover.

00:17:07.827 --> 00:17:09.395
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE] [RUNNING]

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:10.730
ANNOUNCER:
Pikachu makes the first move!

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.165
Such incredible speed!

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:15.201
Is this what it means
to be lightning fast?

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.803
ASH: All right,
Thunderbolt, let's go!

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:22.875
PIKACHU: [THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.343
SAWYER: Dodge it, quick!
CLAWITZER: [DODGING]

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:25.645
BONNIE: It dodged it!

00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:26.879
CLEMONT: It's not over yet
