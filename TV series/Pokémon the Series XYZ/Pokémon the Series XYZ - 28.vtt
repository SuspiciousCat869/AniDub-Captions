eighth Gym badge on the line,

Ash challenged
the Snowbelle Gym.

However, Gym Leader Wulfric
dealt him a crushing defeat.

Counting his previous
battle with Sawyer,

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:18.919
it was Ash's second loss
in a row and afterward,

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.722
Ash disappeared
into the forest alone.

ASH:
I always wanna meet new Pokémon,

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.922
so one time I went into
the forest alone and got lost.

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:29.328
ASH: I brought some Pokémon
in out of the rain with me,

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:30.630
just like what we're doing now.

00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:34.267

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.836
I thought about how much I
wanted to become a Trainer,

00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:38.938
so I could travel
around with my Pokémon.

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.575

00:15:42.575 --> 00:15:45.578
I know that I promised
we'd become stronger together.

00:15:45.578 --> 00:15:47.380
ASH:
I realized it when I was alone.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.949
After I told Sawyer
I'd win my eighth badge,

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.919
I wanted it so bad, I had to
beat Wulfric, no matter what!

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:55.321
ASH: I got impatient.

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:57.256
I thought I'd have to do it
all 'cause I'm the Trainer.

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:59.525
That's not teamwork.

00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:03.663

I was totally determined to help
you out, too, no matter what.
