get back to Lumiose City,

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.635
I'll fly home.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:09.803
CLEMONT: I guess that
means our journey's almost over.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.306
It's kind of sad, you know?

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.248

CLEMONT: One of those vines...
like before!

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.171

be doing all this?

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:45.539
PIKACHU: [ANGRY]

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.614
I stand tall

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.917
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.447
CLEMONT: I wonder if
this could be the work

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:29.650
of a group of some sort...

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.252
CLEMONT:
A group like Team Flare.

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:35.455
BONNIE: But I thought
Squishy got rid of them all...

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:36.390

rid of them right away!

You're right. I see it, too.

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:58.545
SERENA:
What, Ash? What do you see?

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.513
ASH: It's some red thing.

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:02.115
ASH‐GRENINJA: [SUGGESTING]

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.183

CLEMONT:
Looks like it lost its strength!

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.100

came from that red glow.

Xerosic! Team Flare's scientist!

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.241
I battled him!

CLEMONT: But, I thought I...

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.547
XEROSIC: No way!

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.820
XEROSIC:
True, I lost to you back then...

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.991
But I'm miraculously back.

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.960
And I'm now in the
process of creating

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.896
Team Neo Flare!

Squishy's friend right now!

XEROSIC: No, I can't do that.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.711
I'm going to get every Cell and
obtain Zygarde Complete Forme!

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:39.880
Lysandre's ambitions will
then be able to come true!

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.684
ASH: I'm never gonna
let you get away with that.

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.219

knowledge will be useful.

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:29.496
You will join us, of course!

XEROSIC:
Oh, I don't need you to agree.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.770
If I use my control system
on you, you'll do as I say,

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.439
just like Zygarde did!
You'll be an enhanced human!

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:44.377
XEROSIC:
Prepare to use the beam!

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:45.579
CLEMONT:
Wait! Please don't use the beam!

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:49.783
CLEMONT: I have one request.
May I clean my glasses first?

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:52.452
XEROSIC:
That's all? But of course.

JESSIE/JAMES: What?

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:21.715
JAMES: The point of editing this

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.950
is so it looks like we destroyed
Team Flare and not the Twerps,

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.719

SERENA/BONNIE: Right!

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:24.364
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"Who's that Pokémon?"

00:09:29.369 --> 00:09:30.336
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"It's Zygarde Complete Forme!"

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:43.283
XEROSIC:
So! How are you feeling now?

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:47.320
CLEMONT: I feel great.
Thanks to you, Xerosic,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.456
leader of Team Neo Flare.

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:51.091
XEROSIC:
That has such a nice ring!

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:55.028
ASH: We're here!

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.431
PIKACHU: [EXERTION]

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.601
ASH: I know Greninja's
flying around here,

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:02.635
though I can't see just where.

00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:08.475
ASH: Greninja, we're here,
up at the top of the mountain!

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:14.047
ASH: I see it! I should be
able to reach it if I jump!

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:15.949
ASH: I'll hop on that plane!

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:18.751
SERENA: Not from here...

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:20.019
BONNIE:
What happens if you fall?

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:21.721
ASH: I can't let them escape!

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:23.590
ASH:
I've gotta do it. I'm going!

00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:26.993
'Kay, with me?
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:28.962
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]
SERENA: I'm going, too!

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.964
BONNIE: Me, too!

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.199
BONNIE:
We're always a team, right?

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:34.868
ASH: All right!
Make sure you do what I say!

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:39.105
ASH‐GRENINJA: [QUESTIONING]

00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:43.977
ASH: Now! Let's go!

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:46.179
ASH‐GRENINJA: [EXERTION]

00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:05.698
ASH‐GRENINJA: [RELIEVED]

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:07.734
ASH: You did it, Greninja.

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:09.135
SERENA: Yeah, thank you!
BONNIE: That was a close one!

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:13.806
ASH:
Clemont... Where could he be?

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.676
ASH: Clemont!
BONNIE: Clemont!

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:21.814
XEROSIC: I welcome
you all to the unveiling

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:23.216
of the enhanced human!

00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:24.951
ASH: What did you do?

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:26.953
BONNIE: Give me back my brother
and Squishy's friend right now!

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:32.158
XEROSIC: Your brother is
currently being mind controlled

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:34.827
and has become Team Neo Flare's
first enhanced human!

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.097
CLEMONT: Yes, Xerosic, sir.

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:40.700
BONNIE: Clemont!

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.368
SERENA: It can't be!
ASH: Clemont, snap out of it!

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.604
PIKACHU: [WORRIED]

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:47.006
XEROSIC: Unit one! Your first
job is to capture them all!

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:47.974
CLEMONT: Right. As you wish.

00:11:51.244 --> 00:11:53.146
SERENA: This can't be real!

00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:55.515
BONNIE: Clemont!
PIKACHU: [SCARED]

00:11:55.515 --> 00:11:56.916
ASH: There's no way
Clemont could be that weak!

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:01.888
ASH: He'd never give
in to your mind control!

00:12:09.362 --> 00:12:11.764
CLEMONT: Thank you for
having faith in me, Ash!

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:14.267
ASH: Clemont, YES!
XEROSIC: What?

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:16.236
CLEMONT:
You know I'm an inventor!

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:18.371
The future is now,
thanks to science!

00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:20.707
Clemontic Gear, on!

00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:22.875
CLEMONT:
After what happened before,

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:25.044
I invented this multi‐
electromagnetic wave blocker.

00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:28.214
CLEMONT:
I call it Jamming Unit One!

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.851
CLEMONT:
I inconspicuously attached it

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:32.785
while pretending to
wipe off my glasses.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.189
XEROSIC: Unbelievable!

00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:37.657
CLEMONT:
That makes twice you've failed

00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:39.592
against one of my inventions!

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.561
CLEMONT:
This device, and my Clembot,

00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:44.030
should prove whose
inventions are superior!

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.432
Time to admit
you've been defeated!

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.735
XEROSIC:
My inventions are inferior?

00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:50.370
This is not possible!

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:53.306
XEROSIC:
Crobat! Use Air Slash, now!

00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:55.341
CROBAT: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:56.909
CLEMONT: Chespin, Pin Missile!

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:58.244
CROBAT: [AIR SLASH MOVE]

00:12:59.045 --> 00:12:59.746
CHESPIN: [PIN MISSILE MOVE]

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:03.650
ASH:
Clemont! Let's get 'em together!

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.251
CLEMONT: All right!

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:06.252
ASH‐GRENINJA: [DETERMINED]
CHESPIN: [CONFIDENT]

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:07.954
XEROSIC:
All right, Malamar, Signal Beam!

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:09.922
And Crobat, Wing Attack!

00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:11.991
MALAMAR: [SIGNAL BEAM MOVE]

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:13.426
CLEMONT: Now, dodge it!
CHESPIN: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:14.661
ASH‐GRENINJA: [EXERTION]

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.931
CLEMONT: Use Tackle!
CHESPIN: [TACKLE MOVE]

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:20.466
CROBAT: [PAINED]

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.135
XEROSIC: You pesky little...

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.337
I'm not going to
let you annoying brats

00:13:24.337 --> 00:13:27.240
ruin my plan of perfection!
Now, Crobat, use Air Slash!

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.175
CROBAT: [AIR SLASH MOVE]

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:30.877
ASH: Water Shuriken!

00:13:30.877 --> 00:13:32.745
ASH‐GRENINJA:
[WATER SHURIKEN MOVE]

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:34.847
CROBAT: [IMPACT]

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.617
CROBAT: [STUNNED]

00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:38.851
XEROSIC: Crobat, return!

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.456
XEROSIC: This is not acceptable!

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:44.691
As long as I have my
ideas and my genius mind,

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:47.694
I'll be able to
recreate this world!

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:49.529
Defeat is NOT an option!

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:52.031
ASH: Come back!

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:55.501
XEROSIC: Malamar, return!

00:13:58.304 --> 00:13:59.906
XEROSIC: We must
meet again sometime!

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:01.774
I'm not finished yet!
See you again!

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:02.608
CLEMONT: You won't get away!

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:08.548
XEROSIC: Let go!

00:14:08.548 --> 00:14:10.149
CLEMONT: You're going to pay for
all the awful things you did!

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:12.418
And from now on,

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:13.720
you need to invent
things that help humanity!

00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:25.031
XEROSIC: Tell me something.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.766
XEROSIC: You've got a
lot of strength. But why?

00:14:29.402 --> 00:14:31.137
CLEMONT: Honestly,
I wasn't that strong before.

00:14:32.739 --> 00:14:34.574
CLEMONT: But my time
with Ash and all my friends,

00:14:34.574 --> 00:14:36.576
and all that
we've experienced...

00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:37.844
That's given me the
strength I have now!

00:14:39.512 --> 00:14:41.080
XEROSIC: Your friends...

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.415
OFFICER JENNY: Now, get in.

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:48.454
SERENA: Glad that's over with.

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:51.824
BONNIE:
Hey, you know Squishy, right?

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:52.925
Squishy's your friend...

00:15:06.773 --> 00:15:07.774
ASH: What happened?
PIKACHU/DEDENNE: [CRINGING]

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.521
BONNIE: Squishy!

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:28.628
BONNIE: I missed you.
Feeling better now?

00:15:28.628 --> 00:15:29.562
My little Squishy...
SQUISHY: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:33.299
SERENA: We're getting
to see Squishy again!

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:34.667
CLEMONT:
Bonnie, that's great isn't it?

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:35.868
ASH: Sure is!
PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

00:15:37.904 --> 00:15:39.105
SQUISHY: [QUESTIONING]
BONNIE: What is it?

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.508
SQUISHY: Follow me!

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:46.979
GRENINJA: [SURPRISED]
BONNIE: Where are you going?

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:48.181
ASH: Come on!

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:55.388
ASH‐GRENINJA: [EXERTION]

00:15:55.388 --> 00:15:56.689
ASH‐GRENINJA: [SHOCKED]

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.825
PIKACHU: [SHOCKED]

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:07.233
ASH: Zygarde...

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:10.837
B ZYGARDE 50%: Greninja,
I've come to ask a favor of you.

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:14.841
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:16.509
SERENA:
Was that the voice of Zygarde?

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:18.878
ASH: It's telepathy.

00:16:18.878 --> 00:16:21.013
B ZYGARDE 50%:
The vines that reappeared...

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:23.483
Their roots have burrowed
themselves deep into the ground,

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:26.419
and they emerge by
absorbing negative energy.

00:16:26.419 --> 00:16:28.421
What we destroyed was
merely on the surface.

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:31.557
B ZYGARDE 50%:
The scars from the incident

00:16:31.557 --> 00:16:34.060
that nearly destroyed
the world are deep.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.895
The two of us are
destroying the roots

00:16:35.895 --> 00:16:37.563
that are scattered
throughout Kalos, one by one.

00:16:38.798 --> 00:16:40.666
SQUISHY: However,

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.768
it's difficult even for me to
pinpoint their exact locations.

00:16:43.803 --> 00:16:46.105
B ZYGARDE 50%: Yet, Greninja...

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.040
It seems that you are
somehow able to locate them.

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:51.110
ASH‐GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:16:53.713 --> 00:16:55.314
ASH: So that was
the negative energy...

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:58.851
B ZYGARDE 50%: I do not know
why only you possess that power,

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:01.888
but I am in need
of your assistance.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.826
SQUISHY: Will you
help us with your power?

00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:08.060
BONNIE: Power?
SERENA: Does that mean...

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:16.235
ASH:
What will it be? Greninja...

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:22.575
ASH: I know.

00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:24.110
What happened before
can never happen again.

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.349
ASH: Remember what
Professor Sycamore said?

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:34.420
That maybe it
wasn't a coincidence

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.622
that I met you way back
when you were still a Froakie.

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.527
ASH:
I think that maybe he was right.

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:43.329
It wasn't a coincidence.

00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:56.008
ASH:
That when you and I power up...

00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:58.878
it isn't an accident.

00:17:58.878 --> 00:18:00.413
ASH: Maybe your power was
always meant for this moment.

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.531
ASH‐GRENINJA: [MOVED]

00:18:18.531 --> 00:18:19.465
ASH: Thanks.

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:23.135
ASH: You always became
stronger to help someone else.

00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:25.271
So now, this time...

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:28.007
you'll help Kalos,
and the world.

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:34.547
ASH: It's like
something's telling you

00:18:34.547 --> 00:18:36.682
that what you need to do now is
find all that negative energy.

00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:42.355
ASH: Don't worry!
We'll always be connected,

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:43.389
even if we're not
in the same place.

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:47.560
The truth is we won't
ever really be apart!

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:54.800
PIKACHU: [SAD]

00:18:57.103 --> 00:18:58.337
ASH:
This is what you've gotta do.

00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:02.575
ASH‐GRENINJA: [RESOLVED]

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.456
ASH: Oh, Greninja...

00:19:19.225 --> 00:19:20.493
ASH‐GRENINJA: [TOUCHED]

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:40.179
ASH: That's right.
This is how it has to be.

00:19:46.252 --> 00:19:49.622

Greninja will be in my care.

00:19:49.622 --> 00:19:51.891
ASH: Yeah!
I'm counting on you, Squishy!

00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:53.325
BONNIE: Hey, Squishy!

00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:56.829
SQUISHY: We probably won't
see each other for a while, Bonie

00:19:57.797 --> 00:19:59.999
BONNIE: It's okay!

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:02.968
I know that you've got a
lot of important work to do!

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:06.205
I'll always be cheering you on,
you know!

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:09.075
SQUISHY: I'll always be
with you, too, Bonnie...

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:11.677
BONNIE: I'll come and find
you when I become a Trainer!

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:13.979
We'll be together again!
That's a promise!

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:15.281
DEDENNE: [AGREEMENT]

00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:16.949

You too, Squishy! Take care!

NARRATOR: Greninja and
Ash may be parting ways,

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:41.807
but this also means the
beginning of new encounters.

00:20:43.042 --> 00:20:45.311
In search of their
own new encounters,

00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:47.913
our heroes will no
doubt experience many new

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:51.016
and exciting adventures,
as the journey continues!
