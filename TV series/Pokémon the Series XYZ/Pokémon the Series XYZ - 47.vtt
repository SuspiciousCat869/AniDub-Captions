We can hardly wait!

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:36.770

you'll be careful.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.108

Can't forget anything!

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:01.995
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:04.398
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:08.569
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.571

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:46.840
SERENA: Is there
something wrong?

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.844
CLEMONT: You're not
feeling sick are you?

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:53.914
BONNIE: I might have eaten
too many snacks before...

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:55.148
CLEMONT: I warned you that
you shouldn't snack

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.516
right before a meal.

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:57.851

PIKACHU/CHESPIN/DEDENNE:
[QUESTIONING]

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:08.562
ASH: Alain!
CLEMONT: Professor Sycamore!

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:09.296
SERENA: Mairin!
MAIRIN: Hey, there!

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:11.632
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Hello, everyone.

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:13.800
ASH: So what are you doing here?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.668
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Thought I'd say hi.

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:15.769
Before we go our separate ways.

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:19.373
PIKACHU/DEDENNE: [SURPRISED]

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:22.042
JESSIE: Team Flare was
controlling the Legendary

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:25.579
Pokémon Zygarde, who unleashed
a massive attack on Kalos!

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.481
JAMES: But the only thing that
can defeat evil, is evil!

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:32.219
MEOWTH: So Team Rocket wiped
out Team Flare, and took out

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.687
Zygarde while we were at it!

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.426
JESSIE: And that's
the way it is!

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.662
JAMES: Our anti‐Team
Flare victory report...

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:43.463
MEOWTH: ...is now history!

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.265
WOBBUFFET: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.700
JESSIE: So what
do you think, sir?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.136
JAMES: Were we a success?

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:50.837
MEOWTH: Now Team Rocket can take
over the whole world, RIGHT?

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.639
WOBBUFFET: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:54.307
GIOVANNI: Interesting.

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.645
GIOVANNI: The situation
is quite clear.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.514
GIOVANNI: The fact is
you were behind the complete

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:01.548
annihilation of Team Flare.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.384
GIOVANNI: Well done,
Jessie, James, and Meowth.

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:06.553
Return to base.

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:08.321
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH: Roger!

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:09.523
JAMES: We'll head to
Kanto straight away!

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.425
GIOVANNI: I'll be here.

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:16.663
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH: YAY!

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.198
WOBBUFFET: [EXCITED]
GOURGEIST/INKAY: [EXCITED]

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.901
JESSIE: Our video really
rang the Boss's chimes!

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:22.135
JAMES: It was worth
every recording moment!

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.505
MEOWTH: These paws of
mine are editing GOLD!

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.507
WOBBUFFET: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.943
JAMES: Headquarters ho!
It's off to the Boss we go!

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.679
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH:
This is no time to be SLOW!

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:37.484
ASH: Alain, too?

00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:39.419
ALAIN: That's right.
There's nothing as taxing

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.854
as a journey...but I'll
be helping the professor.

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:43.523
With Mairin.

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:45.092
MAIRIN: First off, we're
heading for Frost Cavern!

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:46.426
CHESPIE: [EXCITED]

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.596
ALAIN: This is the path
I've decided to take.

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:51.598
ASH: Right.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:53.233
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
We've learned this.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.402
When the sundial is bathed in
the light of the setting sun,

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.971
it gives off energy.

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.372
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: And
when we traced that energy,

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:00.974
we discovered a material
similar to Mega Stones.

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:06.947
CLEMONT: Wow, does that mean the
material is in the Frost Cavern?

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:08.415
MAIRIN: Yeah, and we found the
same thing in other places, too!

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:11.785
ALAIN: So that's why we're on
our way there. Research.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:14.588
ASH: Hey, Alain, what
happened to your Mega Ring?

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:19.760
ALAIN: Oh. I borrowed that
Mega Ring from Lysandre.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.896
I gave it over to the
authorities to use as evidence.

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:24.297
ASH: But...what about
Mega Evolving?

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:28.001
ALAIN: It'll be fine.
I'll just start from square one.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.305
I'll find my own Mega Stone and
Key Stone. From the ground up.

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:35.408
Just like you, Ash.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:36.877
ASH: Yeah, let's do our best.

00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:47.487
ALAIN: When the time comes,
we should have another battle.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.824
Will you? What do you say?

00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:52.826
ASH: Yeah!

00:04:57.564 --> 00:04:58.598
ALAIN: I'll see you around!

MAIRIN: Remember the time when
you let me know you would come

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.256
along with me? That was so nice!

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:26.960
SERENA: I wasn't being nice.
A deal is a deal!

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.962
