to Lysandre and Lysandre alone!

00:19:08.014 --> 00:19:11.384

new species transforms into an

00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:23.863
incredibly powerful Pokémon!

we're going to be busy.

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:35.474
Especially with that Charizard!

CLEMONT: Even though it
spent so much time lounging

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:04.503
around in the sun?

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:07.506
BONNIE: Yeah I think Squishy's
worried about something.

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:09.575
ASH: Worried? Then
maybe you should hold it.

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:12.745
Squishy really likes
when you do that.

00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:15.981

feel better, I'm sure!

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:18.451

continues to advance their

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:33.365

have begun to turn, drawing

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:35.501
the Kalos region ever
closer to devastation

00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:50.182
