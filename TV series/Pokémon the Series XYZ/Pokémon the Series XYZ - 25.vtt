00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:05.906
DIANTHA: A Kalos disaster...

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:10.978
OLYMPIA: What form it will take
is not clear. But still, I

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:14.815
thought it would be best to warn
you, as the vision I had showed

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.551
the swirling green flame
consuming everyone and

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:20.654
everything. It will affect
people and Pokémon alike

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:21.889
throughout the
entire Kalos region.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:25.893
DIANTHA: And you say.Ash and his
friends are somehow involved.

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.596
DIANTHA: I'd like to please
ask you just one more thing.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:33.133
DIANTHA: What is the
deep green eye you saw?

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.868
OLYMPIA: What I
foresaw was this. Behold!

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.410
DIANTHA: Could it be. Zygarde?!

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.458
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.229
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.033
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.635
Pokémon

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.471
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.740
I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.143
Pokémon

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:17.778

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:18.912

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.826
NARRATOR: As our heroes head
toward Snowbelle City and

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:36.496
Ash's eighth Kalos Gym battle,
he and Greninja are working hard

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:39.299
to learn about staying in
control when experiencing

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.834
Greninja's mysterious powers.

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:42.502
ASH: Ready?

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.004
ASH: Let's go!

00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:48.475
ASH: It's pretty hard to
dodge anything when you're

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.077
moving this fast...

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:51.445
GRENINJA: [AGREEMENT]

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.486
GRENINJA: [DODGING]

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.154
ASH: Oh, I get it!

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.489
So that's how you
can dodge like that! Yeah!

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:05.158
ASH: [DODGING]

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:07.527
ASH: All right,
I can do it, too!

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.796
GRENINJA: [EXERTION]

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.169
ASH: And that, too!

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.712
GRENINJA:
[EXERTION] [QUESTIONING]

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:29.916
GRENINJA: [EXERTION]

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.519
ASH: Hey, thanks. I need to
do more of this. Then I can

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.154
learn.to control that power!

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:36.690
ASH: Let's keep going.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.924
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:45.465
BONNIE: They're
taking such a long time...

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.401
SQUISHY: [QUESTIONING]

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.002
CLEMONT: Leave it to
Ash to come up with a training

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.570
strategy to become a Pokémon.

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:53.040
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.175
SERENA: Training hard is
fine. But I really wish he

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.810
wouldn't overdo it.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.145
BONNIE: Yay! They're back!

00:02:58.145 --> 00:02:59.312
SERENA/CLEMONT/PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:05.619
BONNIE: And Greninja wins!

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:08.789
SERENA: You can do it,
Ash! Just a little more!

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.292
BONNIE: Ash comes in second!

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:13.960
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:16.763
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:20.967
ASH: I guess.
Oh MAN.Greninja's too fast...

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.769
PIKACHU: [AMUSED]
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.371
SERENA: Ash, here.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.605
ASH: That's great. Thank you.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.408
CLEMONT: So Ash, does it feel
like you're catching up to

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.343
Greninja a little?

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.546
ASH: Yeah! I really think I am,
even though it's just

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:34.047
a little bit at a time.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.248
ASH/PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:36.283
ASH: What's that?

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:39.352
PILOT: Are you
certain that those are the ones?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.722
DIANTHA: Yes.

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.490
PILOT: All right,
I'll take us down.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.258
KATHI LEE: We've got a
commercial to shoot right after

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:47.260
this, so take care, okay?
Don't hurt yourself, please!

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:51.431
DIANTHA: Our altitude is
low enough. Pick me up later!

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.634
KATHI LEE: All right, Diantha!

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.070
ASH/SERENA/BONNIE/PIKACHU:
[QUESTIONING]

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.072
CLEMONT: Are you all right?

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.307
DIANTHA: No problems whatsoever!
SQUISHY: [SCARED HIDING]

00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:02.909
DIANTHA: Long time, no see!

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.611
SERENA/ASH/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
Diantha!

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.246
KATHI LEE: Don't forget
to be careful and try

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.380
to stay in one piece!

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:10.317
ASH: Diantha,
what are you doing here?

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:12.219
CLEMONT:
Is everything all right?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.155
DIANTHA: I just
heard Olympia's prediction.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.391
DIANTHA: . so I
dropped in to see all of you..

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:20.727
PIKACHU: [SURPRISED]

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:23.296
JAMES: We follow the
Twerps and whom do we find?

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.932
MEOWTH: None other than Kalos
League Champion and famous movie

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.667
superstar, the
lovely and talented Diantha!

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.244
JESSIE: Such popularity.Beauty.
Incredible acting ability!

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:41.114
JESSIE: But,
compared to me.it's teensy.

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:44.017
JESSIE: Not even
worth competing against!

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.821
JESSIE: Got a
problem with that?!

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:48.789
WOBBUFFET: [DENYING]

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:50.924
CLEMONT:
You mean the Kalos crisis?

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:54.795
DIANTHA: Right. So I
started researching everything

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:55.862
I could find.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.431
DIANTHA: Look.

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.167
SERENA: What's that?

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:01.568
DIANTHA: It's an island.
Once teeming with nature.

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:05.172
SERENA/CLEMONT/PIKACHU:
[QUESTIONING] ASH: Are you sure?

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:07.908
DIANTHA: Yes. And it's not the
only one. This is happening all

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:09.142
over the Kalos region.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.878
CLEMONT: But what could it be?!

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:14.848
DIANTHA: So far, we're not
entirely sure. But if this

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:18.385
phenomenon is the crisis Olympia
mentioned in her prediction,

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:20.320
then Zygarde may
already be on the move...

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.321
ASH: Zygarde?!

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:23.089
DIANTHA: It's a Pokémon...

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.294
JESSIE: Could that be...

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.900
JAMES: The one that those goons
with the goofy eyewear wanted!

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.770
JESSIE/MEOWTH: Yeah.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.807
DIANTHA: Zygarde, the Order
Pokémon. They say it lives deep

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:44.411
in caves. And when there's a
crisis, Zygarde appears with a

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:48.014
mission. A mission to
protect.the entire Kalos region.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.917
ASH: Wow,
the whole Kalos region...

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:52.552
SERENA: That's Zygarde...

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:54.254
CLEMONT: Of course. The crisis!

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:59.426
OLYMPIA: I saw disaster
approaching soon. And your fates

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:00.594
are all connected
to that threat.

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:05.498
CLEMONT: She said
somehow we're all involved.

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:07.300
DIANTHA: That's right. I was
concerned, so I came to see you.

00:06:08.802 --> 00:06:10.503
I'm wondering, has anything
odd been going on lately?

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:13.106
BONNIE/PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.976
BONNIE: THAT'S IT!

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:17.777
BONNIE: Ash's Greninja
does something amazing!

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:23.116
DIANTHA: That really happened?

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:24.117
CLEMONT: Olympia
mentioned it as well.

00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:29.289
OLYMPIA: However, I do know
this. It will reach new

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:33.126
heights that no one has ever
seen before! And the two of you

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:34.694
will reach
those new heights together.

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.098
DIANTHA: Greninja and Ash...

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:42.135
DIANTHA: So Ash?
Do you think you could show me?

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.170
ASH/ PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.607
GARDEVOIR: [APPEARING]

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.175
DIANTHA: Let's battle.
You and Greninja against

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:51.444
me and Gardevoir!

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:52.879
DIANTHA: I want to see
what Greninja can do with

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.115
my very own eyes.

00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:57.918
ASH: Okay, you're on! I'd jump
at the chance to battle with

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:01.187
you, Diantha! Let's show
her what we can do, 'kay?

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:02.322
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]
GRENINJA: [AGREEMENT]

00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:07.360
JAMES:
This could be good for us.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.362
MEOWTH: If we get an opening,
we might end up nabbing a

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:10.730
magnificent
Mega‐Evolving Gardevoir!

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.902
JESSIE: She'll never be as good
as I am, so we'll just have to

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:19.039
hope those two lightweights
can put up a heavyweight brawl!

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.308
JAMES: Right. Beating them
should be a piece of cake.

00:07:21.308 --> 00:07:23.009
MEOWTH: Hope it's got frosting.

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:24.311
WOBBUFFET: [AGREEMENT]

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:30.817
DIANTHA: Oh, what's that, Ash?

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:33.887
ASH: Clemont's new invention!

00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:35.755
CLEMONT: It's a Battle
Pulse Meter and it tells us how

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:37.457
closely Ash and
Greninja are synchronized.

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:41.928
CLEMONT: Those measurements are
then sent to my Clembot Mini,

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:43.263
who converts
them into a hologram!

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:50.570
CLEMONT: By watching the red and
blue waveforms, we are then

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.139
able to observe Ash and
Greninja's changes in real time!

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.108
DIANTHA: I'm impressed.

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:58.945
ASH: Greninja? The last time I
battled against Diantha, Team

00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:01.414
Rocket messed things up before
her Gardevoir Mega Evolved!

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.989
ASH: But we've done an awful
lot of battling since then!

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:11.157
ASH: This time, we'll win!

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:13.226
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]
‐ASH: We're all ready

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.327
to go, Diantha!

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:15.996
DIANTHA: Great!

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:24.070
DIANTHA: Ash,
you have the honor!

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.106
ASH: 'Kay. Aja, use Cut!

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.208
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:31.978
GRENINJA: [CUT MOVE]

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:35.982
CLEMONT: That's incredible.

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.984
SERENA: They can communicate
using just their eyes!

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.486
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:40.854
ASH: Water Shuriken!

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.789

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:04.790
JAMES: Guaranteed to withstand
any attack, Mega or otherwise!

00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:08.861
DIANTHA: You take care of
Ash and I'll take care of this!

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.097
SERENA/CLEMONT: Right!

00:17:11.097 --> 00:17:13.900
DIANTHA: Don't you dare
underestimate my Gardevoir! Now,

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.935
Gardevoir, full power!

00:17:15.935 --> 00:17:18.905
M GARDEVOIR: [CALLING]

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:20.540
JESSIE:
A tone‐deaf waste of time!

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.008
M GARDEVOIR: [CALLING]

00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:26.946
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH:
Perhaps we scoffed too soon.

00:17:26.946 --> 00:17:28.281
CLEMONT: Incredible.

00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:29.949
DIANTHA: Shadow Ball!

00:17:29.949 --> 00:17:31.117
M GARDEVOIR: [SHADOW BALL MOVE]

00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:35.021
JESSIE:
Enough acting for one day!

00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:37.390
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH:
Up, up and away!

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.925
WOBBUFFET: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:46.432
GARDEVOIR: [GASPING]
DIANTHA: Gardevoir!

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:50.970
DIANTHA: You've got to be
exhausted. Take a good rest!

00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:00.513
SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE/PIKACHU:
[RELIEVED]

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.083
ASH: Where's Greninja?
GRENINJA: [RESPONDING]

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.652
ASH: Are you all right?

00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:07.653
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]
ASH: That's a relief!

00:18:08.621 --> 00:18:09.989
DIANTHA: Ash, are YOU all right?

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.824
ASH: Yeah!

00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:15.161
CLEMONT: Hold on to me.

00:18:16.329 --> 00:18:17.730
ASH: Hey, thanks.

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.866
ASH: Guess I passed out again...

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:23.035
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:26.405
ASH: Wow. Today's battle was the
greatest ever. We were really in

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:27.573
sync, weren't we?

00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:29.442
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.719
ASH: We need to
remember how that felt. Okay?

00:18:40.653 --> 00:18:42.388
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:42.388 --> 00:18:44.991
CLEMONT/BONNIE/PIKACHU:
[QUESTIONING]

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:50.529
DIANTHA: About that power of
yours. I'm not sure if it has

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:54.100
anything to do with the
prediction. but there's no doubt

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.035
in my mind that you'll always
be able to work with that power

00:18:56.035 --> 00:18:57.103
only for good!

00:18:58.304 --> 00:18:59.939
ASH/GRENINJA:
Right![AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:01.907
DIANTHA: Maybe the next time
I see you, it will be at the

00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:04.243
Kalos League arena!

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:06.178
ASH: Awesome!
I'm gonna win my eighth badge.

00:19:06.178 --> 00:19:08.814
I'll be there for sure!

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.383
DIANTHA: Until then,
all the best of luck.

00:19:11.417 --> 00:19:12.652
ASH: Thanks a lot, Diantha.

00:19:23.396 --> 00:19:26.432
DIANTHA: If, in fact, Ash and
his friends have something to do

00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:29.135
with the Kalos crisis that
Olympia foresaw, that power must

00:19:29.135 --> 00:19:30.236
have something to do with it.

00:19:31.437 --> 00:19:33.639
ASH: Greninja!
Water Shuriken, now!

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:36.542
GRENINJA: [ROARING]

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:39.645
DIANTHA: I need to investigate
this even further. To protect

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:42.882
Ash and his friends. and to
protect the entire Kalos region!

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:54.927
XEROSIC: All issues
have been cleared up!

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.664
LYSANDRE: That means we
can move forward to the final

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:00.232
stage of our mission!

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:01.434
XEROSIC: Right!

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.374
SQUISHY: [QUESTIONING]
BONNIE: Squishy, ready to go?

00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:10.776
Time for us to get
back on the road again!

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:14.413
ASH: Hey, Greninja? Let's
work hard! Until we can really

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:17.116
control that power, we've
gotta get stronger and stronger!

00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:19.518
GRENINJA: [AGREEMENT]

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:21.554
ASH: First we'll win at the
Snowbelle Gym and then it's off

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.556
to the Kalos League!

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:24.623
PIKACHU: [DETERMINED]
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:28.360
BONNIE: Ash is so fired up.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.562
SQUISHY: [AGREEMENT]
SERENA: He'll be great!

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:33.032
CLEMONT: So why
don't we get on our way?

00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:35.000
ASH: All right! Let's get
to the Snowbelle Gym right away!

00:20:36.102 --> 00:20:37.937
ASH: We'll win. No doubt.

00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:39.205
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:20:39.205 --> 00:20:41.407
GRENINJA: [AGREEMENT]

00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:44.243
NARRATOR: Our heroes are off
again to the Snowbelle City Gym,

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:46.178
where Ash plans to win
his eighth Kalos Gym badge.

00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:49.081
What kind of battle will it be?

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:51.550
The answer,
as the journey continues!
