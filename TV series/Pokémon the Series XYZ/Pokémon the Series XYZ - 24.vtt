MEOWTH: It's saying gobbling up
all their goodies without asking

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:09.536
permission is a big no‐no.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:12.406

dropped in on our heroes at the

fell out of a tree?

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:35.549
ASH: Wonder how it got up there.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:41.021
POKEDEX: Phantump. The Stump
Pokémon. Phantump come from

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:42.656
rotting tree stumps that
have been possessed by spirits.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.625

PIKACHU: [MYSTIFIED]

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.836
CLEMONT: The Pokédex said
Phantump live in remote forests.

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:34.708
I'd say it's highly unusual
for one to live around here.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:37.778
SERENA: It says that Phantump
live in large trees and imitate

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:41.414
the sounds of children. They use
those sounds to lure people into

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.116
the forest and get them lost. At
least that's how the story goes.

BONNIE: That's so cool!

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:47.521

them sound like children!

get lost in the forest!

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:54.261

want to get lost, either!

CLEMONT: Do you think
it could be lost, perhaps?

00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:47.914
ASH: If it is, we know what to
do. Get it back to its friends.

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:50.317
SERENA: But how
are we going to do that?

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:52.385
ASH: Hey, Serena. Would you look
and see if there's a big tree

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:53.687
around here?

00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:55.455
SERENA: Hold on a minute!

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.626
SERENA: There's one at the
top of the mountain. Yup! Here!

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.065
SERENA: Long ago, many people
got lost in those woods because

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:08.535
they would be led astray by
children's voices. So people

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.771
built a place to leave treats
for the Phantump. After that,

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:14.507
the voices stopped,
and people stopped getting lost.

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:16.042
SERENA: And it looks like people
are still leaving lots of treats

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.310
up there.

ever met a Diglett or Dugtrio.

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:16.269

CLEMONT: Probably the first
time it's been away from home!

00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:25.812

been really surprised when it
