WEBVTT

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:05.539
NARRATOR: Now that Serena has
earned her third Princess Key,

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:08.475
our heroes have arrived in
Gloire City, where the Pokémon

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.310
Showcase Master Class
is set to take place.

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:12.813
ASH: Serena, is that it?

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.050
BONNIE: Wowee!

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.519
CLEMONT: What a gigantic castle!

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:24.291
SERENA: Finally here.

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.326
SERENA: The Gloire City
Pokémon Showcase Master Class.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.430
SHAUNA: The big event
we've been dreaming about.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.499
SERENA: Shauna!

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.001
MIETTE: Where the
Kalos Queen will be crowned.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.702
SERENA: And Miette!

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.371
NINI: That's why we've all
worked so hard to collect three

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.172
Princess Keys, isn't it?

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.741
SERENA: Nini!

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:41.909
SHAUNA: Well, well.
You've all met before!

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:46.513
MIETTE: We sure have. We all
stood on the very same stage in

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.582
the Rookie Class!

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:51.184
NINI: And that means we're
all rivals to the very end!

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.319
BONNIE: That's so cool
you're all in the Master Class!

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.022
NINI: Of course!

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.423
CLEMONT: I'd say this is going
to get a lot more challenging!

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.026
SERENA: But, I'm ready!

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.998
PANCHAM: [PANICKING]

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.000
MIETTE: So Ash, naturally you'll
be cheering me on, won't you?

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.270
ASH: Yeah! I'll be
cheering a lot for all of you!

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:12.940
MIETTE: Even if Serena
and I battle head‐to‐head?

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.976
MIETTE: Well?

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:17.978
ASH: In that case, I'll be
cheering all I can for Serena!

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:22.449
MIETTE: Are you two an item?

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:24.851
SERENA:
That's none of your business!

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.788
ASH: What's up?
PIKACHU: [CONFUSED]

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:28.589
NINI:
Sounds kind of complicated.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.057
BONNIE: Kind of

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:33.860
SHAUNA: Whatever,
let's get out here and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.596
show them what we're made of!

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:37.264
SERENA: Of course.
And I'm going to win!

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.068
JESSIE:
The time has finally come.

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:46.540
JESSIE: It's time for none
other than Jessilee to grab this

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.676
historic moment and snag the
hallowed title of Kalos Queen!

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:51.211
JAMES: Hail the Queen!

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.080
MEOWTH: The Queen is keen!

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.014
WOBBUFFET: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:00.787
JAMES: Whew. Seeing Jessie
so happy can be tiring work.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.023
MEOWTH: We're still
gonna have to stay on our toes.

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.592
Our Jessie needs
all the help she can get!

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:06.660
JAMES: Right!
WOBBUFFET: [AGREE]

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.569
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:19.539
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:23.744
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:25.846
Pokémon

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:28.882
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.485
I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:33.220
Pokémon

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.988
Pokémon

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:35.956
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.504
GRACE: So it starts tomorrow?

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:51.838
SERENA: Yeah.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.974
GRACE: I'll be there in a flash.

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:56.143
SERENA: Oh, come on. You don't
need to travel all that way!

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:58.979
GRACE:
What are you talking about?

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.448
I wouldn't miss it
for anything in the world!

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:03.483
SERENA: I'm
worried I won't perform well.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:06.119
I guess I'm a little scared.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.122
GRACE: Being nervous is only
natural. I was always that way

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.158
‐before a race.
‐SERENA: Wow, you were?

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:13.193
GRACE: And that's when
you need to tell yourself:

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.428
It's time to go for broke!

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:19.132
SERENA: Uh Hey, Mom?

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:25.038
SERENA: At first I set off on
my journey only because I didn't

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.239
want to be a Rhyhorn racer.

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.212
SERENA: But what a great
time I've had! I've met so many

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.281
wonderful friends and Pokémon
who support me day after day.

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:35.882
GRACE: Serena...

00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:38.585
SERENA: Tomorrow,
I'll give it my all.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.654
It's time to go for broke!

00:03:40.654 --> 00:03:42.255
GRACE: Great! See you soon!

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.570
FEMALE REPORTER: The opening of
the Gloire City Pokémon Showcase

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.271
Master Class is
filled with excitement!

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:08.281
SERENA: Great. Perfect!

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:09.916
BRAIXEN: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.218
SERENA: Hey, Braixen?
BRAIXEN: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.689
SERENA: This
is finally it, win OR lose!

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.459
SERENA: We've got to
give it everything we've got!

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.460
BRAIXEN: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:24.131
SERENA: Here goes!
BRAIXEN: [CONFIDENT]

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.432
PANCHAM: [CONFIDENT]
SYLVEON: [CONFIDENT]

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.867
SERENA: Readyset...

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:30.036
SERENA: GO!

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.772
SHAUNA: No doubt
Serena's teamwork is amazing.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.242
But we'll show them
what we've got, too.

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:36.810
What do you say, Ivysaur?

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.744
IVYSAUR: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:40.647
SLURPUFF: [PRIMP]

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:42.516
SMOOCHUM: [PRIMP/KISS]

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.522
JESSIE: None of that
means a thing, because who

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:51.558
will be Kalos Queen?
Why, it's me!

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:53.059
MEOWTH: We'll show
them who's top of the heap!

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.227
GOURGEIST: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:55.729
WOBBUFFET: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:05:15.282 --> 00:05:17.851
JAMES: If Jessie wins, we can
return to our life of crime.

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:20.287
BONNIE: What a crowd. Wow!

00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:23.190
CLEMONT: Well, this is the
Master Class. This is what it's

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.058
all about.
The whole world is watching!

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:27.661
ASH: Serena, you'll be great!

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:36.203
MONSIEUR PIERRE: Bonjour,
Pokémon lovers, and welcome!

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:40.173
MONSIEUR PIERRE: The hour is
here. We're now at the moment

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.541
you've been waiting for.

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:45.846
MONSIEUR PIERRE: It's
the Gloire City Pokémon Showcase

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.047
Master Class!

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:50.183
MONSIEUR PIERRE:
And it's about to begin!

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:00.694
MONSIEUR PIERRE: Please
allow me to introduce myself.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:03.096
I'm Pierre, your host.
KLEFKI: [GREETING]

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:04.598
MONSIEUR PIERRE:
Now would you please turn

00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:05.866
your attention to the stage?

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:10.770
MONSIEUR PIERRE:
Prepare to meet our beautiful

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.138
and talented performers!

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.111
MONSIEUR PIERRE: And now,
ladies, if you please Take the

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:20.513
Princess Keys you
worked so hard to earn,

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:23.250
place them into the three locks

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.185
MONSIEUR PIERRE: And watch as
the door to your future opens!

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:39.432
SERENA: My first key. It
represents the win that marked

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:42.302
the beginning of my
quest the search for my dreams.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.647
SERENA: My second key. Showing
me that my dream was one step

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:55.181
closer to becoming reality.

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:10.130
SERENA: My third key. Yes, we
had some rough moments winning

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.432
it, but we
overcame them together.

00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:22.609
SERENA: And now, I'm here...and
I WILL become Kalos Queen!

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:37.557
ASH: Serena!

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.775
MONSIEUR PIERRE: It's my
pleasure to introduce you to our

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:57.110
very special guest!

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.182
BONNIE: Who's that?
PIKACHU: [CONFUSED]

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:04.884
MONSIEUR PIERRE: Former Kalos
Queen and well‐known producer,

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:07.887
she has launched the careers of
countless performers throughout

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:12.058
her career. Welcome Palermo!
She's agreed to take on the role

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:14.227
of special judge.

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:16.696
SERENA: I know her!

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:19.432
PALERMO: There's something
you definitely lack to be Kalos

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.468
Queen. Until you know what
that is, you'll never be able to

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:22.602
defeat Aria.

00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:30.777
PALERMO: I'm very much looking
forward to observing everyone's

00:08:30.777 --> 00:08:33.546
wonderful performances today.
Good luck to all of you.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.185
MONSIEUR PIERRE: Thank you. It's
a pleasure to have you here.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.523
All right then! Let's greet our
current queen as she makes her

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.825
grand entrance!

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:47.327
MONSIEUR PIERRE: Please
give a warm welcome to Aria!

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:10.617
ASH: "Who's that Pokémon?"

00:09:16.156 --> 00:09:17.857
ASH: "It's Scraggy!"

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:30.804
BONNIE: Everybody loves her.

00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:33.173
CLEMONT:
Aria's a true Kalos Queen...

00:09:33.173 --> 00:09:35.608
ASH: Serena's worked so hard to
make it here and get the chance

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:37.510
to become queen. She's awesome!

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:45.552
ARIA: Greetings! Thank you all!

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.427
ARIA: Also Greetings
to all the performers...

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:57.230
ARIA: I'm honored to be here
sharing the stage and competing

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.567
with you. So, with the
title of Kalos Queen at stake,

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:02.102
let's compete with
everything we've got!

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.976
ARIA: To all of you here in
person, and all of you watching

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:11.711
on television,
I hope you enjoy the show!

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:17.984
MONSIEUR PIERRE:
Those were lovely words, Aria.

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:20.954
MONSIEUR PIERRE: Now it's time
to explain the rules. Here at

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.823
our Master Class,
there is no Theme Performance.

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.025
It consists of
Freestyle Performances only!

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:28.928
ASH: What's up with that?

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:31.598
CLEMONT: If I had to make a
guess, I suppose the Theme

00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:34.834
Performance is intended to show
off the strong bond between the

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:37.470
performers and their
Pokémon.They've come this far

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.839
already and it must be
assumed that the competitors

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.075
are beyond those early stages.

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:44.444
MONSIEUR PIERRE: Furthermore,
performers will face off against

00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:46.012
one another in the
following tournament format!

00:10:53.353 --> 00:10:55.655
MONSIEUR PIERRE: The first and
second rounds will feature the

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:59.425
