WEBVTT

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:06.006
Wow, we're here! Couriway Town!

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:08.375
EEVEE: [EXCITED]

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.877
ASH: Whoa! Awesome!

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:11.011
PIKACHU: [AMAZED]

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.547
BONNIE: Look at
the waterfalls, Clemont!

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.951
CLEMONT: Couriway Town is known

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:18.785
as the town of waterfalls.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.589
SERENA: And it's the site of the
next Pokémon Showcase!

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.424
EEVEE:
[EXCITED]

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:25.259
SERENA: And it's where you're
going to make your debut.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.227
I'm so
psyched! Are you?

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:28.695
EEVEE: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:32.966
SERENA: It's also
where I'm gonna win my

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:33.834
third Princess Key!

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:42.476
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:46.146
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.284
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.052
Pokémon

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.655
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.925
(I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner)

00:00:58.592 --> 00:00:59.660
Pokémon

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.228
Pokémon

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:02.796
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.945
NARRATOR: Our heroes are now in
Couriway Town, where

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:20.113
Serena will find out if she
can move on to the Pokémon

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.615
Showcase Master Class!

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.651
BONNIE, PIKACHU: So cool

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.386
ASH: Yeah, check it out!

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:27.754
CLEMONT: This time,
the stage incorporates both

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:28.889
terrain and waterfalls!

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:31.525
SERENA: It's our
first performance outside!

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:35.162
EEVEE: [NERVOUS]

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:40.934
SERENA: I was really nervous my
first time, also. And I still

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:45.105
get nervous. But I'm also
really excited! Aren't you?

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.040
EEVEE: [UNSURE]

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.010
SERENA: Lots and lots of
people are going to watch us

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.512
perform. Isn't that wonderful?

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:55.949
EEVEE: [HAPPY]/[DETERMINED]

00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:59.219
SERENA: All right. You're going
to have you dance during the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.087
Freestyle Performance, okay?

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:01.755
EEVEE: [EXCITED]

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:11.131
PALERMO:
There's that girl.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:33.153
JESSIE: So this is the stage?
I'll just show off

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.788
my giga‐gorgeousness and
win this time for sure!

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:37.524
JAMES: But if you
want to perform in

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.526
the Freestyle Performance,
you first have to get

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:40.227
through the Theme Performance.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:41.662
MEOWTH: That's the rule

00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:44.798
JESSIE: You leave that to me.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.573
EEVEE: [WAKING]

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:02.582
EEVEE: [NERVOUS]

00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:05.519
PANCHAM: [CONCERNED]

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:10.023
SERENA: Eevee?

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:18.365
SERENA: We'll all stay with
you until you can relax, okay.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.935
Right here by your
side. Don't worry.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.105
EEVEE: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:40.220
JESSIE: My only real challenge
will be the Theme Performance.

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.356
As long as I get through that

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.958
MEOWTH: You will because we're
gonna find out what the theme

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.027
is ahead of time!

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:48.895
JESSIE: You're right. And that
is called wisdom.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.530
JAMES: Pure
genius.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.734
JAMES: Which one is it?

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.102
JESSIE: It's got
to be one of these.

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:56.436
MEOWTH: Oy vey.
This isn't it either!

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.507
‐JAMES: Come ON!
‐JESSIE: Come ON!

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.343
JAMES: We've run far enough.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.078
We should be fine now.

00:04:06.113 --> 00:04:07.147
MEOWTH: That was some freak‐out!

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:09.616
JESSIE: And who do you
think created this mess?!

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:12.052
MEOWTH: Hey, whaddaya got there?

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:15.589
JESSIE: Who knows? I just
grabbed whatever was nearby

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:17.157
JAMES: What a strange drawing.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:22.429
JESSIE: Maybe this
is some kind of hint.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.699
MEOWTH: Yeah, but what hint?
Maybe

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.234
it's an Ekans with a Mamoswine
jammed into its mouth

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:30.103
JAMES: To my eye,
it looks like a UFO.

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:32.706
JESSIE: So it's a performance
from another planet?!

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.645
JESSIE: Wait! Maybe this is
some kind of Pokémon hat!

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:40.347
MEOWTH: You may be right!
I'll bet they're gonna test

00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:41.982
your fashion sense!

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.418
JESSIE: I'm sure of it. I'll
make the perfect Pokémon hat!

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.124
BONNIE: I got here first!

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:56.129
BONNIE: Look at all the people!

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.900
SERENA: Bonnie! Make
sure you stay close by!

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.801
You don't wanna get lost!

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.402
BONNIE: Okay!

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:03.236
NINI: Serena!

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.939
NINI: Hey! Hi! Hey!

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.908
SERENA: Nini!
ASH: Long time no see!

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:09.843
BONNIE: Hi, Smoochum!
Farfetch'd. How are you?

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.947
FARFETCH'D: [GREETING]
PANCHAM: [UNCOMFORTABLE]

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:19.352
SERENA: Wow.
You've got a Gothita!

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:20.787
NINI: It's my new friend.

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:22.055
GOTHITA: [GREETING]

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:23.089
BONNIE: So cute!

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:28.061
POKEDEX: Gothita. The
Fixation Pokémon. Gothita's

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.663
psychic powers are made stronger
by its ribbon‐like feelers.

00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:33.733
When Gothita becomes fixated
on something, it's looking at

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:34.935
something only it can see.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.003
SERENA: You're entering
the Showcase, right?

00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:40.907
NINI: Of course!
One more Princess Key to go.

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.542
And this is where I'll get it!

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:43.376
SERENA: One more for me, too!

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:45.412
SERENA: I'm not gonna lose!

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:46.379
NINI: Neither am I!

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:48.615
EEVEE: [NERVOUS]

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:50.150
NINI: I haven't
seen Eevee before

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.852
EEVEE: [STARTLED]

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:53.220
SERENA: That's right! Eevee's an
amazing dancer.

00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:57.390
NINI: Is
something wrong?

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.358
EEVEE: [SCARED]
SERENA: Eevee's shy.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.193
It has to get to know you.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.127
And that might
take a while.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.983
PIERRE: Bonjour, Pokémon
lovers, and welcome! Get ready

00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:24.517
for a competition magnifique!

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.155
The Couriway Pokémon Showcase
will delight, as we present

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:30.223
our Rookie Class Division!

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:38.031
PIERRE: Alors, I'm your dream
world guide. Monsieur Pierre!

00:06:42.302 --> 00:06:43.803
PIERRE: Prepare to
witness a competition

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:44.471
par excellence!

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:47.874
The winner gets one step
closer to becoming

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:49.809
the queen
with this princess key.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:53.647
PIERRE: Ladies and
gentlemen, tonight's exciting

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:55.849
Theme Performance
is on the screen!

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.220
JESSIE: Yes!
Pokémon hat making!

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:02.522
MEOWTH: Jessie's
a shoo‐in for headwear.

00:07:04.724 --> 00:07:06.192
PIERRE: A Poké
Puff performance!

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:10.997
JESSIE: To think I stayed
up all night and made

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:13.333
twenty‐three hats

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:15.001
MEOWTH: I guess you'll
have to find twenty‐three heads.

00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:22.609
BONNIE: This should
be easy for Serena!

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.246
ASH: Yeah. Her
Poké Puffs are great!

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:27.547
CLEMONT: I'm sure she'll get
to the Freestyle Performance!

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.917
PIERRE: In the
Poké Puff performance,

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:34.020
it is not just about
baking, but elegantly

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.690
and imaginatively
performing while baking.

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:41.561
PIERRE: The judging is very
simple. If you think a

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:44.064
performance is exceptional,
please cast your vote with

00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:46.800
the Glow Castors
you have at your seat.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.835
If a performer gets enough
votes, she'll pass the

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:49.869
Theme Performance!

00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:53.373
PIERRE: Without further
delay, please welcome

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:55.008
our first performer. Nini!

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:02.682

PIERRE: Très bien!
Nini has created a

00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:45.091
beautiful‐looking Poké Puff!

00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:48.995
SERENA: Nini was great!

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.164
PANCHAM, EEVEE: [AGREEING]

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:53.166
JESSIE: Boring colors.

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:55.235
MEOWTH: Anything Twerp‐related
is bound to be a snooze fest.

00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:57.604
CHESPIN: [STRUGGLING]

00:08:57.604 --> 00:08:58.938
CLEMONT: Chespin,
you've got to calm down!

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.641

ASH, CLEMONT, BONNIE: Yeah!

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.827

passed the Theme Performance!

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:22.595

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:25.899

fueling a super‐flour sift!

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:43.616
Now we add a touch of milk

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:44.451
WOBBUFFET: [HAPPY]

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.554
JESSILEE: And next, we
