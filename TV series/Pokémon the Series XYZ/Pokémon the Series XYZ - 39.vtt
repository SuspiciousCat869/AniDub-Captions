NARRATOR:
During the final battle

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.940
between Ash and
Alain at the Kalos League,

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.810
Ash‐Greninja faced
Mega Charizard once more.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.812
and was defeated,

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.514
leaving Alain as the
Kalos League Champion!

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.484
But during the awards ceremony,
an unexpected crisis occurred.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.455
LYSANDRE: It's here!

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:22.923
The spotlight's on my
greatest work of all!

ALAIN: Where's Mairin?
ASH: During the finals,

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:49.816
she didn't wanna
get in your way.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.952
She asked me not to tell you!

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:53.120
ALAIN: She's always
overthinking these things...

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.390
ASH: At a time like this,
I guess I can ask...

00:00:57.324 --> 00:00:58.959
Is Mairin important to you?

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:02.095
ALAIN: Yeah...

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:03.997

BONNIE:
Ash, Squishy disappeared.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:20.847
It ran off somewhere!

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:24.351
ANNOUNCER (FEMALE): Giant
mysterious creeping vines

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:26.386
are overrunning the city,

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:29.089
and there has been major damage
centered around Prism Tower.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.891

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.731
BONNIE: It's glowing.

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:39.933
ALAIN: Could it be...Zygarde?

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.835
SERENA: What do you mean?

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.537
ALAIN: Those vines are
the work of Zygarde for sure!

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:44.605

Squishy's heading
over to Prism Tower!

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:35.622
CLEMONT: What? Really?

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:38.392
BONNIE: Yeah! I'm sure of it!
CLEMONT: Bonnie! Wait!

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:40.560

to you guys a little later!

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.229
SERENA: What about you?

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.196
ASH: I'm going with
Alain to find Mairin!

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:44.865
SERENA: But...

00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:46.166
ASH: I'll see you as
soon as we find her!

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.102
CLEMONT: Hey, Ash...Take this!

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.937
CLEMONT: It's a communicator!

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:52.639
I thought we'd
encounter a situation

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.975
precisely like this one!

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:56.376
CLEMONT: It's not that powerful,
but it should come in handy!

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.478
ASH: Thanks, Clemont!

00:02:58.478 --> 00:02:59.613

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:01.615

OLYMPIA: Green fire.
A flickering green flame.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:38.785
I saw it engulf Kalos

and threaten to
consume all of the people

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:43.123
and Pokémon in
that swirling fire!

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:45.125

this was going to happen.

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.724
LYSANDRE:
We are here to remake the world.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.060
Into a place of
pure beauty and peace!

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:23.663
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"Who's that Pokémon?"

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:31.271
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"It's Zygarde 10% Forme!"

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:40.280
LYSANDRE: Team Flare's purpose
is to transform our world

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.781
into an exquisite
example of creation!

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.852
LYSANDRE:
This Pokémon's name is Zygarde:

00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:48.221
a Legendary Pokémon

00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:51.391
who will preside over the
new order of the Kalos region.

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:53.893
LYSANDRE: So,
as leaders of this new order,

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:56.362
we have decided to join forces

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:57.630
with this powerful
guardian of creation.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:03.002
LYSANDRE: Zygarde is angry
at the behavior of both people

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:06.039
and Pokémon.

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:07.574
LYSANDRE: The discipline
of this world has been lost.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:12.612
Humanity is out of control.
We have forgotten how to share!

00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:16.583
LYSANDRE: Without sharing,

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:19.619
people begin to
steal from each other.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.589
LYSANDRE: When that happens,
there is not enough for anyone!

00:10:22.589 --> 00:10:25.358
In order to live in
peace without stealing,

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:28.261
we must reduce the number
of beings on this planet.

00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:30.530
LYSANDRE: Only the chosen
ones will move into our bright,

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.265
hopeful future!

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.036
LYSANDRE: We of Team Flare,
along with the fury of Zygarde,

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:39.105
will be the ones who
will make that judgment!

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:44.744
LYSANDRE: The new order
will do away with the chaos

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:47.313
of the world and bring about
the beautiful future we desire!

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.654

00:10:56.422 --> 00:10:58.158
We have orders from Lysandre
to bring you to him right away.

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:02.262
MAIRIN:
So you're the bad guys, too!

00:11:02.262 --> 00:11:03.997
TEAM FLARE GRUNT: No.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.633
We are doing all this for
the cause of world peace.

00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:08.034

MAIRIN: Professor?

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.873
SYCAMORE: Forcing anyone to
do something against their will

00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:16.176
is wrong... I don't like that.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:16.976

SYCAMORE: You saw him?

00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:58.952
MAIRIN:
That's right. He was with Ash!

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:01.020
They were talking
about Prism Tower.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.956
SYCAMORE: I see...

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:04.524
SYCAMORE: He and Ash
may be in grave danger...

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.228
SYCAMORE: We need to
head there now. Stay close.

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:12.065
MAIRIN: 'Kay.
I'm worried, Professor...

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.800
about all that stuff
Lysandre was saying.

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:17.103
SYCAMORE: Yes.
We have to be careful

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:18.404
and find out what's
really going on.

00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:32.352

soon give you all the details.

Isn't it exquisite?
