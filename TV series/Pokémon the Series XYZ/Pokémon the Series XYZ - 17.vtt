WEBVTT

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:05.439
CLEMONT: Move it, everyone!
Let's really step on the gas!

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:08.108
BONNIE: He sure
is acting weird...

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:10.677
ASH: Yeah,
normally he'd complain.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:12.679
SERENA: I guess
he's really excited!

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.582
CLEMONT: We're going to an
Electric‐type celebration!

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.018
It's Zapdos Festival!

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.155
CLEMONT: As an Electric‐type
Pokémon Trainer,

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.624
I've always wanted to
witness this great event!

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.295
CLEMONT: You see, long ago a
tree in the center of Joule Town

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.097
was split by a bolt of
lightning sent by Zapdos.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.468
CLEMONT: But amazingly, the tree
got larger and stronger

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:40.007
and became thick with berries.
The townspeople were overjoyed,

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.275
and that's when they
created the Zapdos Festival!

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.212
They did it with the hope
that Zapdos would appear again

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:46.280
and bring the town good luck,
and that's the story.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:48.015
BONNIE: Uh what's a Zapdos?

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.652
CLEMONT: It's a powerful Pokémon
who can control lightning.

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:53.220
MOLTRES: [FLAMETHROWER MOVE]

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.122
CLEMONT: There's Moltres, the
Flame Pokemon we saw with Trevor

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:57.791
CLEMONT: And Articuno, the
Freeze Pokémon.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:00.360
CLEMONT: And
finally, there's Zapdos.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:05.098
CLEMONT: Together, they form a
trio of Legendary Pokémon!

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:10.437
BONNIE: Wow... Three Legendary
Pokémon.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:12.306
I'd just love to see them!

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:13.140
DEDENNE: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.011
ZAPDOS: [ROAR]

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.748
CLEMONT: Zapdos?
BONNIE: Wowee

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:22.482
SERENA: I've never
seen it before!

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:24.985
CLEMONT: That means Zapdos
really has come back!

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:29.756
SERENA: I
got to see Zapdos!!

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.325
ASH: Isn't it cool?!

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.362
CLEMONT: Hey! We can't just
stand here!

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:37.264
We've got to get
moving!

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:38.265
ASH: Hold on! What's the rush?

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:42.235
CLEMONT: If we don't make it
town by the time Zapdos arrives,

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:45.138
I'm afraid we're going to
miss the festival's main event!

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:56.984
ASH: Hey Clemont,
are you all right?

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.087
CLEMONT: I'm okay,
but that was close!

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.023
ZAPDOS: [ROAR]

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:08.428
BONNIE: It sounds
like Zapdos is angry...

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:10.163
CLEMONT: Yeah.
I wonder what's wrong.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.704
SERENA: It's too dangerous
to try to get to town now.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.207
SERENA: We need to
find shelter somewhere.

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:24.011
I think I found a cave!

00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:25.746
ASH: Great! I think
we should go quickly!

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.755
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:38.659
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.829
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.032
Pokémon

00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:46.700
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:50.370
I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.039
Pokémon

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.907

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.342
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.121
NARRATOR: While traveling
to the Zapdos Festival,

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.756
our heroes have
actually encountered Zapdos.

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:13.126
For their safety, they're
now forced to seek shelter

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.327
in a nearby cave.

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:19.866
BONNIE: That was scary!

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.234
SERENA: I think we should be
safe here for the time being.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.338
CLEMONT: I still hope we can
make it into Joule Town before

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:27.474
the festival begins...

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:31.478
STAN: You said
Joule Town? Tell me!

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.353
STAN: Wait! I didn't
mean to scare you!

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:45.525
STAN: I'm truly sorry
about that. My name is Stan,

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.928
and I'm a paramedic.

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:49.730
CLEMONT: What
happened to your leg?

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.899
STAN: Strange. It's ironic that
a paramedic needs rescuing.

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:57.337
I was driving in that crazy
storm, when I had to make

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:58.839
a sudden turn and
crashed my ambulance.

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:13.887
SERENA: Oh no! Are
you badly hurt?

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:15.222
STAN: No, I was able to patch
myself up.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.891
But more importantly,

00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:19.092
there's something I really need
to ask you guys.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.395
ASH: What can
we do?

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.831
STAN: Here. I need you to take
this over

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:27.200
to the hospitalin
town.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.568
STAN: There's a child who's
waiting for this medicine.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.571
It needs to get there as
soon as possible,

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:34.608
but I'm in this condition

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:35.842
STAN: I'm sorry for having to
ask in the first placebut

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:40.046
if you could please do this for
me...

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:42.048
ASH: So, we just need
to get it to the hospital.

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:43.850
STAN: Will you do it, guys?

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.851
ASH: Of course we will!

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:46.787
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.524
CLEMONT: But how can we
get there with all that

00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:52.859
lightning going on?

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:55.428
STAN: This cave used to have a
direct connection straight into

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:58.131
Joule Town, but now the only
open route is outside.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.435
STAN: A long time ago, the cave
was sealed off by a rockslide

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:06.239
STAN: The route's been
blocked off ever since.

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:07.641
ASH: No problem. I'm
glad you gave us a heads up!

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:09.843
STAN: You are?

00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:11.211

you!

through the cave!

We've gotta
find the shortest route!

MEOWTH: Honestly? Not this time.

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:36.029

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.130
as per usual...

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.838
MEOWTH: But we hadn't
planned on lugging a large load

00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:47.207

about.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.379
Now I understand why
Zapdos is so angry.

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:57.050
JESSIE: So we got a
bit carried away...

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.654

Zapdos to let us through.

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:03.323
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]
MEOWTH: Ask?!

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:05.792

of your Twerpish mind?!

if we split up, we're toast!

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:25.211
MEOWTH: Wait up! I don't
wanna be a dumb piece of toast!

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:28.948
