ASH: You wanna interview ME?

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:30.991

SERENA: There's no time for
that! You've got to register!

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:06.586
CLEMONT: We're sorry.

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:09.089
But the thing is, registration
is going to close soon.

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:10.891
