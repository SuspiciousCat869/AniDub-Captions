00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:29.809
I guess that would make sense.

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.544
ALAIN:
Being the strongest Trainer

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:34.447
has nothing to do with this.
I want... to battle him.

00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:37.050
That's all.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.284
MALVA:
Are you talking about Ash?

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.788
MALVA: You're giving
him all this attention.

00:08:41.788 --> 00:08:42.622
The boy should be flattered.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.425
ALAIN:
What do you mean? Just tell me.

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:47.727
Is that the real you talking?

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:54.734
MALVA: I hear the Mega Evolution
energy gathering

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:56.770
is nearly complete.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.506
So after you save Chespin,
then what do you do?

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:13.787
ALAIN: None of your business.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.157
MALVA: Yes, you're right.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.965
JESSIE: So tired...Please tell
me we're done for today...

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.134
JAMES: I'm starving!

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:29.869
WOBBUFFET: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.706
MEOWTH: Hey. Stifle it!

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.308
MALVA: Here we go...Let's edit!

00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:39.979
MEOWTH: I thought we were done.

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:42.182
MALVA: Then how are we
going to get it on air in time?!

00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:44.651
Come on. Get back to work.

00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:45.852
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH:
Yes ma'am...

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:52.058
JESSIE: Wait 'til you
see w tomorrow brings.

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:54.627
We'll give you some big news.

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.863
JAMES: The Pokémon who
have made it to the finals

00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:58.798
are quite a cadre of
especially strong specimens.

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:01.768
MEOWTH: We'll catch them
all and then we can eat!

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.103
WOBBUFFET: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.270
MEOWTH: Turn it down!

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.273
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Have you seen Alain already?

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:10.110
MAIRIN: Not yet.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.077
MAIRIN: I'll see him
after the finals are over.

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:15.081
I know he's gotta concentrate.
Don't wanna bother him.

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:19.786
MAIRIN: There will be plenty
of time to bother him later!

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:22.155
ASH: Got it.
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:23.490
CLEMONT: By the way.
Professor, why are you here?

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:25.592
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Well, I've
been doing

00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:27.694
quite a bit of research...

00:10:27.694 --> 00:10:29.329
and I found this
about Greninja's powers.

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:32.398
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE, ACT
BREAK: "Who's that Pokémon?"

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:39.606
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"It's Sceptile!"

00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:54.087
BRELOOM: [DRAIN PUNCH MOVE]

00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:55.288
SAWYER:
So that's a Drain Punch...

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.824
SCRAFTY: [PAINED]

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.425
SAWYER: It's a powerful move

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:01.427
that drains an
opponent of its energy.

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:03.129
BRELOOM: [ENERGIZED]

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:04.330
SAWYER: Now, if they
decide to use Leech Seed,

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:08.101
they could possibly turn the
battle around in their favor!

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:09.802
SCEPTILE: [AGREEMENT]

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:12.071
SAWYER: It's so amazing.

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.706
There are so many battle
tactics I don't know yet.

00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:16.609
Yeah. It sure is a
big world out there.

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:19.946
SAWYER: Pokémon battles
are deep all right...

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:24.751
SAWYER: Being able to battle
Ash at the Kalos League...

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:28.254
I've gained more experience
here than I could've imagined!

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.692
SAWYER:
And it was so much fun, too.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.227
My greatest battle yet!

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:36.896
SAWYER: But...That's it.

00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:39.899
My Kalos League
challenge is over now.

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:45.638
SAWYER:
I told Ash that I'd cheer him on

00:11:45.638 --> 00:11:46.706
with a smile on my face.

00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:50.310
And I will.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.079
But it hurts.
It really hurts!

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.881
SCEPTILE: [SYMPATHETIC]

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.883
SAWYER:
I wish I could've battled more.

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.618
Just a little bit more!

00:11:58.618 --> 00:12:00.053
SCEPTILE: [AGREEMENT]

00:12:03.523 --> 00:12:06.226
SAWYER: I know what to do!
I'll get more experience!

00:12:07.527 --> 00:12:09.362
This's no time for crying!

00:12:09.362 --> 00:12:10.463
SCEPTILE: [AGREEMENT]

00:12:12.999 --> 00:12:15.168
LEAGUE REP:
What do you think, Lysandre?

00:12:15.168 --> 00:12:17.403
LEAGUE REP: We'll be happy
to provide this area for you

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.639
to view the final
match tomorrow.

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:21.207
LYSANDRE: I appreciate you
arranging this so quickly.

00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:24.244
Thanks very much.
LEAGUE REP: Not at all.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.813
It's an honor to have
such a well‐known resident

00:12:26.813 --> 00:12:28.748
of Kalos come watch our event.
We all thank YOU!

00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:34.153
LEAGUE REP: Well then,
I must be getting along.

00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:36.756
If you need anything,
please call.

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:41.294
XEROSIC: Lysandre.

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:58.244
XEROSIC: We've taken
control of central Lumiose.

00:12:58.244 --> 00:13:00.246
The Gym is closed for
the duration of the League,

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.382
so it was easy.

00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:04.017
LYSANDRE: Tell me when
preparations are completed.

00:13:04.017 --> 00:13:05.285
XEROSIC: I will. At once.

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:09.455
LYSANDRE:
What's Mairin doing now?

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.291
TEAM FLARE ADMIN: She made
contact with the Trainer

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.191
who will be battling
in the finals.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.462
LYSANDRE: Oh...
That's Greninja's Trainer. Good.

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:19.065
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: I was
looking at this old manuscript.

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:21.901
I found something. Look at this.

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:25.338
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: They call
it the Bond Phenomenon.

00:13:25.338 --> 00:13:26.873
ASH: Bond Phenomenon?

00:13:26.873 --> 00:13:28.775
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:13:28.775 --> 00:13:30.443
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Here's what it says.

00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:33.012
It's a rare phenomenon
that happens between Trainer

00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:35.214
and Pokémon...when the bond
of trust between them grows.

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.617
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: In addition,

00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:39.752
it appears the Pokémon's
latent skills matter, too.

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:43.289
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: So it's
not something that happens

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:44.357
with every Pokémon.

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:48.995
ASH: Then that means
Greninja's special, huh...

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.630
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
I remember saying how Greninja

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.366
chose you right
from the beginning.

00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:54.467
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
At the same time,

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:55.868
Greninja may have
been aware of its

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:57.403
many latent skills all along.

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:00.340
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
It may have known that you, Ash,

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:03.576
would be the one who can
draw out its true powers.

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:07.213
Perhaps your encounter
was truly meant to be.

00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:10.316
ASH: Yeah...

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:12.151
XEROSIC: Hurry with the setup!

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:13.219
TEAM FLARE GRUNTS X 3: Sir!

00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:23.463
B CORE: [SCARED]

00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:35.708
SQUISHY: [QUESTIONING]

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.912
SQUISHY: [WORRIED]

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:42.849
MAIRIN: Thanks.
I'll be fine from here on.

00:14:42.849 --> 00:14:44.951
BONNIE: Stay with us, please?
We want to talk with you more!

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:49.255
MAIRIN:
But Lysandre's waiting for me.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:52.024
And I'd really rather
not bump into Alain...

00:14:52.024 --> 00:14:53.793
MAIRIN: Chespin...
CHESPIN: [HAPPY]

00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:56.362
You're so sweet.
I'm so glad I met you!

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:59.432
CHESPIN: [EMBARRASSED]

00:14:59.432 --> 00:15:01.801
PANCHAM: [EXASPERATED]

00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:03.703
MAIRIN: You're a bit
different than my Chespie.

00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:05.972
You act kind of silly, you know?
You're kind of like me.

00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:08.941
CHESPIN: [EMBARRASSED]

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:10.009
SERENA: One thing, Mairin.

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:14.380
SERENA: If there's anything
we can do, just let us know.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.682
We'll do whatever
we can to help!

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:17.984
BONNIE: We sure will!

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.388
SERENA: Good luck.
I hope Chespie gets well soon.

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:26.526
MAIRIN: Chespie's gonna be fine!
It'll get better soon.

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:29.395
I'm sure of that!

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:32.298
BONNIE: When it gets better,
please bring your Chespie over.

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:34.934
To play with Chespin!
CHESPIN: [AGREEMENT]

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.370
MAIRIN: Thanks a lot, you guys!
I will. See you soon!

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:41.207
MAIRIN: Wow. This was a fun day!

00:15:41.207 --> 00:15:42.809
BONNIE: See you tomorrow, 'kay?

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:51.751
ASH: We're finally
going up against Alain!

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:53.586
What do we want? We want to win.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.922
And we're gonna do just that!

00:15:56.656 --> 00:15:58.624
ASH: Ready?

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.126
PIKACHU/GRENINJA/TALONFLAME/
HAWLUCHA/NOIVERN: [CHEERING]

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.403
ALAIN: Tomorrow is our battle
against Ash. I just can't wait!

00:16:12.238 --> 00:16:14.507
ALAIN: Not sure why,
but that's how I truly feel.

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:17.243
CHARIZARD: [AGREEMENT]

00:16:22.882 --> 00:16:24.016
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.722
ALAIN: Charizard...

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:31.891
ALAIN:
Very soon... we'll have enough.

00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:35.928
CHARIZARD: [HAPPY]

00:16:44.637 --> 00:16:46.639
LYSANDRE:
Hi there. You must be Ash.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:49.141
ASH: That's right. Who are you?

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:51.010
LYSANDRE: Lysandre.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.680
ASH: Mairin mentioned you.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.149
LYSANDRE:
Oh? So you know Mairin?

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:58.951
ASH: Yeah, we were
just hanging out with her.

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:01.287
She left for her hotel.

00:17:01.287 --> 00:17:02.655
LYSANDRE:
I came here to see you.

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:04.757
ASH: See me?

00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:07.793
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Got a sec? Let's catch up.

00:17:09.996 --> 00:17:11.564
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Wow,
Charizard! You look so strong!

00:17:12.265 --> 00:17:13.599
CHARIZARD: [PLEASED]

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.274
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
So much to say...

00:17:23.676 --> 00:17:24.343
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: There's a
lot I want to tell you...

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.080
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
But now, the words escape me.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.051
ALAIN: Are you angry
I didn't come back?

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:36.022
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Angry? Oh, no.

00:17:36.022 --> 00:17:37.657
I heard you've been working
with Lysandre on his work.

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:40.493
ALAIN: I have been.

00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:42.361
I didn't want to put
you in any kind of danger.

00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:46.599
ALAIN:
They say there's great value

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:47.800
in the energy that's
produced during Mega Evolution.

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:51.804
ALAIN: But there are those
who will use that power for evil

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:53.839
and do anything to get it.

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:54.874
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
You did that...

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:56.342
so you could protect me?

00:17:58.377 --> 00:17:59.812
ALAIN: And I can't return.

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.749
I lost far too much
after I left for my journey.

00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:06.886
Until I can get them back...

00:18:08.888 --> 00:18:10.690
I have to become much,
much stronger.

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.094
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Do what you need to do.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:18.831
LYSANDRE:
The talk of the Kalos League...

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:21.667
is totally about you
and your Greninja.

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:25.404
ASH: About the Bond Phenomenon,
right?

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:27.573
LYSANDRE:
Oh? The Bond Phenomenon...

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:29.275
ASH: That's right. You see,

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.477
Professor Sycamore looked
into it. So is that it?

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:35.247
LYSANDRE: Such power is amazing!

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:38.017
It's a new possibility
between people and Pokémon!

00:18:38.017 --> 00:18:39.685
It's sure to be
a guiding light...

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:41.854
that ushers in a new world.

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:43.489
LYSANDRE: Mega Evolution...

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:45.257
I'm interested in it

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:49.028
and the bond that exists
between people and Pokémon.

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:52.398
I'd love to hear your story in
detail after the League is over.

00:18:52.398 --> 00:18:54.734
LYSANDRE:
Can we make a promise to meet?

00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:57.236
ASH: Sure...
LYSANDRE: Thank you!

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:59.572
Until then, I wish you the
best of luck in the finals!

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:01.607
ASH: Thanks!

00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:05.578
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:21.761
MAIRIN: Hi, Lysandre!

00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:23.562
LYSANDRE:
Mairin! I have good news.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:28.134
LYSANDRE: Everything will
be better tomorrow.

00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:30.036
LYSANDRE: Chespie, too.

00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:32.471
All because of the
Mega Evolution energy

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:34.940
Alain has gathered.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.110
MAIRIN:
Thank goodness. I'm so relieved!

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:49.955
ANNOUNCER: The final round of
the Kalos League is upon us!

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:51.891
After one fierce
battle followed by another,

00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:53.959
one last battle remains!

00:20:05.004 --> 00:20:07.440
NARRATOR: As the entire
Kalos region watches,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.375
two Trainers will
battle in the finals!

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.311
Who will emerge victorious?

00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:13.546
NARRATOR: Will it be Ash?

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:14.914
NARRATOR: Or will it be Alain?

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.759
REFEREE:
Both Trainers please enter!

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:45.878
NARRATOR: As the Kalos League
reaches its conclusion,

00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:47.880
both questions
will soon be answered,

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.682
as the journey continues!
