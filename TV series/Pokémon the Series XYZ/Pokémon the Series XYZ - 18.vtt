The diamond is still here.

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:31.111
GUARD A:
Looks like nothing was stolen.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:34.715
GUARD B: That's strange. All
they did was open the lock.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.522
GUARD C: Who are you?!

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:45.792

opened the lock? Why, I did!

definitely his handiwork.

OFFICER JENNY: You were
watching too, weren't you?

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.749
Tell me exactly what you saw.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.351
BONNIE: He threw
that card, then escaped

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:13.720
through that window!
He laughed and called

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.722

You made that lock yourself?!

every single one of Master

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.939
SERENA: I wonder why.

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.007

I'd say that he might be

00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:08.341

we'll be able to pick any

kind of lock that
needs picking. Handy!

an incident like this?

you again. People and locks

When you're trying to get

someone to open up, you treat
them with kindness, right?

lot of learning to do!

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.554

shortly after that incident.

Along with the
other Binacle, Lefty.

wanted to find them both,

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:18.031
so I said do whatever
you want. I have no time

Once those two had made

the decision to leave me,
then I was through!

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:10.496
ED: A locksmith never ever gives
up when trying to open a lock!

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:14.600
I taught you to always try to
open every lock, didn't I?!

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.802
LOCKE: Ed

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:17.737
ED: Your hands stuck together?!

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:23.075
LOCKE: I was just giving myself
a little break. Lefty, let's go!

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.213
ED: That's the spirit! I'll
work on it from the outside,

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.048
so you work on
it from the inside!

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:30.149
LOCKE: Okay!
ED: See the rotary latch?

00:17:30.683 --> 00:17:32.585
LOCKE: I do!

00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:34.820
ED: It's a difficult job.
There are five of them inside.

00:17:36.589 --> 00:17:39.892
Move the back latch to the right
twice. Move the closest latch to

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.427
the left once and
then the middle latch over

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:42.261
to the right by one.

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:45.831
ED: I'll hold onto any damaged
parts! Give me a hand, Righty!

00:17:47.867 --> 00:17:49.502
ED: Good!

00:17:49.502 --> 00:17:50.303
ED: Quickly!
We're running out of time!

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.539
LOCKE: Right! Lefty,
I'm counting on you!

00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:00.313
ED: Now, compose yourself.
And stay calm.

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.283
ED: Gently. Gently

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.629
LOCKE: Please, EdThere's
something I want to tell you in

00:18:16.629 --> 00:18:17.697
case this doesn't work.

00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:20.833
ED: Be quiet and
move those hands!

00:18:22.702 --> 00:18:24.003
LOCKE: Master Thief Keys,
who's been opening your locks

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:27.873
that guy's me. I wanted
you to acknowledge my skills.

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.676
ED: I knew that.

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:32.979
ED: Do I have to spell
everything out for you?

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.182
There are only two
people who have the skill

00:18:36.182 --> 00:18:37.984
to open those locks.
Me, and you.

00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:41.754
ED: Yes, you're
already a fine locksmith.

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:45.358
LOCKE: You mean it?

00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:58.938
ED: Listen! This is
where it all counts the most!

00:18:58.938 --> 00:19:00.373
LOCKE: All right, sir!

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:17.189
Well done my apprentice.

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:19.425

price for what you did.

You can tell me all about
it down at the station.

ED: I hope you'll come
back when you're a free man.

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:56.128
I'll leave the door unlocked.
Count on it.

there's no doubt
he's a great locksmith.

stays between us, all right?

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:21.320
OFFICER JENNY: Since all
Locke did was open locks,

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.022
I'll go ahead and issue
him a warning and he'll

00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:24.790
be released in no time at all.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.158
ED: Sorry for all of this.

00:20:27.293 --> 00:20:29.395
ASH: Wow, really?!

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:31.664
ED: I figured by
keeping quiet for a change,

00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:32.531
I could teach him a lesson.
