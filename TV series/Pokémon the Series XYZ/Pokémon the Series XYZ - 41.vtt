and Bonnie is chasing after

Squishy. All of our heroes are
valiantly doing what they can.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:22.122
As for Ash and Greninja, they
have broken free from Lysandre's

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.904

forget after being in constant

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.743

it gains Mega Evolution power!

CLEMBOT: I'm scanning now.

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:28.575
CLEMBOT: There are
three of them, one further back.

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:30.811
CLEMBOT: I detect the very
same elements in their device as

00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:32.979
contained within
the red Zygarde.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.081
CLEMONT:
Maybe it's their control system.

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.818
CLEMBOT: It is possible that I
could infiltrate their system

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:39.019
and stop it from functioning.

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.220

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.709
LYSANDRE: Oh, done so soon?

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.846
ASH: No way!
I never quit until it's over!

00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:37.417
ASH: I think you called that
fighting spirit. But there's a

00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:39.686
lot more to a
Pokémon's strength than that!

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:42.922
ASH: I learned that on my
journey. My Pokémon's strength

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:45.458
and my strength come from
believing in each other and

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.327
caring for each
other more than anything else.

00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:54.634
ASH: And if you don't
understand that, we'll show you!

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.171
ASH: Talonflame,
now! Use Flame Charge!

00:08:58.171 --> 00:08:59.406
And Greninja, you use Cut!

LYSANDRE: What's wrong?

00:09:31.104 --> 00:09:33.606
LYSANDRE: Ash, with all that big
talk of yours, is that all you

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:36.876
can come up with? Well then,
this is it! Use Hyper Beam!

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:38.344

00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:46.886

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:48.221
ALAIN: Malva!
MEGA HOUNDOOM: [EXERTION]

00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:50.590
MALVA: Time for all
this to end. Right now!

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.225
LYSANDRE: Malva...What
is the meaning of this?

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:55.095
MALVA: It's really simple.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:56.729
I'm putting my
complete trust in these kids.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:00.767
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"Who's that Pokémon?"

00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:07.674
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"It's Crobat!"

00:10:15.215 --> 00:10:17.684
MALVA: I know this world is
hardly perfect. Far from it.

00:10:19.853 --> 00:10:20.687
LYSANDRE: Then why
are you getting in my way?

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:25.024
MALVA: Because I saw them!

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:28.161
MALVA: Changing the world isn't
about destroying it! And people

00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:29.062
like them are proof of that!

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.933
LYSANDRE: Then let me ask you.
These children, who are destined

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:36.603
to lose... what kind of world
are they capable of making?

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:39.706
MALVA: They
haven't lost yet, have they?

00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:44.544
MALVA: Changing the world
is not something they can do by

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:47.714
themselves, but if adults
like us offer to lend a hand,

00:10:47.714 --> 00:10:50.016
then I'm sure things
can change for the better.

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:52.018
MALVA: The possibilities are
real, and I want to see them!

00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:58.324
LYSANDRE: Our conversation is
through. You've wasted enough of

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:01.427
my precious time!

GRENINJA: [WATER SHURIKEN MOVE]

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:17.177
ASH: Now look! You may not
like this world much. So what?

00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:20.513
It belongs to people
and Pokémon...Everyone!

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:24.951
ASH: Your plan to recreate
the world...All that talk...

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:26.452
You have no
right to say any of that!

meeting new people all the time!

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.126

their dreams come true...

00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:35.728
ASH: People just getting
started on their journeys!

00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:38.464
ASH: People who are
healing from old wounds...

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:40.934
ASH: Everyone's
got their own tomorrow!

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:43.937
ASH: And you have no right to

00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:45.238
take their
tomorrows away from them!

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.641
ASH: That's why we fight.

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:50.843
My Pokémon and I are
fighting for their tomorrows!

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:52.345
PIKACHU: [DEFIANT]

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.415
MALVA: Sounds like the future

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:56.482
Ash talks
about is pretty bright.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.591
LYSANDRE: How naive can you get?
You sound just like me back

00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:05.959
in the days when I was naive!

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:10.330

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:12.632

00:12:25.545 --> 00:12:26.512
MAIRIN: It's fine. See?

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:30.416
SERENA: Thank goodness!

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:31.117

Now, how do we get ourselves

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:32.318
out of this situation?

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.358

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:41.527
You don't really want to
get hurt, do you?

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:42.295

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:50.403

It's me! Bonnie! Can you see me?

don't want to do this, do you?

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:10.256
I know you don't!

Mysterious Squishy, how I
love you. So, oh please,

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.738

Amazing. Zygarde's splitting!

00:16:13.873 --> 00:16:14.907

What's going on, Xerosic?!

00:16:16.242 --> 00:16:18.144
XEROSIC: Look,
I'm too busy to deal with that!

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.011
I'm battling an intruder!

00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:21.113
LYSANDRE: Battling an intruder?

00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:24.183
XEROSIC:
It's the Lumiose Gym Leader!

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:26.052
ASH: Clemont!

00:16:26.052 --> 00:16:27.386

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.752
XEROSIC: Return, you two!

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:04.190
XEROSIC: Now what?

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.592
CLEMBOT: I've done it!
I've infiltrated the system!

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:07.960
XEROSIC: What are you doing?!

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.362
CLEMONT: Activate the system!

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:10.463
CLEMBOT: Roger!

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:17.203
CLEMBOT:
That worked out quite nicely.

00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:19.872
CLEMONT: Who knew?
It sure came in handy, though.

00:17:21.107 --> 00:17:22.208
CLEMBOT:
It's my invention, after all.

00:17:25.444 --> 00:17:26.979
CLEMONT: Synchronizing
you with the system.

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:28.147
Shutting it all down!

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.183
CLEMONT: Hold on. What?

00:17:32.652 --> 00:17:35.621
CLEMBOT: If we force it to shut
down, it will heavily stress the

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:38.491
system. And because I'm
currently synchronized with it,

00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:40.960
my main memory will be
completely erased. I won't

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.929
remember a thing.

00:17:42.929 --> 00:17:45.097
CLEMONT: Nothing?
CLEMBOT: Right!

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:47.033
CLEMONT: Hold on a minute!
I can't do that!

00:17:49.035 --> 00:17:50.570
CLEMBOT: But, if we don't,
this crisis will never end.

00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:55.975
CLEMBOT: You're Clemont.
The Leader of the Lumiose Gym.

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.045
A kind and generous Gym Leader.

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:03.115
CLEMBOT: Always thinking of
others. Considering the good of

00:18:03.115 --> 00:18:04.350
the many over the one.

00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:08.921
CLEMBOT: You know
what you must do. So do it!

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:20.132
CLEMONT: I know. I know!

00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:25.738
CLEMONT: I have to! Or
I won't be able to help anyone!

00:18:42.088 --> 00:18:45.124
CLEMBOT: You are the one who
can save the world. You once

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.926
suggested to me
that we learn together.

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:51.430
CLEMONT: And I want to keep
on learning! Right, Clembot?

00:18:52.932 --> 00:18:54.133
CLEMBOT: Well put, sir.

00:18:55.768 --> 00:18:58.170
CLEMBOT:
It made me happy. Thank you.

00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:03.976
CLEMONT: Oh, Clembot...
I'm so glad I know you!

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:07.880
CLEMBOT: Thanks. And I'm
so glad that you created me.

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.016
You're brilliant!

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.151
CLEMONT: Clembot...

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.658
