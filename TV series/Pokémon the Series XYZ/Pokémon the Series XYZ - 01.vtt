I'll take care of Z2, okay.

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:37.010
BRYONY: It would've been easier
if they'd left it up to us

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.378
from the beginning.

00:09:38.378 --> 00:09:41.314

I challenge all about it.

There are lots of Pokémon

Z had another Forme.

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:25.131
BRYONY: This is incredibly
important new information for

00:19:25.131 --> 00:19:27.233
Operation Z. I'd better
report it right now..

had a premonition

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:05.771
NARRATOR: a vision! She saw
a flickering green flame

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:09.341
engulf Kalos, threatening to
consume all of its people and

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:11.143
Pokémon in a raging,
swirling fire!

aware of it yet, but

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.853
that raging, swirling fire has
already begun to draw them in.

of Z is still a mystery to us.

it.

00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:51.450
