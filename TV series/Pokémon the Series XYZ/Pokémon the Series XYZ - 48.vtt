00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.076
NARRATOR:
A long, long time ago...

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.746
NARRATOR: A time recalled
through Kalos legend...

00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:19.586
AILA: No. Wait.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.656
AILA: Jan, please don't go!

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:25.959
JAN: Aila, I promise you I
will defeat Yveltal. Have faith,

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.295
and wait for me.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:29.496
JAN: Talonflame, go!
TALONFLAME: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.167
JAN: Please.

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:37.838
AILA: Jan, no!

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:43.043
NARRATOR: And so, a young man
embarked on a journey, leaving

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.579
his beloved behind...

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.481
NARRATOR: His target, the
Destructon Pokémon, Yveltal!

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.827
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:04.398
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.635
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.038
Pokémon

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:13.707
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:16.209
I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.345
Pokémon

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.813
Pokémon

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:20.948
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:41.101
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
The Maiden Statue

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:50.377
HELIOPTILE: [QUESTIONING]
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Hey!

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:52.312
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Alexa!

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:56.149
ALEXA: Hi, Professor Sycamore!

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.718
ALEXA: Are you here to
investigate the ruins, too?

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.388
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Well, it is
the biggest find of the century.

00:02:02.823 --> 00:02:05.125
The ruins that confirm
the truth of a Kalos legend!

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:09.162
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Who knew
they would be found at such a

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.298
high altitude?

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.834
ALEXA: Right. It's amazing they
were never discovered until now.

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:16.503
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
So where is the Maiden Statue?

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:19.139
ALEXA: Come. I'll show you.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.413
ALEXA: You see, it was
accidentally discovered on a

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:28.649
satellite image.

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.717
ALEXA: A temple‐like structure,
overgrown by nature.

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:34.821
ALEXA: Because the location
is fairly treacherous, it took

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.091
quite some time to get
a research team up here.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.192
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Why did you
accompany the research team,

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:40.427
Alexa?

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.797
ALEXA: Because of this.

00:02:43.797 --> 00:02:46.099
ALEXA: Through the discovery of
various artifacts,

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.035
we knew there was
an ancient nation

00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:50.170
that flourished here, which

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.906
ultimately became the foundation
of civilization in Kalos.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.908
HELIOPTILE: [AFFECTIONATE]

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.210
ALEXA: I wanted to report on the
lives of the people and Pokémon

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.645
living at that time.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:11.491
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: That's it.

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:15.295
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: The statue
of Aila, the stone‐eyed maiden,

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.898
as described in Kalos legend...

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.436
ALEXA: It's as though someone
took a moment of her life and

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:23.904
carved it into stone.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:28.041
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Exactly as the legend describes.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.915
ALEXA:
Ancient historical records?

00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:36.783
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: That's
right. And we've come to know

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:38.719
this particular segment
as the chapter of the

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.421
stone‐eyed maiden.

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:42.823
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Her hair, her necklace...

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:47.060
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Yes,
everything written here within

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.361
these records
perfectly matches the statue.

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:53.166
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: For the
longest time, people have

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.470
debated whether what's written
here actually took place, or if

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.338
it was simply fabricated by
someone during ancient times...

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.009
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Now we have
the statue. So we may finally

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.479
get the answer.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.981
ALEXA: Are you're saying this
statue wasn't a figment

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:11.518
of someone's imagination? Don't
you think that it's entirely

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:13.253
possible that someone created
it based on these records.

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:16.323
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: That
can't be ruled out. However...

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.227
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Her expression...

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:21.261
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
I don't think that this is

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.429
any ordinary statue.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:25.766
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
I believe the stone‐eyed maiden

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:26.933
actually existed.

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.270
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: And the one
who turned her into stone

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.306
is none other than Yveltal,
the Destruction Pokémon.

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.444
ALEXA: Yveltal?

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.981
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Based on all
the research conducted up

00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:45.452
until now, it is believed that
this symbol resembling a Y is a

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:49.890
reference to Yveltal. In all the
drawings we have of it...Those

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.825
drawings and this symbol
look very much the same to me.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:55.796
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: The story
begins when two people from

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:59.232
different social classes‐‐a
young poor man named Jan, and

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:01.501
Aila, the village chief's
daughtermeet and fall in love.

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:08.408
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
At the time, the city's oracle,

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:09.709
Olympica, made a prediction.

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.579
OLYMPICA: Yes.

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:15.816
OLYMPICA: I see it. Yveltal will
descend upon this land.

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:20.487
Absorbing the life force of all
living things, Yveltal's life

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.722
will come to an end

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:26.393
OLYMPICA: And then it will turn
into a cocoon once more. It is

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:28.261
however impossible for
any of us to escape this fate.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.298
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: When Aila's
father learned of this prophecy,

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.535
he ordered Jan to defeat Yveltal
in order to protect the city.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.507
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: He promised
his daughter's hand in marriage

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.142
if Jan
successfully defeated Yveltal.

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:47.247
AILA: You don't have to listen
to my father and his promise!

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:51.651
Yveltal is extremely dangerous!
You can't defeat it! No one can

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:53.854
defeat it! Don't even try!

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.324
AILA: Jan, please
don't go. I'm begging you!

00:05:58.592 --> 00:06:00.694
JAN: Aila, I promise
you I will defeat Yveltal.

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.296
JAN: Have faith,
and wait for me.

00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:12.405
YVELTAL: [ROARING]

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:13.974
JAN: It's Yveltal!

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:15.976
JAN: Aila!

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:17.644
AILA: Jan! Stay away!

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.816
JAN: Talonflame!

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.819
TALONFLAME: [ATTACKING]

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:27.821
YVELTAL: [OBLIVION WING MOVE]

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:29.222
YVELTAL: [OBLIVION WING MOVE]

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:37.230
JAN: Why you...

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:39.532
YVELTAL: [ROARING]

00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:42.002
AILA: Jan!

00:06:42.002 --> 00:06:43.536
YVELTAL: [OBLIVION WING MOVE]

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:01.721
ALEXA: What happened
to Yveltal after that?

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.392
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Like the
prediction said, it changed its

00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:06.359
shape into a cocoon.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:10.897
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: It absorbed
all life sources around it,

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:12.132
and the land became barren...

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.368
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: So
it could enter its long slumber.

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:43.363
ALEXA: Aila leaped
between Yveltal and Jan, then...

00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:49.602
JAN: Aila...

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:58.111
ALEXA: Do we know
where Yveltal is now?

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:02.215
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: One theory
states it awakens every thousand

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.985
years, but...it's uncertain
if Yveltal's now a cocoon,

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:06.386
or awake and active.

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.934
OLYMPICA: The precious few
people and Pokémon who survived

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:23.303
have left this land.

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:24.437
OLYMPICA:
I'm leaving this land, too.

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:29.042
JAN: How could
this have taken place?

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:32.679
OLYMPICA: There's only one
chance of rescuing the girl.

00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:37.117
OLYMPICA: Perhaps Xerneas
is able to bring her back...

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:40.186
JAN: Xerneas?

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:44.591
OLYMPICA: Yveltal's equal.
The Life Pokémon. When Xerneas

00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:49.062
transforms into a large tree, it
shares its power with the land.

00:08:49.062 --> 00:08:51.564
And that sharing can
bring even the most barren of

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:52.565
lands back to life.

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.168
JAN: So, do you
know where Xerneas is?

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:02.175
OLYMPICA: Find a forest
that glimmers like a rainbow.

00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:04.577
Wherever Xerneas is,
that forest flourishes...

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:12.018
ALEXA: So, the symbol X...
It's a reference to Xerneas,

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:13.787
isn't it?

00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:14.354
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Yes, that's right.

00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:22.495
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Jan visited
many lush forests. But because

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:26.499
Xerneas is constantly on the
move, sadly, Jan wasn't ever

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:27.901
able to find it.

00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:32.639
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
And time passed mercilessly...

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:37.410
GOGOAT: [ALERT]

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.711
JAN: What?
GOGOAT: [STRUGGLING]

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.348
JAN: We can't stop. We need
to find out where Xerneas is.

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:53.226
SCATTERBUG: [WEAK]

00:09:58.064 --> 00:09:59.866
SCATTERBUG: [WEAK]

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:04.671
JAN: The forest. It's lifeless!

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:11.611
JAN: Is it Yveltal?

00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:15.615
OLD MAN:
It's terrible, isn't it?

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:19.586
JAN: Can you
tell me what happened?

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:23.890
OLD MAN: His people came,
and then he took Xerneas away!

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.191
JAN: Xerneas?!

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.760
ASH:
Who's that Pokémon?

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:34.467
ASH: It's Yveltal!

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:44.811
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: The one who
took Xerneas away turned out to

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.246
be the ruler of a small kingdom.

00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:51.050
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: His goal? He
tried to monopolize the Life

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.653
Pokémon's power.
For his own selfish purposes.

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:58.725
ALEXA: So because Xerneas was
taken awaythe forest turned

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:00.093
barren and brown?

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:02.428
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Yes, and all

00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:03.663
due to one
man's selfish actions.

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:19.879
VEOFUM : What is going on? I
brought Xerneas to my garden,

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:21.014
yet nothing is flourishing!

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:25.485
VEOFUM: So, does that mean
bestowing eternal life is

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:27.320
nothing more than a
worthless illusion, Xerneas?

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.624
VEOFUM: Set it on fire.

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:33.626
ADVISOR: Are you sure of that?

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:37.363
VEOFUM: Do it! It is of no
worth to me. And if it brings me

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.265
no benefit... burn it!

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.234
ADVISOR: Let's go!

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:50.543
JAN: Stop it!

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:57.884
ADVISOR:
You have no right to be here!

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:01.921
JAN: Put out that fire!
VEOFUM: Silence!

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:04.157
JAN: No, release Xerneas and
extinguish the fire at once!

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.961
VEOFUM: Xerneas belongs to me. I
will do anything I want with it!

00:12:09.696 --> 00:12:12.799
JAN: Don't you feel anything
seeing it burning? Making

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:15.802
Xerneas suffer will
bring misfortune and pain!

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:18.671
VEOFUM: Such utter nonsense.
Get rid of this man at once.

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:19.806
ADVISOR: Sir!

00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:34.220
VEOFUM: Stop! There's
nothing to worry about!

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.588
You must remain calm!

00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:52.572
VEOFUM: What in
the world is that thing?

00:12:58.177 --> 00:12:59.779
ALEXA: So, at that
moment, Zygarde appeared?

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:02.715
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Yes.

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:03.950
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
This symbol resembling a Z

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.351
is a reference to Zygarde.

00:13:12.859 --> 00:13:13.726
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Zygarde, the Order Pokémon.

00:13:15.328 --> 00:13:17.630
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Zygarde
watches over Kalos's ecological

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.499
system and unleashes
its fury on those who try to

00:13:19.499 --> 00:13:20.533
destroy that system.

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:23.269
RHYPERIOR: [SCARED]

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:24.937
ZYGARDE: [ROARING]

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.590
ALEXA: It's like the human
immune system. How it tries to

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.759
heal irregularities in the body
and bring it back into balance.

00:13:48.428 --> 00:13:50.596
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: You're
right. Zygarde is also known

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:53.900
throughout the land as the
watcher of Kalos.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.301
It eradicates
harmful situations.

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:09.982
GOGOAT: [WORRIED]

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:25.431
JAN: Xerneas! I'm begging you to
assist me! Come to my aid with

00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:26.632
your great power!

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:31.637
JAN: Wait! Xerneas!

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:02.802
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
At that moment, Jan came to a

00:15:02.802 --> 00:15:06.706
realization. He knew that the
land destroyed by Yveltal would

00:15:06.706 --> 00:15:08.374
someday become
even more lush, and alive.

00:15:10.443 --> 00:15:12.745
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: So he made
the decision to protect the

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.781
land, alongside Aila.

00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:24.557
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: It's said
Jan recorded everything that he

00:15:24.557 --> 00:15:25.992
saw and experienced.

00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:30.763
ALEXA: And that's what
has been passed down to us.

00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:35.435
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: After a very
long time, the land became

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:36.969
plagued by a
devastating drought.

00:15:39.906 --> 00:15:42.341
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: And once
again, it became savagely barren

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:43.910
and devoid of life.

00:15:45.812 --> 00:15:47.346
GOGOAT: [CONTENTED]

00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:50.683
JAN: Dear Gogoat...

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:04.397
JAN: Xerneas, you have come!

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:56.682
JAN: Aila...

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:20.806
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Unfortunately, according to

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:22.942
legend, Aila never
returned to her original state.

00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:27.413
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: I believe
both Xerneas and Yveltal are

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:31.350
incarnations of nature that take
care of the land. That is their

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.186
task and their purpose. And when
the natural order is undone,

00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:38.024
Zygarde appears,
in order to balance it.

00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:42.962
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: These three
powerful Pokémon preside over

00:17:42.962 --> 00:17:44.030
the never‐ending cycle of life.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:47.967
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: And perhaps,
there is a distinct

00:17:47.967 --> 00:17:50.169
possibility that
Zygarde Cells could be watching

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:51.237
over us right now.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.107
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Zygarde
Cells are not normally seen.

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:57.543
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: However,
they are everywhere

00:17:57.543 --> 00:17:58.644
in the Kalos region.

00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:02.715
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: That was
clearly proven during the

00:18:02.715 --> 00:18:04.083
incident involving Team Flare.

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.891
ALEXA: Do you have any idea what
happened to Jan after that?

00:18:11.891 --> 00:18:13.125
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Honestly no.

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.493
The legend doesn't
mention anything

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:15.828
having to do with Jan's fate.

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:20.299
ALEXA:
That means only she knows...

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:23.336
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
There is another possibility.

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:26.272
Perhaps
Zygarde was watching, too.

00:18:30.343 --> 00:18:31.277
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Can you please show me the

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:33.379
rest of the ruins?

00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:37.316
ALEX: Yeah! Sure! I'll introduce
you to the research team.

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:38.784
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: Thanks very
much. I'm so glad I came here.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.280
GIRL : Oh, dear me!

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:11.450
JAN: Can I help you?

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:18.991
GIRL: Hello. Do you always
take a nap right there, sir?

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.230
JAN: Young lady, I was
just having a conversation

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.398
with this woman.

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:28.734
GIRL: A conversation?

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:31.203
JAN: Yes. I was telling her that
thanks to a Pokémon

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:33.139
named Xerneas,

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:36.342
the season when flowers
bloom is upon us once again

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:37.410
GIRL: You mean
the Legendary Pokémon?

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:42.314
JAN: A long, long time ago, this
old man actually met Xerneas.

00:19:43.249 --> 00:19:45.785
GIRL: You're kidding, right?

00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:49.622
JAN: Oh no, I speak the truth.
I met Yveltal, too,

00:19:49.622 --> 00:19:51.857
and I also met a third.
A green‐colored Pokémon,

00:19:53.259 --> 00:19:54.994
shaped something like this.

00:19:56.629 --> 00:19:58.130
GIRL: Wow, amazing!

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.301
JAN: The forest stays lush and
beautiful, thanks to the caring

00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:03.669
and watchful eyes
of all three of them.

00:20:06.405 --> 00:20:07.807
GIRL: Won't you come back to my
house and tell me more stories?

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.344
JAN: I don't
want to leave this place.

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:15.014
GIRL: Do you
want to stay because of her?

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:16.749
JAN: Yes.

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:20.653
JAN: And here
I will always remain.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.530
JAN: Now, I must return
to my nap. Thank you for the

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.100
conversation, young lady.
It was most enjoyable.

00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:42.608
NARRATOR: Xerneas, Yveltal,
and ZygardeThose three will

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:45.745
continue to watch over Kalos and
its history, along with the

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:47.213
statue of the stone‐eyed maiden.
