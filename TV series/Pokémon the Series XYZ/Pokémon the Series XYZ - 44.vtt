our heroes are now working
hard to reopen the Lumiose Gym.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.254

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:22.256

MEYER: I'm fine!

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:36.803
MEYER: After all,
this guy's made out of bricks!

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:40.107
ASH: Just a little bit more

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:41.708
MEYER: Right. All we
have left is a final check.

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:44.645
We'll be up and
running tomorrow!

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.880
BONNIE: Yay! Yippee!

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.615
ASH: Clemont's gonna be so glad!

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.183
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.489
CLEMONT:
All right How about this?

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:01.528
CLEMBOT: Initializing program!

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.798
Hi. My name is Clembot.
Nice to meet you.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.770
CLEMONT:
I'm Clemont. I created you.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.172
The pleasure is all mine.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.575
CLEMBOT: Clemont. Hello.

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:18.779
GIOVANNI: So.

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.581
GIOVANNI: News of
Team Flare's untimely demise

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.382
has reached headquarters.

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.751
JAMES:
One fact is not widely known.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.287
JESSIE: You see, the successful
execution of our plan

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:30.824
had a huge hand in
Team Flare's ultimate downfall!

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.327
GIOVANNI: Well, I look
forward to your report.

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:35.662
MEOWTH: As soon as the
Lumiose Airport reopens,

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.464
we'll be winging it
back to headquarters ASAP.

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:40.300
GIOVANNI:
Good. I will be expecting you.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.303
INKAY: [HAPPY]

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.505
MEOWTH: You hear that?

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:47.841
JAMES: Hard work and
trouble really does pay off!

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.743
Our tireless Kalos
toiling has allowed us

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:51.845
to grab the brass ring!

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.780
JESSIE, JAMES, MEOWTH:
Ka‐ching! Ring a ding ding!

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:56.316
JESSIE: There's
something lacking, though.

00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:59.386
Like, some sort of
surprise that'll really

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:00.821
blow the Boss away!

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:02.689
JAMES: Good point!

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.626
Now if we were to gift the
Twerp's Pikachu as a bonus

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:06.927
MEOWTH: We'll make our
new home in happy land!

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.730
MEOWTH: The Boss will have
Pikachu and we'll have dough!

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:12.199
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH:
A‐catching we will go

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.535
INKAY: [EXCITED]
WOBBUFFET: [EXCITED]

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.511
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.382
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.552
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.921

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:37.658

Pokémon

00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:43.664
Pokémon

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:44.665
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.445
MEYER: I see. So it didn't work.

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:02.516
BONNIE: I'm sorry.
DEDENNE: [SAD]

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.551
CLEMONT: I'm afraid the
data's completely lost,

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:05.786
it's impossible to get back.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.289
ALVIN: Hello! 'Scuse me!

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:11.758
ALVIN: I came to
challenge the Lumiose Gym!

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:16.730
ALVIN:
It's YOU! You're you're Ash!

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.498
ASH/PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.434
ALVIN: The Kalos League finals
were the most amazing EVER!

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:21.334
ASH: You saw them, huh?

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:26.073
ALVIN: You were so cool!
I got so into it!

00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:28.075
That's why I wanna battle
in the Kalos League, too!

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:30.210
CLEMONT: A battle, then.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.279
My name's Clemont,
and I'm the Lumiose Gym Leader.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:37.050
ALVIN: Wait. Where's Clembot?

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:40.821
CLEMONT:
So that's what happened.

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:43.356
ALVIN:
Okay. I see. A while back‐

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:47.661
I challenged this Gym.
But Clembotbeat me badly.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:51.131
ALVIN: I was so upset!

00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:54.534
I knew I wanted to
battle Clembot again!

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:56.737
And win that badge!

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:58.772
So I've been training really,
really hard ever since!

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:00.974
ASH: I know just how you feel!

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:03.243
Trainers and Pokémon
work really hard together

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.644
because they've just gotta win!

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:06.413
PIKACHU: [DETERMINED]

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.115
BONNIE:
So then what will you do?

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:09.316
DEDENNE: [QUESTIONING]

00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:12.252
CLEMONT:
Clembot can battle with you,

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.354
but it's back to
its default memory,

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:16.223
so it won't remember
anything from before. Sorry.

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:20.060
ALVIN: I don't care.
I want to battle Clembot!

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.428
Can I? Please?

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.599
CLEMONT:
I understand. One thing.

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:28.935
The battlefield isn't ready yet,

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:29.836
so I hope you'll be
able to come back tomorrow.

00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:33.707
CLEMONT: In the meantime, I'll
give Clembot some final tweaks.

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:35.876
ALVIN: Great!

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:39.546
ALVIN: Thank you so much!

00:04:41.148 --> 00:04:42.215
CLEMONT: See you tomorrow!

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:43.450
BONNIE: Yeah! Bye‐bye!

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:48.088

Let's get Chespin to bed!

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.028
CLEMONT: Oh, Chespin

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.598

GARCHOMP: [GREETING]

00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:36.016
ALAIN: Yeah.
GARCHOMP: [HAPPY]

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.817
ASH: So what about you?
What are your plans?

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.855
ALAIN: I'm not really sure.

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:42.889
ASH: Oh. I see.

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:45.692
ALAIN: I didn't mean to,

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.794
but I helped
Lysandre with his plan

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:49.195
whether I knew it, or not.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.166
ALAIN: I caused trouble for
a lot of people and Pokémon.

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:55.769
I made so many mistakes.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.205
ASH: Alain

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.940
ALAIN: I can't even begin
to make up for them all.

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:04.844
ASH: I don't know
much about that, but

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:10.550
ASH: I do know that
battling you was a blast!

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.754
ASH: I got so pumped up
and excited during the finals!

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.092
I'm sure my Pokémon
felt the same way, too!

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.728
ALAIN: Thanks, Ash.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.496
ASH: That's it! I guess

00:09:25.198 --> 00:09:27.233
ASH: Just promise me one thing.
That you'll battle me again.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.438
ALAIN: Again?

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:33.807
ALAIN:
You're always helping me out

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:37.177
and you did it again.

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:38.912
I guess I never really
could win once and for all.

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:41.714
ALAIN:
It's a deal. We'll battle again.

ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"It's Psyduck!"

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:04.070
ASH: What happened?

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:05.738

people within our nation!

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.960

planet is back on its feet

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.795
JAMES: We're back on
the Pikachu burglary beat!

prepare for a newsworthy fight!

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:39.772
MEOWTH: Meowth, that's right!

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:41.307
WOBBUFFET: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:45.845
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: You had
better let Pikachu go, or else!

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:48.047
JESSIE: Or else? Or else what?

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:49.482
Are you going to tell us
how marvelous everything is

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.584
until we give up?

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:53.353
JAMES: This prized Pikachu has
a one‐way ticket to the Boss!

00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:56.556

Let's not forget those two
were Kalos League finalists.

00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:04.023
MEOWTH:
I would've wagered the Twerp

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:04.924
and the big guy for the win.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:08.595
JESSIE: Pikachu is still
a great homecoming gift!

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:11.297
Gotta fly for now,
but we'll be back!

It's your first battle.

00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:40.093

battle between Clembot,

the substitute Gym Leader,

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.831
will now begin!

00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:46.899
MEYER: Each Trainer will
have the use of three Pokémon,

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:48.768
and the battle is over

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:51.371
when all three Pokémon on either
side are unable to continue!

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:53.539

PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]
MEYER: All right, battle begin!

00:13:12.025 --> 00:13:13.826
CLEMBOT: Bug and Flying
types like Vivillon

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:15.528
are weak against
Electric‐type moves.

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:17.063
Use Electro Ball!

00:13:17.063 --> 00:13:18.965

CLEMONT: First, stay calm!

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.046
CLEMONT: Focus and observe!

00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:34.947
Predict your opponent's next
move and give precise commands!

00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:37.583
CLEMBOT:
Observe, sir? Then predict?

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.753
ALVIN: Vivillon, use Stun Spore!

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:41.921

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.702
Vivillon's the winner!
ALVIN: YESS!

00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:57.470
SERENA: Vivillon completely
paralyzed its opponent

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:58.938
with Stun Spore

00:13:58.938 --> 00:13:59.806

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:13.586

VIVILLON: [STUNNED]

00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:38.878
MEYER: Vivillon is unable
to battle! Magneton wins!

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.713
CLEMONT:
You slowed up its movement

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.648
and attacked using Thunder!
Good! Excellent strategy!

00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:48.087
CLEMBOT: Because I observed,
predicted, then formed a plan.

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:49.522
Watch me win again!

00:14:49.522 --> 00:14:51.190

CLEMBOT: Ground type.
Electric‐type moves?

00:15:12.145 --> 00:15:14.680
They have no effect.
Weak against Water types.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.649

MAGNETON: [IMPACT]
MAGNETON: [STUNNED]

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:35.401
MEYER:
Magneton is unable to battle!

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:37.637
Cubone's the winner!

00:15:37.637 --> 00:15:38.404
CUBONE: [PROUD]
ALVIN: All right!

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:41.741
CLEMBOT:
All right, Magneton, return.

00:15:43.576 --> 00:15:46.579
CLEMONT: It's upsetting to lose.

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:49.482
But losing is how you
learn to become stronger.

00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:52.618
Use the experience.
It's not over , you know!

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.353
CLEMBOT: Yes sir!

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:56.422
CLEMBOT: Now, Heliolisk!
I need your help!

00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:00.626
HELIOLISK: [APPEARING]

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.862

no matter what!

00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:05.198
Cubone, Brick Break!

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:09.435
HELIOLISK: [EXERTION]

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:11.037
CLEMBOT:
Electric‐type moves won't work.

00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:13.206
Instead, Dragon Tail!

00:16:13.206 --> 00:16:14.941
HELIOLISK: [DRAGON TAIL MOVE]

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:17.777

CUBONE: [BONE RUSH MOVE]
CLEMBOT: Use Focus Blast!

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:28.654
HELIOLISK: [FOCUS BLAST MOVE]

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:29.355

CUBONE: [DETERMINED]

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:36.629
ALVIN: All right! No.
We're never giving up!

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:38.464
I'm sure we're
going to beat Clembot!

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:40.233
Clembot taught us a lot!

00:16:43.603 --> 00:16:46.272
CLEMBOT: All Pokémon
possess infinite possibilities.

00:16:46.272 --> 00:16:47.440
And tapping into them?

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.076
CLEMONT, CLEMBOT:
That's a Trainer's duty!

00:16:51.611 --> 00:16:55.014
ALVIN: Your words inspired me to
train really hard ever since!

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:58.117
CLEMBOT: My words?

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:01.621
ALVIN: Cubone, use Bonemerang!
CUBONE: [BONEMERANG MOVE]

00:17:01.621 --> 00:17:03.389
CLEMBOT:
Focus Blast, one more time!

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:04.891
HELIOLISK: [FOCUS BLAST MOVE]

00:17:07.293 --> 00:17:08.461
HELIOLISK: [SURPRISED]
HELIOLISK: [STUNNED]

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:13.633
MEYER:
Heliolisk is unable to battle!

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:16.536
Cubone's the winner!
Which means the victor is Alvin,

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:17.670
the challenger!

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.939

Thanks!
CUBONE: [HAPPY]

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:30.750
CLEMBOT: Having a
Pokémon battle is lots of fun.

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.086
Most enjoyable.

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:35.254
CLEMONT: Good.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.226
CLEMONT: Give him this.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.361
CLEMBOT: Congratulations, Alvin!
Here is your Voltage Badge.

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.198
ALVIN: Thanks a lot. Wow!

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.637
ASH: Good for you, Alvin!
ALVIN: Thanks!

00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:53.606

BONNIE: Magnemite,
Magneton, and Heliolisk

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.577
They were great, too!

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:59.478
CLEMBOT: Yes! Thank you
all for cheering for us.

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:04.483
CLEMBOT: I want to learn
a lot more about Pokémon.

00:18:04.483 --> 00:18:05.952
To learn more about
drawing out a Pokémon's power.

00:18:07.153 --> 00:18:09.088
Won't you teach me?
Please, Clemont!

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.795
CLEMONT: I'd love to!
Let's grow together, deal?

00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:18.631
CLEMBOT: It's a deal!

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:22.802
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: All right,

00:18:22.802 --> 00:18:23.736
now that we're
gathered here together

00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:27.039

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.744
SERENA: Right! It never happened

00:18:31.744 --> 00:18:34.113
because of the horrible
things Team Flare was doing.

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:36.282
CLEMONT: You're right! So let's
award Ash and Alain right here!

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.685
BONNIE:
I know! Let's award EVERYONE!

MAIRIN: Everyone?

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.190
BONNIE: Yeah! 'Cause we
all b ed Team Flare, right?

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.359
That's why!
DEDENNE: [AGREEMENT]

00:18:46.359 --> 00:18:47.393

A great idea, Bonnie.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.868

PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
Alain? I'm wondering.

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:10.616
Would you consider helping
me out again? With my research?

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:13.452
ALAIN: But I can't

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:15.087

We all could.
