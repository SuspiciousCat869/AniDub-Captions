JESSIE: Uh One second.

00:08:07.287 --> 00:08:10.023
JESSIE: I'd guess transforming
a rather large Pokémon

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:12.892
like that into a teeny
ring isn't going to work

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:14.027
JESSIE: Or an earring!

00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:16.963
JESSIE: My left earlobe
would droop much lower

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:17.931
than my right as a result!

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:22.869

It would give me a pointy head.

its body is as hard as diamonds!

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.413
