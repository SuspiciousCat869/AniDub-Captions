00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:04.811
My brother's re‐ liable, but
he makes things that sometimes

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.581
don't work, so he needs
someone to keep him grounded!

Wow, talk about cool!

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.793
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]
CLEMONT: Beyond amazing!

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:56.029
LILIA: It's true. Even so,
your Aipom Arm is more amazing.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.665
‐By a mile!
‐ASH: Yeah.

00:04:58.665 --> 00:04:59.733

sorts of machines!

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:04.204
CLEMONT: I don't know. The thing
is It's really just a hobby.

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:06.706
ASH: He also made
a robot named Clembot!

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.410
BONNIE: Blabbermouth

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.611
DEDENNE: [IRRITATED]
SQUISHY: [RESIGNED]

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:16.149
LILIA: They're
all so fascinating!

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:19.886
CLEMONT: I keep the Aipom
Arm hidden in my backpack and

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.822
ready to go.

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:24.057
LILIA: What a great idea.
Then, you can use it anytime!

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:28.128
ASH: Clemont's such a big help.
He's gotten us out of a whole

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:29.029

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.267
looking for a partner?

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:38.338
LILIA: Yes, I did. I'll have to
take over for my father someday.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.807
CLEMONT: you mean you are
going to become president?

00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:44.945
LILIA: Likely. But the partner I
end up choosing will have to be

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:45.612
ready too.

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:47.848
CLEMONT: Makes sense to me.

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:49.015
LILIA: That's great!

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.116

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:56.223

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.909
CLEMONT:
Maybe I should make lunch.

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.478
