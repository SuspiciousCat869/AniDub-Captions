NARRATOR: Our heroes arrived in
Sanpei's hometown of

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:09.009
Ninja Village: a lovely,
peaceful place filled with

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.146
hard‐working ninja and Pokémon.
And then, a mysterious ninja

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:16.884
force appeared and made off with
the village chief, Hanzo!

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:20.454
CLEMONT, BONNIE: Team Rocket!

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:24.858

a Pokémon and you

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.194
wind up with two Twerps instead!

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:28.662

BONNIE: What happened
to you two?

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:37.404
CLEMONT: That was
a ninja body switch!

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:39.172
SHINOBU: It's the
power of the ninja.

NIHEI: It's too
dangerous! Stay away!

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:19.232
SERENA: Listen to me!
Hanzo was just captured by

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:20.300
some mysterious ninja!

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:22.002
IPPEI: They got the chief?!

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:25.572
HEIDAYU: It seems
I'm outnumbered. But it looks

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.009
like I have also bought enough
time. Bisharp, return!

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:35.215
SAIZO: Stop there!

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.084
SAIZO: Going after him won't
help.

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:40.187
Our chief hasfallen into
enemy hands,

00:03:40.187 --> 00:03:42.055
and if we act
carelessly, we may lose

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.123
our opportunity to save him.

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:45.358
SAIZO: We need to create a plan.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.260
CLEMONT: They're retreating.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:48.628
BONNIE: Yeah, but why?

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:51.798
SHINOBU: They left because they
accomplished what

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:52.999
they came to
do.

00:03:58.171 --> 00:03:59.806
SAIZO: I'm afraid
Kagetomo and his henchmen

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:00.607
kidnapped the chief.

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:01.775
IPPEI: No way!

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:02.576
SHINOBU: Oh no!

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:05.312
ASH: Kagetomo?
PIKACHU: [CURIOUS]

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:09.015
SAIZO: That's right.
Kagetomo also used to live

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:11.184
right here in Ninja Village...

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:13.053
IPPEI: I remember him well.
He was a very powerful ninja.

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:19.392
KAGETOMO: It's useless. You
cannot escape!

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.733
HANZO: It would appear so.
There's no reason for disguises,

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.268
so why not show your
face , Kagetomo

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:32.372
KAGETOMO: Still clever.
You saw right through my mask.

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:41.047
HANZO: It was easy. Only a
person who comes from Ninja

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:43.183
Village would possess the
skill to fashion a rope that

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:44.518
is virtually impossible
to escape from.

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:47.454
NIHEI: Kagetomo, huh...

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.088
IPPEI: Battling him
will be very difficult.

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.925
ASH: Kagetomo's
really that strong?

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:55.095
SAIZO: He was expected to become
the next chief. It was his

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:57.697
destiny to become the leader of
Ninja Village after Hanzo

00:04:57.697 --> 00:04:59.566
stepped down. But then!

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:06.273
HANZO: To continue to train
along with and discover

00:05:06.273 --> 00:05:08.475
the possibilities of Pokémon to
defend the people of the world.

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:12.179
That, and that alone,
is the role of the ninja...

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.014
KAGETOMO: Ridiculous!

00:05:16.283 --> 00:05:19.152
KAGETOMO: I have great power!
Overwhelming power

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.855
with which to rule the world!
Am I wrong!?

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:23.156
HANZO: You flatter yourself.

00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:30.063
KAGETOMO: Incorrect. And I vow
I will prove it! After I become

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:30.997
leader of the Ninja Village!

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.468
HANZO: If you turn your back on
our teachings, you will not be

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:39.005
the leader. You will not have
the role of chiefand you won't

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.207
have the chief's emblem.

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.844
SAIZO: And with that, Kagetomo
and his follower,

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:45.312
Heidayu, left the village.

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:51.251
SAIZO: After that, Kagetomo and
Heidayu trained more ninja and

00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:53.053
formed a ninja force. And then

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:55.155
IPPEI: They kidnapped Chief
Hanzo!

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.226
SAIZO: When I became aware of
what the ninja force

00:05:59.226 --> 00:06:01.194
force was planning to do,
I decided to come here to

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.396
warn the chief ahead of
timebut I was too late.

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:06.199
SERENA: I sure hope
he's doing all right

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:09.069
BONNIE: I can't bear
thinking of anything bad!

00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:11.638
DEDENNE: [UPSET]

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:13.406
SANPEI: I've got to do
something!

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:14.541
I'm going to
rescue the chief NOW!

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.243
ASH: I'll go!

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:17.811
CLEMONT: Think this through,
Ash!

00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:19.179
We have no idea where
Hanzo's being held right now!

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.449
SHINOBU: I'm sure
Hanzo's just fine.

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.785
After all, he is the chief.

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:27.821
IPPEI: The villagers are
tracking his whereabouts

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:29.489
right now. Let's see
what they come up with.

00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:32.993
ASH, SANPEI: Right.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:40.033
HANZO: Kagetomo? What is
it exactly that you want?

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.435
The chief's emblem, perhaps?

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:46.006
HANZO: If that's what
you desire, it's in my pocket.

00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:47.440
Take it.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.608
KAGETOMO: I won't steal it.

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:49.409
HANZO: What?

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:57.317
KAGETOMO: You'll give it to me
at the festival. Then you will

00:06:57.317 --> 00:07:00.987
announce this to the villagers:
"I'm passing the leadership to

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:03.723
Kagetomo." Only then will
I let you go free.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.930
HANZO: Even if I
agreed to make such a

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.065
ridiculous announcement, the
villagers would never accept you

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:13.934
as leader in a million years.

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:14.668
KAGETOMO: I'll
make them accept me.

00:07:18.038 --> 00:07:19.072
KAGETOMO: I'll do
it with my power!

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:27.414
HEIDAYU: The villagers have
discovered our whereabouts.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.582
They will here shortly Kagetomo.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.254
KAGETOMO: Everything's going as
planned. My only need is Ippei.

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:35.722
‐Intercept them.
‐HEIDAYU: Right!

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:42.195
VILLAGE MAN‐WHITE KERCHIEF:
I'm certain it was the chief.

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:44.831
SANPEI: Where did you find him?

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:45.966
VILLAGE MAN‐WHITE KERCHIEF:
On Otori Mountain.

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:47.901
Not very far from the summit.

00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:48.668
IPPEI: Then let's
go rescue him NOW!

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:56.943
SAIZO: Wait, hold on!

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:04.818
SAIZO: It's Heidayu!

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:05.585
ASH: So that's him?
PIKACHU: [WONDERING]

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:08.488
HEIDAYU: Don't let them
go any further!

00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:15.762
NIHEI: Listen to me, Saizo!

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.064
Leave them to us and you
go rescue the chief!

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:19.666
IPPEI: Then let's go!

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:23.436
HEIDAYU: All right, Bisharp,
stop them with X‐Scissor GO!

have to beat us!

to make certain they don't!

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.014

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:08.160
WEAVILE: [WHIMPER]

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.964
KAGETOMO: You battled very well.
Thanks, Weavile.

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:14.834
WEAVILE: [GRATEFUL]

00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:18.371
IPPEI: You are indeed a fine
ninja. Use your power for the

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.206
people, the Pokémon,
and for the whole world.

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:29.949
IPPEI: That's excellent, Ash.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.285
I see that your
Frogadier evolved as well.

00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:35.988
SANPEI: I'm so excited. That
makes three of us. All our

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:38.591
Frogadier evolved into Greninja!

00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:40.860
ASH: Well, we're gonna get
stronger and stronger.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.862
You just wait! We're gonna
get even stronger than

00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:44.864
the two of you guys!

00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:46.365
IPPEI: I look forward
to seeing your progress.

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:47.900
ASH: Thanks!

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.501
GRENINJA ‐ A:
[HAPPY]PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:59.078
HANZO: After much consideration,
I have decided who will be the

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:00.980
next chief of Ninja Village!

00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:05.418
HANZO: And that will be the fine
young man standing

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.086
next to me. Ippei!

00:18:34.013 --> 00:18:35.748
HANZO: So will you be leaving
the village, Kagetomo?

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.685
KAGETOMO: Yes. I must
rededicate my training and

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.587
I have a lot to think about.

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:44.490
HANZO: But you could accomplish
all of that right here

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.691
in Ninja Village, you know.

00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:48.027
KAGETOMO: I cannot forget what
you both told me.

00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:52.465
Words of wisdom.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.201
If my power is for the
world, I must first see what the

00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:57.403
world is. All by myself.

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:00.539
HANZO: Heidayu,
is that your plan?

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:03.442
HEIDAYU: I will follow Kagetomo.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.177
Wherever he goes.

00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:08.047
IPPEI: Ninja Village will
be indeed be waiting for

00:19:08.047 --> 00:19:09.682
your return! Don't forget.

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:11.884
KAGETOMO: I promise you.

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:20.059
KAGETOMO: And my
ninja Please watch over them.

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.162
IPPEI: With all that I have.

00:19:34.607 --> 00:19:36.809
SERENA: Thank you so
much for everything.

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:37.710
BONNIE: The ninja
festival was so much fun!

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:39.478
DEDENNE: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.049
HANZO: I hope you'll come and
pay us a visit whenever you're

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:45.951
nearby. You're always welcome.

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:47.219
CLEMONT: Thanks. That's
so very nice of you!

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:51.357
SANPEI: Best of luck, Ash.
Now go and win your eighth

00:19:51.357 --> 00:19:53.893
Gym badge! I'll cheer
you all the way!

00:19:53.893 --> 00:19:55.327
ASH: Thanks! Good luck
to you too, Sanpei!

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:57.430
PIKACHU: [FAREWELL]

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.432
GRENINJA ‐ A: [FAREWELL]

00:19:59.432 --> 00:20:00.399
SANPEI: Thank you!
GRENINJA: [PLEASED]

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:05.671
NARRATOR: Now that the festival,
as well as the battle

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:09.241
for Ninja Village has ended, our
heroes are off once again to

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:12.712
Snowbelle City, where Ash will
battle for his eighth and final

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:13.846
Kalos Gym badge!

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:23.389
SAIZO: Wait,
Ash's Greninja took

00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:25.057
on a new appearance?!

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.292
NIHEI: Yes but it was
only for an instant

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:37.870
IPPEI: And you know what that
means. The village hero from

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.271
long ago has protected
us once again.

00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:42.441
HANZO: Greninja. Of course.
