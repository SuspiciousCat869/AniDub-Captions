WEBVTT

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.686
NARRATOR: Continuing their
journey to Snowbelle City, site

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.523
of Ash's eighth Gym badge
challenge, our heroes are

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:24.258
exploring a
nearby Pokémon Center.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.063
CLEMONT: You know, I'd like to
see what's going on with Ash and

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:32.499
Greninja. I say
it's time for an analysis.

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.137
CLEMONT: The future
is now, thanks to science!

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:39.606
Clemontic Gear, on!

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.109
ASH/SERENA/BONNIE/PIKACHU/DEDEN
NE: [SURPRISED]

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.077
SERENA: Clembot?!

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:45.946
BONNIE: So cute!

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.584
CLEMONT: My new revo‐
lutionary analysis machine.

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:53.186
CLEMONT: I call it Clembot Mini.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.222
SQUISHY: [AMUSED]

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:58.058
CLEMONT: All right,
Clembot Mini,

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.626
the results of the analysis,
please.

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:05.866
CLEMONT: Up until now, Greninja
has shown changes three times.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.269
ASH/SERENA/BONNIE/PIKACHU:
[QUESTIONING]

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.305
CLEMONT: We also know those
changes have occurred only when

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:12.139
a battle is taking place.

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.576
And during those battles,

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:19.413
Greninja's appearance seems to
resemble Ash. I believe that

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:22.049
this is most likely deeply
related to a psychological

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.517
element between the two of them.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.520
BONNIE: Psychological?

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.821
CLEMONT: That's right. In other
words, it's a mental change.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:31.558
And because they have the same
responses, how they react and

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:32.726
move starts to look alike.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.029
SERENA: This is just like the
thing Olympia told us, right?

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:41.902
OLYMPIA: Its power will become
greater and greater. However,

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:45.706
I do know this. It will reach
new heights that no one has ever

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:48.842
seen before! And the
two of you will reach those

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.143
new heights together.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:54.748
CLEMONT: That's it! That's
what Olympia's prediction was

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:56.750
referring to!

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.785
SERENA: Also, Olympia told you
that Greninja

00:01:58.785 --> 00:01:59.920
was trying toearn your love.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:03.857
OLYMPIA: However, what this
Froakie was yearning for was

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.492
something much deeper.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.529
OLYMPIA: I have a word for that.
That word is love!

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:13.000
SERENA: So, maybe that's
the reason for all the changes.

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:17.337
CLEMONT: Sawyer did say Pokémon
and Trainers with deep bonds

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.206
begin to look alike.
Maybe that's what could be

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:19.706
happening to you!

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.078
CLEMONT: So, I think it's
time to prove my hypothesis!

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.321
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:38.091
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.962
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.731
Pokémon

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.634
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:50.337
I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.239
Pokémon

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.907
Pokémon

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.342
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:15.128
ASH: Hey, what's this?
GRENINJA: [QUESTIONING]

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:17.497
CLEMONT: I'll show you!
Clemontic Gear, on!

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:18.632
BONNIE: Yay, part two!

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.001
CLEMONT: I call
them Battle Pulse Meters!

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:25.639
ASH: Battle Pulse Meters?
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.241
CLEMONT: That's correct. They
collect and display changes,

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.310
inbrain waves, heart rate,
and other data during battle.

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.147
CLEMONT: Any changes Greninja
experiences are recorded,

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.317
as well as how they're
reflected in you, Ash.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.289
ASH: Then let's give
it all we've got! You ready?

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:43.557
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.996
CLEMONT: The time has come.
Battling research, begin!

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:53.934
LUXRAY: [ELECTRIC TERRAIN MOVE]

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.273
CLEMONT:
There's no holding back, Ash!

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:02.843
ASH: Hey, I never do!

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:04.211
ASH: Greninja, use Cut!

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:06.646
GRENINJA: [CUT MOVE]

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:07.614
CLEMONT: Thunder Fang, NOW!

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:10.350
LUXRAY: [THUNDER FANG MOVE]

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.823
GRENINJA: [EXERTIONS]

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:18.658
ASH: That was a strong move!

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:21.294
CLEMONT: Wait till you see this!
Luxray, use Wild Charge!

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.663
LUXRAY: [WILD CHARGE MOVE]

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:24.831
ASH: Greninja, Double Team!

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.068
GRENINJA: [DOUBLE TEAM MOVE]

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:29.069
LUXRAY: [WILD CHARGE MOVE]

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.471
GRENINJA: [IMPACTS]

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.911
ASH:
Now, Greninja, use Aerial Ace!

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.280
LUXRAY: [SHOCKED]

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.815
GRENINJA: [PAINED IMPACT]

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.217
LUXRAY: [GROWLING LAND]

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.322
CLEMONT:
That was an excellent move.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:51.758
SERENA: Oh wow! Ash
and Greninja are really tuned

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:52.926
in to each other!

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.039
NURSE JOY:
Welcome to the Pokémon Center!

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:06.706
WIGGLYTUFF: [GREETING]

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:15.715

LUXRAY: [STRUGGLING]

00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:21.488
CLEMONT: Time out, time out!

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.058
CLEMONT:
I'm not seeing any changes.

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:28.829
ASH: I guess it doesn't happen
all the time. Neither of us has

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:31.464
any idea what makes it happen.
Right, Greninja?

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:32.732
GRENINJA: [AGREEMENT]

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:35.535
CLEMONT: Maybe
there's a piece of critical

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:36.903
information we're overlooking

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:38.305
SQUISHY: [STARTLED]

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:40.473
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.110
ALAIN: Whenever we meet, you're
in the middle of a battle. Hi!

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:46.980
ASH: Hey, Alain!

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.048
ALAIN: Interesting
device you're wearing.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.219
ASH: Yeah! We're trying
to figure out what's up with

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:54.454
Greninja's power!

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.422
BONNIE: But it looks
like it won't happen today.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.858
CLEMONT: There must
be something we're missing.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:02.229
ASH: That's it! Let's
you and I have a battle, Alain!

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.763
CLEMONT: That would be great!
Then I can concentrate

00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:04.798
on the data!

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.870
ALAIN: Right! I was hoping
to battle Greninja again.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.905
CLEMONT: So, in that case...

00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:13.740
CLEMONT: Thanks for
helping out, Luxray. Return!

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.510
ASH:
Take a little rest, Greninja!

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:22.649
NURSE JOY: Put them right here.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:24.918
ASH: Thanks!
CLEMONT: Thanks!

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:26.953
NURSE JOY:
I'll take good care of them.

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:32.492
ASH: All right, Alain, what do
you want to do while we wait?

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:35.028
ALAIN: I'm not sure.

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:36.596
ASH: You must have some other
Pokémon with you

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:37.464
besides Charizard, right?

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:41.301
ALAIN: Yeah. In fact I do.

00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:43.436
ASH: Then let's have a battle
until Greninja's rested and all

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:44.905
ready to go!

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:45.872
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:48.608

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:13.300

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:18.772
METANG: [APPEARING]

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:19.639
ASH: A Metang

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.547
POKEDEX: Metang. The Iron Claw
Pokémon, and the evolved form of

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:31.551
Beldum. Metang is created
from the union of two Beldum.

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.853
When its two brains are
joined together, its psychic

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:34.721
power is increased.

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:39.025
CLEMONT: Metang is a powerful
Pokémon.

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:40.727
It will be a formidable opponent
no matter who it battles!

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:44.698

It looks strong, all right

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:48.168

No doubt this battle will make

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:45.385
you even stronger!

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:47.253

lot of power!

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:54.027
BONNIE: You're right.
Noivern was so good!

00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:56.696
DEDENNE: [AGREEMENT]

ASH/CLEMONT/PIKACHU:
[QUESTIONING]

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:06.072
NURSE JOY: Ash? Clemont?

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:10.310
I'm happy to report your
Pokémon are now fully recovered!

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.015
ALAIN: So that
will tell you something?

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:18.651
CLEMONT: I think that the
phenomenon between Ash and

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:21.788
Greninja is psychological. In
other words, I think the changes

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.456
occur when their mental
and emotional states are

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.591
truly in sync.

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:27.794
ALAIN: Truly in sync.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.429

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:49.449

ASH: "Who's that Pokémon?"

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:25.084

CHARIZARD: [FLAMETHROWER MOVE]

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.074

CHARIZARD: [SUGGESTING]

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.358
ALAIN: Yes, it's only right to
use the massive power we possess

00:12:05.358 --> 00:12:05.925
to face them in battle.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.064

if we can trigger that change.

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:41.060

BONNIE: Anything, Clemont?

00:12:58.044 --> 00:12:59.512
CLEMONT: I'm not
seeing any changes yet

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:00.413
ASH: Now, use Cut!

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.416
GRENINJA: [CUT MOVE]

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:05.118

happen. There's the overlap!

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:00.940
SERENA: Clemont!
What does it mean?

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.344

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:28.167
CLEMONT: So that means my
hypothesis is correct! In order

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.336
for the change to take effect,
Ash and Greninja's emotions

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:31.270
must be in sync!

00:14:31.938 --> 00:14:34.140

ALAIN: Oh yes! This...This
is what I've been waiting for!

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:27.927
ALAIN: Can you feel it like
I can? Can you feel all their

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.295
incredible power yet?!

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:29.896

You had me so worried!

ASH: Uh, sorry.

00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:36.556
ALAIN: You should take it
easy for the rest of the day.

messed up our battle...

ALAIN: Don't worry about it.

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:45.765
ASH: You know I couldn't
move, no matter what I did.

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:49.969
CLEMONT: Synchronizing
to that degree can put a heavy

00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:51.971
load on a Trainer.

00:17:51.971 --> 00:17:53.005
ALAIN:
That doesn't surprise me at all.

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:57.543
ALAIN: I've never witnessed that
kind of raw power before...

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:04.784
ASH: But why
couldn't I move my body?

00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:09.689
ASH: Alain! If we can
learn to control that power,

00:18:09.689 --> 00:18:11.857
I want to battle again!

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:14.694
ALAIN: The reality is our
battle hasn't been decided yet.

00:18:18.731 --> 00:18:21.100
ASH: I'll train hard and get
strong enough to beat you and

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.469
then I'll win the
Kalos League! I'll be a

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:24.570
Pokémon Master someday!

00:18:25.638 --> 00:18:27.773
ALAIN: Really. Kalos League?

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.375
BONNIE: You're gonna
enter, too, right, Alain?

00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:30.509
ALAIN: I'm not. Not really.

00:18:32.712 --> 00:18:35.915
ASH: Why not? All of the
strongest Pokémon and Trainers

00:18:35.915 --> 00:18:37.450
in the entire Kalos
region are gonna be there!

00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:39.485
ASH: I'm so psyched!

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:43.289
ALAIN: It sounds like fun.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.967
ALAIN: Everything's
fine here. I'll keep researching

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.202
Mega Evolution and

00:18:56.202 --> 00:18:58.004
