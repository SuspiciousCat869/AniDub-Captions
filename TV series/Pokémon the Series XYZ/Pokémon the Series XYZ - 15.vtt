CLEMONT: Are we close
to a Pokémon Center?

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:18.819
SERENA: We still
have a ways to go...

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:20.487
ASH: Just hang in there!

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.321
PIKACHU: [EXHAUSTED]

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.525
CLEMONT: Everything's
starting to get hazy...

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.829
BONNIE: Well I'm
feeling super‐duper!

DEDENNE: [HAPPY]
SQUISHY: [SLEEPING]

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.634
CLEMONT: I wish that I
were Dedenne or Squishy...

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:36.637
SERENA: Yeah, me too.

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:39.673
The sun is really really, really
hot and the air is so dry.

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.675
I totally understand.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.443
CLEMONT: Isn't there
anywhere we can take a rest

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.845
for a little while?

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:46.113
SERENA: It doesn't look like it.

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:49.550

I'm going to pass out...

CLEMONT: A robot, wow!!

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.574
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.377
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.682

NARRATOR: As our heroes
continue their journey to

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:51.912
Snowbelle City, where Ash hopes
to win his eighth Kalos Gym

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:54.214
badge, they've discovered a
robot digging in the middle

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:55.782
of a scorching wasteland!

00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:58.585
CLEMONT: What
a retro‐looking robot.

00:01:58.585 --> 00:01:59.720
It must've been built ages ago!

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:02.723
BONNIE: It looks
kind of beat up.

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:04.758
SERENA: I wonder what
it's doing way out here.

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:05.859
PIKACHU: [AGREEING]

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.263

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:11.331
CLEMONT SERENA, BONNIE,
ASH: It talks!

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.033
ROBON: Yes, I can speak.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.935
CLEMONT: You've got A. I.!

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:16.803
I never would've guessed from
the way you look! Excellent!

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:30.183
CLEMONT: You know, those look
like seeds! What are you doing?!

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.321
ROBON: Those are seeds.
I'm planting them.

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:39.126
CLEMONT: Way out here?
In this hot, dried‐out place?

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:42.796
BONNIE: Will they grow?
SERENA: I'm not sure...

00:02:42.796 --> 00:02:45.165
ASH: I wonder if it's
been here a long time.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.267
CLEMONT: It looks like
quite a few years.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.902
Someone must have programmed
it to do all this work.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.041
ASH: What's that?
PIKACHU: [ALARMED]

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:55.275
BONNIE: A Pokémon?!

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:57.644
ASH: What kind?

00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:02.449
POKEDEX: Chesnaught. The Spiny
Armor Pokémon, and the final

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.619
evolved form of Chespin. Its
Tackle is so powerful, it can

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.688
overturn a fifty‐ton tank.

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:09.489
CHESNAUGHT: [ROAR]
ASH: That's a lot of power!

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.058

coming right for us!

ASH: Man, why did we all
get attacked like that?

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.482
SERENA: I think Chesnaught's
protecting the robot.

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:37.017
BONNIE: Maybe they're
really good friends.

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:38.218
SERENA: Could be.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.120
CHESPIN: [WHISPERING]

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:46.727
ASH: What's this?

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:47.627
CLEMONT: Perhaps it has
something to do with the robot.

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.697
BONNIE: There's no one here.

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:53.133
SERENA: Amazing. Looks like
some kind of research lab.

00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:58.371
CLEMONT: I'd say this place
has to have something to

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.307
do with those two.

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:01.641
SERENA: They must've been
cultivating plants in here.

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:03.477
BONNIE: Uh, look!

00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:06.646
ASH: Who's that?

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:09.916
HENNY: Hey what are you doing?!

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.422
ASH: Oh, hi there.
My name is Ash.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.157
And this is my partner, Pikachu.

00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:18.658
PIKACHU: [GREETING]

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.660
SERENA: Hi! I'm Serena.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.530
BONNIE: I'm Bonnie!
This is Dedenne and Squishy!

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.398
DEDENNE: [GREETING]
SQUISHY: [GREETING]

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.501
BONNIE: That's my big brother...
CLEMONT: My name is Clemont.

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:29.803
CHESPIN: [GREETING]

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:32.272
HENNY: So what do you want with
the Chapman Research Lab?

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.473
CLEMONT: We're interested
in finding out about

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:35.108
a robot we saw outside...

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.010
HENNY: Hmm

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.245
BONNIE: So, who are you?
HENNY: My name is Henny.

00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:41.181
That man you see in the
photograph is my grandfather.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.186
HENNY: If you wanna know
about Robon, then watch this.

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:51.892
CHAPMAN: My name is Chapman...
I'm a scientist researching

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:55.028
environments where people and
Pokémon can live together

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:59.633
happily. You see, once upon a
time, this beautiful forest was

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:02.302
nature at its finest, filled
with many wild Pokémon ...

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:07.474
CHAPMAN: But one day, the
forest began to dry up and

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:12.546
wither. I did my best to figure
out the reason why, but my work

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:15.048
was unfortunately cut short
by an unexpected illness.

00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:20.487
CHAPMAN: I was able to construct
Robon to help the

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.790
forest regrow, but I'm afraid
I won't be around to see

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.091
it come to fruition.

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:30.764
CHAPMAN: The forest is now
dried up. Neither people nor

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:32.365
Pokémon can live here.

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:36.603
CHAPMAN: Its only remaining
hope is with my robot,

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:38.972
Robon, and Chesnaught.

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:41.074
CHAPMAN: If they somehow
encounter difficulties,

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:43.076
I would like you to help them.

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:46.580
CHAPMAN: I ask this
of whoever is watching this

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.381
as my final request.

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:54.154
ASH: I get it. I think
Chesnaught attacked us because

00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:55.555
it thought we were
interfering with Robon's work.

00:05:57.224 --> 00:06:00.927
HENNY: Even though Grandfather's
gone, Robon keeps on planting

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.863
seeds...and Chesnaught
keeps on protecting Robon...

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.203
HENNY: Robon...

00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:23.250
CLEMONT: Robon can
even charge itself...

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.385
HENNY: Yeah. But lately that's
been taking longer and longer.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.556
HENNY: I think it's working
way too hard and must be

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:31.057
starting to break down.

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:33.760
CLEMONT: Let me have a look...

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:40.367
CLEMONT: I'm certain
I can fix this!

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:43.570
BONNIE: My big
brother's an inventor!

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.105
He can fix any machine!

00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:47.507
HENNY: Stop it!

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:50.010
HENNY: What I really want is for
Robon and Chesnaught to stop

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.113
working so hard! They've
worked hard enough already...

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.486
CLEMONT: But you know Robon's
mission is to replant the

00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:03.223
forest. So instead of stopping
Robon, shouldn't we help it to

00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:04.925
accomplish the very reason
why it was constructed in

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:06.593
the first place?

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.295
HENNY: But it's been working
so hard with no progress.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.364
It's impossible.

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:12.766
CLEMONT: The progress of
science will stop cold

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:15.068
the moment you give up.

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:17.470
CLEMONT: So, continuing on no
matter what challenges appear

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.439
is key to making
scientific progress!

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.541
CHESPIN: [AGREEMENT]

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:24.110
BONNIE: Clemont's right!
SERENA: I think so, too!

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.979
ASH: Taking on
challenges is the only way!

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.681
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:35.088
HENNY: I hear you.
I'll do whatever I can!

00:07:35.088 --> 00:07:36.256
CLEMONT: That's great!

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:40.360
ROBON: Charge complete.

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:42.696
HENNY: It charged way
faster this time!

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.467
HENNY: Thank you
so much, Clemont!

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.335
ASH: So now we know
what we've gotta do!

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:57.477
SERENA: This whole
area is so enormous.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:00.814

CHESNAUGHT: [SURPRISED]

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:04.484

SERENA: I think it understands!
PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:22.535
CLEMONT: Thank you, Chesnaught.

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:23.970
ASH: Let's get this
forest back in shape!

00:08:24.738 --> 00:08:26.139
SERENA: Yeah!

00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.210
CLEMONT: First off, we need
to figure out whether or not

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.012
plants can even grow here.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:32.979
ASH: So how are
we gonna do that?!

00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:37.584
CLEMONT: The future is now,
thanks to science!

00:08:37.584 --> 00:08:40.053
CLEMONT: Clemontic Gear, on!

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:42.889
CLEMONT: You see, I thought we'd
encounter a situation precisely

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:45.959
like this one! I call it the
Mr. Dirt Analyzing Simulator!

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:48.194
BONNIE: I like
that name, Clemont!

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.598
CLEMONT: All right
then, here we go!

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.501
MECHA VOICE: Beginning analysis.

00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:01.741
CLEMONT: It's a device that can
analyze the soil's components

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.410
and determine whether or not
seeds are able to grow!

00:09:11.818 --> 00:09:15.255
MECHA VOICE: Growth in
this soil is impossible.

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:17.624
CLEMONT: It looks like this
isn't going to work out.

00:09:17.624 --> 00:09:20.226
BONNIE: So Clemont,
what are we gonna do?

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.562
CLEMONT: If this was once
a forest, there must be

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:23.963
underground water
somewhere around here...

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:26.099
Let's figure out where!

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:30.403

ASH: Noibat will
use its Supersonic!

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.313
CLEMONT: Search for an
underground water source!

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:41.915

CHESNAUGHT: [EXERTION]

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:51.391
Chesnaught has put his
antennas into the ground

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:52.292
to search for water too.

00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:54.294
That's un excellent idea.

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.834
CLEMONT: It's great that you
want to help, too, Chesnaught!

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:04.237

stuff, as usual

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:15.248
JESSIE: What a big, fat bore.

00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:17.984
Instead, we should all focus
our attention on catching that

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:20.053
power‐packed Chesnaught.

00:10:20.053 --> 00:10:22.088

ASH: What's this?

00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:34.360
CLEMONT: It looks to me
like we may have hit bedrock.

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:37.030
CLEMONT: Time to investigate.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.000
CLEMONT: It's huge!
Ten meters in diameter.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.803
The water's below it.

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:45.004
We can't get to it
unless we move the rock...

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:51.044
ASH, SERENA, CLEMONT, BONNIE:
"Who's that Pokémon?"

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.017
ASH, SERENA, CLEMONT, BONNIE:
"It's Chesnaught!"

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.994
CLEMONT: It appears seismic
activities shifted the rock

00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:10.263
until it formed a kind of lid.

00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:11.831
CLEMONT: The big question is
how are we going to get it

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:13.666
out of the way?

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:15.435

ASH: No good.

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:30.316
CLEMONT: So in order to break
the rock, we'll need to heat it

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:31.384
up and rapidly cool it down.

00:12:32.652 --> 00:12:34.420
So we'll all have
to attack at once!

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.288

CLEMONT: Let's see.

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:21.000
If we can't break it,
maybe we can pull it out!

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.672
CLEMONT: Let's pull hard!

00:13:25.672 --> 00:13:28.941

break it, pull it" strategy!

CHESPIN: [SAD]

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:03.756
BONNIE: Uh‐oh. Robon's broken.

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:04.857
SERENA: Yeah
PIKACHU: [SAD]

00:17:09.095 --> 00:17:11.764
CLEMONT: The progress of science
stops the moment you give up.

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:13.466
If you don't give up,
anything is possible!

00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:41.727
CLEMONT: Robon's as good as new!

00:17:44.297 --> 00:17:46.065
ROBON: Reboot. Reset

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:49.268
ROBON: Reset complete,
and Robon feels great!

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.738
HENNY: You're back,
Robon! You're really back!

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:53.539
CHESNAUGHT: [GRATEFUL]

00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:01.013
CLEMONT: Robon? What do
we do about that rock?

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.719
ROBON: Obstacle
present! Scanning!

00:18:13.793 --> 00:18:15.161
ROBON: Rock removal
operation commencing.

00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:17.730
ROBON: I will
now remove the rock.

00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:25.404
CLEMONT: I didn't know
Robon could do that!

00:18:31.077 --> 00:18:32.011
ASH, SERENA, PIKACHU
BONNIE: Go, Robon!

00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:33.145
CLEMONT: Show us how it's done!

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:34.080
HENNY: Do it!

00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:40.786
ROBON: It's a gusher!

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:44.390
CLEMONT: The spring
is flowing again!

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.758
ASH: All right!

00:18:45.758 --> 00:18:46.993
CHESNAUGHT: [HAPPY]

00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:48.794
CHESPIN: [HAPPY]

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:01.173
BONNIE: Oh wow, it's beautiful!

00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:04.076
Look at the water,
Dedenne and Squishy!

00:19:05.845 --> 00:19:07.179
DEDENNE: [YAWNING]
SQUISHY: [CURIOUS]

00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:10.950
CLEMONT: Why don't we
analyze the soil once again?

00:19:13.686 --> 00:19:14.887
MECHA VOICE: Beginning analysis.

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:29.502
MECHA VOICE: Growth in
this soil is very possible.

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:38.010
HENNY: Now Grandfather's
dream will come true!

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.812
CHESNAUGHT: [HAPPY]

00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:40.746
CLEMONT: I realized when
I was fixing Robon...

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:45.551
CLEMONT: that each one of its
parts was constructed with lots

00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:48.020
of love. Professor Chapman
was a great inventor indeed.

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.690
And I want to be just like him!

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.425
CHESPIN: [HAPPY]

00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:54.427
PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

00:19:54.427 --> 00:19:57.063
HENNY: Clemont, I've decided
I'm going to pursue the path of

00:19:57.063 --> 00:20:00.866
science just like you! Then, if
Robon ever needs fixing again,

00:20:01.734 --> 00:20:04.136
I'll be able to do it.

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:06.205
CLEMONT: Great! And I
know you will do it, too!

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.907
CHESPIN: [ENCOURAGING]

00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:09.041
CLEMONT: Lots of
luck to you, Henny.

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.009
HENNY: Thank you, Clemont!

00:20:11.177 --> 00:20:12.845
CHESNAUGHT: [ENCOURAGING]

00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:14.480
CHESPIN: [HAPPY]

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.756
HENNY, CHESNAUGHT:
Goodbye, everyone!

00:20:23.756 --> 00:20:26.258
HENNY: Take good care! ROBON:
See you again. I know it!

00:20:29.195 --> 00:20:32.431
NARRATOR: And so, with
everyone's help, a water source

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:35.634
was discovered and unleashed,
and water now gushes powerfully

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:37.470
through the parched land.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.972
And our heroes are off
again to Snowbelle City

00:20:50.049 --> 00:20:51.650
NARRATOR: as the
journey continues!
