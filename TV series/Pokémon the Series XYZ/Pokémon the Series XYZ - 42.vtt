00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:04.404
NARRATOR: The destruction
of Kalos continues‐

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:06.840
brought on by Team Flare.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.210
NARRATOR: However,
Serena, along with Mairin,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.778
successfully rescued Chespie!

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:14.882
NARRATOR: And with
Blaziken Mask at her side,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.485
Bonnie stood before
Zygarde to stop its rampage.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.687
With a song,

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.757
an exhausted Squishy was soon
freed from Team Flare's control.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.662
NARRATOR: Clemont and
Clembot successfully destroyed

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:30.831
Team Flare's control system

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.633
and released the other
Zygarde from its grip.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.871
NARRATOR:
However, it came at a price:

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.541
the complete loss
of Clembot's memory.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.777
It was a
heart‐wrenching decision

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.546
Clemont was forced to make.

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:49.349

Listen, everyone.

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:08.948
I want to tell you what I
know about the Giant Rock.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.052
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
When we scanned it,

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:13.420
we discovered that it's
a giant mass of energy.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:16.990
A mass of energy that
strongly resembles Zygarde's.

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:21.761
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: In addition,

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:23.196
we picked up Chespie's vital
signs from within its core.

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:27.267
STEVEN: And, we found and
retrieved Chespie's records

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:30.003
located in the labs' database.

00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:31.971
STEVEN:
According to those records,

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:34.274
an accident caused Chespie to
absorb some of Zygarde's energy.

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:38.244
STEVEN:
We think that the giant rock

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.947
absorbed Chespie in
order to obtain that energy.

00:09:42.882 --> 00:09:44.451
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: But now,
the Giant Rock

00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:45.785
is in search
of its next energy source.

STEVEN:
It's headed toward the sundial.

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.166
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE:
The sundial is a giant crystal

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:01.534
said to have come from space.

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:06.873
We know that the energy it
contains is the very same energy

00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:09.275
that Pokémon emit when they're
experiencing Mega Evolution.

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:12.946
BLAZIKEN MASK:
Let's say the Giant Rock

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.614
is drawn toward that energy.
Why that energy, though?

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:18.184
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: I know why.

00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:20.520
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: If the
Giant Rock and the sundial

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.288
come in direct contact
and then merge as a result...

00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:31.698
SERENA: Then that means...

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.567
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: It means
it's the end of the world.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.839
ALAIN: Lysandre! Recreating
the world at any cost!

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:43.743
ASH: Professor!

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.645
We've gotta rescue Chespie and
stop the Giant Rock right away!

00:11:00.894 --> 00:11:02.695
ALAIN: I promise.
I'm going to save Chespie!

00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:06.232
MAIRIN: Thanks.

00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:09.402

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.655

Professor Sycamore told us.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:31.224
OLYMPIA: You need to evacuate

00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:32.959

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:33.793

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:37.096

OLYMPIA: Gather!

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:48.508

00:11:48.508 --> 00:11:49.742

heading to Anistar City!

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.912

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:37.917
Let's go full throttle,
right from the start!

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:47.760
DIANTHA:
That didn't even slow it down...

00:18:49.996 --> 00:18:51.330
DIANTHA: Let's fall back and
come up with a different plan.

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.404
DIANTHA:
We all know the situation.

00:18:58.404 --> 00:19:00.506
Rescuing Chespie is
our first priority!

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:02.708
STEVEN: Right.

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.077
Let's use the Pokémon's moves
to get into the Giant Rock.

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:07.847
The target is there.

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:10.483
That Water Shuriken!

00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:15.354
DIANTHA: We'll attack
with our combined power!

00:19:17.023 --> 00:19:20.526
STEVEN: It is truly a sincere
honor to battle alongside you.

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:22.261
DIANTHA:
Steven, the honor is all mine.

00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:24.864
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE: We couldn't
have asked for a stronger group

00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:26.632
for help! Thank you.

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:28.334
KORRINA: Hi, Ash!
ASH: Korrina!

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:30.503
KORRINA:
So this is the famous Greninja.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:32.972
ASH: Sure is!
Its power merges with mine!

00:19:32.972 --> 00:19:33.839
KORRINA: Excellent!

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:36.876
OLYMPIA: And now you've
finally made that power yours.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:38.611
ASH: That's right!

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:41.547
GIANT ROCK: [ROARING]

00:19:43.983 --> 00:19:45.484
DIANTHA: Everyone!

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:46.852
You're looking at the
final line of defense!

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:50.690
DIANTHA: We cannot let it come
in contact with the sundial!

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:51.891
Remember that at all times.

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:56.162
MALVA: Let's go, Houndoom.

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:58.631
HOUNDOOM: [APPEARING]

00:19:58.631 --> 00:20:00.066
ASH: Serena!
Take care of Mairin and Bonnie!

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.101
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:02.535
CLEMONT:
And thanks a lot for your help!

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:05.171
SERENA:
You got it. Leave it to me!

00:20:05.171 --> 00:20:06.806
BRAIXEN: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:20:06.806 --> 00:20:07.573
BONNIE:
Now, all of you be careful.

00:20:08.174 --> 00:20:09.408
MAIRIN: Alain?

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.279
ALAIN: It's okay. I know I'll
come back, and Chespie with me!

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:15.748
MAIRIN: Okay.

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.322
JAMES:
Meowth, gotta catch them all!

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:24.323
MEOWTH: So what else is new?

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.593
JESSIE: Viewers the world over!
This is history!

00:20:29.295 --> 00:20:30.830
JESSIE: Watch as these titans
tackle the threat to Kalos...

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.264
and the world!

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.469
NARRATOR:
In order to rescue Chespie

00:20:36.469 --> 00:20:38.304
and prevent the Giant Rock
from coming into contact

00:20:38.304 --> 00:20:40.139
with the sundial,

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:42.742
the most powerful team in
Kalos has gathered together

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:44.176
in a battle for the
future of the world!

00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:47.346
What will be Chespie's fate?

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:48.547
What will be the
future of Kalos?

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.650
The final decisive
battle to come,

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.986
as the journey continues!
