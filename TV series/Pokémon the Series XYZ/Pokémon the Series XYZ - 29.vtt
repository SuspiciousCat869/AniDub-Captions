WEBVTT

00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:03.904
NARRATOR: In pursuit of
his eighth Kalos Gym badge

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:06.006
and entry into the Kalos League,

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.109
Ash challenged Gym Leader
Wulfric at the Ice‐type

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.012
Snowbelle Gym. However,
our hero was roundly defeated.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.017
NARRATOR: With the burden
of doubt on their shoulders,

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.019
Ash and Greninja disappeared
separately into the forest.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:23.490
But along with great
challenge comes great growth,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.492
as the two of them
finally learned how to harness

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.594
the true power of Ash‐Greninja!

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.130
NARRATOR:
Now, with renewed spirit,

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.067
Ash prepares for his
rematch to earn his final badge!

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.938
SERENA: Hey, Ash...

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.810
ASH: It's okay. I know what
to do. I see the way to go!

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:48.415
BONNIE: Now's the time to go
and win your eighth Gym badge!

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.416
ASH: Right!

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.019
ASH: 'Scus ,
but I'd like a Gym battle!

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.622
PUPIL: A rematch, huh?
We've been waiting for you!

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.601
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.938
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.775
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.578
Pokémon

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:20.681
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.283
I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:25.185
Pokémon

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.753
Pokémon

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.522
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:50.010
WULFRIC: Well, well...
Back for another match?

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.678
ASH: Yeah!

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:54.548
WULFRIC: How are you?
After our last battle...

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:00.654
WULFRIC:
I shouldn't have worried!

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.390
WULFRIC: You know what?
Forget my last question.

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:05.859
WULFRIC:
All right, shall we begin?

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.530
WULFRIC:
No doubt you're a fiery one.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.033
Let's see if your fire's
enough to melt my icy resolve!

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.067
PUPIL: But, sir!

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.337
PUPIL:
I haven't stated the rules yet!

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:20.340
WULFRIC: It's fine!
It's fine! We just battled, so

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.642
‐WULFRIC: Right?
‐ASH: Right!

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.777
Let's get this show on the road!

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:25.646
WULFRIC: Exactly.

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:28.081
PUPIL: Excuse me,
but this is an official battle!

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:30.984
WULFRIC: Don't get lost in
the details. You know what?

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.253
Whoever loses three
Pokémon loses the match, right?

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:34.688
Simple, RIGHT?!

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:36.156
PUPIL: Right

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.325
CLEMONT: Wulfric sure is bold

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.827
SERENA: He can hardly wait
to get the battle started!

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.996
WULFRIC:
You know what? Let's begin!

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:49.836
BERGMITE: [APPEARING]

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.438
PIKACHU:
[SURPRISED] [QUESTIONING]

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.741
ASH: It's a Bergmite!

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.743
SERENA:
He didn't use it last time.

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:59.079
CLEMONT: I wonder how
Bergmite's go into attack

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.314
ASH:
'Kay, achu! You're up, buddy!

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:03.450
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.885

All right then, battle begin!

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:11.658

PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]
[ELECTRO BALL MOVE]

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:16.763
BERGMITE: [DODGING]

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:17.631
ASH:
I knew Bergmite would slide

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.933
WULFRIC: Now, Icy Wind!

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.268
BERGMITE: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:22.469
ASH: Pikachu, heads up!

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:23.870
PIKACHU: [DODGING]

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.472

PIKACHU: [ANGRY]

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.947
ASH:
Keep it up with Quick Attack!

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:36.249
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE] [RUNNING]

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.054
BONNIE: Hey, what's wrong?

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.956
CLEMONT: An additional
effect from the Icy Wind.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:44.558
Keep an eye on Pikachu...

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:46.593
PIKACHU: [EXERTION]

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:48.361
CLEMONT: Icy Wind is
chilling Pikachu's body

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.430
and slowing it down!

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.264
PIKACHU: [QUICK ATTACK MOVE]
BERGMITE: [SLIDING]

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.633

BERGMITE: [PAINED]
BERGMITE: [SLIDING]

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:03.944
WULFRIC: So Pikachu is
still moving quickly...

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:08.348
You know? Bergmite,
your specialty! Use Sharpen!

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:12.085
BERGMITE: [SHARPEN MOVE]

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:15.155
ASH: What's Sharpen?

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.158
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:20.093
SERENA: Sharpen?!
BONNIE: What's that do?!

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.928
CLEMONT: It's a move
that sharpens Bergmite's body

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:22.929
and increases attack power!

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:25.398
WULFRIC: Now Rapid Spin!

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:29.402
BERGMITE: [RAPID SPIN MOVE]

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:30.971
ASH: Pikachu, dodge!

00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.907
PIKACHU: [EXERTION] [YELLING]

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:40.480
PIKACHU: [EXERTION] [PAINED]

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.215
ASH: Pikachu, no!

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:44.117
CLEMONT:
Pikachu's really slowing down.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.087
All those attacks...
What will Ash do now?

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:50.190
PIKACHU: [EXPLAINING]

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.193
ASH: Got it. Run around
and around and around!

00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:55.362
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE] [RUNNING]

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:56.663
WULFRIC: What's going on?

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:59.266
PIKACHU: [RUNNING]

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:07.374
ASH: Yeah! Looking good!

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:09.109
‐WULFRIC: What?
‐CLEMONT: Of course.

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:10.677
BONNIE: Whaddaya mean of course?

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:12.212
CLEMONT: The increased
body temperature melted

00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:14.781
the ice on Pikachu's body.

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:17.117
SERENA: Looks like it's also
melting‐ Wulfric's icy resolve!

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:18.919
PIKACHU: [EXERTION]

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.988
WULFRIC: Fascinating. Now,
Bergmite, again! Use Rapid Spin!

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:25.225
BERGMITE: [RAPID SPIN MOVE]

00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:26.660

PIKACHU: [QUICK ATTACK MOVE]

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:33.233
ASH: Now use Iron Tail

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:36.570
PIKACHU:

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.805

BERGMITE: [STUNNED]

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.513
WULFRIC: Impressive...

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:47.948
PUPIL:
Bergmite is unable to battle

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:49.850

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.185

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:59.259
SERENA: Yeah.
Ash is back. The Ash I know!

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:02.729
WULFRIC: Bergmite, return!

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:09.970
WULFRIC: You know what? I was
waiting for that kind of fire...

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.606
WULFRIC:
Avalugg, you're up next!

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:21.548
AVALUGG: [ROARING]
PIKACHU: [CONFIDENT]

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:24.117
really turn
up the heat, challenger!

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.120

WULFRIC: Please.
I need more heat than that.

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:47.567

So Who's your second Pokémon?

All your Pokémon have
such fire in their eyes...

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:04.317

Watch this! Use Flame Charge!

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.820

PUPIL:
Abomasnow is unable to battle!

00:18:06.686 --> 00:18:08.354
That makes Greninja the winner

goes to Ash the challenger!

WULFRIC: You're greatly
loved by your Pokémon,

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:52.425

much you believe in them,
