that Jimmy guy is the kind to
leave even if I tell him what

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.070
the situation is.
I said I'd take care of Ash,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.404

MEOWTH: He may play too loud,
but at least he's determined.

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.681
JESSIE: So that loudmouth thinks
he can beat the Twerp's Pikachu?

00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:13.186
MEOWTH: Yeah. You can't
win with determination alone

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:18.158
JAMES: But on the odd chance
that they're really strong,

00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:20.727
I say we procure the
Twerp's Pikachu while it's in

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.595
a weakened state.

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:25.365

this guy isn't just all talk.

PIKACHU: [DETERMINED]

00:09:58.031 --> 00:09:59.632

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:01.034

in a situation like this?!

what I've been searching for!

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.799
SERENA: You just wait.
When it comes to what I can do,

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:08.434
you haven't seen anything!

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:09.936
SERENA: Oh my gosh,
I can't believe it worked!

00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:12.906
JAMES: Say, good match.

00:11:14.474 --> 00:11:17.544
JESSIE: I have a thought. Since
the loudmouth's Pikachu seems as

00:11:17.544 --> 00:11:19.812
strong as the Twerp's Pikachu,
why don't we grab them

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:22.081
both for a double play?

00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:25.251

You're a genius, genius!

GIOVANNI: Reward you reward you

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.398

Does that mean Ash will

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:55.014
be all better soon?

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:56.449

feel much better in no time.

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:41.327

Ash and Pikachu to a battle

You've gotta get well quick.

You battled in my place, right?

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:14.100

that later. Right now, getting

a Pokémon battle can be the

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:39.805
catalyst for so many friendships
and encounters. And that surely

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:43.042
must be what's crossing Serena's
mind as she watches Ash,

00:20:43.042 --> 00:20:45.211
Jimmy and their
Pikachu sitting there together

00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:51.417
