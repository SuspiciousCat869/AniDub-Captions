WEBVTT

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.006
ASH: All right, Hawlucha,
Flying Press!

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:09.309
HAWLUCHA: [FLYING PRESS MOVE]

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.677
SHELGON: [PAINED GRUNT]

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:15.849
SAWYER: Shelgon!
SHELGON: [DAZED]

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.918
CLEMONT: Shelgon is unable
to battle! Hawlucha wins!

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:19.486
ASH:
Okay, that's one.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.789
HAWLUCHA: [TRIUMPHANT]

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:23.857
SAWYER: Okay Shelgon. Return!

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:27.628
SAWYER: There's no
doubt you're strong, Ash.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:28.562
But I'm gonna win the next one!

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.231
BONNIE: Yeah, go for it, Sawyer!

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.736
NARRATOR: On their way to
Snowbelle City, our heroes have

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:37.237
suddenly crossed paths with
their old friend Sawyer, which

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.708
resulted in an exciting best
of three Pokémon battle!

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:44.945
SAWYER: All right,
Honedge, let's go!

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.348
HONEDGE: [GREETING]

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:49.716
SERENA: A new Pokémon!

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.385
BONNIE: Yay!!

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.686
ASH: So you caught
a new Pokémon, huh?

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.892
POKEDEX: Honedge.
The Sword Pokémon.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.194
It is said that Honedge
is actually a spirit

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.297
living inside a sword.

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:06.333
ASH: 'Kay, b
PIKACHU: [DETERMINED]

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.901
SAWYER: Right, here we go!
Fury Cutter!

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.370
HONEDGE: [CHARGING]

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.675
ASH: Pikachu, Iron Tail!

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.276
PIKACHU: [IRON TAIL MOVE]
HONEDGE: [FURY CUTTER MOVE]

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.580
ASH: Now, Pikachu,
use Thunderbolt!

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.682
PIKACHU: [THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:26.887
SAWYER: Honedge!

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:30.524
CLEMONT: Honedge
is unable to battle!

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.059
CLEMONT: Pikachu is the winner!

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:33.093
BONNIE: Wow.
That was so amazing!

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.763
ASH: Awesome job!
PIKACHU: [TRIUMPHANT]

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:39.666
SAWYER: Honedge.
You take a good rest.

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.370
SAWYER: It's frustrating,
but good experience.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.241
SAWYER: The third time's the
charm! It's up to you, Sceptile!

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.245
SCEPTILE: [APPEARING]

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:56.483
ASH: So it evolved, huh?
Check out my third Pokémon!

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.018
ASH: Greninja! I choose you!

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:02.689
GRENINJA: [APPEARING]

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:05.759
GRENINJA: [DETERMINED]

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.234
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.305
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.109
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:25.012
Pokémon

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:26.580
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.816
I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:32.252
Pokémon

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.154
Pokémon

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.555
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.135
SAWYER: A Greninja...

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:50.570
SAWYER: So Frogadier
evolved, too.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.880
POKEDEX: Sceptile. The Forest
Pokémon, and the evolved form

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.083
of Grovyle. The seeds growing
on Sceptile's back are brimming

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.985
with vitamins that
can revitalize trees.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:06.753
SAWYER: Here goes! Bullet Seed!

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.222
SCEPTILE: [BULLET SEED MOVE]

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:11.258
ASH: Check this out!
Use Water Shuriken!

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:15.796
ASH: Use Cut!

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:17.631
GRENINJA: [CUT MOVE]

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:19.166
SAWYER: Dodge it, quick!

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:19.833
GRENINJA: [CUT MOVE]

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:23.103
SCEPTILE: [DODGING]
SCEPTILE: [EXERTION]

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:23.904
SAWYER: I know we've got the
matchup advantage,

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:25.972
but I've
still gotta stay on my guard!

00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:28.275
ASH: Keep it going.
With Aerial Ace!

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:30.477
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:32.579
SAWYER: Sceptile, Leaf Blade!

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.648
GRENINJA,SCEPTILE:
[AERIAL ACE MOVE]

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:51.098
SAWYER: Dragon Pulse, GO!

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.701
SCEPTILE: [DRAGON PULSE MOVE]

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.070
ASH: Dodge it, quick!

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.072
GRENINJA:
[DODGING]/[PAINED GRUNT]

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.207
GRENINJA: [STRUGGLING]

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.814
ASH: Can you go on, Greninja?
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:09.716
SAWYER: Keep pushing.
Leaf Storm!

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:12.519
SCEPTILE: [LEAF STORM MOVE]

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.156
GRENINJA: [BRACING]

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:18.859
ASH: Greninja!

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:19.860
SAWYER: I'm pretty sure I've
figured out

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.062
Greninja's battling
style.

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:23.930
It uses speed to get up
close so it can finish up the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.566
battle with just one attack.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.934
SAWYER: So if I can
attack from a distance,

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.137
I'll have the advantage!

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:31.972
SERENA: He's really
done his research.

00:04:31.972 --> 00:04:34.341
CLEMONT: Well, Ash has become
Sawyer's role model, so it

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:35.675
doesn't surprise me one bit.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:44.985
SAWYER: All right,
Sceptile, wrap this up!

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.255
SCEPTILE: [ATTACK]

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:52.626
ASH: Greninja, can
you still battle?

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:53.994
There's no doubt we
can win this thing!

00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:55.162
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:57.297
GRENINJA: [RISING YELL]

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:16.283
SAWYER: Hey, what's
going on here?

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.820
Sceptile, I think it's time
we get this over with! Okay.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.489
SCEPTILE: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:23.890
ASH: Greninja, let's do this.

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:27.227
ASH: Use Aerial Ace!

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:31.031
GRENINJA: [AERIAL ACE MOVE]

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.467
GRENINJA: [CHARGING]

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:36.570
SCEPTILE:
[SHOCKED]/[PAINED GRUNT]

00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:39.139
SAWYER: Sceptile!

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:43.410
CLEMONT: Sceptile
is unable to battle!

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.345
Greninja wins!
So the match goes to Ash!

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:51.985
ASH: I still won anyway.

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.956
SAWYER: No matter what I try,
I can't keep up with you, Ash.

00:05:57.791 --> 00:05:59.292
But this battle was even
more great experience!

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.295
SERENA: Hey, Ash!

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.231
‐BONNIE: Are you okay?
‐ASH: Yeah, but I'm wiped out.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.267
That was a close one,
right, Greninja?

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:09.369
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.470
SAWYER: So Ash, you've gotta
tell me what just happened!

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:13.139
How did you do whatever you did?
Fill me in!

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.609
ASH: I don't really
know what I did, Sawyer.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.678
Stuff just flashes in front of
my eyes when I get like that...

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:21.348
SAWYER: Oh, I see. No, I don't!

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:27.120
NURSE JOY: Everyone's
just fine now!

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:29.189
ASH, SAWYER: Thanks, Nurse Joy!

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:31.024
WIGGLYTUFF: [HAPPY]

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:34.294
PIKACHU: [GREETING]
ASH: Looking good, Pikachu.

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:35.495
PIKACHU: [HAPPY]

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.631
BONNIE: Hey over here!

00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:38.465
ASH: Okay!

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.472
NURSE JOY: Hello there sir, and
welcome to the Pokémon Center!

00:06:46.673 --> 00:06:47.674
ALAIN: Hi. Would you
take care of this?

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.210
NURSE JOY: Sure.
WIGGLYTUFF: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.751
DEDENNE: [PLAYFUL]

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:59.119
SAWYER: Hey, your Greninja
looked kind of different in

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:00.353
battle, didn't it, Ash?

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:02.289
ASH: Did it?

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.090
SAWYER: It sure did! And it was
all wrapped up in water!

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.227
SAWYER: So please, tell me how
the two of you did that, okay?

00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:11.064
ASH: I really don't have a clue.

00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:13.767
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.135
SERENA: Actually, none
of us have any idea.

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:17.237
BONNIE: It just happens.

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:18.538
CLEMONT: That's true,
although so far it's only

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:20.840
happened a few times.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.877
SAWYER: Wow, that's so strange.
The way Ash and Greninja

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:25.478
were moving together like that,
it's as if they'd become one.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.082
SERENA: It was just like
that when it happened before,

00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:30.850
‐wasn't it?
‐ASH: Well. Kinda, I guess.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:38.191
ASH: It's really hard to
explain. I guess it's like all

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:41.695
the things that Greninja's
seeing and doing, I'm seeing

00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:43.363
and doing the exact same
things at the same time.

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:46.499
SERENA: It sounds like
you're telling us you

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:48.535
get fused together.

00:07:48.535 --> 00:07:51.037
ASH: Right! Then I start to burn
UP! Like I'm on fire!

00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:53.840
After that,
I wanna go to sleep.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.843
SAWYER: It sounds to me
like you turn into Greninja.

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:01.081
ASH: I become Greninja?

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:02.082
PIKACHU: [DISBELIEF]

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.285
ASH: That would be kind of cool
if it was true...

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:08.355
JAMES: What's that
nonsense about?

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:10.690
JESSIE: The Twerp
becoming Greninja?

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:12.959
MEOWTH: What a wacky idea.

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:14.094
WOBBUFFET: [AGREEMENT]

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:17.430
CLEMONT: That's quite
a theory you've got!

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.898
BONNIE: That would be so cool!
DEDENNE: [AMAZED]

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:20.900
SERENA: It sure
would explain a lot.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.570
SAWYER: They say when the bond
between Trainer and Pokémon gets

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.439
stronger, they start to look
alike. So maybe that might

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:29.142
explain whatever's happening
to them since the bond between

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:30.477
Ash and Greninja has
gotten so powerful.

00:08:32.212 --> 00:08:34.647
ASH: It's our bond?
It turns me into Greninja.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:43.189
LYSANDRE: Alain? As the data
I sent to you earlier shows,

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.492
the Mega Evolution energy has
accumulated according to plan.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.095
ALAIN: Thank you,
Lysandre. Also.

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:51.164
LYSANDRE: What's that?

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:52.699
ALAIN: I was wondering how
Mairin and Chespin are doing.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.277
LYSANDRE: They're still
the same. No change for

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:06.079
either of them.

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:07.280
