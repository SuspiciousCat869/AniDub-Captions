here will become Kalos Queen!

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.279
CLEMONT: So, I guess that
means she's going to enter

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:46.380
the Pokémon Showcase as well

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.682
BONNIE: She sure looks popular!

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.669
I stand tall

SERENA:
I'm fine.

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:56.984
ASH: You really need to eat a
lot of food before you compete.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:59.319
Or you won't have
enough strength!

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.323
BONNIE: You know Ash always
eats a lotta food, right?

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:04.958
Gives him energy!

SERENA: But, Ash

00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:26.559
ASH: Wait up, Serena!

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.860
SERENA: Hurry it up,
you guys! Quick!

00:20:29.929 --> 00:20:31.564
CLEMONT: Whether we
hurry it up or not,

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.599
Gloire City
isn't going anywhere!

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.700
SERENA: Let's hurry anyway!

00:20:36.135 --> 00:20:37.903
Thinking too much won't
help.

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:39.205
For now, I've got to
keep moving forward!

00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:44.043
NARRATOR: After winning
her third Princess Key,

00:20:44.043 --> 00:20:46.846
Serena can now
compete in the Master Class!

00:20:46.846 --> 00:20:49.782
Although many challenges
stand between her and her goal

00:20:49.782 --> 00:20:53.018
to become Kalos Queen,
the journey continues!
