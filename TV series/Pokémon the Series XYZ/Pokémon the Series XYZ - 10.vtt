WEBVTT

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:03.804
CLEMONT: Hey! Squishy!

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.207
BONNIE: Where are
you, Squishy? Answer us!

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.377
DEDENNE: [CALLING]

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:13.780
BONNIE: Squishy?!

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.951
BONNIE: Ash. Serena.

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.253
‐BONNIE: Did you find it?
SERENA: No

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:20.254
ASH: Where could it have gone?

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:25.759
BONNIE: Oh, Squishy

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.569
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:39.373
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:43.777
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.112
Pokémon

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.748
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.118
(I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner)

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.453
Pokémon

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.388
Pokémon

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.156
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:17.911
ASH: Bonnie?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:19.913
ASH: You need to eat something.

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.149
You've gotta have your strength
if you wanna find Squishy.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:23.917
PIKACHU: [AGREEING]

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:26.353
DEDENNE: [REASSURING]

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:27.020
BONNIE: Thanks, everybody.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.824
I wonder how Squishy is.
I sure hope it's okay.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.226
CLEMONT: I'm sure
Squishy's doing just fine!

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:35.462
I think you'll feel
better if you eat something.

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:37.130
SERENA: Clemont's right.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:38.999
BONNIE: Yeah

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:46.206
CELOSIA: The Cells

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.140
BRYONY: So many!

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:49.876
CLEMONT: Cells

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:50.577
SERENA: What, Clemont?

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.080
CLEMONT: I remember
what those people said.

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:55.983
They were talking about Cells
while they were after Squishy.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:00.687
CLEMONT: There's no doubt
Squishy possesses mysterious

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:04.091
powers. An unusual Pokémon.
No doubt about that.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.563
BONNIE: I know. That's why
they're chasing it. I hate this.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:12.566
BONNIE: Maybe they're
chasing Squishy right now!

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.502
Maybe they caught it and they're
doing all sorts of bad stuff!

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:19.473
We've gotta save Squishy!
Squishy's in trouble!

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.575
‐SERENA: Bonnie, stop!
‐CLEMONT: Try to relax!

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.810
BONNIE: Come on, Clemont! You're
worried, too!

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.679
CLEMONT: Of course
I'm worried!

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.582
But it's too dangerous to go
looking for Squishy this late!

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:30.851
BONNIE: It's dangerous
for Squishy, too! Squishy!

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.086
CLEMONT: Bonnie, wait!

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:34.721
BONNIE: Hey, let go!

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:35.989
You're supposed to listen to
your big brother!

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.759
BONNIE: ButWhat
about Squishy, huh?!

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:39.426
CLEMONT: It's not just Squishy!

00:02:40.394 --> 00:02:41.461
What if something
happens to you?!

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.937
ASH: Bonnie?

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:57.878
BONNIE: I promised! I said I'd
always protect it! I promised

00:02:57.878 --> 00:02:58.945
I'd make sure it was safe!

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:02.349
CLEMONT: I know.
We'll find Squishy tomorrow.

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.184
I give my word.

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:11.491
SERENA: All right.
We need to sleep.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:12.726
Let's all wash up and get ready.

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:14.594
BONNIE: Okay

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.673
SQUISHY: [WISTFUL]

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.381
SERENA: She's asleep.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.316
CLEMONT: Thanks so much, Serena

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.820
SERENA: I totally understand
why Bonnie's so worried.

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:42.489
ASH: Who are
those people anyway?

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:45.192
What are they gonna do
if they catch Squishy?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.195
CLEMONT: There are far more
questions than answers.

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:52.466
SERENA: You know? Maybe Squishy
really did run away from us.

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:55.168
CLEMONT: Well, even so,
I'd like Bonnie to be able

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.504
to say goodbye

00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:00.540
CLEMONT: We have to find
Squishyfor Bonnie's sake.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.309
ASH: Not only that We know it's
Bonnie's friend

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:04.177
but Squishy's our friend, too!

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:06.546
SERENA: Let's
look first thing tomorrow.

00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:08.014
CLEMONT: Right!

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:13.153
HENCHWOMAN: This is
the pursuit team reporting in.

00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:14.121
HENCHWOMAN: The
Trainers in question have

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:16.656
yet to make contact with Z1.

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:18.325
BRYONY: Alright
continue to observe them.

00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:19.626
HENCHWOMAN: Roger.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:20.360
BRYONY: Tell me what's the
scanner showing?

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:22.763
HENCHMAN: It's
not showing a thing.

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:27.601
It appears Z1's
whereabouts are still unknown.

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.369
CELOSIA: Wow. That thing really
likes to play hide‐and‐seek.

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:31.204
Let's find it already.

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:33.406
BRYONY: Focus the
scanner on a wider area.

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:35.008
HENCHMAN: You got it.

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.282
ASH: Kay, time to
get going, Bonnie!

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.317
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:45.685
BONNIE: Dedenne, let's go.

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:46.286
DEDENNE:
[AFFIRMATIVE]/[EXERTION]

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:50.023
CLEMONT: Just a second! I have
a method for locating Squishy!

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:52.292
ASH: Yeah? What's that?

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:57.130
CLEMONT: Simple!
Remember the future is now,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.665
thanks to science!

00:04:58.665 --> 00:04:59.833
Clemontic Gear, on!

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.469
CLEMONT: It's the perfect device
to search for Squishy!

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:07.007
I call it the "Track Down
Squishy for Certain, Mark One!"

00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:07.908
BONNIE: I'm counting
on you, Clemont!

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:11.778
CLEMONT: Count on the
po‐ wer of science! My

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:14.581
brilliantly designed machine
will automatically search out

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.216
and find the kinds of sunny
places Squishy loves so much!

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:19.085
ASH: Hold on. When did you
find the time to make that?

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.789
CLEMONT: Making a useful machine
for a dear sister is what being

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:23.957
an inventor is all about.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:25.992
BONNIE: Thank you

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.796
CLEMONT: Now, "Track Down
Squishy for Certain, Mark One,"

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:32.499
let's go. Show everyone
just what you can do!

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:36.703
BONNIE: Did it find
Squishy already?!

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:38.572
ASH: All
right! Come on!

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.440
PIKACHU: [DETERMINED]

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.011
JAMES: Who would have thought
Squishy would have that much

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:45.979
strength at its disposal?

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:49.950
MEOWTH: If we get our paws on
that hot shot, conquering the

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.551
world will be a piece of cake
with ice cream on the side.

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:54.621
JESSIE: It's just the fancy
glasses gang in our way.

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:58.792
JAMES: They do act like the
perfect picture of health.

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:01.161
MEOWTH: A little rest and
relaxation and we'll be charged

00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:02.596
up and ready to rumble
with those rowdy rascals.

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:04.564
WOBBUFFET: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:12.372
JAMES: Hey what's this?

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.212
JAMES: What's that?!

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:25.919
WOBBUFFET:
[SURPRISED]/[STRUGGLING]

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.254
JESSIE: I'm
putting my FOOT DOWN!

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:28.688
JESSIE, JAMES,
MEOWTH, WOBBUFFET: [SURPRISED]

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:31.024
TOXICROAK: [IMPACT GRUNT]

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:37.330
MEOWTH: That doesn't
sound like a party to me

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:40.200
JAMES: It's at times
like this when we should

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.602
trust our instincts!
And that's to run away!

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:43.069
WOBBUFFET: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:49.509
BONNIE: I don't get it.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:50.343
Where did your machine go?

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.414
CLEMONT: Don't worry.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.416
I installed a tracking device
to see just where it goes

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:03.957
CLEMONT: OH NO!! My
magnificent machine!

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.793
TOXICROAK X LOTS: [ANGRY]

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:08.628
ASH: Whoa, Toxicroak?!

00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:14.334
POKEDEX: Toxicroak.
The Toxic Mouth Pokémon, and

00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:15.368
the evolved form of Croagunk.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.873
Toxicroak's throat has a
poison sac, and its poison

00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:22.142
stirs and becomes even more
potent when it croaks.

00:07:22.142 --> 00:07:23.343
TOXICROAK: [ANGRY]

00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:24.044
ASH: They look like they're mad.

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:27.080
SERENA: Maybe Clemont's
invention did something

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.281
bad to them?

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.015
ASH: That's why it got beat up!

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:31.051
BONNIE: I think you're right.

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:32.919
TOXICROAK: [MUD BOMB MOVE]

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.888
CLEMONT: Bunnelby! Use Mud Shot!

00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:35.789
BUNNELBY: [MUD SHOT MOVE]

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:42.262
CLEMONT: Now's our chance!

00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:43.330
ASH, SERENA, BONNIE,
PIKACHU: [SCARED]

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.097
CLEMONT: Why can't
we all be friends?

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:45.799
ASH: Stop it, Toxicroak!

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:48.001
TOXICROAK X 2: [ADAMANT]

00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:53.306
BONNIE: Hey!

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.011
CLEMONT: Aipom Arm, activate!

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.149
SERENA: Bonnie! NO!!

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.251
CLEMONT:
Bonnie! No!

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:06.853
[EXERTION]/
[IMPACT GRUNT]

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.030
Bonnie!
Are you all right?!

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:20.700
BONNIE:I think I'm okay

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.901
DEDENNE: [RELIEVED]

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:22.569
SERENA: Oh thank goodness!

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:25.839
TOXICROAK X4: [DISMISSIVE]

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:30.343
BUNNELBY: [WHIMPER]

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:33.580
BONNIE: Bunnelby

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.214
CLEMONT: Oh no, what's wrong?!

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.983
BUNNELBY: [STRUGGLING]

00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:39.619
CLEMONT: That's not good

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.554
ASH: Hang in there, Bunnelby!

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.824
CLEMONT: It needs treatment now!

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:45.625
SERENA: We need
to go to the Pokémon Center!

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:48.428
CLEMONT: You'll be fine!
Just hang on!

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:53.867
JAMES: It appears the Twerps
haven't been able to reunite

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:54.734
with Squishy as of yet.

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.004
MEOWTH: If we stay close to
those yahoos we'll find that

00:08:58.004 --> 00:08:59.806

HENCHMAN: The scanner
is picking up Z2's energy!

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:14.954
HENCHMAN: Z1
appears to be responding,

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:15.755
but it's out of range!

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:21.161
CELOSIA: I wonder. Are Z1 and
Z2 having some sort of secret

00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:21.995
conversation or something?

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:25.665
BRYONY: Fine‐tune the scanner.
Determine Z1's location!

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:27.033

00:09:42.816 --> 00:09:44.551
SQUISHY: Not necessary.
I want to observe‐‐

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:47.387
what humans are truly like.

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:52.992
B CORE: Do not support.

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:58.832
They are destructive. The

"It's Toxicroak!"

BONNIE: Nurse Joy? Will Bunnelby
get better?

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.308
NURSE JOY: Of course. It's just

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.944
NURSE JOY: I'm out of Nicera.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.780
SERENA: Nicera?

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.384
SERENA: Is this it?

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:54.587
NURSE JOY: Yes.
It's a medicinal plant.

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:56.156
It grows on
the mountaintop nearby,

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.924
so I'll run and get some.

00:10:57.924 --> 00:11:01.728

Joy, please come look!

00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:03.796
NURSE JOY: Yes, right away!
Please, wait here one moment.

BRYONY: We're too late.

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.017
CELOSIA: Tell me
Z1's current location.

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.086
HENCHMAN: It appears they're no
longer transmitting

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:28.888
the signals, so I lost them.

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:29.822
CELOSIA: You're so useless

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:32.859
BRYONY: This is Bryony.
Do you read?

00:11:34.494 --> 00:11:35.361
HENCHWOMAN: Affirmative. This is
the pursuit team.

00:11:36.663 --> 00:11:38.731
BRYONY: What's up
with those Trainers?

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:40.967
HENCHWOMAN: Well we've tracked
their location to the Pokémon

00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:44.270
Center. One of their Pokémon has
been injured and they're forced

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.405
to deal with that matter
at the present time.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.075
BRYONY: Understood. It
sounds to me like Z1 isn't

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:49.909
their current priority.

00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:53.446
CELOSIA: It's possible they
simply gave up on it

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:54.514
because
they know we're after Z1.

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:57.317
BRYONY: I guess that means
they won't be coming back

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:01.187
CELOSIA: All right,
pursuit team, pull back.

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:04.457
back. I think we're going to
focus our search on Area R.

CLEMONT: Could she?!

00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:30.650
BONNIE: Must save Bunnelby.
I've got to! Bunnelby

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.053
BONNIE: It got hurt because
I was being so selfish.

00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:37.023
I'm sure of it! Bunnelby!

BONNIE: It's totally my fault

00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:04.544
Bunnelby got hurt really
badly because of me.

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:08.114
CLEMONT: Because of you?

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.753
CLEMONT: You're wrong.
Bunnelby saw how desperate

00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:15.755
you were to find Squishy
and wanted to help you.

00:14:15.755 --> 00:14:16.656
BONNIE: Help me? But I

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.826
CLEMONT: Don't you get it?

00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:21.794
Squishy's just as precious
to us as it is to you.

Squishy's our friend, too.

as the journey continues!
