sure is strong! Awesome moves.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:45.512
Fast and powerful!

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:47.514

great battle to have before your

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:53.687
Snowbelle Gym
battle takes place.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.990
ASH: Yeah!

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.127
SERENA: Ash? I know you're
going to win your Gym battle!

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:02.663

be my eighth Kalos Gym badge!

I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:24.217
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

NARRATOR: On their way to
Snowbelle City, our heroes have

00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:58.085
run into their friend Sawyer,
a young Trainer who admires Ash.

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:02.489
ASH: The Snowbelle Gym?

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.224
SAWYER: Yeah!
That's the gym where I earned

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:05.959
my eighth Gym badge!

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.160
ASH: Whoa, you got
your eighth badge already?!

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:08.729
SAWYER: Uh huh!

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:10.430
ASH: Wow

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:12.532
ASH: That's so awesome!

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:15.268
BONNIE: Sure is. Nice work!

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:18.872
ASH: I've still got seven. Guess
you beat me to it, didn't you?

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:20.340
SAWYER: I was kind of jealous
when I saw your badges before.

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:22.409
I knew what I had to do.

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:26.013
SAWYER: I had to work hard
so I could catch up to you!

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:30.283
ASH: Well I'm up next.
And I'll win, too!

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.788
SERENA: Sawyer? So, what type
of Gym is the Snowbelle Gym?

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:35.756
SAWYER:
Snowbelle is an Ice‐type Gym.

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:38.759
CLEMONT: And that means Water
types should do really well!

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.962
ASH: Then I'll use
Greninja for the win!

00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:44.598
SERENA: Since the two of
you did so well against Diantha

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:47.567
SAWYER: You
actually battled the Champion?!

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.870
BONNIE: Yup! She
was using Mega Gardevoir, too!

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:52.572
DEDENNE: [AFFIRMATIVE]
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:02.416
ASH: Uh huh. It was great.

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:04.618
Greninja and I merged completely
while the battle was going.

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:05.352
SAWYER: You merged?

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.088
Like that time back
when we had our battle?

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:19.032
ASH: Not quiteIt was more
like It just really clicked.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.568
SAWYER: Uh

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:23.470
BONNIE: And Greninja had a big
Water Shuriken on its back!

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:26.440
SAWYER: A big Water Shuriken?

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.742
BONNIE: And its head got all
pointy‐looking like "voomp" and

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:30.143
it was so totally cool!

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.946
SAWYER: Voomp?

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.347
SERENA: I don't think Sawyer
quite understands what you mean.

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:36.783
ASH: So why don't
we just show you?

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:39.186
Wanna battle
with me and Greninja?

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.624
SAWYER: You're on! So how
aboutI'm thinking we should

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:45.659
have a three‐on‐three battle!

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:50.497
SAWYER: I wanna have a battle
just like we had last time, that

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:51.998
way I can see just how much
stronger I've gotten since then.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.434
And I think that
would be a great way to see!

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.237
ASH: You've got it, Sawyer!

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:06.279

confirmed. Compared to the total

00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:32.365

it is three units higher

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.133
than initial estimate.

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:36.236
TEAM FLARE ADMIN M:
Discrepancy from planned output

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:38.405
approximately two percent.

TEAM FLARE ADMIN M: Negative.

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:51.117
Their energy depletion
level is greatly reduced.

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:53.653
TEAM FLARE ADMIN F: Results
far exceed our expectations.

00:05:58.892 --> 00:06:00.894

What's wrong? Can you hear me?

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:28.021
Are you safe?

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:43.536
BONNIE:
You're worried about someone

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:44.404
SQUISHY: [SURPRISED]

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:47.607

You always have us!

we're so happy. I'll care for
you and always be with you.

Sweet little Squishy, here's my
song for you. My sweet Squishy,

it's true!
My sweet Squishy, that's you!

00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:19.873
SAWYER: Hey,
Ash, what's that thing?

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:24.744
CLEMONT: It's a Battle Pulse
Meter. It closely monitors Ash

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:27.113
and Greninja's emotional
synchronization, essential for

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.049
Greninja's powering up.

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:31.084
SAWYER: That's great.

00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:32.585

ASH: Check it out!

00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:52.706
POKEDEX: Doublade. The Sword
Pokémon, and the evolved form of

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:56.743
Honedge. Doublade's attacks are
so rapid and intricate, it is

00:07:56.743 --> 00:07:58.945
said to be impossible for even a
master swordsman to stop them.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.549
ASH : Wow. Guess Honedge
evolved since our last battle

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.353
ASH: In that case

00:08:06.353 --> 00:08:07.687
ASH: Noivern, I choose you!

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:13.994
NOIVERN: [APPEARING]

your Noibat evolved as well!

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:17.130
Awesome!

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.532
ASH: And it's
gotten really strong!

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:25.271

exhaust Noivern by blocking all

00:08:57.504 --> 00:08:58.705
of its attacks
using Iron Defense!

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:03.610

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.721
SERENA: Ash won!

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:54.427
SAWYER: Thanks, Doublade. You
deserve a good rest. Noivern

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.930
knew Doublade's position and
exact timing. It attacked in the

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.200
dust cloud! How did it know?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.469
ASH: Noivern was using
sound waves the entire time!

00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:04.370
NOIVERN: [AGREEMENT]

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.040
SAWYER: I get it. That's whyI

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.007
Gotta make a note
of this experience!

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:11.244
ASH: Ready?
Time for your next Pokémon!

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:12.378
SAWYER: Right!

00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:14.414
SAWYER: Here we go!

00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:18.518
CLAWITZER: [APPEARING]

00:10:18.518 --> 00:10:19.552
ASH: Hey, that's

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:25.158
POKEDEX: Clawitzer. The Howitzer
Pokémon, and the

00:10:25.158 --> 00:10:28.895
evolved form of Clauncher.
Clawitzer can travel at nearly

00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:31.798
seventy miles an hour when it
propels itself by shooting water

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:32.699
from the back of its claw.

00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:34.000
ASH: Clawitzer, huh

00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:38.304
SAWYER: This time, I'll win!
Now, Clawitzer, use Crabhammer!

00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:42.442
CLAWITZER: [CRABHAMMER MOVE]

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:44.410
ASH: Dodge it,
then use Boomburst!

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.146
NOIVERN: [DODGING]
CLAWITZER: [CRABHAMMER MOVE]

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.248
NOIVERN: [BOOMBURST MOVE]

00:10:48.248 --> 00:10:50.250
CLAWITZER: [PAINED]

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:55.188
SAWYER: You're gonna be fine!
Heal Pulse, go!

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:58.158
CLAWITZER: [HEAL PULSE MOVE]

00:10:59.893 --> 00:11:00.927
BONNIE: Wow, it's glowing!

00:11:00.927 --> 00:11:02.462
DEDENNE: [QUESTIONING]

00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:05.298
CLEMONT: That's right! Heal
Pulse is a move that restores a

00:11:05.298 --> 00:11:08.134
Pokémon's health. It also worked
with Mega Launcher, Clawitzer's

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:10.103
Ability, which
helped Clawitzer recover!

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:11.471
SERENA: No way!

00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:13.072
ASH: Noivern, use Dragon Claw!

00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:15.909
NOIVERN: [DRAGON CLAW MOVE]

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.545
SAWYER:
Clawitzer, use Dragon Pulse!

00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:19.913
CLAWITZER: [DRAGON PULSE MOVE]

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:23.550
NOIVERN: [PAINED]

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.817
ASH: Noivern!

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:26.786
NOIVERN: [STRUGGLING]

00:11:32.325 --> 00:11:33.960
SAWYER: ALL RIGHT!

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.395
BONNIE: Look at that!

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.764
SERENA:
Was that its Ability, too?

00:11:37.764 --> 00:11:39.899
CLEMONT: Yes. It increases the
power of aura and pulse moves!

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.703
ASH: Thanks, Noivern!
That battle was great.

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:46.773
ASH: Hawlucha, I choose you!

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:53.313
HAWLUCHA: [APPEARING]

00:11:56.516 --> 00:11:57.217
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"Who's that Pokémon?"

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:04.624
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"It's Doublade!"

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:13.800
HAWLUCHA: [DODGING]
[HIGH JUMP KICK MOVE]

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.034
SAWYER: Use Dragon Pulse!

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:16.336
ASH: Quick, dodge it!

00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:17.837
CLAWITZER: [WATER GUN MOVE]

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:19.272
HAWLUCHA: [DODGING]
HAWLUCHA: [LANDING]

00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:22.208
ASH: All right, Mega Launcher's
impressive but check this out!

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:23.576
HAWLUCHA: [JUMPING]

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:24.877
ASH: Grab it by the claw!

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:28.081
HAWLUCHA: [DIVING]

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.783
SAWYER: I knew you were going
to do that, Ash! Clawitzer,

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:32.585
use Dragon Pulse on the ground!

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.754
CLAWITZER: [DRAGON PULSE MOVE]

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.256
HAWLUCHA: [SURPRISED]

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:37.991
BONNIE: How can it be flying?!

00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:40.026
ASH: Wanna have a battle
in the air, huh? Hawlucha,

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.394
get above it!

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:43.730
HAWLUCHA: [JUMPING]
CLAWITZER: [QUESTIONING]

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:45.898
ASH: Use Flying Press!

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:48.301
HAWLUCHA: [FLYING PRESS MOVE]

00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:49.269
SAWYER: Closer now

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.505
SAWYER: All right!
Ice Beam, let's go!

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:54.173
CLAWITZER: [ICE BEAM MOVE]

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:55.174
HAWLUCHA: [SHOCKED]

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.344
ASH: Hawlucha!

00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:01.314
SERENA:
They were waiting for that!

00:13:01.314 --> 00:13:03.082
CLEMONT: Ice Beam's super
effective against Hawlucha!

00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:06.786
HAWLUCHA: [PAINED]

00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:12.659
ASH: Thanks, Hawlucha.
You deserve a good rest.

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:15.094
I was so worried about pulse
moves, that Ice Beam caught me

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:17.430
totally off guard.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.465
SAWYER: I taught it to Clawitzer
to deal with its disadvantage

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.600
against Grass types.
I'm glad it worked.

00:13:21.501 --> 00:13:23.202
CLAWITZER: [AGREEMENT]

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:26.039
CLEMONT: So Clawitzer used
Dragon Pulse to dodge instead of

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:29.142
attacking, and dealt the final
blow with Ice Beam, effective

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.311
against Hawlucha.
The way he called those moves

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.346
was very precise.

00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:36.115
SERENA: Sawyer studies
really hard and it shows.

00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:39.686
CLEMONT: I can see why he
won all eight Gym badges!

00:13:41.554 --> 00:13:43.823
ASH: Wow Sawyer's
got so much more strength now

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:44.757
then he had before.

00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:47.160
ASH: We can't let our
guard down at all! Greninja!

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:50.229
Are you ready to go?

00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:52.098
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.736
SAWYER: Greninja

00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:57.670
SAWYER: This battle's gonna
be great experience for us!

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:02.208
We'll do our best! Clawitzer,
Dragon Pulse, let's go!

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:04.210
CLAWITZER: [DRAGON PULSE MOVE]

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.278
ASH: Dodge it

00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:06.012
GRENINJA: [DODGING]

00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:09.882
SAWYER: Fast!

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:13.052
ASH: Now what? Do we just go for
it? What move is Sawyer

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:13.720
gonna use next?

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:18.224
SAWYER: Clawitzer, Ice Beam, go!

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:20.493
ASH: Greninja, now use Cut!

00:14:20.493 --> 00:14:21.661
CLAWITZER: [ICE BEAM MOVE]

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:23.930
GRENINJA: [CUT MOVE]

00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:32.372
CLAWITZER: [PAINED]

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.073
SAWYER: Clawitzer!

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:36.242
BONNIE:
So strong! So fast! So cool!

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:37.043
DEDENNE: [EXCITED]

00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:40.179
SERENA: Clemont? What's up?

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:42.815
CLEMONT: Their battle pulses
are still staying separate.

00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:44.484
It's not merging like when
they battled against Diantha.

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:46.452
SERENA: I wonder why

00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:48.988
SAWYER:
You were awesome, Clawitzer.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.491
SAWYER:
Just leave the rest to us.

00:14:54.694 --> 00:14:56.295
SAWYER: Sceptile, now. GO!

00:14:57.864 --> 00:14:59.165
SCEPTILE: [APPEARING]

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:03.936
ASH: The battle's almost over

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:05.905
SAWYER: Now it's time to really
show you how strong I've become!

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.073
So get ready, Ash!

00:15:09.609 --> 00:15:12.912
SAWYER: Here we go I know I've
already won eight Gym badges.

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:15.848
But I'm up against
Ash now. I've gotta beat him!

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:20.119
SAWYER: It'll be proof I've
become a full‐fledged Trainer.

00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:22.555
I've gotta make
sure he knows it!

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.326
SAWYER: And winning this battle
is the best way to do it!

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:29.028
SAWYER: You ready, Sceptile?
Leaf Blade, let's go!

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:32.732
SCEPTILE: [ROARING]

00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:35.468

00:15:35.468 --> 00:15:37.804

GRENINJA: [WATER SHURIKEN MOVE]

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:56.722

CLEMONT: Greninja's great at
close range, but they're taking

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:14.373
it on anyway?

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:16.209

00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:18.344

amazing close up and long range!

00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:42.969

ASH: You two are good!

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.479
ASH: There are some things you
just can't know unless you have

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:57.783
a battle Sawyer's gotten really
strong! It's obvious he must've

00:16:57.783 --> 00:17:00.620
trained really hard Otherwise he
couldn't have gotten this

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.420
strong so quickly!

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:06.025
SAWYER: Being able to adapt to
any situation and choose the

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:08.494
most effective moves I learned
how to do all of that from Ash!

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.200

me. Greninja, Aerial Ace!

ASH: All right We're
gonna battle as one!

00:17:44.497 --> 00:17:46.299
GRENINJA: [RUNNING]

00:17:48.134 --> 00:17:50.069
SCEPTILE: [QUESTIONING]

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:54.340
ASH: It's not happening!

00:17:58.611 --> 00:18:00.279
CLEMONT: The waveforms
They're separating!

00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:06.686
ASH: Wait. How did we
do it in the first place?!

00:18:06.686 --> 00:18:07.820
GRENINJA: [QUESTIONING]

00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:10.890
SAWYER: All right,
Sceptile, use Leaf Storm!

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:14.827
SCEPTILE: [LEAF STORM MOVE]

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:17.997
GRENINJA: [IMPACT]

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:20.232
ASH: No, Greninja!
PIKACHU: [YELLING]

00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:22.835
SAWYER:
Finish this with Leaf Blade!

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.806
SCEPTILE: [LEAF BLADE MOVE]

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:28.140
GRENINJA: [IMPACT]

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.414
GRENINJA: [PAINED]

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:42.888
SCEPTILE: [SATISFIED]

00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:46.425
ASH: Greninja, you okay?!

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.195
GRENINJA: [EXHAUSTED]
PIKACHU: [WORRIED]

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.965
ASH: Guess we lost.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.433
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:56.102
SAWYER: We beat
Greninja We did it

00:18:59.038 --> 00:19:01.607
SAWYER: Amazing! We won!
Sceptile, we really beat Ash!

00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:03.075
SCEPTILE: [AGREEMENT]

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:04.844
BONNIE:
I can't believe Ash lost.

00:19:04.844 --> 00:19:06.679
CLEMONT: It happens sometimes.

00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:08.347
It's almost
impossible to win every battle.

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.251
SERENA: And don't forget
Sawyer's gotten really strong.

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:14.754
CLEMONT: Right. I can't imagine
how hard he must have trained to

00:19:14.754 --> 00:19:16.055
become so strong so quickly.

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:18.557
ASH:
Thanks, Greninja. Now, return.

00:19:22.762 --> 00:19:23.763
PIKACHU: [CONCERNED]

00:19:26.065 --> 00:19:27.400
ASH: Sawyer got me good.

00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:30.269
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:32.238
SAWYER: Ash?

00:19:32.238 --> 00:19:33.606
SAWYER: Uh, do you
think I've gotten strong?

00:19:34.607 --> 00:19:36.142
ASH: Yeah. You're really strong!

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:38.611
ASH: You surprised me

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:53.159
ASH: I wonder why we
couldn't make it happen today.

00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:54.260
CLEMONT: I really have no idea.

00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:58.097
Your battle pulses didn't
overlap even once during the

00:19:58.097 --> 00:19:59.265
whole time you were battling.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.537
ASH: Ah, forget it!
No point making ourselves crazy.

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:08.374
ASH: You'd better not get used
to beating me, though! Okay?

00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:13.145
SAWYER: Okay!

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:15.581
ASH: Now, let's get back on
the road to the Snowbelle Gym!

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:17.416
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.719
SAWYER: Hey, do you
think I could come along?

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:22.421
It would be awesome to be there
when you have your battle!

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:24.957
ASH: Sure! You can watch
me win my eighth Gym badge!

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:26.492
Let's all go!

00:20:26.492 --> 00:20:27.560
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.703
ASH: Ah, Snowbelle City.
There it is, up ahead!

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:39.905
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.443
NARRATOR: Our heroes are finally
closing in on Snowbelle

00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:48.013
City, and Ash's battle to win
his eighth Kalos Gym badge is

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:50.182
soon to begin,
as the journey continues!
