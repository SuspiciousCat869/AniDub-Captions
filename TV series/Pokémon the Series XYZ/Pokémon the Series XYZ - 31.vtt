WEBVTT

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.606
CLEMONT: This way!

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:07.875
BONNIE: Clemont, wait UP!

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.243
CLEMONT:
C'mon, stragglers! Move!

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:11.778
SERENA: I've never seen
Clemont run this quickly!

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.750
ASH: Slow it down a little!
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.853
CLEMONT: There! That's it,
all right! There's no doubt.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.155
The Gadget Festival
is just up ahead!

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.057
It's the largest exhibition of

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.693
mechanical devices in
the entire Kalos region!

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.563
BONNIE:
All this running for that?

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:31.765
SERENA: It's that great?

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.201
CLEMONT: Calling it
great would be an insult!

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.069
All of the most brilliant and
talented inventors from Kalos

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.572
will be gathering
here to compete

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:40.173
by showing all their
mechanical wares!

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:41.942
ASH: Wow

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:43.577
SERENA:
And that's more than great?

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:44.578
CLEMONT:
Well, you just wait and see.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.147
What are you waiting for?

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.282
ASH: Sounds like a lot of fun!

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:49.783
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.886
CLEMONT: This is it!

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:59.760
ASH: Wow! It's huge!

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.895
SERENA: So this is what
they call the Gadget Festival!

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.297
BONNIE: Awesome!

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:04.798
DEDENNE: [CURIOUS]

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:05.799
CLEMONT: That's right.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.534
The best and brightest,

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.436
all gathered in one
magnificent setting!

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.871
Unbelievable!

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.108
CLEMONT: Even the
word gadget is inspiring.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:19.079
A triumph of human
intelligence and skill!

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.448
The gears of my
curiosity are turning

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.450
like there's no tomorrow
and they're not about to stop!

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:32.659
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.396
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.667
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.569
Pokémon

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.606
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:48.241
I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.810
Pokémon

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.578
Pokémon

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:52.746
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.167
BOY 2:
Right. Just do it like that

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:20.073
BONNIE: Yippee! This is so cool!

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:23.243
ASH: What's that?

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:24.878
CLEMONT: Why, you're looking
at the welcome gadget.

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:26.647
It will help to explain

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:28.081
exactly what a gadget
is all about with ease.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.885
SERENA: Looks complicated.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.754
ASH: So how does
this thing even work?

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:35.489
PIKACHU: [MYSTIFIED]

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.024
CLEMONT: We simply
place a ball in here, and

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:42.162
ASH/SERENA/BONNIE/PIKACHU:
[AMAZED]

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.219
BONNIE: It's still going!

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.454
ASH:
Wow, gadgets are so amazing!

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:10.190
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.091
SERENA: Can't wait to
see what happens next!

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:31.211
CLEMONT: Genius!
It's an automatic berry‐opener!

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.246
Inspiration plus!

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.782
SERENA: Seems like a
waste of time. Why build that?

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.120
SERENA: Isn't doing
this a whole lot easier?

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:44.925
CLEMONT: Nonsense!
You don't get it, do you?!

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:47.260
Gadgets have a
sense of playfulness!

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.696
CLEMONT: Playfulness creates
a variety of inventions,

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:52.399
which leads to new technologies!

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.067
The lives of convenience
we live are all built

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.869
upon this foundation of gadgets!

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.839
CLEMONT:
The name of the game is fun.

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:01.007
Otherwise, you'll never
be able to appreciate

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.343
all that this wonderful
place has to offer!

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.078
SERENA: So this is about fun

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.646
BONNIE: Whee

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.014
ASH: That makes sense to me!

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.649
PIKACHU: [AGREEMENT]

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.618
CLEMONT:
Fun, fun, fun, here we come!

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:19.025
JAMES: There!
I've just completed

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.528
my Poké Ball Stealer Mark One!

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:23.063
MEOWTH:
So now everyone's Poké Balls

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:25.265
are gonna be OUR Poké Balls!

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.201
JAMES: Right. All that remains
is a teensy bit of a fine tune.

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:29.636
JESSIE:
So This is your gadget room?

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.239
JAMES: It certainly is.
Something wrong?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.475
JESSIE:
Isn't a gadget what people use

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:37.310
to keep track of money?
You know what I mean.

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:39.546
A household gadget!

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:41.681
MEOWTH:
No, that's a budget, brainiac.

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.083
JESSIE: There's a difference?

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:44.384
JAMES: Like night and day!

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:46.153
JESSIE: Oh

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:48.255
JAMES: Let's go to
the various gadget rooms

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:50.190
and discover what all the
others have come up with.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.925
You know, check the competition.

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:53.693
MEOWTH: Right behind you!

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:56.663
JESSIE: Please.
Gadget, budget Who cares?

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:01.501
WORKER A:
Sit in one of these chairs

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:02.903
and it will take you up.

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:04.504
BONNIE: YAY!

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.340
WORKER A: Now you be careful

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.509
BONNIE: I will.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.077
CLEMONT:
I think we should go, too.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.081
CHESPIN: [APPEARING]

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:16.983
BONNIE: Hey, Chespin wants
to ride up with us!

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.718
SERENA:
I'll bet Pancham would, too.

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:20.086
This'll be fun!

00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:21.922
PANCHAM: [APPEARING]

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:24.591
PANCHAM/ CHESPIN: [SURPRISED]

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.898
JESSIE: Twerps! And Pikachu!

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:33.767
MEOWTH:
I think we can catch Pikachu

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:36.002
before we use the
Poké Ball Stealer Mark One!

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.571
JAMES: Hear, hear.

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:39.272
The gadget rooms should
provide ample opportunities!

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:41.775
JESSIE:
They don't want to waste money.

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:42.542
JAMES: Wrong word

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:46.179
ASH: Must be locked.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.280
SERENA: Give it a push.

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:49.449
ASH: It's stuck!

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.253
CLEMONT:
I know Pull it to the side!

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.323
ASH: Hey, you're right!

00:05:56.323 --> 00:05:57.991
CLEMONT: That's the way
with gimmicks. I love them!

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:00.627
ASH: Man. A wall!

00:06:01.795 --> 00:06:03.864
CLEMONT:
So it seems. Let's just see

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:09.069
CLEMONT:
It was really a hidden door.

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:12.672
BONNIE: Hey!
Pikachu and the others are gone!

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:15.675
PIKACHU/PANCHAM/CHESPIN:
[STRUGGLING]

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:17.210
ASH: Pikachu?
PANCHAM/CHESPIN: [CONFUSED]

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.812
PIKACHU: [CALLING]
CLEMONT: We've gotten separated,

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:20.347
so let's meet up later!

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.883
ASH: That okay, buddy?

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:24.117
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:25.685
BONNIE: You be good!

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:26.920
CLEMONT: Now, let's go this way!

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:29.689
ASH: So it looks like we've
gotta get over those next, huh?

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:38.131
DEDENNE: [EXERTION] [EXCITED]

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:39.332
BONNIE: Here I come!

00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:42.068
DEDENNE: [IMPATIENT]

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.104
BONNIE: Now!

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:46.406
CLEMONT:
That's the way to do it, Bonnie!

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.075
BONNIE: This is fun!

00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:52.679
BONNIE: Way to go, Clemont!

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:55.882
SERENA: You're like a totally
different person today. Wow!

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.652
ASH: 'Kay, keep it up!

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.222
PIKACHU/CHESPIN: [WORRIED]

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:04.457

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.437

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.973
CHESPIN: [LAUGHING]

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:21.441
PIKACHU: [CONFIDENT]

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.076

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:24.344

00:07:29.683 --> 00:07:32.218
CHESPIN: [ANGRY]

00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:38.525
ASH: Must be a trick
to this door, too.

00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:43.930
ASH: It feels like
it's been glued shut.

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:47.000
CLEMONT: Let me try it now

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.004
ASH: So that's the
way the door works!

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:00.747
JESSIE: This thing's BROKE!

00:08:00.747 --> 00:08:01.848
MEOWTH:
If it doesn't pull, try pushing.

00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:05.251
JESSIE:
That doesn't work either!

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.921
JAMES:
Now, watch the master at work.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:10.757
JAMES: Voilà.

00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:11.925
JESSIE: The annoying master

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.462
JESSIE:
What IS this stupid contraption?

00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:16.229
MEOWTH: That's a wall.

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:19.366
JAMES: It's elementary!

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:22.068
JAMES: Open sesame

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.170
JESSIE: You're still annoying.

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:28.475
PANCHAM: [INSISTING]

00:08:28.475 --> 00:08:30.143

JAMES:
I heard Pikachu down below!

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:00.974
JESSIE: My bad

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:10.817
JESSIE:
Balancing a household budget

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:12.452
makes me glad I
don't have a house.

00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:13.286
MEOWTH: It's a gadget

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.389
JAMES: Sliding down
was the right thing to do.

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:20.693
ASH: I think you're
supposed to sit on this thing.

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:27.934
ASH: Whoa Yeah

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.671
ASH: It stopped.

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.440
SERENA:
Now that's a great Gadget!

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.774
BONNIE: Like an amusement park!

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:35.775
DEDENNE: [AGREEMENT]

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:39.913
ASH: Now what? Clemont?

00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:42.549
CLEMONT:
Maybe another arm appears!

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:44.017
ASH: Well I can't wait!

00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:48.988
SERENA:
Good thing you didn't wait!

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:54.160
BONNIE/DEDENNE: [EXCITED]

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.829
SERENA: Bonnie! Hurry! Hurry!

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:56.796
BONNIE: Don't worry! I know!

00:09:57.997 --> 00:10:00.066
BONNIE: Woah that
thing doesn't waste time

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:02.235
JESSIE: This will be
like a walk in the park.

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:07.006
JAMES: We've got to
catch up to Pikachu.

00:10:11.878 --> 00:10:13.012
JESSIE: This is getting so old

00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:17.217
Stop! No more! My back! OUCH!

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:18.384
MEOWTH: Oy vey, Jess

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:22.522
ASH: What's that?

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:30.563
SERENA: Wow, that's the
cutest little wind‐up doll

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:31.998
I've ever seen!

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:33.299
CLEMONT:
Yeah, it's so well made!

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.634
BONNIE: Adorable!

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:35.635
ASH: It's built really well

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:39.305
ASH: You want me
to have a cup of tea?

00:10:41.508 --> 00:10:43.743
ASH: That's hot!
What was that for?

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.245
CLEMONT: I'm guessing that
was a little bit of humor

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.780
CLEMONT:
That's part of the playfulness.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.625
SERENA: It's obvious
from the lovely way she bowed

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.260
that her manners
are second to none.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.562
ASH: Yeah, if you say so

00:11:02.562 --> 00:11:05.665

PIKACHU: [PLEADING] / [PAINED]

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:37.730
JESSIE:
Where did Pikachu get to now?

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.465
JAMES: Further ahead, I'd say

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:41.301
JESSIE:
Ah, perfect. I needed a rest.

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:46.773
JESSIE: This feels pretty good!

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.377
JESSIE: What's going on?

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.479
JAMES: Perhaps another
arm will manifest.

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:54.380
JESSIE:
Oh yeah? From where then?

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:58.351
MEOWTH: Man

00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:02.455
JESSIE: That little
doll's a little doll!

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:04.924
JAMES: And it's well
known all over the region!

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:05.959
JESSIE: How nice.
You brought us tea, didn't you?

00:12:07.126 --> 00:12:09.329
MEOWTH:
Thanks for the refreshments. Ow!

00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:12.732
My tongue turned
into burnt toast!

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.035
JESSIE:
We'll never catch Pikachu

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:18.338
while we're trapped
inside this loony bin!

00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:21.341
MEOWTH: Why don't we chill
out and get my tongue some ice?

00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:24.544
JAMES: So? It's time we employ
our Poké Ball Stealer Mark One!

00:12:24.544 --> 00:12:25.545
MEOWTH: For fun!

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.216
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"Who's that Pokémon?"

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:37.290
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE:
"It's Pinsir!"

00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:49.836
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH:
Welcome, child!

00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:52.772
BOY A: What's up with this room?

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.307
JESSIE: You've wandered
into the Poké Ball Budget Room!

00:12:55.308 --> 00:12:57.443
MEOWTH: She means Gadget Room!

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.679
BOY A: What's it got
to do with Poké Balls?

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:00.947
JAMES: You place your
Poké Ball right in there.

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:03.249
BOY A: Like this?

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:08.121
JESSIE: I'm afraid that's not
quite enough weight just yet.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:11.924
JAMES: Third ball's the charm

00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:16.496
JESSIE: It's moving!
BOY A: Yay!

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.405
JAMES: Now watch as they
separate into three directions!

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:26.572
BOY A: Whoa

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:37.917
JAMES:
And finally they've reunited!

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:39.018
BOY A: Oh, WOW!

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:47.293
BOY A: Where are my Poké Balls?

00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:49.962
JESSIE:
Not your concern. Buh bye.

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:00.807
JAMES: Poké Ball
Stealer Mark One rules!

00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:03.343
MEOWTH:
And everyone else drools!

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:04.177
JESSIE: Those fools!

00:14:06.612 --> 00:14:07.680
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH:
Welcome, child!

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:10.383
GIRL A: Wow, what room is this?

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:11.651
JESSIE: You've wandered
into the right place

00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:13.052
JAMES:
The Poké Ball Gadget Room!

00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:18.024
GIRL A:
But wait. Nothing happened.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:18.925
JESSIE: Third ball's the charm

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:20.860
GIRL A: One more?

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.794
JAMES: Success!

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:27.333
JAMES: Watch as they
separate into three directions!

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:28.434
GIRL A: Wow!

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:32.739
JAMES:
And finally they've reunited!

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:37.910
GIRL A: Hey, where are my
Poké Balls? They're gone!

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.012
JESSIE:
Not your concern. Buh bye!

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.723
PIKACHU: [DELIGHTED]
ASH: Pikachu!

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.458

SERENA: Hey, guys cut it out!

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:06.272
WORKER B:
No, they're not in this room...

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:07.907
ASH: Is something the matter?

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.876
WORKER B: We've recently
had several reports

00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:11.778
of Poké Balls being
stolen in the area.

00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:13.546
SERENA: Poké Balls being stolen?

00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:15.314
CLEMONT: That's just awful!

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:16.449
ASH: Let's have a look around!

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.320
BOY C: My Poké Balls!
What are you doing?!

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.089
ASH: What's going on here?

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:24.824
BOY C: My Poké Balls
just went down that thing!

00:15:26.192 --> 00:15:27.360
ASH: Hold on!

00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:33.866
CLEMONT: Down that pipe?

00:15:36.202 --> 00:15:37.336
ASH: Yeah, that's it!

00:15:40.907 --> 00:15:43.743
ASH: What are you guys doing
in this Gadget Room anyway?

00:15:43.743 --> 00:15:45.812
JESSIE: All the world is a stage

00:15:45.812 --> 00:15:47.313
and budgets are an
actor's tools of the trade!

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:48.815
MEOWTH: Whatever

00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:50.049
JAMES:
Allow us to reveal our charade!

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:55.021
JESSIE: To protect the
world from devastation!

00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:57.924
JAMES: To unite all
people within our nation!

00:15:57.924 --> 00:16:00.726
JESSIE: To ease on down
the Poké Ball‐stealing road!

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:02.528
JAMES: To extend our reach till
we've grabbed the last load!

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:04.797
JESSIE: Jessie!

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.799
JAMES: And James.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.301
JESSIE: Team Rocket blasts
off at the speed of light!

00:16:09.902 --> 00:16:12.638
JAMES: Surrender now or prepare
for a gadget‐laden fight!

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:13.806
MEOWTH: Meowth, that's right!

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.444
SERENA: Team Rocket!
ASH: Give the Poké Balls back!

00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:19.512
JESSIE: Not today.

00:16:19.512 --> 00:16:20.680

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:23.382
ASH: Come back!

00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:28.387
BONNIE: This is fun!

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:30.256

00:16:30.256 --> 00:16:31.290
SERENA: Bonnie, be careful!

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:33.426
ASH: Stop!

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.597
MEOWTH: Awesome!

00:16:37.597 --> 00:16:39.198
You're not hoofing it now
like you have two left feet!

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:41.200
JESSIE: Thank you!

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.669
My true brilliance doesn't come
out until I'm under pressure.

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:44.570
That's how genius works!

00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:49.742
JAMES: I told her
not to scoff at gadgets!

00:16:50.443 --> 00:16:51.744
ASH: Come back!

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:54.313
PIKACHU: [ANGRY]

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:55.014
JESSIE: Yess!

00:16:57.083 --> 00:16:57.717
ASH: Stop!

00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:03.222
ASH:
Those Poké Balls aren't yours!

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:06.158
JESSIE: We've been
hustling with budgets!

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:08.127
MEOWTH: It's gadgets, genius

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:09.562
JESSIE: Now go for it, Meowth!

00:17:10.463 --> 00:17:11.597
MEOWTH: Roger!

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:15.034
ASH: What's going on?

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:16.068
PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

00:17:17.303 --> 00:17:19.071
JAMES: Feast your eyes.

00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:21.507
We worked on this for
three days and three nights

00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:23.175
without sleeping!
Our greatest work!

00:17:24.644 --> 00:17:26.579
JAMES:
Our monstrous megalo‐maniacal

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:29.348
super attacking
gilded Meowth gadget!

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:31.484
CLEMONT: Excellent! That's
an impressive piece of work!

00:17:33.286 --> 00:17:35.621
JAMES: Show them what it can do.
Stop, drop and roll!

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.186
ASH/SERENA/PIKACHU: [DETERMINED]

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:10.456
JESSIE: This is a
budget that walks the walk!

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.125
JAMES:
It's gadget! Learn how to talk!

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.071
MEOWTH: Now for Fury Swipes.

00:18:26.005 --> 00:18:27.273
PIKACHU: [BRACING]

00:18:31.644 --> 00:18:33.012

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:40.186
ASH/SERENA/BONNIE/DEDENNE:
[EMBARRASSED]

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:41.821
JESSIE: Look,
it would have been simpler

00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:44.090
for Meowth to just
use Fury Swipes!

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.224
That silly thing
didn't even reach!

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:49.328
JAMES: NONSENSE!! Stop it!!

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:51.263
Gadgets should have a
sense of playfulness!

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:53.199
It's vital to the very reason

00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:54.100
for this machine's
unbridled brilliance!

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.303
CLEMONT: This is the first time

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.805
I've agreed with Team Rocket!
Wow!

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.207
BONNIE:
Hey, those are the BAD GUYS!!

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:04.977
ASH: Give the Poké Balls
