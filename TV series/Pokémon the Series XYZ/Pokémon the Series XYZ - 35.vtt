00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.605
NARRATOR: The Kalos League
semifinal match between Ash

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.574
and Sawyer is well under way!

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:10.677
Will Ash settle an old score
with a win against his rival?

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.746
One of them will face Alain
in the finals, but which one?

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.351
ANNOUNCER: What's that about?

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:20.187
Aegislash has chopped up
every tree on the battlefield!

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:21.221
ASH: Let's see what
you're up to, Sawyer...

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:23.891
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]
CHESPIN: [QUESTIONING]

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.094
BONNIE: Why? Why would
they chop all the trees?

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:28.862
TIERNO: Knowing Sawyer, he's
no doubt got some kind of plan.

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.465
TREVOR:
Normally, someone would do that

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:33.033
so it would be easier to see,
but now?

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.337
SAWYER:
All right, good work, Aegislash.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.139
AEGISLASH: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.508
ASH: All right,
here they come, Pikachu!

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:42.109
PIKACHU: [DETERMINED]

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.717
I stand tall
'Cause I know I'm a winner

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.688
Knock me down
I'll just get up again

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.625
You've met your match
Yeah, I'm no beginner

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.861
Pokémon

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:03.664
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:06.433
I stand tall 'cause
I know I'm a winner

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:07.968
Pokémon

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.770
Pokémon

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.804
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:25.886
SYCAMORE: Looks like Sawyer's
up to something interesting.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.988
How marvelous.

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.122
DIANTHA: So far,
he's been planning

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.525
his tactics very carefully.

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:33.694
Which makes me think if
he's coming up with something

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:35.262
to defeat Pikachu soon.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.032
ASH: Pikachu, Iron Tail!

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.602
PIKACHU: [IRON TAIL MOVE]

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.370
SAWYER: King's Shield, GO!

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.440
AEGISLASH: [KING'S SHIELD MOVE]

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.241
PIKACHU: [IMPACT]

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.810
PIKACHU: [SURPRISED]

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.545
ASH:
That's right! If we attack them

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:53.647
while Aegislash is
using King's Shield,

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:55.816
Pikachu's attack
power gets weaker!

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:57.684
PIKACHU: [FRUSTRATED]

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.086
ASH: So, the more we attack,
the worse it is for us.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.788
What should I do?

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.024
TIERNO: Ash is in a tough spot,
all right...

00:02:04.024 --> 00:02:06.026
CLEMONT: His attack
options are so limited!

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:07.694
BONNIE: What's he gonna do?

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:09.062
CHESPIN: [WORRIED]
DEDENNE: [WORRIED]

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.364
SAWYER: Use Sacred Sword!

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:11.865
AEGISLASH: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.871
ASH: Dodge it, quick!
PIKACHU: [EFFORT]

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.072
AEGISLASH: [SACRED SWORD MOVE]

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.173
PIKACHU: [PAINED]

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.708
ASH: No, Pikachu!

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.510
PIKACHU: [PAINED] [DETERMINED]

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:26.246
TIERNO: Hold on!
I get the feeling

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:27.914
Sawyer's
trying to slow Pikachu down

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:29.249
as much as possible.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.218
SHAUNA: What do you mean?

00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:33.654
TIERNO: The chopped trees
are making Pikachu unsteady.

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.789
That keeps it from
getting a secure foothold,

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.258
while on the other hand,
Aegislash is floating...

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.359
CLEMONT:
So Sawyer's got the advantage!

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.462
SAWYER: All right,
use Sacred Sword again!

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.930
AEGISLASH: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.501
ASH: Dodge it...
PIKACHU: [EFFORT]

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:51.705
PIKACHU: [PANTING] [PAINED]

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:54.408
PIKACHU: [EXHAUSTED]

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:56.343
ASH: No, Pikachu!

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.311
SAWYER: I can't just let you
move around freely, you know.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.746
ASH: All right, Thunderbolt!

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.515
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:03.950
SAWYER: King's Shield, GO!

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.018
AEGISLASH: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:12.092
AEGISLASH: [KING'S SHIELD MOVE]
PIKACHU: [THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:13.927
BONNIE: Not again!

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:15.195
ASH: I've got a good
idea I think will work.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.897
I know it's a really big risk,

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:19.099
but we've gotta
give it a shot, okay?

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.834
PIKACHU: [AFFIRMATIVE]
ASH: I believe in you, buddy!

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:21.468
PIKACHU: [DETERMINED]

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.305
SAWYER:
Ash is up to something for sure.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.641
I know that
expression on his face!

00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:29.109
SAWYER:
I've seen it plenty of times.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.879
SAWYER:
Okay, Aegislash, heads up!

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.014
AEGISLASH: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:36.149
ASH: 'Kay Pi u, Iron Tail!

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.385
PIKACHU: [IRON TAIL MOVE]

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.822
ANNOUNCER: Pikachu knocked
the wood up into the air!

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:43.290
What could that mean?

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.394
SAWYER: What will that do?
Use Fury Cutter!

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:48.428
AEGISLASH: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:50.197
ASH: Now! Use the trees!

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:52.699
PIKACHU: [EFFORT]

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.401
AEGISLASH: [FURY CUTTER MOVE]

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.002

AEGISLASH: [FURY CUTTER MOVE]

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:10.550
AEGISLASH: [BEWILDERED]
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.953
SAWYER: I thought you'd do that.
Aegislash, King's Shield!

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.822
AEGISLASH: [KING'S SHIELD MOVE]

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:18.225
ASH: Now, Pikachu!
Use that piece of wood!

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:19.726
PIKACHU: [EFFORT]
AEGISLASH: [FRUSTRATED]

AEGISLASH: [STUNNED]

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:35.175
REFEREE: Aegislash is unable
to battle! Pikachu's the winner!

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.846
ANNOUNCER:
What an incredible strategy!

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:42.115
Pikachu jammed up that King's
Shield with a piece of wood!

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.416
I've never seen that before!

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:45.786
BONNIE: Yay, Pikachu won!

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:50.423
CLEMONT:
That was a classic Ash win.

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.992
SAWYER:
Aegislash, take a good rest.

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:55.462
ASH: Come here, buddy!
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:57.164
ASH: You did it!

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.368
ANNOUNCER: That's two wins
in a row for Ash and Pikachu.

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.604
Three of Sawyer's Pokémon
have been defeated,

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:06.273
so it's time to
change the battlefield.

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:09.776
SAWYER: I can't believe you
ever would have used a tactic

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:12.212
like that in a million years.
I wouldn't have!

00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:14.314
ASH: Seriously?

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.183
SAWYER: 'Course not
ithout perfect timing and aim,

00:05:16.183 --> 00:05:18.218
that strategy never
would've worked!

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:20.887
ASH: That's 'cause ou.
You're the best!

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:21.955
PIKACHU: [PLEASED]
SAWYER: Wow...that's what it is.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.927
The total trust
between Ash and Pikachu.

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:29.496
That's why Ash is so strong.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.497
SAWYER: All right,
now why don't you show me

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.065
more of what you've got?

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:33.733
ASH: Sure!

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.502
ANNOUNCER: And now,

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.737
the battlefield we've prepared
for them is... Badlands!

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.641
REFEREE:
Please get your Pokémon ready!

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.109
ASH: Noivern! I choose you!

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:45.679
NOIVERN: [APPEARING]

00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:49.316
ANNOUNCER: Ash has sent Noivern
in as a substitute for Pikachu.

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:53.186
ASH: Show them how it's done!
NOIVERN: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.454
SAWYER: Salamence, let's go!

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:57.390
SALAMENCE: [APPEARING]

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:00.894
ANNOUNCER: Sawyer's fourth
Pokémon is Salamence!

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.864
Both Trainers have
chosen Dragon types!

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.767
POKEDEX:
Salamence. The Dragon Pokémon.

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:09.169
Constant dreams of flight

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.438
caused a shift in
its cellular structure.

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:14.541
When it evolved,
Salamence finally grew wings.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.744
ASH: So Shelgon evolved
into Salamence, huh? Great!

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:20.213
SAWYER: Thanks, Ash!
It's a lot stronger now, too.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.681
REFEREE: Battle begin!

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:23.850
ASH: Noivern, use Boomburst!

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.385
NOIVERN: [BOOMBURST MOVE]

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:26.753

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.933

ASH: Noivern, you okay?
NOIVERN: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:59.853
SAWYER: I can't afford to
lose one more time. Incinerate!

SALAMENCE: [INCINERATE MOVE]

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:06.826

SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE/
CHESPIN/DEDENNE: [GASPING]

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:18.204
CLEMONT: Salamence used
the flames from Incinerate

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:19.339
to lure Noivern in.

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:21.908
ASH: Noivern!
NOIVERN: [ACKNOWLEDGING]

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:24.010

I've been trying to catch
up to you this whole time...

00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:47.286
SAWYER: At first it
seemed so impossible...

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:48.654
so insurmountable.

00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:52.258

ASH: Scared of you, because you
were coming up on me so fast.

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:17.750
And then, suddenly,
you surpassed me.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.487

SHAUNA: Ash‐Greninja
keeps getting pushed back!

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:35.988
It can't seem to close the
gap between the two of them!

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:38.591

the power of Frenzy Plant?

Ash is one with
Greninja right now

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.602

all they've got!

power of two becoming one!

00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:56.008
As long as Ash
becomes one with Greninja,

00:17:57.343 --> 00:17:59.845
and as long as Greninja
becomes one with Ash,

00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:01.747
they'll always
be stronger for it!

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:03.149

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.073

That's that! It's decided!

00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:01.540

so great in that battle!

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:19.792
CLEMONT: Incredible!
That was a Pokémon battle.

00:19:21.227 --> 00:19:22.561

another big round of applause

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:25.431
for this stupendous battle!

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:31.270
ASH:
We really did it, Greninja!

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.171
GRENINJA: [AFFIRMATIVE]

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.542

The Twerp really pulled it off.

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:38.010

And we know what that means...

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.679

the whole enchilada!

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:40.379

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:44.383
That was truly an
indescribable match.

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:46.552
DIANTHA: The future is
bright for those two Trainers.

00:19:46.552 --> 00:19:48.988
It would make me very happy

00:19:48.988 --> 00:19:50.389
if there were more Trainers
just like them in the world!

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.225
SYCAMORE:
Yeah. I agree completely.

00:20:03.803 --> 00:20:04.870
SAWYER: I experienced
everything you had to give.

00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:08.908
It reminded me once again
why I admire you so much.

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:13.045
ASH: It was great, for sure.
You had me so super‐psyched.

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.747
I was having a ball!

00:20:14.747 --> 00:20:15.448
SAWYER:
Thanks for the kind words.

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:18.150
I'm gonna keep on
training and battling

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.052
and gaining lots of experience.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:23.823
And one day, I'm gonna
be even better than you!

00:20:23.823 --> 00:20:26.992
ASH: And don't forget I'm gonna
work harder and get stronger,

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:29.428
too! I'll never give up.
We'll battle again, right?

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:31.997
SAWYER: Battle again? RIGHT!

00:20:35.034 --> 00:20:37.269
NARRATOR: The fierce and
highly competitive match

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:39.905
between Ash and
Sawyer has come to an end.

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:42.975
Of course, both Trainers will
continue to gain more experience

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:46.011
and strength, along with the
promise to battle again one day.

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:48.447
But, for now,
the finals are up next,

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:50.182
with Alain as
our hero's opponent,

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:51.383
as the journey continues!
