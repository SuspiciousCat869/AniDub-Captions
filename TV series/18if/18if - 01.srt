others expected her to be,

328
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,041
the more she felt like
she was suffocating.

329
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,291
She went to sleep.

330
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,166
[HARUTO]
She went to sleep?

331
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,416
[LILY] All of the witches in the
dream world have been stricken

332
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,125
with Sleeping Beauty
Syndrome in the real world.

333
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,291
This is why the witch
must be defeated.

334
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,041
So she'll awaken from her sleep.

335
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,166
I don't understand!

336
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,666
[THE WITCH OF THUNDER laughs]

337
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,916
[HARUTO groans]

338
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,750
[THE WITCH OF THUNDER laughs]
Game set and match.

339
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,291
Ah, I feel better.

340
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,625
Who's the mightiest witch in
the whole world, my darlings?

341
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,666
[ALL]
The Witch of Thunder is!

342
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,666
Is this really what
you wanted to do?

343
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,958
What did you say?!

344
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,583
Your game. It's boring.

345
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:07,958
This is my world,

346
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,166
so I can do whatever I want
in it, you understand?!

347
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,500
As long as I'm having fun,
then everything's fine!

348
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,750
It's boring, and cold.

349
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,250
I don't know why you
wanna stay here.

350
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,958
[THE WITCH OF THUNDER]
How dare you?

351
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,166
[HARUTO] This is a pathetic
"dream world," if you ask me.

352
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,708
The whole thing seems
kinda thrown together.

353
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,041
[THE WITCH OF THUNDER]
Dreams are random!

354
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,750
There are still tons
of things I like here.

355
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,458
It doesn't matter!

356
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,500
But, you're still all alone.

357
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,166
[gasps] That's what I like!

358
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,875
And I'm not causing problems
for anyone, am I?

359
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,833
You don't know how tiring
it is to be the girl

360
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,875
everyone expects me to be.
I'm not allowed to fail!

361
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,625
It's too much pressure.

362
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,541
I really want to be spoiled.

363
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,583
To have my way, but I can't!

364
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,500
That's why I felt like there was
no choice but to bind myself.

365
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,291
At least I have some
control in this world.

366
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,041
I can do what I want
when I like!

367
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,166
[HARUTO] Is that everything
you've got to say?

368
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,625
[gasps]

369
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,166
Yeah? Then it's my turn now!

370
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,291
[gasps]

371
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,375
You're wasting your
life in here.

372
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,166
All this talk about
binding yourself

373
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,416
trying to make people
feel sorry for you!

374
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,791
You've got it all wrong.

375
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,083
That isn't the way BDSM
is supposed to work!

376
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,875
You don't know
anything about me!

377
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,416
Now shut your stupid mouth!

378
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,125
When you say it like that,
I believe you.

379
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,916
No one expects you
to be perfect.

380
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,416
It's okay to be
more laidback.

381
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,083
Believe me, it's a
lot less stressful

382
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,833
when you can just shrug it off.

383
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:38,000
It's easier that way. I know.

384
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,333
Laidback, huh?

385
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,958
I could never allow
myself to do that!

386
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,416
Don't be so hasty
to write it off.

387
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,875
Give it a try, and you'll
start feeling better.

388
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,083
[gasping]

389
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,583
First off,
we'll just skip school!

390
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,708
Does that sound good?

391
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,708
After that, we can go
do something fun.

392
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,291
Really?

393
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,875
Really.

394
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,000
I give you my word.

395
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,541
Now, open your eyes.

396
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,666
Oh, man. I didn't say anything

397
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,666
about making all of your
clothes disappear!

398
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,041
[gasps]

399
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,625
I'm very sorry.

400
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,041
It didn't hurt, did it?

401
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,708
It was a dream.
It didn't hurt at all.

402
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,708
I wish we'd met long ago.

403
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,541
[HARUTO]
You mind if I ask your name?

404
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,208
[YUKO]
Yuko Sakurabe.

405
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,791
[gasps]

406
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,666
Man. I had a dream I got eaten.

407
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,083
You did get eaten.
That's why.

408
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,291
So then, you did this?

409
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,458
I hope I wake up soon.
I've got things to do.

410
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,416
Yes, well. I'm thinking
more and more,

411
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,958
you're someone to
keep an eye on.

412
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,875
I guess. Lily showed up.

413
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,125
She did?!

414
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,500
It's the blue door!

415
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,750
Once you wake up, be sure
to swing by my laboratory!

416
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,791
There are still a great number
of matters for us to discuss!

417
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,708
Huh? Professor?

418
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,916
Well then. Back to sleep.

419
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,000
[LILY]
Follow your dream.

420
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,500
But will you follow it
all the way to the end?

421
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,541
Even if that end's
considered a taboo?

422
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,750
[EGOS]
Taboo, baa!

423
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:57,333
[LILY] The next dream is:
"Time Stopped at Age Twelve."
