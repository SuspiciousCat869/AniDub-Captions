[KANZAKI] So, basically, after
this Natsuki Kamikawa girl

153
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,416
attempted to commit suicide,

154
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,333
everybody in the group
that bullied her started

155
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,250
experiencing similar, recurring
nightmares, is that it?

156
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,791
But it doesn't stop with us.

157
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,500
The other students
who didn't bully her,

158
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,791
even our homeroom teacher,

159
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,250
they're all having
bad dreams, too.

160
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,791
[KANZAKI] And all these people's
nightmares are the same?

161
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,500
They vary a little,
depending on the person,

162
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,083
but everybody remembered
being chased by Natsuki,

or someone who looked like her.

164
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,791
I see, and what's
this Natsuki up to?

Would you say she seems
different than before?

Who knows?

167
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,083
She hasn't been back
to school since then.

168
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:07,041
Some people say she passed away,
and now she's haunting us.

169

170
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,291
[gasps]

171
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,250
[MOMOKA]
Miku!

172
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,666
Miku...

173
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,958
[cries]

174
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,791
Please, forgive us! Natsuki...

175
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,041
I want you to try
diving into the dream

176
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,791
of a local middle
school girl named Natsuki.

177
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,791
There's been a rash of
nightmares at the school,

178
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,750
recently. Starting with the
group of girls who bullied her.

179
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,083
If they're bullies,

180
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,541
it sounds like they're getting
what they deserve.

181
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,708
They aren't alone.

182
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,041
The nightmares have
begun spreading

183
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,666
like some kind of epidemic.

184
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,916
Which means there's a
chance the entire school

185
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,958
could be stricken with
Sleeping Beauty Syndrome.

186
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,708
You're positive this was the
way we were supposed to go?

187
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,583
Probably.

188
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,583
Probably-- Ah!

189
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,250
[HARUTO whimpers]

190
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:18,625
[KANZAKI]
That was a close one.

191
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,500
Watch out!

192
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,500
Hm? [screams]

193
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,541
Ah... Thanks for the save!

194
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,000
Maybe it's just me,

195
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,750
but we don't seem to be very
welcome around this place.

196
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,041
[BOTH]
Hm?

197
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,041
[HARUTO]
Ah! Run!

198
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:34,916
Hurry up!

199
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,166
I am hurrying!

200
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,125
[KANZAKI]
We should be safe here.

201
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,208
Man, that was close!

202
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,333
This is the place...

203
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,625
[NATSUKI] May calamity and ruin
fall upon Kasumi Fukumoto.

204
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,750
May calamity and ruin
fall upon Mei Asakura.

205
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,958
May calamity and ruin
fall upon Momoka Sakurai.

206
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,458
Excuse me.

207
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,583
Could we have a word with you?

208
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,416
[NATSUKI]
Who're you?

209
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,375
A friend.

210
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,083
My name's Haruto Tsukishiro.

211
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,750
And I'm Katsumi Kanzaki.

212
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,416
[NATSUKI]
You won't trick me.

213
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,125
You're really ghosts!

214
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,541
We are not ghosts!

215
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,083
[gasps]

216
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,541
We were hoping to ask
you to stop the curses.

217
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,625
At the rate you're going,
you're gonna spread curses

218
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,083
to the point that everyone
in town gets brought down.

219
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,166
"Gets brought down"?

220
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
So, that means my
curses are working.

221
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,000
[KANZAKI]
They are--

222
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,333
Then I'll curse them again!
Curse them to their graves!

223
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,333
All the damn bullies
around the world.

224
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,958
The ones who push things way too
far, and who prey on the "weak,"

225
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,625
even though those poor souls
have done nothing wrong.

226
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,166
This world is far better
off without them.

227
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,125
With all the bigotry
and scapegoating,

228
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,916
humanity has set
itself on a course

229
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,666
of continual conflict
and suffering.

230
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,708
Tell me what worth people
who perpetuate that have!

231
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,041
You don't understand,
it's affecting your classmates

232
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,375
that weren't even involved
in the bullying!

233
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,666
Involved? They're all guilty!

234
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,625
Those spineless fools
knew what was happening,

235
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,291
and pretended not
to see anything.

236
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,125
They deserve it!

237
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,666
She's got a point there.

238
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,875
Doing nothing only makes you
complicit in the bullying.

239
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,416
But still, who are you to decide
what other people are worth?

240
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,541
That's the mentality of a bully.

241
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,583
[NATSUKI]
Hm?

242
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,916
[HARUTO]
Think of yourself,

243
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,208
you have value that no one
can take away from you.

244
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,000
You don't know anything
about me, all right?

245
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,458
So you'd better watch
what you're saying!

246
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,833
You work hard, and when
you make a mistake,

247
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,000
it's difficult to let it go.

248
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,291
[gasps]

249
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,458
[HARUTO]
Must've been tough.

250
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,708
You stood out because you were
smart, as well as focused.

251
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,791
Every day, you always
gave everything 100%.

252
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,458
If you ask me,

253
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,500
I think that proves your worth.

254
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,916
You should be proud.

255
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,916
Oh. Really?

256
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,625
Not to mention there
are several people

257
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,541
terribly worried
about you, Natsuki.

258
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,083
People like your mother,

259
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,333
who sobbed and said she was
sorry for not noticing how much

260
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,791
you were suffering.

261
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,291
I spoke with Momoka as well,
who apologized profusely.

262
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,125
No way.

263
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,500
Thank you both.

264
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,833
Too bad. We're all out of time.

265
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,500
Goodbye.

266
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,958
[gasping] What the hell?

267
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,875
The invasion fleet
from Alpha Centauri

268
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,083
has finally come to Earth.

269
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,500
Humanity is finished
if nothing is done!

270
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,916
Well, then.

271
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,291
We'll have to resist the
invaders with our giant robot!

272
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,208
Your robot? Don't you mean
your space battleship?

273
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,583
Are you ready?

274
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,416
[gasps] Sure!

275
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,666
[KANZAKI]
Put them on the main monitor!

276
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,791

[NATSUKI, HARUTO]
Roger!

279
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,708
[KANZAKI] Pretty weak on
the cosplay front, Kanzaki.

280
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,000
Unit One, engage!

281
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,041
Unit Two, engage!

282
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,416
[HARUTO]
Huh?

283
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,083
Have fun out there, you two!

284
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,333
[gasps] Where'd she come from?

285
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,791

Emergency launch.

To avoid danger, please

00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:07,958
Time to link up!

Go, Giant Robot Natsuking!

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,416
What now?

297
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,958
Pretty cool name,
don't ya think?

298
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,458
Yeah, not too bad, I guess.

299
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,125
Go! Natsuking!

300
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,541
We'll start off by kicking
things into gear!

301
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,375
You've got it!

302
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,208
Here goes.

307
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,500
There are too many.

308
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,666
Ready up, finishing move time!

309
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,750
I can't wait!

310
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:21,833
Here we go!

311
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:26,250
[BOTH]
Activate! Eye-Beam Laser Cannon!

312
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,750
You've got a nice smile.

313
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,750
What? Where'd that come from?

314
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,416
Who knew? You're quite
the <i>otaku,</i> aren't you?

315
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,000
You seemed to be having a pretty
good time yourself, old man.

316
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,875
Uh! What was that?
The cat's the old one!

317
00:20:55,458 --> 00:21:00,166
You know, it's been way too
long since I had any fun.

318
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,708
I wish I could have met someone
like you earlier, before I died.

319
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,291
Before you died? [gasps]

320
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,333
This place isn't the afterlife.

321
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,708
You've got Sleeping Beauty
Syndrome, Natsuki.

322
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,916
Huh? "Sleeping Beauty
Syndrome"? What's that?

323
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,625
[HARUTO] It's the illness
that keeps people asleep.

324
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:22,083
Then, that means...
I must still be alive!

325
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,333
[HARUTO]
Mm-hm.

326
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,500
Oh, good. That means
I can get out of here!

327
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,291
That's all up to you,
from this point.

328
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,041
Are you prepared to face
the harshness of reality?

329
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,625
That's a choice you'll have
to make for yourself.

330
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,791
I am ready.

331
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,583
Thanks, Haruto.

332
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,708
And farewell.

333
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,083
[MIKU groans]
What do I do, Mei?

334
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,208
I can't go to school
like this, can I?

335
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,916
Uh! Don't ask me!

336
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,125
We're all getting flak
for picking on her!

337
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,291
Just leave me alone!

338
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,666
[phone vibrates]

339
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,583
[LILY] Imagine you were
a country's monarch.

340
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:52,000
Think. What would you want
to protect, and why?

341
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,000
[EGOS]
Think it over, baa!

342
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:58,166
[LILY] Next time's dream is:
"And Now There Are None..."
