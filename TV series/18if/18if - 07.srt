00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,583
Do we need special glasses to
see the tower, like an eclipse?

[YOSHITSUNE] No, the door

00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,791
[NENE]
Did you forget that?!

327
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,916
[YOSHITSUNE] Pot, he--
He died because of me.

328
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,916
I will never forget that!

329
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,125
There's no way I ever could!

330
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,708
[HARUTO gasps]

331
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,375
What happened?

332
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,208
This is the end. I think?

333
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,041
[YOSHITSUNE]
Nene?

334
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,916
Nene!

335
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,958
Nene! Nene?

336
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,291
Uh?

[POL cries]

339
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,833
[YOSHITSUNE cries]
Pot...

340
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,708
[HARUTO]
I can't see anything.

341
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,541
--[crash]
--[HARUTO groans]

342
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:05,750
Wait. Was this all right?

343
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,833
As long as the witch
wakes up, it is.

344
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:12,083
[BOY 7A] Extra! Extra!
Extra! Extra edition!

345
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,625
Extra!

346

[NURSE 7A] Don't run around
in the halls of the hospital!

347
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,958
[NARRATOR 7A] The woodsman
continued to work diligently,

348
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,500
never losing heart.

349
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,250
However, the sharp blade
of the axe cut through

350
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,333
the woodsman's body,
slicing him cleanly in half.

351
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:28,125
In exchange for a
completely tin body,

352
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,166
the human heart of
the woodsman was lost...

353
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,166
Tin man.

354
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,458
[NARRATOR 7A] ...his ability
to love went with it.

355

[LILY] If all the sounds
vanished from the world,

356
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,708
we'd be okay, 'cause we
could still rock and roll!

357
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,875
[EGOS]
You bet, baa!

358

[LILY]
Next time's dream: "THRESHOLD."
