Okay, we already know

I'll go do some research.

39
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,708
Once I've accessed the database,

40
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,458
we should have plenty of
information to work with.

But listen up.

I'll try to phrase
this very plainly.

43
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,666
She's still a witch. Your love
isn't going anywhere.

Mm...

48

[KANZAKI] Mirei Saegusa.
Eighteen. Figure Skater.

49
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,375
At the age of three, her
grandfather took her

50
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,541
to a local ice rink,
introducing her to skating.

51
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,791
She picks up spins and jumps
by watching other skaters,

52
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,208
and is scouted out by a coach

53
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,416
from a skating
school in no time.

54
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,041
She then becomes a household
name by coming in first

55
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,541
in the All-Japan Championship
at the tender age of 14.

56
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,041
From this point on,
she's a domestic superstar.

57
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,250
With her rich expressiveness
and technical prowess,

58
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,583
she takes the skating
world by storm.

59
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,500
Couple that with her
endearing good looks,

60
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,875
and you have a national idol.

61
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,375
As the obvious favorite
for the upcoming Olympics,

62
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,166
her fame swells
like never before.

63
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,666
In her last appearance at
the world championships,

64
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,833
she messed up a triple
jump and fell,

65
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,958
which put her in second place.

66
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,708
Shortly after, for unknown
reasons, she came down

67
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:41,458
with Sleeping Beauty Syndrome
and fell into a coma.

68
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,625

In her last competition

Affairs windows at once.

[MIREI] Excuse me.
My name is Mirei Saegusa.

160
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,375
I was just paged?

161
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,291
You said a family
member was here?

162
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:44,416
What?! No way! It was you?

163
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,750
[gasps]

164
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,833
Wow, I'm glad I thought to
have you paged, because you

165
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,000
have a completely different
image going on this time.

166
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't take this the wrong way,
but have we met before?

167
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,791
No, you and I have
never met in person,

168
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,083
but your look has
totally changed

169
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,291
since you were a
celebrity, you know?

[HARUTO]
Huh?

172
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,708
Hey! Hold on! Wait a second!

173
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,291
I'm never going back!

174
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,916
Just who are you, anyway?!
What do you want?!

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,083
And why do you insist on
barging into my life?!

176
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,375
[HARUTO] You're the one
who called me here.

177
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,250
You came to me because
you needed help.

178
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,750
I don't know what you're saying.

179
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,333
I just want to enjoy my
new, ordinary life!

180
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,083
Why would I want any help?

181
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,250
Now let go.

Are you really happy here?

183
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,041
That's my business, and it
has nothing to do with you!

184
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,583
[HARUTO]
It's just a regular college.

185

[gasps]

186
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,375
I guess you don't understand.

How could you?

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No. No one can understand.

189
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,958
Look, my mind's already made up.

190
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,083
I'm living a different
life from now on.

191
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,000
[MIREI] As far back as
I can really remember,

192
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,625
I've been out on the ice.

193
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,416
Five AM, every day, running 10K.

194
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,833
After school, skating at
the rink until closing time,

195
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,500
then gym work and stretching
until bedtime.

196
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,666
There was never any
time for field days.

197
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,500
No culture festivals.

198
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,500
I really missed going on field
trips with the other students.

199
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,875
I ate countless meals
in a moving vehicle,

200
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,833
and on my days off,
I spent 20 hours in the rink.

201
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,833
Have you ever been so
exhausted from training

202
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,583
that you fell asleep
right on the ice?

203

209
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,791
But you started skating
'cause you liked it.

210
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,500
I still do. Even now.

211
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,875
Yeah?

212
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,875
I never thought the practices
were too strenuous.

213
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,625
But then, it wasn't about
a gold medal for me,

214
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,458
or about being a star.

215
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,583
That didn't matter.

216
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:33,083
I just... I just wanted
to have a normal life.

217
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,833
A normal life? Like what?

218
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,000
[MIREI]
When I was younger,

219
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,791
I was happy just to hit
the ice and skate.

220
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,000
I wasn't anxious about anything.

221
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,208
As long as I was out on the ice,
I could be myself.

222
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,416
Then, some publicists decided
I needed more exposure.

223
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,041
Before I knew it,
I'd become an idol.

224
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,125
I hated it.

225
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,875
It wasn't what I wanted
my life to be.

226
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,125
And I realized I had
lost sight of myself.

227
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,041
Look, I totally understand
what you're saying,

228
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,916
but you're not missing much!

229
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,416
And I'll be the first to tell
you, a comfortable, normal life

230
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,041
is nothing to write home about.

231
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,333
If I had talents
like yours, I'd--

I want the experiences
other girls my age

were able to have
that I missed out on!

236
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,666
And I don't think wanting
that is asking too much!

time with you.

316
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,791
[YUKI]
It doesn't have to end here.

317
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,541
Do you still have some time?

318
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,625
[MIREI]
Huh?

319
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,541
[YUKI]
'Cause, there's one more place

320
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,333
I'd really like to take you.

321
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,416
Okay. Sure.

322
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,125
I'm glad. I like you.

323
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,125
I want to get to
know you even better.

324
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,500
[gasps] Likewise.

325
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,083
Why here?

326

[ice skates scraping]

327
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,791
[YUKI grunts] What's wrong?
Haven't skated before?

328
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,916
No, I wouldn't say that.

329
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,541
Then let's go. Take my hand.

[gasps]

332
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:09,166
[MIREI] It's strange. I can't
believe how "right" this feels!

333
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,291
[MIREI laughs]
This sensation!

334
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:31,833
[MIREI gasps]
Oh, uh. Sorry.

335
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,291
That was amazing.

336
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:37,041
You looked so self-assured
and beautiful.

337
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,750
Yuki...

Where did he go?

341
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,375
Come back to us, Mirei!

342
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,083
You owe it to yourself to try!

[gasps]

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,666
Now, skate your heart out!

Go, Saegusa!

[YUKI]
Come on. Skate, Mirei.

349
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:19,166
After all, this is exactly
where you belong.

350
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,000
[MIREI]
No, stop.

351
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,250
Please don't!

No!

[HARUTO]
Like I tried to tell you,

354
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,416
a "normal" life
isn't always easy.

355
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,750
[MIREI] But why?
This is my dream, isn't it?

356
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,666
How could something
like this have happened?

357
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,125
I don't know.

358
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,416
It was all going really well
there for a little while.

359
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,000
But in the end,

360
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,041
it might just be your destiny to
be out there in the spotlight.

361
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,791
Right. Fate.

362
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,500
[HARUTO] It's the one place
you can really be yourself.

You see?

[MIREI]
Yes.

365
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:04,791
In the long run, this is the
only path I have, isn't it?

00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,916
[YUKI]
That's right, Mirei.

Gliding gracefully
across the ice

368

is where you shine
your brightest.

369
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,750
Keep on skating.
You were meant to be a star.

370
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,333
You were born to it.

371
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,416
That's destiny.

[HARUTO gasping]

I guess I'll be going then.

Maybe I'll even get
to see you skate

It's gonna be all right.

00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,791
Knowing you, you're strong
enough to bounce back.

Miss Saegusa, can
you understand me?

[gasps] Doctor! Doctor!

[KANZAKI] What do you think?
Did she seem happy?

384
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,750
Yeah. Sure.

385
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,708
It looked like she'd
gotten over it.

[KANZAKI]
I see.

387
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,958
[HARUTO]
Also, I could sense something

388
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,791
when I was looking at her.

389
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,666
Something... inescapable.

390
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,208
And, I've been carrying
it around with me

391

this whole time without
ever realizing it...

392

[KANZAKI]
And, what would that be?

393

No idea.

Hm? Again?
