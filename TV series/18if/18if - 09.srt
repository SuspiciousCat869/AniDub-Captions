[WITCH 9A]
You disappoint me.

325
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,916
I had high hopes for your
future at our academy.

326
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,125
Then, you disrespected
me with your betrayal.

Haruto... Tsukishiro.

[WITCH 9A] Yes. Now I see
your true form, Haruto.

[TAMAKI]
What'll we do, ma'am?

333

You said that no men are allowed
in the Nightmare Idol School!

Yes, that was the rule.

waiting for, my Lady!

You're asking me to
punish a man while

339
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,250
in the body of a
sweet little girl?

I couldn't think of
a hotter scenario!

341

I should be able to
snag some nice footage!

My style of play
is pretty severe,

but the punishment
must fit the crime!

from your techniques.

Like the name of the

for the Nguyen
dynasty of Vietnam!

aren't around to interfere,

What do you mean?

[WITCH 9A]
I mean what I said.

400
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,583
I came to this world,
and every single thing

started going my way.

402
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,875
So, I thought I'd get a little
payback on all of those people

But it seems that in the end,

I was the one who ended up
losing, and so I ran away.

I became a loser,
even in my dream.

But the you that exists
back in the real world

isn't a loser any
way you slice it.

I use a toilet,
like everyone else,

because they have a dream.

Those eyes of yours.

something inside me

for a long time.
