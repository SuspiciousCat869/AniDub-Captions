hear what I say.

160
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,083
I think I'm starting
to understand.

161
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,375
You've experienced it for
yourself in this world,

162
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,791
haven't you?

163
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,333
In what world? It wasn't here.

164
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,958
It was here.

165
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,000
[gasps]

166
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,625
You couldn't hear her.

167
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,083
You couldn't tune into
her sound, could you?

168
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,541
I called out to you
with my other voice.

169
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,916
A voice from another you?

170
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,708
You mean her?

171
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,500
You can have everything
you could ever want

172
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,416
here in the dream world. So why?

173
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,416
I already told you,
we each assume

174
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,791
whatever forms we wish
here in the dream world.

175
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,166
That's what this is about?
None of that seems right to me.

176
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,750
I wanna hear everything
you've got,

177
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,583
and continue to do my best to
help others when they need me!

178
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,250
Yes. Talking with you has
already helped me plenty.

179
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:09,458
And probably not just me,
but others, I'd imagine.

180
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,791
However, I think I know
who you're really helping.

181
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,541
That would be yourself,
wouldn't it?

182
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,583
Do what? Help myself?

183
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,666
Right. I think
it's pretty clear.

184
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,125
You came trying to help me,

185
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,208
because you're really
helping yourself, aren't you?

186
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,500
You didn't come here
because you needed help...

187
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,125
...but rather, you gave it.

188
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,416
[HARUTO] So, I'm helping you
because I want to help myself?

189
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,125
That's strange. I've never
even thought of that.

190
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,958
[HARUTO] But I have no control
over the things that happen.

191
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,958
There isn't any way
to help myself.

192
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,583
And that's why you
help others, isn't it?

193
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,375
--Huh?
--Huh?

194
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,416
Up to and including
this moment,

195
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,625
a number of people have
needed your help,

196
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,458
and have approached you for it.

197
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,541
It all makes sense, really.

198
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,041
You naturally attract them.

199
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,916
I do?

200
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,750
[WITCH 8A]
Where others refused to listen,

201
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,416
you took what they said
and accepted it.

202
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,000
[WITCH 8B] However, you refuse
to accept the positive aspects.

203
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,791
Which means you can't hear
the things that would

204
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,208
give you courage, or maybe
even cheer you up.

205
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,416
Wait, are you implying

206
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,875
that I can't hear when
others cheer me on?

207
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,166
Come on now,
that can't be right!

208
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,708
I've heard them thank me.

209
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:27,041
And yet somehow, you're thinking
"poor little me," don't you?

210
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,166
Self-deprecation?

211
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,458
Because I won't accept
unearned praise?

212
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,708
You were surprised when you
learned that I was in a band,

213
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,791
even though I was deaf,
weren't you?

214
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,458
Well, to be honest...

215
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,625
Still, I want to get
out there and sing!

216
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,750
I want to be an actress, too.

217
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,125
And to walk the runway!

218
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,625
If you heard that
for the first time,

219
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,583
would you still laugh it off
and give me the old

220
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,666
"that dream isn't possible
for you" nonsense?

221
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,541
[WITCH 8A]
You couldn't do that, could you?

222
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,958
You've seen for yourself.

223
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:20,250
You know that this dream
isn't impossible for me.

224
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,625
It's not as if everyone

225
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,250
has to follow the same path
in life as each other.

226
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,000
But if you can
understand an inkling

227
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,833
of the ideas I've been
sharing, then I'll be glad.

228
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,208
I'd also be glad if the
anime and movies I love

229
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,583
had closed captions.

230
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,083
[WITCH 8A]
Mm-hm.

231
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,625
You'd be glad?

Mm!

Mm-hm!

By learning about the uniqueness
of another person...

235
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:46,083
By changing your point of view
just the slightest bit,

236
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,833
your feelings toward that person
allow for a closer connection.

Getting to know one another,

without judgment, for their
inner voice to speak.

239

All it takes is opening up
the doorway to your heart

00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,375
just a little bit wider,
and you change.

[HARUTO gasping]

She certainly was a preachy
little thing, wasn't she?

255
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,583
Whether you took the things she
said as overly preachy or not,

256
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,125
surely would depend on how
wide you open the doorway

to your heart. Makes sense,
now doesn't it?

[KANZAKI]
According to the research

259
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,500
of American psychologist
Doctor Albert Mehrabian,

260
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,958
the input we receive from
communication with others

261
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:02,666
is 55% based on
facial expressions.

262
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,458
Whereas vocal pitch,
volume, and tempo affect 38%.

263
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,166
While the actual meaning of
the words that are spoken

264
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,708
accounts for a mere
7% of the total.

265
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,083
Huh. The words mean that little?

266
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,958
It's not just the words we use.

267
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,250
We need to acknowledge the
importance of various forms

268
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,875
of communication
that connect us all.

269
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,500
[MARI] Like how they say a
person's innermost feelings

270
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,458
are directly reproduced
in the range

271
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:31,583
of an analog record
that people can't hear.

272
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,375
I've been wanting to ask.
What are you doing?

273
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,708
And why'd you bring
a guitar in here?

274
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,125
I went to a live music venue
for the first time in a while,

275
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,208
and it gave me the urge to play.

276
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,250
Geez, turn the sound off
while you're tuning!

277
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:55,291
But I can't tune it unless
I make it make some noise!

278
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,041
It's not until a person's
heart produces the sound

279
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,708
of their actions that they can
start tuning themselves.

280
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:05,458
But still, you have to cut out
the sounds that interfere.
