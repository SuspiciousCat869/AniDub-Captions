Massive white

and the sky grows ominous.

of the dream world.

What's Haruto's status?

His status?

Would you please repeat back
what you were just saying?

Tell Haruto. It's time
that he knew the truth.

He's in a coma. They've been

there was an accident

Almost like he was hibernating.

that accident was.

Do you remember what
happened to you, Haruto?

I don't.

It's not important.
You're different from the rest.

Time doesn't move for you.

Since time's flow was
stopped by your accident,

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
your consciousness was
caught in an unending loop

here in the dream world.

It was the same for Eve.

50
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,583
She kept repeating the regret
she had for eating from the

I don't care why I'm
caught up in this.

Look, for now, we should
just focus on stopping Eve.

Or else everyone's gonna die!

That's why killing Eve
is our only option.

Yeah? Then why don't you do it?

You're the one who knows
Eve best, after all.

Because. I'm Eve.

59
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,916
Beyond this door,
lies the corrupted Eve.

60

Wait a second.
You said you're Eve?

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,958
I'm the other Eve.

of the Tree of Knowledge.

The Eve that first
received God's blessing,

and laughed in the
Garden beside Adam.

Will I be able to wake up?

not dead. So, what am I, huh?

very different.

You should realize by now,

that I can see through
everything you're thinking.

I've held this
grudge for so long.

The only thing I yearn for is
the destruction of this world

No need to fight. You're both
aspects of Eve, right?

Each one of us owes Haruto
for saving us from our dreams.

for needing a man to save you.

You fools. Has no one
told you that according

107

to the grand design set by God,

00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,625
women are meant to submit to men
in everything we do in life.

the course of our chat!

119
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,708
For Yurina and me, our
popularity is largely dependent

120
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,583
on how well we can juggle being
coy yet still approachable,

121

and getting the
men's blood pumping.

122
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,458
I get the lyrics to a
new song, and think,

"Whoa! Is this really the stuff

What's with all the names?

Listen, Evette: that whole
women-obeying-men concept

138

is decades
behind the times.

139
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,916
These days, women make the
decisions about everything.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,916
And the men now are more
like servants with benefits.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,333
Bingo.

142
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:20,083
Oh! Then there's some kind
of gap between God's will,

143
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,583
and those of the
human world?

144

She's plotting to destroy
the world. Don't get too chummy.

She's saying we should
at least hear her out.

What, like have a discussion?

147

leaving it to the witches?

watch from over there, okay?

prepare some tea?

Having any sort of stance

But, the whole concept,
of women obeying men.

To understand the
root causation,

we must go back to when I
was tempted by the snake.

Of course, since Evie-pie was

For your failings,

God considered you a
fool from that time on.

Yes. And thus, humans were
henceforth burdened

with pain and suffering
due to my mistake.

But this penance
must come to an end!

I felt the same way when
I was being bullied at school.

213
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,666
But the way things
ended was my fault.

I felt so lost and confused.

You were tricked, sleepy head.
The snake is the one at fault.

But you know, it was all because
of my actions and transgressions

that women have come to bear
pain and suffering in this life.

313
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,833
Instead he always
stayed by our side.

314
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,958
[JANE] That's why we're
all here before you now,

315
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,500
getting to know you.

316
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,125
Eve's heart is
slowly calming down.

317
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,750
You can tell?
Because you're Eve too, right?

318
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,500
Yes.

319
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,625
Evelyn, we keep
talking about men,

320
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,458
but they're all scumbags.

321
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,333
And so immature.
I totally get it.

322
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,208
When I was young, there were
men I'd go out with

323
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,208
to pay for my meal. Then I had
a whole slew of other guys

324
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,000
if I ever needed a
ride somewhere.

325
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:22,125
You had it all figured out!
One day, I'd like to try it too!

326
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,541
[BOTH gasp]

327
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,458
That's not the sort of
person you are, Yuko.

328
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,666
[EVE] I can actually
relax around you all.

329
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,500
Now that I think about it,

330
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,875
ever since I was
thrown out of Eden.

331
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,375
I just followed along with Adam,

332
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,416
and never had any place
where I could just be myself.

333
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,916
[KANZAKI]
What's going on now?

334
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,875
It's fine. Eve's calmed
down at the very least.

335
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,208
Would you care for a piece
of cake? It's quite tasty.

336
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,291
She'll know for sure
when she tries some!

337
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,916
Ahh!

338
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,250
[EVE grunts]

339
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,250
[ALL]
Ahh!

340
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,375
Ahh!

341
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,666
So, what do you think?
It's good, isn't it?

342
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,125
Yes. Very good.

343
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,083
Delicious food always helps
make people happier.

344
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,125
You were so angry, you probably
wouldn't even have been able

345
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,833
to taste the cake!

346
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,666
"Your perspective has changed."
That's what she said.

347
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,083
[EVE]
I see.

348
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,833
I have an idea! Let's keep
that power in reserve!

349
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,083
The future's unknown.

350
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,791
There may be many more
things you don't think

351
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,375
you'll be able to bear.

352
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,541
If you have to smash things to
get through it all, go for it!

353
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,458
I'd be glad to help you out!

354
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,208
[JANE] Everybody has times where
they've got to scream, right?

355
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,500
[NATSUKI] Going crazy right
after waking up, though.

356
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,041
That seems like such a waste.

357
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,291
[MIREI] So learn about this
world first, and then go crazy?

358
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,958
Is that what you meant?

359
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,333
Very well. I will learn
about your world.

360
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,791
What makes life worth living,
and what brings you joy.

361
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,375
Great! Want to go get
some kind of food?

362
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,375
Let's hit up an
all-you-can-eat place!

363
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,750
With karaoke!

364
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,708
And we can sing a
medley of my songs!

365
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,291
It's been a while,

366
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,875
but I have the desire to start
skating again! If I'm in here.

367
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,583
my legs are strong,
and they'll still let me jump!

368
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,333
We could open up a banking
account for you!

369
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,583
It's also fun to take a
leisurely walk now and then!

370
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:19,083
That's right. Just try it all.

371
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,625
[EVE]
I will.

372
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:25,125
[breathes deeply]

373
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,875
Are you feeling better now?

374
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,625
[EVE]
It's still too soon.

375
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,666
Perhaps, but don't you
feel like the whole thing's

376
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,416
become kind of silly?

377
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,791
[EVE]
Well. I suppose.

378
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:56,000
They're gone. So does that
mean the girls were successful?

379
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,541
Eve.

380
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,125
Lily.

381
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,083
You and I are connected.
We are one.

382
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,625
I know.

383
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,458
[EVE] Even in a place like this,
humans will continue finding

384
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,833
new ways to keep growing.

385
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,458
They worry, and from time
to time, they will fail.

386
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,416
And those failures
can lead to tragedy.

387
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,000
However, humans somehow
keep moving forward.

388
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,541
[LILY]
Yes.

389
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,208
Now. I have much to learn from
you and I hope you'll teach

390
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,791
me how we can be custodians
of this world together.

391
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,458
I want you to teach
me about the world

392
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,708
and the people you've seen.
While I was blinded by hatred,

393
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:39,916
you were learning, you were
living on. As things stand now,

394
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
my resolve is wavering from
what the witches told me.

395
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,541
And that's all right.

396
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,833
Humans have spent
centuries in uncertainty.

397
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,791
Wavering is what they do best.

398
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,708
[EVE] Adam and Eve.
We were the original humans.

399
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,166
Perhaps faltering is a
manifestation of that humanity?

400
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,166
As is the you right now.

401
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,666
[LILY] On the other
side of that door...

402
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,333
...lies a world that humans
can't begin to imagine.

403
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,666
Somewhere that transcends
time and space as you know it.

404
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,208
God's domain.

405
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,250
[EVE, LILY]
Brother. You must kill Eve.

406
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,625
Still, after all that? And how
can you be so relaxed about it?

407
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,291
There's no way I can kill Eve!

408
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,166
[YURINA] You just have to do
it again. What you did to me.

409
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,250
It can't be!

410
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,041
She just did it
with Lily, didn't she?

411
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,500
Yeah, but she did it to herself,
so that's technically different.

412
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,333
Tarnish Eve's purity.

413
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,416
If you do that, you'll transform
Eve into a normal girl.

414
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,541
Not a goddess, but a human.

415
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,875
Hold on a sec.

416
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,333
What's wrong?

417
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,000
I get it. It's hard 'cause
everyone's watching, right?

418
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,208
That isn't it.
Lily's wish will come true.

419
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,666
Eve's anger also seems to have
calmed down thanks to all

420
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,500
the work you girls have done.

421
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,375
Yes? What else?

422
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,958
Well then, what about me?

423
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,625
Is there any way for me to wake
up and return to the real world?

424
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,500
Or can I go through that door,
and see what lies beyond?

425
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,041
Think about what you're saying!

426
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,000
You finally
found yourself, Haruto!

427
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,833
I want this dream
to come to an end.

428
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,458
On the other side of that door,

429
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,916
is a dimension beyond the
breadth of human imagination.

430
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
[WITCH OF GLUTTONY] What're you
gonna do on the other side?

431
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,958
I want to see what's there.

432
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,375
I've been dreaming this
entire time anyway, so,

433
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,541
If that's to be my life,

434
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,250
I want to go to a
different dream world.

435
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,625
[MANA] She never said
it was a dream world.

436
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:36,500
[HARUTO] It's all right.
Thank you all. Now, then.

437
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,791
As for Eve,
I'll do something.

438
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,041
[EVE, LILY]
What something?

439
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,666
I'll go across with you.

440
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,916
[EVE, LILY]
You're coming with me? Really?

441
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,416
Well, it's something
only I can do, isn't it?

442
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,041
[EVE, LILY]
Indeed.

443
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,458
[YUKO] Just like that? You're
going to go through with her?

444
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,125
[HARUTO]
I finally know where I am now.

445
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,333
So I can come back anytime.

446
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,375
That's what I'd like
to think, anyway.

447
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:08,125
And if you can, come visit
me from time to time.

448
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,125
I'd be glad to.

449
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,291
Farewell! I'll miss
working with you.

450
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,958
Hey, whenever you come back,

451
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,000
you'll have to tell me
all about the other side.

452
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,708
Ha. See ya.

453
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,250
And then he was gone.

454
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,375
Have a nice trip.

455
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:43,166
[EKG beeps]

456
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,000
[KANZAKI] Man. I still
haven't heard anything.

457
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,583
Did you check from inside
the dream world?

458
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,958
[KANZAKI] I did, but I
wasn't able to go to

459
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,041
Haruto's room anymore.

460
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,833
I can't seem to
find him anywhere.

461
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,625
[YURINA] So do you want
to know what I think?

462
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,250
You've got a theory?

463
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,125
Since there was an Eve,
it makes sense that there

464
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,625
would be an Adam, too.
What about Haruto?

465
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,250
