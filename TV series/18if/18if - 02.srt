I recently met someone.

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,541
I think they might be able
to help me wake you up.

19
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,875
[NEWSCASTER] The victim was from
a group of juvenile criminals

20
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,625
responsible for a number
of murders a decade ago.

21
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,708
At 16 years old,
he was charged as a minor.

22
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,416
According to files, the boys
broke into a family's house

23
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,708
in the evening,
catching them by surprise.

24
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,041
Then they killed the parents
and the eldest daughter,

25
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,375
leaving only the youngest
daughter alive.

26
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,583
Interestingly enough, the
youngest daughter who survived

27
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,041
is currently afflicted with
Sleeping Beauty Syndrome,

28
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,083
and remains comatose
in a hospital.

29
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:51,625
A very sad close to
a horrifying story.

30
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,833
Oh, man. What was
with that dream?

31
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,125
Well, it's official.

32
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,125
A witch killed someone
in the real world.

33
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,833
What are--? What are
you talking about?

34
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,500
That dream you just woke
up from, the bloody one.

35
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,666
Well, it left a corpse
in the waking world.

36
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,958
From my dream?
How do you know about that?

37
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,083
Don't worry.

38
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,458
How can I not?

39
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,291
It's all right, just listen.

40
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,625
She's killed one,
just two to go.

41
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,750
She'll kill them just like
you saw in your dream.

You'll see.

What do you mean?

44
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,333
It all happened 10 years ago.

45
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,041
[KANZAKI]
There was a family that had been

46
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,375
brutally murdered in their home.

47
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,291
The victims were
the father, the mother,

48
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,000
and the oldest daughter,
aged 15.

49
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,166
Her younger sister,
who was 12 at the time,

50
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,083
hid motionless in the closet,
surviving unnoticed.

51
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:51,458
But she saw everything
that happened.

52
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,791
The culprits were arrested based
on the young girl's testimony,

53
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,208
but all three were 16 at
the time of the murders,

54
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,750
and were sentenced as minors.

55
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,083
They weren't acquainted
with the victims at all.

56
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,791
Their motive was simply
to shock the world

57
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,416
with the sheer brutality
of the scene.

58
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,208
Every bone in the father's
body was broken,

59
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,375
the mother had been
hacked apart by a knife,

60
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,500
the daughter's neck was--

61
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,500
Stop! I don't want
to imagine anymore.

62
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,875
I haven't even gotten
into all the gory details.

63
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,666
I've still heard enough.

64
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,083
It was all just a game
to them, you see.

65
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,791
They tried to make it look
as if they were killed

66
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,083
because of a grudge.

67
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,541
And in their wake,
they left behind

68
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,333
a horrific locked-room
murder mystery

69
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,541
for the entire world to solve.

70
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,166
I remember.
I saw it on the news.

71
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,833
The boys' parents were shocked.

72
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,500
They'd always been well-behaved
at home and model students

73
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,083
at school. They got good grades.

74
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,000
The ringleader didn't
kill anyone himself,

75
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,375
but came up with the scenario
for this twisted game,

76
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,416
told the other boys what
to do at the crime scene.

77
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,416
Two years ago, the three young
men reentered society.

78
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,291
So, tell me, who was
killed this time?

79
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,958
[KANZAKI] None other
than one of the killers.

80
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,208
He was found mutilated
inside a locked room.

81
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,250
[HARUTO]
A locked-room murder?

82
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,666
[KANZAKI] He was killed in the
exact same manner as the mother.

83
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,000
There are two more of
those boys still out there.

84
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,250
They will, without a doubt,
also be targeted.

85
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,041
[HARUTO] So then,
I'm guessing that the culprit

86
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,000
is the younger
sister in the coma?

87
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,166
I deduced the same
from the given facts.

88
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,250
Then wouldn't it be faster if
we tried waking up the girl?

89
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,166
Unfortunately, Sleeping
Beauty Syndrome

90
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,625
is more complicated than that.

91
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,250
Then it's almost like
she's already dead.

92
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,583
The poor girl's heart has been

93
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,875
completely closed
off from reality.

94
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,583
Until now, at least,
since you were able

95
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,166
to share the witch's dream.

96
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,125
That's the one lead we have
to solving this crime.

97
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:40,000
If anyone can reach the witch,
it'll be someone like you.

98
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,083
But the witch's dream...
How was I able to see it?

99
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,333
[KANZAKI]
I'd be willing to assume

100
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,333
that Lily is the key
to that quandary.

101
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,833
I'm just wondering,
what this is all about?

102
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,875
Why are you trying
so hard, anyway, huh?

103
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,083
This has nothing to do with you.

104
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,666
[KANZAKI]
That's where you're wrong.

105
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,208
It can't be just because
of your research.

106
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,166
My little sister has it--
Sleeping Beauty Syndrome.

107

Here's a communicator.

with you here in

You got a plan?

[KANZAKI]
In the real world,

113
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,958
I'll try to make contact with
the remaining two boys,

114
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,416
and take measures
against the witch.

115
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,791

You'll be in the dream world,

from killing anyone.

Hey.

[KANZAKI]
Hm?

00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,708
If the witch kills someone in
a dream and it becomes real,

120
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,875
would she be charged
for any wrongdoing?

121
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,875
[KANZAKI]
That is not the issue here.

122
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,250
Even if it's for vengeance,

123
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,416
I cannot in good conscience
let a murder happen.

124
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,583
That's the true essence of
morality, wouldn't you agree?

I'm counting on you.

00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,541
[HARUTO] What does it
mean to have morals?

I'd hurry and take those.

You'll be killed if you
fall asleep, after all.

You know something, don't you?

I don't care what kind
of scumbags you are,

or whether or not you've
been rehabilitated.

That's not my concern.

But even if you are two heaping

if I know that there'll
be a murder,

then the moral thing to do
would be to try and stop it.

It's very dark, bloody.

I think this is the scene
of the murders.

159
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,541
[HIMURO]
Colleague?

160
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,250
He's working on finding the
killer so you boys can be safe.

161
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,916
What are you, some kinda
policeman or somethin'?

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,375
The majority of
my detective work

163
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,541
has been spent
focusing on dreams.

164
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,416
Let me guess, you hear
voices, don't you?

165
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
You want some help with
your nightmares, right?

166
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,125
Tell me about them.

167
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:45,916
[gasps] Like I said, it's the
exact same nightmare every day.

168
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,500
For me, too.

169
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,416
It's always a pair of
red shoes. High heels.

170
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,541
[HIMURO] Same with my dream,
and they keep coming after me.

171
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:58,666
[ETO] And in the end...
I always get strangled.

172
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,041
[KANZAKI]
And you?

173
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,791
My bones get broken, slow.

174
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:06,166
When I can't move anymore,
my body gets chopped to pieces.

175
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,791
And this is every night?

176
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,291
Yeah, every night.

177
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,208
That's the reason why I've
been trying to stay awake

178
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,875
as much as possible.

179
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,791
[KANZAKI]
Hence the pills, yes?

180
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,208
Saeki was killed in
his sleep, wasn't he?

181
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:21,208
That appears to be the case,
but I do have a hypothesis.

182
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,416
It looks like the dream
linked to reality

183
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,375
resulting in a
locked-room murder.

184
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,208
It's almost as if the
witch was doing to you

185
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,208
what you fellows tried to do
to that family a decade ago.

186
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,500
[HIMURO]
You see?

187
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,125
[grunting]

188
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,208
Don't fall asleep!

189
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,041
Aw, just a bit.
Five minutes. Please?

190
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,208
[KANZAKI]
No. No sleep for you.

191
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,041
[ETO] Who the hell do
you think you are?!

192
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,916
[KANZAKI]
Listen to your friend.

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,166
The only way to escape
the witch is to stay awake.

194
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,416
Once you fall asleep, the
nightmare will become reality.

195
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
[HIMURO]
Just deal with it.

196
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,250
[ETO]
I'm at my freakin' limit, here!

197
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,791
It's all your fault things
turned out like this!

198
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,541
[HIMURO]
What are you afraid?

199
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,708
[ETO]
Damn right! Why? Are you not?!

200
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,416
I think I'd like
to meet this witch

201
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,208
the old-timer keeps
yakking about.

202
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,500
Might let myself
sleep to do that.

203
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,875
Okay. I've got an idea.

204
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,791
We go to sleep, and with you
and me in there together,

205
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,500
we can kill the witch ourselves.

206
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,416
Wait!

207
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,125
I can't stay awake any longer!

208
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,250
Is it really okay
just to leave him?

209
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,583
His idea isn't awful.

210
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,750
We can set our own trap
for the witch.

211
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,291
You sure-- [gasps]

00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,291
I came to meet you.

00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,375
I had a dream that
you killed that guy.

216
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,916
I wish I had made him
suffer even more.

217
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,208
[MANA] Mom's throat
was sliced wide open.

She couldn't even
scream in pain.

[HARUTO] You're the younger

the incident, right?
Can I watch you work?

Aw, man. I'm totally
gonna crash out.

223
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,500
I'm so sleepy.

224
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,041
If she's gonna come, let her.

Ha. Who cares about some
stupid red-shoed witch?

Is this one of those bastards

[KANZAKI]
Have you found the witch?

231
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,541
We've had a slight
complication on my end.

232
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,625
[HARUTO]
Yes. She's right in front of me.

233
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,250
What's the situation?

234
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,666
[HARUTO]
She's caught something weird.

Says it's one of the killers.

must've gone to sleep.

Does that hurt?

It hurts, doesn't it?

240
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:08,500
I remember my sister,
screaming out in vain for help.

"Don't kill me!", but you and
your friends just smiled.

I will not be smiling.

243
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,166
I hated them.

244
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,041
I never got along
with my family.

Always one fight after another.

But that day, I died with them.

I never would have
expected that.

248
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,833
My heart died with my family.

00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,000
[MANA] The three of them
were spending time together

in the living room while
I was alone in my bedroom.

But I heard and saw
what happened.

had wide, toothy grins.

My family never let them know
that I was in the house.

The mother, father, and sister

I had always argued
with protected me.

259
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,375
And worse, these filthy
beasts weren't tried because

260
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:04,958
they were minors. Psychotic
murderers protected by the law.

Why?

Ever since that day, my heart

has been tethered to this place,
unable to leave this room.

I've had to live with
this hellish memory

for the last 10 years.

Oh, really?

What do mean, "weird thing?"

So now that weird thing
turned into a human corpse.

[KANZAKI]
Why didn't you stop her?

275
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,875
Because I didn't want to.

You what?

00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,541
[HARUTO] If I'd stopped her,
she wouldn't be able to leave.

[KANZAKI] Are you seriously
planning to help a killer?

It's a dream, why shouldn't I?

Because people are dying

Yeah.

they could really kill someone

Until then, I had nothing.

I thought my whole

00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:37,791
Because I felt perfectly fine
just the way I was.

317
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,958
But after that day...

318
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,416
That's when I discovered a
new dream to work towards.

319
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,000
To kill these bastards.

320
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,750
To hurt them. To make them
feel hundreds of times

321
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,250
the pain they inflicted on
my family, then kill them.

322
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:57,166
That way, I'd know what it was
like to accomplish something.

323
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,708
[HARUTO]
The dream of yours.

324
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,083
It's over once you've killed
all three of them.

325
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,291
It will end.
What will you do then?

326
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,000
What I do after doesn't matter.

327
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,541
If they don't die, I can't live.

328
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,541
This scar.

329
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,458
So what? Let go.

330
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,000
Damn. You really are something.

331
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,458
You can do incredible
stuff like this!

332
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,708
I mean it, you're awesome.
I honestly think so!

333
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,416
[BOTH gasp]

[HIMURO MONSTER chattering]

335
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,250
Is that the third guy?

336
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,666
This one didn't do any killing,
but he planned everything.

337
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,166
[HIMURO MONSTER groaning]

338
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,875
I wanted to kill him the most.
To make him suffer!

339
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,583
[HIMURO panting]

[HIMURO groans]

341
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,625
I was hoping to meet you.
Just my luck!

342
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,333
[HIMURO MONSTER]
Everything changes once you've

343
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,333
killed someone, doesn't it?
It was the same for us.

344
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,000
But I can see you came
up with something

345
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,000
pretty interesting here!

346
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,291
To kill people using dreams.

347
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,041
That's amazing!

348
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,583
Through dreams, you could
commit the perfect crime!

349
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,916
How did you learn to do
something so damned impressive?

350
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,041
Come on, spill it!

351
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,458
What a piece of shit.

352
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,000
[HIMURO]
Who the hell are you?

353
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,250
[gasps] You don't need
to worry about me.

354
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,208
What, are you her boyfriend?

355
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,958
No, wait, don't tell me.

356
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,791
You did something to get
yourself dragged into this too!

357
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,250
[HARUTO]
Idiot.

358
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,833
Why don't you help me?

359
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,750
We could finish this
witch off together!

360
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:45,250
[HIMURO groaning]

361
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,000
I think you misunderstand
my involvement.

362
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,041
My friends were
the real killers.

363
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,416
These two were the ones
who got their hands dirty.

364
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
There's no way I could
be as guilty as they are!

365
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,875
It doesn't make sense to
want to kill me the most.

366
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,541
I don't understand
what you're thinking.

367
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,666
[MANA] You smiled the
whole time, arrogantly.

368
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,375
You're smiling now, too.

369
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,833
That's because I
know I can learn

370
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,041
how to do what you're doing.

371
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,208
Let's try!

[MANA gasps]

373
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,083
Ha! I did it! It's really easy.

374
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,583
You just have to think
about what you want,

375
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,583
and it starts to happen!

376
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,666
Ha! This place is the best!

377
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,916
I'm gonna do whatever
I want to do.

378
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,958
I've gotten pretty famous on the
internet, I'll have you know.

[screams]

380
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,708

pissed me off.

[HARUTO]
She's strong, you know.

383
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,583
Way more amazing than
some slug like you.

384
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:47,166
You're a coward.
So, I'll take her side.

385
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,083
Does that hurt? Huh?!

386
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,916
It does, doesn't it?

387
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,291
Let me do it.

388

You okay? Looks like the bad
dream has come to an end.

398

I have a new dream. What that
means, I'll have to learn.

Thanks for your help.

Now that I've awoken,
I want to meet you for real.

Oh, welcome back.

403
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,208
So, the witch's dream.
Was it you?

404
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,875
Are you the one
who showed it to me?

405
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,750
[LILY]
No, not me.

406
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,625
[HARUTO]
Okay. Do you know who did?

407
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:40,416
I'm not sure, but I am very
certain that somebody

408
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,333
is trying to tell you something
rather important, brother.

409

Living someone's dream.
How does that happen?

410
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,791
I don't know that either.

411
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,333
Well, okay then.

412
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,750
I'm tired. Just let me sleep.

413
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,375
You killed someone?

00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,750
Uh, yeah.

415
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,833
But not the witch.

Yurina...

I wish you could tell me what
kind of dream you're having now.

to end tomorrow,

is there someone special--

Someone you'd like to
share your feelings with?

Yes! Bah!

be: "The Witch of First Love."
