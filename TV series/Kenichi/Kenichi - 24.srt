1
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:42,938
Oops!

2
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:44,773
Please we don't
want any trouble!

3
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:46,108
Neither do we.

4
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:48,652
You can relax, pretty boy.
We're just here to have

5
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:51,697
a friendly little chat with you
and your Drama Club friends.

6
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:53,740
See, you guys are a problem.

7
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,077
You're always in here rehearsing
those lame plays of yours.

8
00:01:57,077 --> 00:02:03,625
Which means this room is
never available for us!

9
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,420
Now, you've got a
week to move out.

10
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,631
After that, it would look pretty
lame if a martial arts club

11
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:13,796
let a bunch of actors push
them around, don't you think?

12
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:21,643
Um, Tanimoto?

13
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:30,193
You say it was Hermit?

14
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:32,195
That's right, and
don't ask me why,

15
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:35,365
but for some reason he was
really interested in you.

16
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:38,952
I don't know! Forgive me!

17
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:41,997
Your partner, the one
called Kenichi Shirahama...

18
00:02:41,997 --> 00:02:45,584
Where did he acquire his
martial arts training?

19
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:47,961
I don't know, you moron!

20
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:51,882
Yeah! Later, dude!

21
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:54,968
Well, I took care of him
without too much trouble!

22
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:58,847
Still, I can't help wondering
why he was so interested in you.

23
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:00,474
Who knows?

24
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:01,850
Aw, come on!

25
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,102
Don't you think you're
taking this way too casually,

26
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:06,855
I mean, for all we know he
could be targeting you next!

27
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:09,691
Maybe, but I can't spend all
my time worrying about it.

28
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:13,195
From now on, I'm going to
use my free time to relax.

29
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:16,698
You should read more,
Niijima, it's very soothing.

30
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:20,035
Hm. When did he get so mature?

31
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:22,913
Well, I guess I'd better
make a note of it!

32
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:24,247
There!

33
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:27,209
Ever since Kisara Nanjo
stopped coming to school,

34
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,461
a lot of new delinquent gangs
have started popping up

35
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:32,380
and the school is on the
verge of all-out civil war!

36
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,674
During the confusion you and
I have a chance to assert

37
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:36,760
our strength and take
over the school!

38
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,970
Together we'll be able
to rule over it all!

39
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,933
No.

40
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:45,310
Aw, come on, don't you
want to rule over it all

41
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,436
just a teeny-tiny bit?

42
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,438
I said no.

43
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,148
Now listen up, Niijima!

44
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,359
The only time a martial
artist ever uses his fists,

45
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,152
is when he has
to protect himself,

46
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,822
or to protect the
people he cares about!

47
00:03:56,822 --> 00:04:00,450
Well, that's what Master
Koetsuji says about it, anyway.

48
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,786
You mean to protect your
precious little Miu?

49
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:04,162
What? What kind of nonsense

50
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,414
are you spouting now,
you little freak?!

51
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,290
Check it out!

52
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,377
Looks like your little Miu
is in danger even now!

53
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:20,762
As I recall, he's from Class B.
Yup, and here he is.

54
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,848
He's a regular winner
in my "hot guy" ranking

55
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:26,768
for the entire school, first
year student Tanimoto Natsu.

56
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,520
Tell me what I should do!

57
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,772
Are you kidding, you're
no match for this guy!

58
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:32,774
He's no fighter, but
he's good at sports,

59
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:34,067
his grades are perfect,

60
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:35,902
and he's the idol
of the Drama Club.

61
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,612
They call him "Prince Tanimoto",

62
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:41,408
and every girl in the
school is crazy about him.

63
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:44,119
If you want to beat this guy at
popularity you better drop

64
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,956
the book and start
working on your image!

65
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:50,250
Better yet, let me help you.

66
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,836
If you agree to formally join
the Shinpaku Alliance, I'll make

67
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:56,298
sure that guy disappears
from Miu's life forever!

68
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:57,841
How would you do that?

69
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:00,719
By completely destroying
his reputation, of course!

70
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:04,723
I'll spread all kinds
of foul rumors about him!

71
00:05:04,723 --> 00:05:06,266
What?! You're outta your mind!

72
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,310
I'm not gonna listen
to you, you devil!

73
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,728
Come on, Kenichi,
who's your buddy?

74
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:11,104
Who's your pal?

75
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:14,399
I won't listen to you!
Get away from me!

76
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,068
Oh, Kenichi. Have you
got a minute to talk?

77
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:27,787
His smile lights up the room!

78
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:30,707
Nice to meet you.
My name is Tanimoto.

79
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:33,084
So, you're the famous
Kenichi Shirahama.

80
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:35,253
I've heard a lot about you.

81
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:40,008
I was afraid you'd
be more intimidating.

82
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:43,428
He's totally dreamy!
Like a pop star!

83
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:45,931
Oh, man, I haven't got a
prayer against this guy!

84
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:47,891
Tanimoto says the Drama
Club is short-handed

85
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:50,018
for their next play,
so he asked me

86
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:53,355
if I'd like to play Juliet
in "Romeo and Juliet."

87
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:55,941
I'm playing the part of Romeo.

88
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:59,361
It's true, the two of them
would be perfect together!

89
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:02,364
What happened to protecting the
people you care about, buddy?

90
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:04,074
Kick his butt,
you'll feel better!

91
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:05,408
I said shut up!

92
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:06,868
Taste the stinging
slap of justice--

93
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:09,162
I'm not all that comfortable
being in the spotlight,

94
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:11,122
so I wasn't sure if I should.

95
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:14,125
Uh, hey, are you
listening to me?

96
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:20,882
What? Miu's going
to be in a play?

97
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,384
It looks like girls
are more impressed

98
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:24,344
with acting than martial arts!

99
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:26,763
What if Miu does end up
falling in love with Tanimoto

100
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,974
because of this? All the pain
and suffering I've endured

101
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:31,726
training here will end
up being for nothing!

102
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:33,186
I thought you were
doing this because

103
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:40,402
it was a matter of principal.
In any event, calm down.

104
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:42,821
Calm? How can I be calm
at a time like this?

105
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,447
What is it this time?

106
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:49,411
Let's just say it's not
easy being a teenager.

107
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:54,332
So, you're in a
play as a tree?

108
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:56,876
Well, I'm playing
the lead in it.

109
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,921
They really didn't
have anyone else.

110
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,841
I'm just helping 'em out.

111
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:05,427
Hm. You seem so pleased, though.

112
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:11,599
That's nice.

113
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:16,354
There are only five days
left til the performance.

114
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:19,816
I don't know if I can
memorize the lines in time.

115
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:23,820
You're very smart.
You'll be fine.

116
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,990
Man. Does she have
to be so excited?

117
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,659
It's gotta be because
Tanimoto is playing the lead.

118
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,327
Hey! Try and stay focused!

119
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,081
Until the dinner bell rings this
is still a training session!

120
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:37,917
You haven't been putting as much
time in on Chinese martial arts

121
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:40,003
and we have a lot
of catching up to do.

122
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:43,381
Okay, okay, the chart
isn't necessary.

123
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:46,217
All right, let's get started.

124
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:50,764
This is the Takusosho
stance of the Baguazhang.

125
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:52,599
Now, Kenichi, hit me.

126
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:57,020
All right! Take this, Tanimoto!

127
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,981
From this position you can
quickly reverse your stance,

128
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:03,193
and then...

129
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:06,112
...attack and defend
all at the same time.

130
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,322
Yeah, got it!

131
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:09,324
Once you've got your
opponent like this,

132
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:11,117
you can easily break his arm!

133
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,160
Ow!

134
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,704
The Baguazhang focuses
on combination attacks

135
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:16,498
that flow from one to the other.

136
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:18,458
Let's look at some easy ones.

137
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:22,128
Chop to the throat, the groin,
the neck, elbow to the ribs,

138
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:27,008
and finally, you hit
the back of the leg,

139
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,344
knock him to the ground,
and finish him off!

140
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,137
But because this is
a combination attack

141
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:34,015
with flowing movements,
each individual blow is weak.

142
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:36,059
So even though you're striking
what are normally considered

143
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,812
vital spots, this isn't
really a killing move.

144
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:41,689
Now, I'm going to show
you my secret technique

145
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:47,487
for getting out of a grip,
so pay close attention.

146
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:49,614
But, that's just an uppercut.

147
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,533
An opponent with a
strong neck would be able

148
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,910
to withstand that blow.
It's impossible for you to put

149
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,705
much force into the hit when
you're so close to your enemy.

150
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,791
Which is just what your
opponent will be thinking,

151
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,419
so he won't expect
what happens next.

152
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:12,011
Oh, man! How did you manage to
muster so much force, Master?

153
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:14,139
This form is the
source of your power.

154
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:16,015
Once your hand is
placed under his chin,

155
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:18,017
use your other hand
to strike your elbow.

156
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:20,145
The strength of two hands
is now behind the one

157
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:23,189
in contact with the chin. And
since you're already in contact

158
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:26,025
with your opponent, he won't
be able to dodge the blow.

159
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,694
It's a powerful
technique all right.

160
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:29,863
Geez, I thought my neck snapped!

161
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:33,032
It's very dangerous.
Don't teach it to anyone,

162
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:36,536
and don't use it against
anyone who is weak.

163
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:38,788
Well, that should
cover it for today.

164
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:41,082
Now you're free to go back to
thinking of some way

165
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,876
to get Miu's
attention back on you.

166
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:45,170
Yes, sir!

167
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,338
Oh, let me tell you
one more thing.

168
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:48,631
Yes?

169
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,801
If history has proven anything,
it's that the man who has a goal

170
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:54,929
and works hard
gets the girl.

171
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:58,391
And although Miu can be a
little slow, she's not stupid.

172
00:09:58,391 --> 00:09:59,976
I'm sure someday
she'll understand

173
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:01,769
how you feel about her.

174
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,938
In any case, I don't think
joining the Drama Club

175
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:07,025
will help. I'll take these
before you get any crazy ideas.

176
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:09,027
No! Please don't take them!

177
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:14,073
Oh, Romeo!

178
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:18,411
Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?

179
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:22,165
Wow. She really stinks.

180
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:24,626
For thou art as glorius
to this night...

181
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:27,837
On the other hand,
Master Koetsuji is pretty good!

182
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:31,090
He's even saying his
lines from memory!

183
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,843
I hope Miu will be all right.

184
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,345
I'm starting to get
a little worried.

185
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:39,349
Oh, Romeo!

186
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:47,684
Now that I think about it, what
kind of Drama Club makes a girl

187
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:50,270
with no acting experience the
lead in a Shakespeare play?

188
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,981
It's kind of suspicious.

189
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:57,110
Here we go. I'll just take a
little peek at their rehearsal.

190
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,571
Hold on a minute, Imai.

191
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:02,866
I'm sorry, Tanimoto.
I can't take it anymore!

192
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:08,580
You're the Vice President! You
can't let them intimidate you!

193
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,457
Imai, wait!

194
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:14,043
Oh, Kenichi, I'm sorry,
I didn't see you there.

195
00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:15,587
If you're looking
for Miu, you're early,

196
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:17,672
she's still at
gymnastics practice.

197
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:18,882
Uh, right.

198
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:22,343
So what was that all about?

199
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:24,762
It's tough.

200
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:26,890
The Martial Arts Research Club?

201
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,765
Mm-hm.

202
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:30,894
Believe me, the name is
just as phony as it sounds.

203
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:33,938
They're nothing but
a gang of cheap punks.

204
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:36,482
They want to take over this
room for their headquarters.

205
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:38,151
Most of the Drama Club
members have quit

206
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:42,739
because of their threats.

207
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:46,576
Listen, I need to
ask you a favor.

208
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:48,411
You've gotta protect us.

209
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:51,706
Protect the remaining members of
the Drama Club from these thugs!

210
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:54,000
But, Tanimoto...

211
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:01,049
Don't tell me you
guys are still here?

212
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:04,594
I guess I didn't make myself
clear enough the last time.

213
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:07,555
Maybe a little pain will
make you understand.

214
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:26,407
I'm telling you to pack it
up and get out right now.

215
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:27,909
You wouldn't want us to mess up

216
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:33,373
that pretty face of
yours, would you?

217
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:36,960
Tanimoto, are these
the guys you meant?

218
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,545
What are you gonna do?

219
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:43,132
We're waiting!

220
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:45,009
Your cheap threats
don't frighten me,

221
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:47,595
it'll take more than you've
got to drive us out!

222
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:49,263
This room has belonged
to the Drama Club

223
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:51,683
since this school was built!

224
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,059
He's braver than I thought!

225
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:56,521
Oh, look at this
cool set, boys!

226
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:58,982
You guys are doin' "Romeo
and Juliet" next, aren't ya?

227
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:01,901
Keep your hands off of that!

228
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:03,778
Okay.

229
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:05,280
No hands!

230
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:08,658
Huh? What the?

231
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:13,329
Pile driver time!

232
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:19,585
That's enough!

233
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:22,839
Ow! Ow! You're
pulling out my hair!

234
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:24,632
Hey, who is this guy?

235
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:27,176
You lookin' for a fight?

236
00:13:27,176 --> 00:13:31,264
My name's Kenichi Shirahama! And
I'm a big fan of Shakespeare,

237
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:35,435
especially "Romeo and Juliet!"
Got a problem with that?

238
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:37,812
Ke-Kenichi Shirahama?!

239
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:40,231
You mean you're the commander
of the Shinpaku Alliance?

240
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:43,359
N-Now what? I heard he
took down Kisara's crew

241
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:45,528
from Ragnarok
all by himself!

242
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:48,406
I heard he can take down a bear
if the conditions are right!

243
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:50,158
And I heard he can
do it one-handed

244
00:13:50,158 --> 00:13:52,076
if the bear is 800
pounds or less!

245
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:53,536
What has Niijima been saying?!

246
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,455
Yeah, well, we'll take
care of you later!

247
00:13:55,455 --> 00:13:57,540
We'll get even with
you, you'll see!

248
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,878
Oh, wow! You really did it!
You're just like the rumors say!

249
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:04,714
Uh, yeah, what kind of rumors
you been hearing exactly?

250
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:07,133
Man, you must have a
grip like a steel vise!

251
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:10,094
I mean you stopped that guy's
pile driver using only one hand!

252
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:11,971
No, it's just that
a person can't move

253
00:14:11,971 --> 00:14:13,431
when you've got him by the hair.

254
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:17,060
Suit yourself. Anyway, you seem
to know a lot about fighting.

255
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,978
I'll bet you've had a lot
of really heavy-duty

256
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:20,396
martial arts training, right?

257
00:14:20,396 --> 00:14:24,692
Uh, yeah sure...

258
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:28,488
Must be nice, to have a talent
for martial arts like that.

259
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:30,782
Hold on! What did you just say?

260
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:32,492
This isn't about talent!

261
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:34,702
What, do you think I was
just born like this?!

262
00:14:34,702 --> 00:14:36,704
I've worked my butt off!

263
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:38,873
Uh, right! I'm sorry!

264
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:41,125
Hey, sorry I'm late!

265
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,003
Gymnastics practice ran
a little long today!

266
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:48,132
Oh, hi, Kenichi!
W-What are you doing here?

267
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:49,634
Yeah, well, I, uh...

268
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:51,886
I was just checking out the
rehearsal, yeah, that's it.

269
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:54,639
Good luck, see you later!

270
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,974
Where are you going? Wait!

271
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:59,268
Oh wow, he's acting weird.

272
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:03,731
You sure screwed that up!

273
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:06,275
If you hadn't interfered, it
woulda been the end of the play!

274
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:09,987
If those two end up being a
couple, it's all your fault!

275
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:12,406
Why don't you go haunt
a house somewhere?!

276
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:21,374
This is getting tiresome.

277
00:15:21,374 --> 00:15:23,709
I don't know what this
Shinpaku Alliance is exactly,

278
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,586
but a guy like you shouldn't
have any trouble

279
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:27,588
getting rid of them, right?

280
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:30,091
So what's taking you so long?

281
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:33,094
Just leave me alone.
I'm having fun with this one.

282
00:15:33,094 --> 00:15:36,430
Yeah, I can see you can
barely contain yourself.

283
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,350
I must say you're not very
convincing, my friend.

284
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,520
I could easily beat this
Shirahama right now if I wished.

285
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,647
But I believe the ones
teaching him the martial arts

286
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:48,192
are serious masters. With every
day that passes, his skills

287
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:51,028
and strength increase, and he
becomes more of a challenge.

288
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:54,073
I see, so you're like a farmer
waiting for the fruit to ripen

289
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:55,825
before you pick it, is that it?

290
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:59,036
Just make sure you don't wait
too long for the harvest.

291
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:02,248
There's a major war coming
and it won't wait for anyone.

292
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:04,709
Go ahead and play your
little games, but when things

293
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:11,632
get serious, you could end up
with a knife in your back.

294
00:16:11,632 --> 00:16:14,594
Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague.

295
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:15,428
No!

296
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:20,016
What's Montague? It is, nor hand
nor foot nor arm nor face,

297
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:20,975
No!

298
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:24,020
She's working her tail off, but
she hasn't gotten any better.

299
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,772
Not like that! You
have to say it slower.

300
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:29,275
Whisper it out loud, as if
you were talking to a cow

301
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:30,860
from a distance.
Make sure you honor

302
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,528
the pentameter without
hammering at it!

303
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:33,446
Oh, okay.

304
00:16:33,446 --> 00:16:35,990
Wow, his coaching is
pretty sophisticated.

305
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,576
I'll bet Master Koetsuji could
be a professional acting teacher

306
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:39,702
on top of everything else.

307
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:41,913
Do you really think so?

308
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:46,250
What?! What is it?!

309
00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:53,174
I captured a
suspicious person. See?

310
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:56,052
Well, yeah, I agree he is
suspicious, but he's also

311
00:16:56,052 --> 00:16:58,763
sort of a friend of mine,
don't you remember?

312
00:16:58,763 --> 00:16:59,722
Oh.

313
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:02,058
I've been doing more research
on Tanimoto's background

314
00:17:02,058 --> 00:17:04,310
and guess what I found out?

315
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,103
I've made an amazing discovery!

316
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:10,191
What? Have you discovered
his weakness or something?

317
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:13,152
No, the thing is...

318
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:14,570
...the guy is perfect.

319
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,073
Huh?

320
00:17:17,073 --> 00:17:19,075
He's only a freshman,
but he's already the head

321
00:17:19,075 --> 00:17:21,577
of the Drama Club and a born
leader. He gets good grades

322
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:23,788
and naturally the teachers
are wild about him.

323
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:25,790
But he never brags about
it, and what's more,

324
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,667
he tutors other students
in his spare time.

325
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,585
In other words, he's as
perfect on the inside

326
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:31,504
as he is on the outside.

327
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:34,715
I think he's a little too
perfect, he just can't be real!

328
00:17:34,715 --> 00:17:36,968
It's like Persian carpets,
no matter how squeaky clean

329
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,053
they seem to be, if you
pound them hard enough,

330
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:40,304
they're bound to show some dust!

331
00:17:40,304 --> 00:17:41,222
Do you think so?

332
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:43,724
Hey, bro, when it comes
to dirt, I'm an expert.

333
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:47,228
This guy's suspicious. My sensor
is tingling like crazy.

334
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:48,813
And it's never wrong.

335
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:51,524
So you need to put the screws
on him and make him talk.

336
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:51,981
What?!

337
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:53,192
Come on, a little third degree

338
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:54,777
and he'll crack
like an egg shell!

339
00:17:54,777 --> 00:17:56,779
Give me a break!
Get out of here!

340
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,864
Come on, are you really
gonna let that pretty boy

341
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:00,575
get away with being so perfect?

342
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,744
Shut up and go away! Get out!

343
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,651
See you later!

344
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:11,730
Can you believe
that guy Niijima?

345
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,482
He came all the way
out to Ryozanpaku

346
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:15,400
just to give me a load of crap!

347
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,113
Well, yeah, that does
sound like Niijima.

348
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:20,989
Okay, I'll admit at first,

349
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:24,409
I was jealous of Tanimoto
being so perfect.

350
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:28,288
But when I saw him stand up
to those bullies yesterday,

351
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:30,499
it reminded me of when I
rushed out without thinking

352
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:32,709
and challenged those thugs.

353
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:35,420
Well, whatever the reason,
I just can't dislike the guy.

354
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,215
So I've decided to do whatever I
can to protect the Drama Club

355
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:40,717
and the play from that
gang of delinquents.

356
00:18:40,717 --> 00:18:43,095
And that way you can
concentrate on Juliet.

357
00:18:43,095 --> 00:18:44,888
Great!

358
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:46,139
But I have to tell you,

359
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:49,226
there's one other thing
that's been worrying me.

360
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:52,938
Tanimoto is such a good actor,
but he doesn't seem to enjoy it.

361
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:55,732
In fact, he seems
really unhappy.

362
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:58,777
Whenever we're rehearsing,
when I look deep into his eyes

363
00:18:58,777 --> 00:19:00,946
I can see a sort of
sadness shimmering there

364
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:02,906
like a faint light
off in the darkness.

365
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:05,701
Uh, you can? Really?

366
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:09,162
Oh, man, are they connecting
on that deep a level now?

367
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:10,914
How close have they become?

368
00:19:10,914 --> 00:19:14,376
He's such a mystery.

369
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:16,753
Kenichi! You got a minute?

370
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:19,840
I'm vice president
of the Drama Club.

371
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,509
I wanted to say thank you for
what you did the other day.

372
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:26,805
Uh, well, you're welcome, but
it's really not necessary.

373
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:28,348
It's just that Tanimoto was--

374
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:30,642
Because you stood up to the
Martial Arts Research Club,

375
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:32,769
we've been able to go ahead
with our production of

376
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:34,980
Romeo and Juliet
in complete safety.

377
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,231
However,

378
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:39,484
don't you think you're overdoing
it with the martial arts stuff?

379
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:42,696
One of those guys has
three fractured ribs!

380
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:43,572
No way.

381
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:46,033
Now hold on a minute!
That just isn't possible!

382
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:47,618
I was in the
clubroom when they--

383
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:49,703
Did you hear? Kenichi
threatened to kill them

384
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:51,914
if they didn't transfer
to another school!

385
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:54,625
It figures! We call him
a hero and he turns out

386
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,960
to be a thug just like
the rest of them!

387
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,171
He didn't have to send
them to the hospital!

388
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:02,883
Hey! Hold on a sec you guys!
This is all a big mistake!

389
00:20:02,883 --> 00:20:06,470
He's as scary as the delinquents
he's always fighting with!

390
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,224
Maybe this has something to do
with that gang he's part of!

391
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:12,726
Way to go, Kenichi!

392
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:15,854
Are you ready join the
Shinpaku Alliance now?

393
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:17,814
What are you talking
about, you devil?!

394
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:18,982
Don't be modest!

395
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:21,151
The story going around the
school is that you destroyed

396
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:23,528
three different delinquent gangs
yesterday, and you announced

397
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:25,405
to all of them that you
were Kenichi Shirahama,

398
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:27,532
co-commander of the
Shinpaku Alliance!

399
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:30,619
Ni-Niijima, you mean
you started that rumor?

400
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:33,080
I only wish I had! This has
made the Shinpaku Alliance

401
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,334
the most feared group in school
and you the scariest fighter!

402
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:39,836
Of course, it wouldn't hurt
to spice the story up a little

403
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:41,672
with the old
Niijima magic touch.

404
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:44,508
How about some heartrending tale
about our lifelong friendship

405
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:47,261
and how you had to act to
save me from a threat from

406
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:48,720
a rival gang, or
something like that?

407
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,264
Sound good, partner?

408
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:53,100
What's going on?

409
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,980
Nobody in the whole
school believes me.

410
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,858
But I really didn't do
anything to those guys.

411
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:05,153
Don't give up. I believe
in you, Kenichi.

412
00:21:05,153 --> 00:21:07,447
If you were really the kind of
person who loved violence,

413
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:12,202
you wouldn't be able to grow
flowers as beautiful as these.

414
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:14,371
Thanks, I'm glad you think so.

415
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:17,916
You're the only one left around
here who believes in me.

416
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,377
Yes!

417
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:24,673
You and Miu are all I've got.

418
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:27,009
Oh, well. I don't get it,
though, who would go around

419
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:28,760
attacking different
gangs using my name

420
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,471
instead of building
their own reputation?

421
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:36,018
I heard about what
happened, Kenichi.

422
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:37,019
Tanimoto!

423
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,398
Whoa! It's Prince Tanimoto!

424
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:43,316
People can be so mean.

425
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:44,776
No matter what you've
done they'll believe

426
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:46,903
the first cheap rumor they hear.

427
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:49,823
In the end all they care
about is themselves.

428
00:21:54,536 --> 00:21:58,457
Oh! He makes my heart
pound! I'm such a cheater!

429
00:21:58,457 --> 00:22:00,167
I want you to know
I believe you.

430
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:02,044
I admit that when I
first heard the story,

431
00:22:02,044 --> 00:22:06,631
I was afraid you might
really have done it.

432
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:11,219
But you're someone who knows
where to draw the line.

433
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:16,349
And what happened
yesterday was just sick.

434
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:17,934
You know, everybody
has this idea

435
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:20,103
that I'm sort of
Mr. Perfect Student. Right?

436
00:22:20,103 --> 00:22:22,105
Consequently I don't
have many friends.

437
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:25,376
So I'd be really happy if you'd
consider us friends from now on.

438
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:32,324
Sure.

439
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:42,292
Just then, I saw it.

440
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:45,921
In his eyes,
a sort of sadness,

441
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:48,340
shimmering like a faint light.

442
00:24:20,432 --> 00:24:21,474
The play is tomorrow!

443
00:24:21,474 --> 00:24:24,019
Man, I can hardly wait
to see Miu's Juliet!

444
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:25,103
Are you sure?

445
00:24:25,103 --> 00:24:27,314
Miu's going to look absolutely
beautiful in her costume!

446
00:24:27,314 --> 00:24:29,024
I tell you, it's gonna be great!

447
00:24:29,024 --> 00:24:30,859
Are you really sure?

448
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:32,986
All the masters are
going to see it too!

449
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:35,197
We're all going to be
there to cheer her on!

450
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:37,574
You know there's a
kissing scene, right?

451
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:38,992
No! Don't say that!

452
00:24:38,992 --> 00:24:40,493
I've been trying
to forget about it

453
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:43,747
and you had to go and
remind me all over again!

454
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:45,832
What am I gonna do?
