1
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,895
I'm not gonna beat
around the bush here.

2
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:44,836
I want you to be
a part of my crew!

3
00:01:44,836 --> 00:01:46,754
Word on the street is
that Kisara's people

4
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:48,339
have been causing
you problems lately.

5
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:52,051
And from what I hear, they're
plannin' to take you down.

6
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:54,220
I'm here 'cause I wanna
offer you protection.

7
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,849
if you join me and my gang those
punks'll never touch you again!

8
00:01:57,849 --> 00:01:59,434
So, whadda ya say?

9
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:01,436
I could really use a guy
like you on my team.

10
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:04,397
I'll take good care
of you, I promise.

11
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:06,899
I don't understand, what exactly
do you want from me?

12
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,443
Isn't it obvious?

13
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:10,862
A man's true value is determined
by the number of people

14
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:14,282
he's in command of. I'm gonna
keep expanding my personal army,

15
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:16,200
so that in the end,
I'll be in charge

16
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,077
of the most powerful
group in Ragnarok!

17
00:02:18,077 --> 00:02:20,788
And what do you plan on doing
after you've gotten to the top

18
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:23,082
huh? What about once you
graduate from high school?

19
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:25,334
You can't be a delinquent
forever you know.

20
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:27,045
Eventually you and
your thug friends

21
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:29,422
are gonna have to grow
up and get real jobs!

22
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,896
Come on, Boss, take it easy!
Just calm down, okay?

23
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:46,814
My men and I don't need
your clever logic.

24
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:48,775
There's no way you
could ever understand

25
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:51,027
that a man's greatest desire
in his life is freedom.

26
00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:54,614
Everything that my men and
I do is about being free.

27
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:56,949
I can understand that,
but if you're harming people

28
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,951
to get your way
then that's not right!

29
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:00,620
You and your gang are
running around town

30
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,288
enjoying your "freedom", but
all you're really doing

31
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:04,082
is causing other people pain!

32
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,500
That's not freedom!

33
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,252
Don't you see?
That's tyranny!

34
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:11,506
I wish he wouldn't
say things like that.

35
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:12,924
It'll just make 'em madder!

36
00:03:12,924 --> 00:03:15,051
You know I should probably
get this thing on tape.

37
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:16,969
I'm betting that he'll
want to see this later!

38
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:18,679
Let's go, bring it on!

39
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:32,026
Way to go, Kenichi!

40
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:33,778
Boss, are you gonna be okay?

41
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:38,741
Not bad, that one kinda stung.

42
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,993
You like that? Plenty more
where that came from!

43
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:44,330
Now it's my turn!
You're gonna pay for that kid!

44
00:03:46,332 --> 00:03:47,917
Keep it up, Kenichi!

45
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,046
You're gonna bleed!

46
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:59,554
You're doing great, Kenichi,
don't give up on me yet.

47
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:02,348
Come on over
here, little buddy.

48
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:05,977
I'll give you one more good
shot right in the face!

49
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:10,398
Aw, what's the matter?
What are you chicken?

50
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:12,733
Come on, take your best shot!

51
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,986
What's the deal with this guy?

52
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:19,740
I knew you couldn't do it,
you're just a coward!

53
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,242
I'm no coward!

54
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:27,957
My hand!

55
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:32,837
I think he's hurt. it looks
like he's in trouble!

56
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:54,358
That one almost
knocked me out.

57
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:56,235
I even saw the punch coming!

58
00:04:56,235 --> 00:04:59,447
Get up and fight me.
You call yourself a man, right?

59
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:05,995
Don't tell me that's
the best you can do!

60
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:08,247
I'm glad you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

61
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:10,124
I'm amazed you have the
strength to talk smack

62
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:11,501
after the beating
you just got.

63
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:14,086
So listen, why don't
you join my gang or,

64
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:15,880
I'm gonna have to
take you down!

65
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:26,807
I can't seem to
figure this guy out.

66
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,768
I should've been able
to beat him already,

67
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:31,062
but my attacks aren't
working at all.

68
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:33,189
I could really use some help!

69
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:38,027
I must say I'm a bit concerned.
I don't think Kenichi

70
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:41,072
is strong enough to
face this guy yet.

71
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:43,032
Skill is only part
of the equation.

72
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:45,701
A fighter gains a certain knack
with years of experience.

73
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:48,663
And no amount of talent or
training can stand up to that.

74
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:51,666
Then, what are we waiting
for, he needs our help!

75
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,584
Let's give him a chance!

76
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:55,253
Kenichi...

77
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:02,301
Is that really all
you've got, kid?

78
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:04,428
I expected so much
more out of you!

79
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:05,763
Hey!

80
00:06:06,097 --> 00:06:08,099
Hm?

81
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:10,768
Who said the fight was over?
I don't remember quitting!

82
00:06:10,768 --> 00:06:12,812
Cause I'm just
getting warmed up!

83
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,274
You really got
some guts kid.

84
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:17,566
If you keep impressing me,

85
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:21,612
I might actually start
respecting you as an opponent!

86
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:23,531
And since you've almost
earned my respect,

87
00:06:23,531 --> 00:06:25,616
I don't have to hold back!

88
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,704
He's swinging big!
I can do this!

89
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:45,052
I'm losing my balance!
I've got to get my footing back!

90
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:47,096
Damn it! What now?

91
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:48,389
That was a mistake!

92
00:06:54,145 --> 00:06:56,439
This fighting by the book will
get you nowhere with me.

93
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:00,151
It's not a formula.
A fight's only about one thing.

94
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:02,028
It's about your instinct!

95
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,207
Nailing up another one
of your dolls, I see?

96
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:17,543
Uh, yes.

97
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:18,461
We need luck.

98
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:20,963
'Cause Apachai got a horrible
feeling earlier today.

99
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:23,591
Apachai picked up the
stuff that Miu asked him to,

100
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:25,259
then felt worried
for Kenichi.

101
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,803
This time he knows
it's for real.

102
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:31,390
Yes but Shigure, you
know how Hayato feels.

103
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,810
It's for Kenichi.
He'll understand.

104
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,062
But what I mean is--

105
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:39,982
It's okay. It's just
a few nails. Only 100.

106
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:41,233
Apa!

107
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,110
Lucky nail number one!

108
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,906
Keep Kenichi safe, lucky nail!

109
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:49,617
I'll leave you to it then.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

110
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:50,451
Thank you.

111
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:52,995
Apachai, that had better
not be you again!

112
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:53,579
Apa?

113
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:57,792
I swear, if you're pounding more
nails into my pine trees--!

114
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,838
Well, you're pretty good at
taking a beating aren't ya?

115
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:13,089
You punk!

116
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:20,888
We've gotta do something!
He can't handle this!

117
00:08:20,888 --> 00:08:22,432
Give him time!

118
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:27,520
You 'bout ready
for a break, kid?

119
00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:32,817
I'm not really
feeling that tired.

120
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:34,694
If you need a break,
let me know!

121
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:36,571
Why don't you shut your
mouth? Nobody's allowed

122
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:39,324
to talk to me like that! I will
tear you limb from limb!

123
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:41,409
What the heck do you
mean "limb from limb"?

124
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,077
Do I look like a tree to you?

125
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:45,997
Keep it up, I'll show you how
much of a man I really am!

126
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:49,167
Wha--? For someone who's losin',
you sure like to talk smack.

127
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,252
I hope you can back
it up, you little punk!

128
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:53,504
Oh? Why don't you come
over here and find out

129
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:56,382
whether I can back it up?
Who knows, I might surprise ya!

130
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:57,842
I can't believe he's
still standing.

131
00:08:57,842 --> 00:08:59,552
No one's lasted this
long with the boss.

132
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,596
He's got guts, but if
he keeps smartin' off,

133
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:03,014
he's just gonna
make things worse!

134
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:05,391
Tsuji won't put up with it
much longer, he'll kill him!

135
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:07,268
Nobody disrespects me!

136
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:09,479
My right hand's numb.

137
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:11,356
A punch won't work.

138
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:13,983
Kouho!

139
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,819
Haiho!

140
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:19,364
Wow, I can't believe it, he's
using the stepping method

141
00:09:19,364 --> 00:09:20,907
I taught him at the beginning!

142
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:22,575
Not bad!

143
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:27,330
It worked!

144
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,249
He just missed his chance
to strike. It's over.

145
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:39,509
I have a feeling
he's lost this one.

146
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:44,639
So, you didn't really think
you were the only one

147
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,933
who knows how to take
a little pain, did you?

148
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:48,851
I hate to do this, but
you're being so stubborn

149
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:50,770
and refusing to
join my gang so,

150
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,147
I have no choice
but to take you out!

151
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:56,943
I think I'll start
with your leg.

152
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,987
Have you ever broken a bone?

153
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:10,248
No matter what I try,
nothing works against him.

154
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:13,876
After all those painful
hours of training...

155
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:17,672
It's all useless
against this guy.

156
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:21,884
I'm so sorry, everybody.
I'm so sorry.

157
00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:24,303
That's it!

158
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:25,430
Not yet!

159
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,265
What are you talking
about? Are you crazy?

160
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:28,933
That guy is gonna break his leg!

161
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:30,101
Look at that!

162
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:35,690
Your fighting style hasn't
changed one bit has it?

163
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,108
You're still sloppy.

164
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:40,737
Why, you little!

165
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:42,739
I heard that you were
going after the kid.

166
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:45,366
So Kisara's got you doing
her grunt work, huh?

167
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:47,493
I knew that you'd do
whatever she said.

168
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:50,038
Doing a little recruiting?

169
00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:53,124
Hey! This has nothin'
to do with you. Walk away!

170
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:56,210
You just raised your fist to an
executive member of Ragnarok!

171
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,045
You're totally out of line, man!

172
00:10:58,045 --> 00:11:01,424
We have rules. There's no way
you're gonna get away with this!

173
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:03,634
Sorry, but that's
not my problem.

174
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:05,386
Guess you guys haven't
heard the news.

175
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:06,554
I quit the gang!

176
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:09,265
Hold it! You know the penalty
for quitting Ragnarok, right?

177
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,350
You get a "farewell beating"
from the whole gang!

178
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,060
Me and my boys are
gonna make sure

179
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,980
the only way you leave is
on your hands and knees, punk!

180
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,356
You're goin' down!

181
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:21,819
That does it!

182
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:25,239
It doesn't matter what you say,
I'm not walking away!

183
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:28,493
From now on if you mess with
him, you mess with me.

184
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:31,537
Not only did he save my life,
he saved my boxing career.

185
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:32,288
I owe him!

186
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:36,167
Your lethal left!
I thought it was busted!

187
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:39,003
Oh no. Let's just say my
arm's back in business.

188
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:41,005
So, unless you want me
to open up shop on ya,

189
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:42,924
how bout we postpone
the farewell beating?

190
00:11:42,924 --> 00:11:44,092
That you...

191
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:45,343
...Takeda?

192
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:47,428
You're a lot heavier than
I thought you'd be.

193
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:48,930
Can barely hold you!

194
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,764
I'm...

195
00:11:49,764 --> 00:11:52,892
...really sorry.

196
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:57,480
Stop him! Don't
let him get away!

197
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,773
Yes sir!

198
00:11:58,773 --> 00:11:59,857
Look guys,

199
00:11:59,857 --> 00:12:02,819
you might wanna reconsider this,
'cause I can crush your face

200
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:04,529
with one punch!

201
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:09,575
Later!

202
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:11,077
Why didn't you
guys do something?

203
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:13,121
The boxer was obviously
bluffing you idiots!

204
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:15,581
If his left hand was really
100% healthy, don't you think

205
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:18,000
he would've used
it from the get-go?

206
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,751
Come on!

207
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:20,628
Let's get him!!

208
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:23,840
That fool. He's just a
wannabe, that's all he is!

209
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,843
But he sure packs
one hell of a punch!

210
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:32,723
Kenichi, listen, you're uh,
a lot heavier than I expected.

211
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:34,684
Damn it! Those punks
are catching up to us!

212
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:36,644
Don't look back! Keep running!

213
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:38,229
He's so fast!

214
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:40,815
What's up with the old man?

215
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:43,317
Since Kenichi held his own
against your crazy boss,

216
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:45,987
I think he's earned a helping
hand from his sensei!

217
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:52,618
Help me! Help!

218
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:57,331
I'm gonna drown! I don't
swim, someone please help!

219
00:12:57,331 --> 00:13:00,209
Oh my!

220
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:02,086
Our little secret.

221
00:13:02,086 --> 00:13:04,672
Whaddya know! He
annihilated that bridge

222
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:07,466
with a simple kick!
He's just like Apachai,

223
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:09,886
he doesn't even know
his own strength!

224
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:11,846
I've been looking for
you all over Kenichi.

225
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:14,056
I wanted to say thanks for
everything that you've done!

226
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:17,101
Guess what Aksiame told me?
He said that if I give my hand

227
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:19,770
a little time to heal, I'll be
boxing in no time!

228
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,273
Oh man, I can hardly wait
to get back into the gym

229
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:25,109
and start training again!

230
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:26,360
You awake?

231
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:50,343
Thank goodness, he's awake!

232
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:51,552
Apa!

233
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:54,263
Where am I?

234
00:13:54,263 --> 00:13:56,849
You're in the 3rd
circle of hell.

235
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:58,768
I can't believe you let
that delinquent punk

236
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:00,728
clean your clock like that.

237
00:14:00,728 --> 00:14:02,855
I promise you this, the
training session we're about

238
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:05,650
to put you through's gonna make
you wish you were in hell!

239
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,902
Hey, guys just cut
him a little slack!

240
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:11,197
Kenichi stood up for himself and
did everything he could to win!

241
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:13,157
But he still lost!

242
00:14:13,157 --> 00:14:15,618
Let me tell you what's
gonna happen to you now.

243
00:14:15,618 --> 00:14:18,454
You're in way over your head.
Since you got your butt kicked,

244
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:20,539
everyone in the entire school
is gonna be comin' knockin',

245
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,083
lookin' for a
piece of Kenichi.

246
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,918
Your name's gonna be
spread all over town

247
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,836
by the end of the day
and there's nothin'

248
00:14:25,836 --> 00:14:27,755
you can do to stop
what's coming at you.

249
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:30,341
Once rumor spreads that
this crazy haired guy beat you,

250
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:32,885
every single person that's been
too afraid to step up to you,

251
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:35,972
will take this opportunity
to take you down!

252
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:37,848
'Course now that you've
lost your first fight,

253
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:40,309
you're bound to keep losin'
over and over again.

254
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:41,143
True.

255
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:45,147
Many fighters aren't ever able
to break such a vicious cycle.

256
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:47,650
If only Apachai knew how
to count straight through

257
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,071
to 100, the good luck charm
might have worked out!

258
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:55,950
As senseis, we felt it was our
duty to warn you ahead of time,

259
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,035
so be careful,
and protect yourself.

260
00:14:58,035 --> 00:15:00,705
More than careful.
We're not tryin' to scare you,

261
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:02,039
we just wanna give
you a head's up.

262
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:04,750
You'd better start watchin'
your back at school tomorrow!

263
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,544
But you are scaring me!

264
00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:09,380
Oh I wouldn't worry about it
if I were you, you'll be fine!

265
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,924
Just avoid the dark alleyways!

266
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:13,926
You know, that really doesn't
make me feel any better,

267
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:15,803
in fact, now I feel worse.

268
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:17,555
Wait a sec, I don't
remember anything,

269
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:20,516
how did I get back here anyways?
Was I dreaming or did Takeda--

270
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:22,309
Yep.

271
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:24,478
You're lucky your friend
showed up when he did.

272
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:26,522
That guy was about
to break your legs!

273
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:28,232
Takeda rescued me?

274
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:30,067
When you face off
against an opponent,

275
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:32,778
you have to be ruthless.
A split second decision

276
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:35,656
can make all the difference
between winning and losing.

277
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:37,950
Remember this? The
moment you were certain

278
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,952
you had him beat, you
let your guard down!

279
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:41,537
Hey! How'd you get this on tape?

280
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:43,205
You were hiding in the
bushes the whole time,

281
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:44,331
and you didn't help me?!

282
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:47,126
Well uh...

283
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:48,419
Yes.

284
00:15:54,258 --> 00:15:56,177
Well, I'd better go,
or I'm gonna be late.

285
00:15:56,177 --> 00:15:57,511
I've gotta get to the club!

286
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:58,179
Okay then!

287
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:00,347
Try to be careful on
your way home, okay?

288
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:03,350
Remember, your wounds haven't
had a chance to heal yet!

289
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,685
Right!

290
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:15,196
I wonder if those guys are
really going to come after me

291
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:16,864
like everyone said?

292
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,329
Why are you sneaking
around Kenichi?

293
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,206
You scared the crap
out of me you jerk!

294
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:26,082
What's wrong with you?!

295
00:16:26,082 --> 00:16:27,958
Take it easy there,
buddy I just wanna know

296
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,044
why you're sneaking around.

297
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:32,004
Why don't you mind
your own business?

298
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:33,547
That's right, I forgot!

299
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:36,634
I heard you got smacked around
by one of the Rangnarok guys!

300
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:39,178
That's a lie, where did
you hear that? Tell me!

301
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:40,763
And how many people
have you told?

302
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:44,475
Who would I have told?
The whole school knows!

303
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:47,853
Guys! Kenichi's here and
he's still kinda beat up

304
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:50,147
so if you're looking for
a chance to kick his butt,

305
00:16:50,147 --> 00:16:51,398
now's the time to strike!

306
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:53,901
You shut up! Are you trying
to get me killed, idiot?

307
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:58,197
Excellent work, Niijima.
We finally found him!

308
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:00,074
I've heard a lot
about you, kid.

309
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:01,617
Word on the street
is your head's

310
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:05,538
getting too big for
your own good!

311
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:06,747
I wouldn't say that.

312
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:08,749
I'd say my head's just
about the right size!

313
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:09,875
Why Niijima?!

314
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:14,797
We're not best friends but I
didn't think you wanted me dead!

315
00:17:14,797 --> 00:17:16,423
Come back here!

316
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:17,466
Hmph!

317
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:20,094
I have such high
expectations for him.

318
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:23,514
Can the bullied weakling
become the powerful hero?

319
00:17:23,514 --> 00:17:25,808
Can he rise like a
phoenix from the ashes

320
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:28,435
and be triumphant over
the evil doers?

321
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:31,230
In all honesty I don't really
care what happens to anyone

322
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,066
else, not as long as
I stay entertained!

323
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,651
Gods, if you hear me,

324
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:40,030
rain down hell, fire, brimstone,
and suffering upon him!

325
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,786
What a freak!

326
00:17:56,592 --> 00:18:00,430
Looks like your back's
against the wall!

327
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,793
Somebody messed up.

328
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:03,510
Running away isn't
an option this time!

329
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,554
Who says I was running? I wasn't
trying to escape you guys,

330
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:09,682
this was just part
of my strategy!

331
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:13,812
You actually think that being
cornered is a strategy?

332
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:17,023
What about getting attacked
from both directions?

333
00:18:17,023 --> 00:18:19,526
'Course this was just
a happy accident.

334
00:18:19,526 --> 00:18:20,819
This ain't fair.

335
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:23,530
There's three of you big fellas
and only one of my friend,

336
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,031
and he's injured.

337
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:26,866
That's pretty pathetic
if you ask me.

338
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:29,744
You're Takeda right?
I've heard of you.

339
00:18:29,744 --> 00:18:32,288
I've got Kenichi's back, so if
you wanna get a piece of him,

340
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:34,541
then you're gonna
have to deal with me!

341
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,918
Go ahead and keep on
talking smack, you punk!

342
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:39,379
We know you left Ragnarok
so you don't have anyone

343
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:42,048
to back you up! we heard
they're coming for you, boxer.

344
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:44,259
If I were you, I'd worry
about my own problems

345
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:46,302
and keep my nose out of
other people's business!

346
00:18:46,302 --> 00:18:47,971
I'm running out
of patience here.

347
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:52,142
Are we gonna do
this thing or what?

348
00:18:52,142 --> 00:18:55,228
You're lucky we're lettin' you
off the hook this time, boxer!

349
00:18:55,228 --> 00:18:56,437
Oh, man.

350
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:59,858
Don't worry about those guys,
they're just a bunch of losers!

351
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:00,900
Uhm...

352
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,861
I really don't know
what to say.

353
00:19:02,861 --> 00:19:06,239
Thank you so much for
bailing me out again.

354
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:09,325
It's no big deal. I
owe you big time, kid.

355
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:12,245
I could stick up for you every
day for the rest of my life

356
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:13,955
and I would still
be in your debt!

357
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:15,456
They say my hand's
gonna be fine.

358
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:18,001
I'm okay'ed to get back into the
gym first thing next month!

359
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:20,295
Are you serious?
Congratulations, man!

360
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:21,963
That's awesome!

361
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:24,549
I've got you to thank.
My career would've been over

362
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:26,676
if it weren't for you
and your sensei.

363
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:27,719
Hey, but listen,

364
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:30,263
'Got a reputation to uphold
so try not to get beat up.

365
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:31,806
You were the guy who beat me.

366
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:34,517
If you lose, it makes us both
look like a couple of chumps!

367
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:36,019
Yeah, sorry about that.

368
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:37,979
For some reason I
totally lose confidence

369
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:40,732
whenever I have to face
up to a thug like him.

370
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:42,400
Hold it!

371
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,193
Oh man, this is not good!

372
00:19:44,193 --> 00:19:45,778
What's up, Ukita?

373
00:19:45,778 --> 00:19:47,906
Hey Takeda. I just heard.

374
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:51,492
So you decided to quit
Ragnarok and become a boxer?

375
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:52,785
Yeah.

376
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:55,663
Come on, you guys are friends,
it's not worth fighting!

377
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:57,624
To tell ya the truth I've
never really thought

378
00:19:57,624 --> 00:20:00,335
you belonged with us. You
always seemed kinda different

379
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:02,170
from me and the other guys.

380
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,673
And now I've finally figured out
why you felt so out of place!

381
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:08,426
Deep down, you've never
been a delinquent.

382
00:20:08,426 --> 00:20:11,179
You're a boxer!

383
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:13,890
A true sportsman
belongs in the ring!

384
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,893
I'm glad to hear that your left
arm is workin' for ya again.

385
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:20,021
I'll try to buy ya as much
time as I can with Ragnarok.

386
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:22,649
but if I were you,
I'd start training.

387
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,822
See ya, Takeda the Puncher!

388
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:32,992
See ya 'round,
Ukita the Thrower!

389
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:35,828
You're lucky to have
a friend like him.

390
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:38,164
He's nothing like my
traitorous alien friend!

391
00:20:38,164 --> 00:20:40,375
Ah-choo!

392
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:44,629
Someone must be
talking about me.

393
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,638
Attention! I would
like to begin

394
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:56,349
the Ryozanpaku summit
meeting at once!

395
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:58,851
It would be nothing short of
a disgrace to the martial arts

396
00:20:58,851 --> 00:21:00,895
to allow Kenichi to
carry on this way.

397
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:02,814
We've been far too
easy on the boy

398
00:21:02,814 --> 00:21:05,817
and I am recommending
that this change at once!

399
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:08,111
I'd like to propose a new
approach that will take

400
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:10,488
his training to the
next level of intensity!

401
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:12,156
I call it...

402
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:16,911
"Phase Two: Transform into a
Real Fighter or Die Trying!"

403
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:18,663
Yay! Self-sacrefice!

404
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:20,456
That's what I'm talkin' about!

405
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:24,794
So, how do we go about
executing this new initiative?

406
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:26,045
It's simple.

407
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:28,798
First, we force the boy
to move into Ryozanpaku.

408
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:31,050
After that, we
infuse martial arts

409
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,469
into each aspect of his life.
Once he's reached

410
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:36,097
the point of exhaustion, martial
arts will be his only solace!

411
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:38,182
We make him recognize
that he is nothing

412
00:21:38,182 --> 00:21:40,893
but a product of martial arts!
He'll live martial arts

413
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:42,478
and breathe martial arts,
until he comes

414
00:21:42,478 --> 00:21:44,355
to the fork in the road
where he has

415
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:46,774
only two options before him!

416
00:21:46,774 --> 00:21:48,860
Martial Arts or death!

417
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:53,281
It's genius. We'll force
Kenichi to become a resident

418
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:56,159
of Ryozanpaku and then
bend him to our will!

419
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,618
That is correct!

420
00:21:57,618 --> 00:21:58,786
Finally!

421
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:02,123
We can stop playing games
and begin the real training!

422
00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:14,385
Ah-choo!

423
00:22:20,391 --> 00:22:23,019
Man, this sucks.
I just got the chills.

424
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:26,773
You catching a cold?
You better not get me sick!

425
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:27,523
What the--

426
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:30,276
How'd you get in here and why
are wearing my pajamas?

427
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:32,361
Oh whatever, it's not
that big of a deal.

428
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:35,281
Your pjs are just
more comfy than mine!

429
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:38,618
I don't care if they're comfy
or not they're mine, got it?

430
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:40,787
Now go change and give 'em back!
You're gonna catch a cold!

431
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:41,829
You big stupid head!

432
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:44,332
I don't wanna wear your
smelly pjs anyway!

433
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:45,500
I'm gonna go change!

434
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,044
Great! Now I'm gonna have
to wash the girl off of 'em!

435
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:49,295
Shut your face!

436
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:50,797
Fine! I'm just gonna keep 'em!

437
00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:53,424
Give me back my pajamas! Mom!

438
00:24:19,343 --> 00:24:20,928
That's it for
today's training.

439
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:23,097
It's not good to push
yourself too hard, you know?

440
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:25,016
You've gotta be kidding me!
We just started!

441
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:26,934
How are you feeling?
Does it hurt anywhere?

442
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:28,060
Are you in any pain?

443
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,980
Because if you are, I'll be sure
to take care of that right away.

444
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,482
Why is everybody being so
nice to me all of a sudden?

445
00:24:33,482 --> 00:24:35,359
Something's up. What's
going on with around here?

446
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,402
Are you guys
plotting something?

447
00:24:36,402 --> 00:24:37,278
Tell me!

448
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:39,322
You see, starting tomorrow
you're going to come here

449
00:24:39,322 --> 00:24:40,907
to live and start
your special training.

450
00:24:40,907 --> 00:24:42,200
It wouldn't be
fun for anyone

451
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,701
to hurt yourself before
that, would it?

452
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:46,120
What are you guys talking about?
I don't wanna live here!

453
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,206
I didn't sign up for this!
