[Music]

2
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:45,489
Tanimoto is Hermit?

3
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:46,782
I don't understand.

4
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:48,993
Yeah, I was pretty confused
about that myself...

5
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:50,286
but it looks like
the friend thing

6
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:51,787
was just an act
to pull me in.

7
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,375
Whoever he is...

8
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,879
that kid has received
some impressive training.

9
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,005
Yes, I agree...

10
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:02,798
Such skill is rare
in one so young.

11
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:22,902
Chalk it up to
experience, I suppose.

12
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:25,446
Easy for you to say!

13
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:26,655
What is it?

14
00:02:26,655 --> 00:02:27,990
It's just... Hermit-

15
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,867
I mean Tanimoto-
asked me something...

16
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,410
While we were in the
middle of fighting

17
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,330
he asked me if my master's
name was Sougetsu Ma.

18
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,789
Does that make
any sense to you?

19
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:41,462
Master...?
What's wrong...?

20
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:42,796
Let's go...

21
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,673
You've put off your
training long enough.

22
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:45,674
Right. I'm sorry.

23
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:56,310
Not fast enough!

24
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,687
Kenichi must be quick
like tiny rabbit!

25
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:01,690
I've never seen Kensei
look so serious before...

26
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,233
Who is Sougetsu Ma?

27
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,486
I have to know!

28
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,821
Something tells me he's not just
gonna spit it out, though.

29
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,658
For all I know
everyone here

30
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:11,784
could have some
sort of secret past

31
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:13,494
they're not letting
me in on...

32
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:14,870
I'm supposed to be
their disciple

33
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,413
and they don't tell
me anything...!

34
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:17,748
It's not fair.

35
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:20,167
Faster, faster, faster,
faster, faster...

36
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,507
A-pa-pa!!

37
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:29,760
Oh! Tiny rabbit
got distracted!

38
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,347
Your magazine's
upside down.

39
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,682
Is not!

40
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:37,643
Something is
definitely wrong...

41
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:39,561
But right now...

42
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:42,356
Uh-oh! Kenichi,
please don't die!

43
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,693
Another day in hell...

44
00:03:52,324 --> 00:03:54,535
What's he doing sneaking out
in the middle of the night?

45
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:10,759
I've followed
him this far...

46
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,094
can't let him
get away now...

47
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:14,096
Ah! Too late!

48
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:15,556
He's gone!

49
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:18,308
Man... where the
hell did he go...?

50
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:19,643
I'm so stupid...

51
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:24,356
Okay, I'm the worst spy ever.

52
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:26,608
Did that even count
as espionage...?

53
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:28,485
I kept expecting you
to do a little dance

54
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,321
and wave a red flag.

55
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:33,032
This is as far as you should
accompany me, Kenichi...

56
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:35,034
Have some take
out and go home...

57
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:37,870
It's on me this time,
don't worry about it.

58
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,996
No, thank you!

59
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:44,043
I'm afraid it'll be impossible
to guarantee your safety

60
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:46,003
if you follow me any
longer tonight...

61
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:48,172
now be a good disciple
and run along home

62
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:49,506
before things get sticky.

63
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,718
Being your disciple isn't
just about training together

64
00:04:52,718 --> 00:04:53,927
and living under
the same roof,

65
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,804
it's about sharing
your burdens, too...!

66
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:57,514
I want to go with you, Master!

67
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:59,433
So you're prepared, then...?

68
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,143
To face whatever may happen?

69
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:02,519
I am!

70
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,897
Alright-y...
you can come along...

71
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:06,690
But this means that
if I jump off a cliff,

72
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,609
you have to do it
too, you know...

73
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:11,487
That's the rule
of following.

74
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:13,405
Please be joking.

75
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:18,243
Cool! We get to eat first?

76
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:20,120
Ahhhh.

77
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,832
I figured you'd show your
face sooner or later... Kensei.

78
00:05:23,832 --> 00:05:25,209
Master Hakubi...

79
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:27,836
It's been a long time.

80
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:29,046
What is this place...?

81
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:30,130
A bald club?

82
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,257
I'm not bald.

83
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:35,386
No... This man is the strongest
fighter in the district...

84
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:38,055
Actually, his entire
name is Hakubi Ma Ryou...

85
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:39,431
And he is my uncle.

86
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,776
A feast...!
I'm in heaven!!

87
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:52,444
Eat as much as you'd like.

88
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:53,862
Ah! You're a good man...

89
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:55,364
And not--bald at all!

90
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:56,365
Thank you.

91
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:57,783
Time to eat!

92
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:01,328
Tell me, Kensei...

93
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,247
I know two reasons you
might have come here today,

94
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:04,706
so which is it...?

95
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:07,376
Are you looking
for Sougetsu?

96
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:08,418
That's right...

97
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:10,129
Is it true he's in
the country then?

98
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:11,422
Yes.

99
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:12,881
Alright. Then I suppose

100
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:14,591
I'll have to have a
little chat with him.

101
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:15,884
A chat, huh...?

102
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:17,553
Do you really think
that's going to help?

103
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:19,304
Who is this Sougetsu guy?

104
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:20,806
Sougetsu Ma...

105
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:22,641
Otherwise known as
my big brother...

106
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:24,852
What...?! You have a brother?!

107
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,104
Mmm... a troublesome
one at that...

108
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:29,940
Chaos seems to follow him
around like a puppy...

109
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,151
Right now he's being
hunted by some of the mafia's

110
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:34,319
most notorious hit men.

111
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,156
That's just who Sougetsu is,
he was born to fight...

112
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:40,200
He's never been able to control
those brutal tendencies...

113
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,995
But this district can't afford
the surge of violent crime

114
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:44,037
he'll bring
along with him.

115
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,290
I know...
I will find him.

116
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,417
You really just come
here for your brother?

117
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,628
Oh... That's
the other reason

118
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,380
I thought you might
have for stopping by.

119
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,724
Man. He's fast.

120
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,310
Not a bad attempt for
such a lovely young lady,

121
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,061
but I'm afraid I have
years of experience

122
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,355
dodging similar
attempts on my life.

123
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,443
What...? Who's she?

124
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:18,197
Really, Daddy?
I don't even get a hello...?

125
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:20,032
That's nice.

126
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:22,409
Daddy...? Like sugar daddy...?

127
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,578
So he... and she, they...

128
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,747
-They're like a... ahhhhhh
-Ew! No! We're not!

129
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:29,208
She's my daughter, Renka,
you disgusting boy!

130
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,336
She's sixteen!

131
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:33,795
Wha...?!

132
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:36,089
You mean you have
a daughter?...?

133
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,009
Come to think of it, you've
mentioned that before.

134
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:41,595
Huh. Don't worry, your
wife and the other two kids

135
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,930
are still far away in China.

136
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,264
That's right, Daddy,

137
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,683
I'm the only one you should
be worrying about right now...

138
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:48,518
I've had this place
staked out for weeks...!

139
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,479
Knew you'd show up someday!

140
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,566
I'm taking you back
home with me tonight!

141
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:57,861
We-heh-hell...! Kensei,
I'd say you're in a pickle.

142
00:07:57,861 --> 00:08:00,113
Now come on...!
Just give it up, old man.

143
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,156
Forgive me, dear.

144
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:09,248
Well... Guess that's a wrap.

145
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:10,374
Not... funny.

146
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:12,167
Wait! Don't go, Daddy!

147
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,210
Kensei!!

148
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:16,255
Get your face...
out of there!

149
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:17,839
This. Is not. My fault.

150
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,716
Believe me, you're not
who I meant to catch.

151
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:20,926
Yeah, I got that...

152
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:22,302
Why are you trying
to force your dad

153
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,762
to come home anyway?

154
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:26,223
Geez you really don't
know anything, do you?

155
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:28,976
My dad is the leader of the
Phoenix martial arts sect.

156
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,353
He has over 10,000
disciples waiting for him

157
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:32,813
back in China.

158
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:36,024
Really? That's so cool.

159
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:38,944
Yeah. Well dad said it was
too much responsibility.

160
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:41,113
He gave all the leadership
duties over to mama,

161
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:43,031
packed a bag,
and disappeared.

162
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:44,449
Sounds right.

163
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:45,742
And now I find
him in Japan,

164
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,744
hanging around with
some loser kid...

165
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,204
so exactly who
are you, again?

166
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:50,998
Oh... Who, me...?

167
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,624
I'm Kenichi Shirihama...

168
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:54,042
a sophomore in
high school...

169
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,753
And I happen to be your
father's number one disciple!

170
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,177
You idiot...! Didn't anyone
teach you to dodge a punch?!!

171
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,262
Poor Daddy!

172
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:06,596
He's sunk so low in life

173
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:09,474
that he can only find one
scrawny little disciple...!

174
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:11,184
Oh, it must be humiliating

175
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:14,354
to have a student who can't
fend off one helpless girl!

176
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,398
He seems okay with it.

177
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:18,650
Oh... You're up already...

178
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,069
Well, at least you can
take a punch... kind of...

179
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,364
Yeah... The masters are
always saying that...

180
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,533
I have an unparalleled
ability to get beat up.

181
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,868
And that makes you what?...?

182
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:28,994
Proud?

183
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:31,330
Please stop hitting me,
Kensei's daughter.

184
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,790
So. Where did my
dad run off to?

185
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,875
How should I know...?

186
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,001
You're his daughter,
aren't you?

187
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,711
Shouldn't you
have some idea?

188
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,588
If I did, you'd think
I'd be wasting time

189
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:41,340
with his charity project?

190
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:49,076
So. Not the best part of town.

191
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:51,078
Lots of scary people.

192
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:53,372
This whole neighborhood's
under the control of the mafia.

193
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:55,291
Then whaddaya say
we get outta here

194
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,501
and get ourselves a
latte or something?

195
00:09:57,501 --> 00:10:00,129
You can go. I have something
I wanna ask these guys.

196
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:01,380
Oh yeah? What's that?

197
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,716
Where I can find
my uncle Sogetsu.

198
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:05,760
Hold up! You mean you're
not looking for Kensei??

199
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,844
Boy you're slow...!

200
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:09,055
You see my dad is looking
for uncle Sogetsu,

201
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:11,057
so if we find him first,
we can ambush him.

202
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:13,225
Umm... do you know why...

203
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:17,188
your uncle's being
targeted by the mafia?

204
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:19,106
Because he betrayed them.

205
00:10:19,106 --> 00:10:21,776
So you're sayin' I
don't gotta hold back?

206
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:23,069
No reason to.

207
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:25,738
If we don't kill him
he'll just kill all of us.

208
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:27,740
You mean like how he
bumped off that whole family

209
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,409
of 14K Triads back
in China, right boss?

210
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:31,702
Yeah.

211
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:32,620
But how do you know
he's gonna show up here

212
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,914
and fight me, boss?

213
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:37,083
A guy like him can't resist
the lure of a good fight,

214
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,542
no matter what...

215
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:39,960
When he hears our strongest
fighter is waiting here,

216
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,045
he'll take the bait.

217
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:42,380
And I'll be right here,

218
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,715
ready to take him
out when he does.

219
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:46,842
We'll show that traitor
what happens in our world

220
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:49,053
when you don't hold up
your end of a bargain...

221
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:50,179
You get dead.

222
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:55,768
I give up.

223
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:57,019
You can't give up.

224
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,938
We just have to
find one clue.

225
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:01,440
He's there...? Just keep
him busy, I'm on my way.

226
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,651
You! Where's Sogetsu Ma?

227
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:04,860
And who the hell are you?

228
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,404
Just answer...!
Where is he?

229
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:15,496
What's that a sword-belt...?

230
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:16,914
Well that's a new one.

231
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:17,998
And you...

232
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:19,125
That fancy move...

233
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,460
That was no Chinese martial
art I've ever seen.

234
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,379
No... It's Japanese Jujitsu.

235
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:25,339
-Jujitsu?
-Yeah...

236
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:26,549
I'm learning a bunch of
different disciplines

237
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:27,716
at the moment...

238
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:30,511
Let's see, there's Karate,
and Jujitsu, and Muay...

239
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:31,804
What is this,
some kinda buffet?

240
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:32,805
You don't just take
one of everything

241
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:33,973
and see what tastes good!

242
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:35,766
You pick a discipline and
stick with it, you jerk!

243
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:40,020
Oh! 'Scuse me.

244
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:42,439
What do we have here...?

245
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,066
Trying to sneak something
out of my pocket

246
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:45,359
or something into it?

247
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,027
I was just testing you...

248
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:48,529
I heard that
you were fast...

249
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:50,281
I've got a note
from Hakubi for ya.

250
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:52,533
Well maybe next time
hand it to me...

251
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:53,993
I could have broken
your arm, stupid boy.

252
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,244
I'll remember that.

253
00:11:55,244 --> 00:11:56,412
Hmmm...

254
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:57,705
If Hakubi's right,

255
00:11:57,705 --> 00:12:00,291
maybe I can stop this
from going any further...

256
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,376
So this is where
you've been!

257
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:04,336
We all waited for you
there for over an hour

258
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:06,422
and you were off training
again, just like always...

259
00:12:06,422 --> 00:12:07,923
I can't believe I
went to the trouble

260
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:10,426
to set you up on a blind
date and you no-showed!

261
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:13,220
Come on, man, I'm just trying to
get my big brother to realize

262
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,346
there might be more to life

263
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:16,765
than sparring matches
and alcohol, ya know?

264
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:19,852
I like sparring matches
and alcohol better than girls...

265
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,854
Girls are always
chattering and giggling...

266
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:23,230
it's annoying.

267
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,609
Trust me, man, the benefits
seriously outweigh the costs.

268
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:28,527
Yeah, I think I'd
rather bash heads in.

269
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:29,653
Fine...

270
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:32,114
Just tell me you
didn't kill anyone.

271
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:33,991
I don't think I did.

272
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:35,201
You don't think you did??

273
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:36,577
You've gotta get a
hold of yourself!

274
00:12:36,577 --> 00:12:38,078
Lately it seems like
you're trying to kill

275
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,079
everyone you fight.

276
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,331
I am!

277
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,124
That's what
martial arts means!

278
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:44,585
It's the art of death,
used to defeat your enemy.

279
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:47,505
You're serious.

280
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:53,594
I don't get it, if Kensei
and Sougetsu are brothers...

281
00:12:53,594 --> 00:12:56,055
then how come they don't
talk to each other anymore?

282
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:57,097
Twenty years ago,

283
00:12:57,097 --> 00:12:59,266
my uncle killed some
people back in China...

284
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:01,227
and he had to leave
the country for good.

285
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:03,395
Really...? He murdered people?

286
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,068
This is the place.

287
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:10,986
And this is the end
of the line, kid...

288
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:13,489
Inside that building lies a
world of corruption and violence

289
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,783
you've never seen before.

290
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:17,201
You'll be putting
your life on the line

291
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:18,702
if you go any further...

292
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:20,996
Ask yourself if you're
really up for that.

293
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:23,582
What would you say if I tried
to stop you from going in?

294
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:24,792
I'd say 'bite me!'

295
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:26,293
And that's how I feel...!

296
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:28,504
I'm not letting a girl walk
into a place like that,

297
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:30,589
looking for a
murderer, all alone.

298
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:33,384
Jeez... Is this guy for real?

299
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:34,635
Who are you kidding?!

300
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:35,886
I'd be better off
alone than taking you!

301
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:38,305
You're probably gonna get
us both killed, amateur!

302
00:13:38,305 --> 00:13:41,600
What was daddy thinking,
taking on this puny weakling?

303
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,726
Well, if you
really want to come

304
00:13:42,726 --> 00:13:44,436
I guess I can't
stop you...

305
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:45,980
But I can't
guarantee your life!

306
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,439
I'm sure we'll be fine,

307
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:49,650
I mean this guy is
your uncle, right...?

308
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,652
It's not like he's gonna
kill his own family...

309
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:53,237
Maybe he'll
listen to reason.

310
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:54,280
Sure. Right.

311
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,406
Sure! Right!

312
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:57,241
You just have to
be more peaceful.

313
00:13:57,241 --> 00:13:58,826
Fighting isn't
the only answer.

314
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:05,499
Didn't we just agree
to be more peaceful?!

315
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:06,750
I am being more peaceful.

316
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,920
I didn't kill
anybody, did I?

317
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,840
I can't let uncle Sogetsu get
away with what he's doing...

318
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,426
He's shaming the Ma family
by dealing with the mafia,

319
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:16,593
and I'm putting
a stop to it.

320
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:20,389
Wait...!I'm
coming with you!

321
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:22,641
Renka!

322
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:24,101
Oh.

323
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:25,311
Get down!

324
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,358
Ow...! Man!

325
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:33,569
-What was that?
-That... was uncle Sogetsu.

326
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:37,031
Huh...

327
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:40,451
I thought this one was
supposed to be strong...

328
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:42,161
What a disappointment.

329
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:19,182
Sougetsu Ma!

330
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:20,850
You're done
shaming our family!

331
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:27,399
Interesting... that kick...

332
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,109
I'd recognize
the form anywhere,

333
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:30,485
but I don't recognize you.

334
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:31,569
No, wait...!

335
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:34,030
Don't hurt her, she's
Kensei Ma's daughter...!

336
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,324
She's your own niece!

337
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:37,867
I suppose I should've
guessed that...

338
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:39,369
But no matter
who her father is,

339
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:41,371
she attacked me as
a martial artist...

340
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:42,330
Besides...

341
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:45,417
I said goodbye to
my family long ago.

342
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:00,473
Weird...

343
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,767
Kenichi hasn't come
back to the dojo yet?

344
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,644
No. Is sad...

345
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:06,813
He said we'd play the
black and white game.

346
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:09,816
Kenichi followed Kensei
into town a few hours ago...

347
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:10,942
..Lame.

348
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:12,444
Oh... Alright then.

349
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:15,613
Who knows what den of sin
Kensei's introducing him to...

350
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:25,790
Brother... I see that
you haven't changed.

351
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,335
Never thought I'd run
into you, Kensei...

352
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:31,004
I guess this trip
was worth it.

353
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:32,422
Hang on, Renka.

354
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,798
Kenichi.

355
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:35,508
I want you to
take her and go.

356
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:37,510
No! I'm not leaving
you alone with him!

357
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,678
So that runt...

358
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:40,138
Is he your disciple?

359
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:44,059
Hah... I'll never understand

360
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:45,477
why you live this way...

361
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:47,354
wasting your time
training weaklings

362
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:48,980
when you could be
a great fighter.

363
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,565
Hey! I'm not weak!

364
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:55,362
Twenty years and you still
can't see the truth, can you?

365
00:16:57,614 --> 00:17:00,158
We can try to go
back, Sougetsu...

366
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:02,035
Find the man you
could have been.

367
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:03,828
No... It's too
late for that.

368
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:07,499
Then you leave
me no choice...

369
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:09,459
As your brother,
it's my duty to stop you.

370
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,046
Don't get cocky... Kensei.

371
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:14,756
That stance...

372
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:17,592
In a normal fight the left
hand is above the right...

373
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:20,261
But they both have their
right hands on top,

374
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:22,347
which can only
mean one thing...

375
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:24,849
This is a fight
to the death!

376
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,351
Master! Don't do it...!

377
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:28,186
You'll never be able
to forgive yourself!

378
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:36,361
I've never seen
anything like this!

379
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:51,126
I've never watched two masters
in a fight this intense...

380
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:52,544
It's unbelievable.

381
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:53,712
It's like...

382
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:56,172
It's like watching them
duel for their souls.

383
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:11,563
Fist of Heaven!

384
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:16,317
Well...

385
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:18,445
Looks like your defense
is as strong as ever...

386
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:21,072
Not just anybody can
absorb my attack like that.

387
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:22,824
Your attack has
no technique.

388
00:18:22,824 --> 00:18:24,325
It can't hurt me...

389
00:18:24,325 --> 00:18:27,078
I'm surprised at how little
you've improved in this time.

390
00:18:27,078 --> 00:18:29,748
But then, I suppose when you
lost your heart as a man...

391
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:32,000
-your art lost its heart, too.
-Shut up!

392
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,084
Sougetsu the Strong...

393
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:34,669
and Kensei the Slick...

394
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:35,879
They were revered
as China's most

395
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:37,839
accomplished martial artists.

396
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,217
No doubt... Wonder which one's
the most accomplished now.

397
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:42,927
Let's see you
fight this...

398
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:44,679
Master Sougetsu.

399
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:45,722
Do it.

400
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:46,598
Right.

401
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:53,146
What happened?

402
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:54,481
Now you die!

403
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:58,318
Son of a bitch.

404
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:04,324
Oh no...

405
00:19:04,324 --> 00:19:05,950
Kensei lost?

406
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,203
I told you, martial
arts is the art of death

407
00:19:08,203 --> 00:19:09,954
used to defeat your enemy...

408
00:19:09,954 --> 00:19:11,372
It's not a tool
for the weak.

409
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,214
It's not the tool
that makes a killer...

410
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:21,132
It's the spirit of
he who weilds it...

411
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:22,509
You're a fool to think

412
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:25,762
strength gives you
the right to kill.

413
00:19:25,762 --> 00:19:28,223
But... I don't understand
how this happened...

414
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:29,808
how'd you beat me?

415
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:31,643
I have the strength
of my friends...

416
00:19:31,643 --> 00:19:33,019
all of their training...

417
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:35,730
When you fought me, you
fought each of them as well...

418
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,148
but you've been
training alone,

419
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:38,691
so you fought alone today.

420
00:19:42,362 --> 00:19:44,322
We have to go!
This place is collapsing!

421
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:45,740
Daddy!

422
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,117
'Course... surrounded by people
who're worried about you,

423
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:50,578
like always.

424
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:52,664
I never had anyone
who cared about me...

425
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:54,415
or supported me...

426
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:55,625
But you...

427
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,169
You were always popular.

428
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:01,130
I didn't leave China because
I was running from what I did.

429
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,926
I was looking for
my place to be...

430
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:07,011
Somewhere I might
actually belong.

431
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:08,179
Brother...

432
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:11,307
It's not gonna hold
much longer, master!

433
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:14,727
Go on, Kensei...

434
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:15,520
Get outta here.

435
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:25,446
Alright, kids...
Let's get going.

436
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,244
We're just gonna leave...?

437
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:33,288
But he'll die!

438
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:35,665
You can try to get him out
the door if you'd like...

439
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:38,877
I'm sure my brother would
prefer to go out fighting.

440
00:20:38,877 --> 00:20:40,962
He'd rather die?

441
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:42,547
Is that what a
fighter's world is like?

442
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:43,464
Hurry!

443
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:54,309
No better than I
deserve I guess...

444
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:55,727
At least it's over.

445
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:06,112
I can't let you do this...

446
00:21:06,112 --> 00:21:07,572
Damn it, he's your brother!

447
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,619
Is this guy freakin' crazy?!

448
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:13,911
Come on. Let's go.

449
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:15,371
Why...? It's done.

450
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:17,624
Because I'm a disciple,
that's why...!

451
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:19,876
And I can't just watch
a master die like this.

452
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:21,544
You're not my disciple.

453
00:21:21,544 --> 00:21:23,129
I may not be...

454
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:25,173
But think I know someone
who feels differently.

455
00:21:26,424 --> 00:21:27,800
You mean, Natsu.

456
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:31,012
He had the same look
in his eyes I did

457
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:32,096
when I was a kid.

458
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:34,015
He called you his master...

459
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:35,266
And he would
want you to live!

460
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:38,853
Jeez... Are you for real...?

461
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:42,148
Kensei really found himself a
weird one this time, didn't he?

462
00:21:56,954 --> 00:21:59,123
Neither the rescue team
nor the cleanup crew

463
00:21:59,123 --> 00:22:02,251
ever found Sougetsu's body...

464
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:04,921
On the way back
to Ryouzanpaku...

465
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:07,882
Kensei didn't really
have much to say...

466
00:22:07,882 --> 00:22:10,134
But I could've sworn when I
headed to my room that night,

467
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:11,803
I heard him whisper...

468
00:22:11,803 --> 00:22:13,054
thank you.

469
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,311
And even though he's
not quite himself yet...

470
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:22,230
He's slowly getting
back to normal.

471
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,401
So... Are you sure it's okay

472
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:29,070
you didn't go back
home with Renka?

473
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,196
Of course.

474
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:31,698
This is my home now...

475
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:35,618
I'm sure deep down
she understands.

476
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:37,995
That sneaky rat.

477
00:22:37,995 --> 00:22:39,372
What kind of a father

478
00:22:39,372 --> 00:22:40,790
refuses to come home
with his daughter

479
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,959
when all she wants to do is
take care of him lovingly?!

480
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,961
Now, now... That won't
get anything clean.

481
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,672
And who knows...

482
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:49,215
Maybe I'll even
drag that Kenichi guy

483
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:50,591
back home with us, too.

484
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,266
[Music]

485
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:20,348
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

486
00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:21,724
What's the
matter, Kenichi?

487
00:24:21,724 --> 00:24:23,518
My locker. There's a
letter in my locker.

488
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:24,602
It's pink.

489
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:26,896
And I'm pretty sure...
It's a love letter.

490
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:29,148
Oh.

491
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:31,192
Wow. Aren't you
the popular one.

492
00:24:31,192 --> 00:24:33,277
No! I mean, I don't wanna be!

493
00:24:33,277 --> 00:24:35,321
I mean it's not like that
Miu, really! I swear!

494
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:38,366
Well, don't let me stop you
from reading your love letter.

495
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:39,492
I'll get out of your hair.

496
00:24:39,492 --> 00:24:40,993
Miu! Wait! I...

497
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:43,079
Aaaaah! This sucks...!

498
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,580
But I wonder
who it's from...
