1
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,538
Back to the ol'
strategic withdrawal.

2
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,248
Not the most
exciting of options,

3
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,583
but definitely the safest.

4
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,376
And if you avoid a
problem long enough,

5
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,295
it'll eventually go away, right?

6
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,924
But these Ragnarok goons
are so darn persistent.

7
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,051
I don't even get
Sundays to relax.

8
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,094
Well, look who's
finally bagged the prize!

9
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,180
Me, Takashi Furukawa!

10
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,225
That name don't mean much right
now, but you wait, pretty soon

11
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:24,102
everybody's gonna know me as
the number-one guy in Ragnarok!

12
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,188
Oh, can it! I don't
care who you are!

13
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,523
Right now you're screwing up

14
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,233
my only day to go
shopping with Miu!

15
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,776
I've been waiting for
this all week!

16
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:31,985
Not my problem.

17
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,488
If I can manage to drag you
back to Kisara's place,

18
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,283
chances are she'll make me
one of her top go-to guys!

19
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,411
Kisara? Who the heck is that?

20
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,996
Just one last thing.

21
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,748
Fine, what is it.

22
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,377
Call off your crazy
girlfriend, huh?!

23
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,176
Amazing as always...

24
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,512
She's taken out five guys
in less than two minutes

25
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,639
and hasn't even broken a sweat!

26
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,765
Hang on a sec,

27
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,143
maybe I should try to bring this
chick back to Kisara instead.

28
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,938
Nah. I better not start
second guessing my orders.

29
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,566
If Kisara wants the kid,
the kid who she'll get.

30
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,485
Uh oh. If I can't take care
of at least one of these guys,

31
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,779
I'll never be able to look
Miu in the eye again!

32
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,114
My pride's at stake!

33
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,536
Want some more? Free samples.

34
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,912
I'm bleeding!

35
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,872
What the heck you
tryin' to do to me?!

36
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,251
I think-I think you
broke my nose, you punk!

37
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,753
Man, that hurts! I quit!

38
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,463
Are you gonna be alright?

39
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,381
Be careful!

40
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,092
He could be faking it to
try to lure you in closer!

41
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,719
Keep your guard up!

42
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,348
Now you're gonna bleed.

43
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,225
Hey, wait a minute!
That's no fair!

44
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,311
You're not allowed to use
that thing! Are you crazy?!

45
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,395
Someone could really get hurt!

46
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,938
Enough already!

47
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,944
I've gotta get inside his
reach without getting cut.

48
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,613
But how?

49
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,538
Pulling a knife on an unarmed
opponent? You know better.

50
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,915
That's against the rules!

51
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,085
Gotta save face.

52
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,838
I better play it cool,
like it's no big deal.

53
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,466
Whew! We make a
great team don't we.

54
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,885
Huh?

55
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,142
What happened to him?

56
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,186
Someone pee in his Sake glass?

57
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,479
He's been like
that ever since

58
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,272
he came back from
shopping with Miu.

59
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,316
I can't even get him
to start training.

60
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,193
Apachai knows that face.

61
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,278
Kenichi is hurting
on his insides.

62
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,905
Whadda ya know? He's movin'.

63
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,615
Maybe Apachai could
cheer him up?

64
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,617
Nah, let's leave him alone.

65
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,122
It's normal for teenagers to
get depressed from time to time.

66
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,123
He's alright.

67
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:54,086
Well now, Sakaki, been studying
up on teen psychology, have we?

68
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,966
Why'd he have to pull
that stupid knife?

69
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,677
I'm scared enough
in a normal fight,

70
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,679
and I sure wasn't
prepared for that.

71
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,145
So what am I supposed to do?

72
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,231
Guess I'm gonna
need some help.

73
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,362
Akisame sensei might be able
to teach me a few pointers.

74
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,990
But knowing the way he works,
he'll probably make me

75
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,076
do some freaky exercise
I don't understand.

76
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,328
It'd be too embarrassing
to ask Miu.

77
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,122
But maybe Sakaki...

78
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,248
Yeah, that's it!

79
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,251
I bet you he's dealt with
his fair share of weapons.

80
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,378
Huh? Huh?!

81
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,223
Shigure! Leave him alone! What
do you think you're doing?!

82
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,599
Just practicing, is all.

83
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,019
I could be wrong, but it
looks to me like Shigure's

84
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,979
just offered you some
personal weapons training.

85
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,313
What?

86
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,024
When it comes
to weapons use,

87
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,942
Shigure's skills
are unparalleled.

88
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,694
But I'm not interested
in using weapons,

89
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,404
I just wanna know
how to avoid 'em!

90
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,239
What happened when you
saw that knife today?

91
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,283
You completely
froze, didn't you?

92
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,953
Yeah, that's one
way of putting it.

93
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,747
What you need is experience.

94
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:14,207
And before you can learn
to avoid weapons in a fight,

95
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,627
you must first become familiar
with the weapons themselves.

96
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,635
I was a little uneasy
with the idea

97
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,471
of leaving Shigure
totally in charge,

98
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,265
so for safety's sake, I
decided to watch this one.

99
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,309
Apachai thinks watching
is a good idea.

100
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,435
Most definitely.

101
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,895
Just promise me!

102
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,272
You won't let her cut off
anything I can't grow back?

103
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,441
Okay then, what
should we start with?

104
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,111
Your first lesson:

105
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,780
using a blade...

106
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,032
...to kill.

107
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,285
What, is something wrong?

108
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,536
'Course not.

109
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,749
You'll get a better chance
to learn this way.

110
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,168
Using a spoon? Really?

111
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,678
Yes, yes! No!

112
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,098
Kensei, you pervert!

113
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,809
Kenichi! Kenichi!

114
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,519
Don't be dead!

115
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,524
What in the world is
going on in here?

116
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,484
I need to go change!

117
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,985
Kensei, you know better.

118
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,321
And Kenichi, you should
know knives and spoons

119
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,697
are just worthless
hunks of metal,

120
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,075
as long as you can
avoid being hit by them.

121
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,869
But, the problem here
is that Shigure's an expert,

122
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,412
and she never
misses her mark.

123
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,915
Your only chance
is to observe calmly,

124
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,667
and wait for an opening.

125
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,002
Isn't there some safer way
I can learn this stuff?

126
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,463
Assume the position.

127
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,632
Okay. Like this?

128
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,176
What, do you want me
to chop your hand off?

129
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,553
You're wide open.

130
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,263
Every vital point.

131
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,521
Stand up straight.
Now shift your stance

132
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,857
so your body's aligned
sideways with mine.

133
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,025
Put your free hand on your hip.

134
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,530
Think you can hit me?

135
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,616
I know I can!

136
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,455
You're dead.

137
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,082
I win.

138
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,876
I'm not dead yet!

139
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,471
Okay then. Now that you're
getting the hang of it,

140
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,473
let's teach you how to
counter an armed opponent

141
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,558
with your bare hands!

142
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,393
You call this getting
the hang of it?!

143
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,438
Kenichi. What would you
say is the most important

144
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,481
characteristic a
fighter can possess?

145
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,150
I dunno. mm...

146
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,903
Strength maybe? Or technique?

147
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:52,324
Nonsense! It's courage!

148
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,575
If you don't have courage,

149
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,869
you can't stay calm,
and you overlook openings.

150
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,163
Without courage your
strength is limited!

151
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:02,292
Without courage your technique
is sloppy and unfocused!

152
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,002
Then I'll never
be a great fighter.

153
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,963
My courage, well,
it's a little lacking.

154
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,258
If you don't have it, then
you have to train for it!

155
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,303
Practice is the
key to everything.

156
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:17,891
Shigure, this time I want you to
push him to the absolute edge.

157
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:25,774
Shigure...

158
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,525
She really is a
master of weapons,

159
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,527
but otherwise she's
such a mystery.

160
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,655
Most of the time I don't
even know she's here.

161
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,031
Get set. Go.

162
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,241
What happened to "ready"?!

163
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,743
One thing's for
sure, though.

164
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,287
I definitely found the
right person to teach me!

165
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,980
Ah, I think I'm
bleeding internally.

166
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,357
If that was Shigure's
way of taking it easy,

167
00:10:04,357 --> 00:10:06,234
then I can't imagine what
would happen to anyone

168
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:07,861
who had to fight her for real--

169
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:16,703
Betcha' he's not
afraid of a knife.

170
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,289
Guys his size probably never
give them a second thought.

171
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:21,207
With muscles that thick,
I'd be surprised

172
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:25,295
if most weapons didn't
just bounce right off them.

173
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:27,297
I've been training for what
seems like months now,

174
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:29,507
and I haven't gained a
single ounce of muscle.

175
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:31,885
I'm starting to wonder if
all of Akisame sensei's

176
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:33,720
weird training techniques
are really working.

177
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,971
Oh, there you are.

178
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:37,724
I've got some shopping to do
would you like to come along?

179
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:38,725
Huh?

180
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:43,938
You know, I said I'd
go shopping with you,

181
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:46,441
but I didn't think that meant
I'd have to drag you around

182
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:47,484
like your own personal mule.

183
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:50,737
Seriously, remind me never
to go anywhere with you again!

184
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:53,323
Oh, quit being a poor
sport. It's multi-tasking.

185
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:55,283
We're Killing two
birds with one stone.

186
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:57,202
Killing me is more like it.

187
00:10:57,202 --> 00:11:00,413
One-two! One-two!

188
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:02,665
Aw, come on, Sensei,
this is so embarrassing.

189
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:04,542
How much of this
do I have to do

190
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:06,127
before I graduate
from basic training?

191
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:08,421
Graduation? But
that's impossible!

192
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:11,341
Your basic training
lasts an entire lifetime.

193
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,134
What?! You can't be serious.

194
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:15,220
So I'm gonna be running
these embarrassing marathons

195
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,847
for the rest of my life?

196
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:20,517
You don't have to run
marathons necessarily.

197
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:23,311
But you have to maintain
some kind of training routine.

198
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:25,230
Back in the old days
it was very rare

199
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,190
that people did any
separate muscle training.

200
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,024
What?

201
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:30,151
So why am I getting
the special treatment?

202
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,569
They sparred a lot back then.

203
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:33,696
So they really didn't
need muscle training.

204
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:34,656
Dry yourself off.

205
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:36,950
So then, sparring was
their strength training.

206
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,993
Sparring's a great
way to build muscle.

207
00:11:38,993 --> 00:11:41,621
Mostly because it focuses
specifically on all the muscles

208
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:44,165
needed for fighting, without
adding unnecessary bulk

209
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:46,167
in places that could
slow the body down.

210
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,670
However, there is
definitely one drawback

211
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,548
to that method of training.
High risk of bodily injury.

212
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:54,217
Out of every 100 or so
disciples only a handful

213
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:56,928
ever made it through
training alive.

214
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:58,888
So how does that sound to you?

215
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:01,516
We could skip muscle
training and spar instead.

216
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:07,438
That's not a good idea.

217
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:09,232
Well, you aren't
quite a master yet.

218
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:12,902
I suppose you have plenty of
time to work on your courage.

219
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:15,071
Me a master? Yeah, why not?

220
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:18,491
You train with masters,
to become a master, right?

221
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:20,702
Can I ask you a
question, Sensei?

222
00:12:20,702 --> 00:12:24,706
How come your body's not built
up like Apachai's or Sakaki's?

223
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:26,958
I keep an eye on my figure.

224
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:32,338
I'd be really curious to see how
he handles himself in a fight.

225
00:12:34,591 --> 00:12:36,467
Normally, I come
here with Kensei,

226
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,761
but he said he had to pick
up something very important

227
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:40,263
at the book store today.

228
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:42,515
Girly mags...

229
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:45,935
So you two usually walk back and
forth between here and the dojo.

230
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:47,937
Is this part of your
training routine?

231
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:51,274
Nah. I'm just
saving on bus fare.

232
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:54,110
Let go, or you'll be sorry!

233
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,278
Calm down little girl,

234
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:57,280
we're just gonna ask
you some questions.

235
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,032
Hey! I know them...

236
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:01,075
Izumi, and Makoto!

237
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:03,578
School friends? They look
like they're in trouble.

238
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:05,997
We're trying to find a girl
that goes to your school.

239
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:09,250
Looks just like you, 'cept she's
taller and her hair' and eyes

240
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,211
are different, and
she's not so scrawny.

241
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:14,505
So you're looking for a girl
that wears glasses, is that it?

242
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:16,424
That's what I said!

243
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:17,717
I remember now...

244
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:21,346
Those are the same thugs that
Miu beat up the day I met her.

245
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:22,805
I've gotta do something!

246
00:13:24,515 --> 00:13:26,601
There go my weak legs again.

247
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:30,480
Why is it so hard for me to work
up the courage when I need it?

248
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,107
Hey, that little
punk was with her.

249
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,127
Is that Kenichi?

250
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:56,047
Go home girls. Your
friend will be fine.

251
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,131
Come on!

252
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:02,303
Be careful, Kenichi.

253
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:05,974
What's he doing?

254
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:07,266
Move, old man.

255
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:10,687
I got some business
with the kid there.

256
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,729
Oh, is that so?

257
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:14,524
I'm afraid I don't
quite understand.

258
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:17,694
Has my disciple caused
some sort of trouble?

259
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:20,321
Watch out boys.

260
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:21,781
He's tricky...

261
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:23,241
Keep both eyes on him.

262
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:24,659
Hey, uh, dude?

263
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:25,910
Yeah, what is it?

264
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,453
Um, well--

265
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:29,163
What the heck you blabbin' ab--

266
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:34,002
Sorry, that's my fault.

267
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:36,087
Dislocation is an
old habit of mine.

268
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:37,672
That's some habit.

269
00:14:39,757 --> 00:14:40,758
There you go,

270
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:42,885
but you should watch where
you stick that thing.

271
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:44,846
You're completey insane!

272
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:47,473
You two, get some
weapons or somethin'.

273
00:14:47,473 --> 00:14:49,600
Hurry! And get the boss
while you're at it!

274
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,185
Yeah, right!

275
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:53,813
Now that's just rude.
I'm not completely insane.

276
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:55,606
Isn't that right, Kenichi?

277
00:14:58,276 --> 00:15:00,528
Alright boys, I'm
guessin' this freak here

278
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:03,406
is like glasses-girl's old man,
and that makes him fair game!

279
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:06,367
Come on out, Boss!
Let me introduce ya!

280
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:15,918
That's the guy.

281
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:19,881
You take care of him, and
we'll deal with the runt.

282
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:22,383
Oh my. You're certainly
a big fellow, aren't you?

283
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:25,595
We're in trouble. This guy's
built like a redwood!

284
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:27,972
Looks like we got
ourselves a bonus!

285
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:29,640
We were just tryin'
to track down

286
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,017
that brat daughter of yours!

287
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,936
But seein' as how you need to
learn to keep your kid in line,

288
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:36,481
we'll start with you instead!

289
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:39,984
I hate to rain on your parade,
but I'm still a bachelor.

290
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:41,611
What, you call me for this?

291
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,738
He's smaller than anyone here.

292
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:44,322
Hm?

293
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:46,574
Next time make sure
he's at least your size

294
00:15:46,574 --> 00:15:48,117
before you think about
wasting my time.

295
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:50,661
Ah, excuse me, if I may?

296
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:52,789
I take it that you're the
leader of these men?

297
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,749
We seem to have a bit
of a misunderstanding.

298
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:56,626
Whatever the problem
is, I'd rather not

299
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:58,961
have to cause any trouble
for you or your goons.

300
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:01,631
Perhaps it would be best
if we went our separate ways?

301
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:03,841
At least if we all
walk away right now,

302
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:05,051
you won't have to dirty

303
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:07,303
that fancy white suit
that you're wearing.

304
00:16:17,313 --> 00:16:19,565
Yeah! You show 'im, Boss!

305
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:23,277
Oh, man, he's gonna get killed!

306
00:16:23,277 --> 00:16:24,612
What did you do that for?

307
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:26,531
That's government
property paid for

308
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:28,825
with your hard
earned tax dollars.

309
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:30,660
It appears that I may
have offended you

310
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,911
in some way, haven't I?

311
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:34,747
Again, I'd rather not fight
you, but if that's the case,

312
00:16:34,747 --> 00:16:37,667
I am willing to take back
some of what I said earlier.

313
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,585
Yeah, that's more like it.

314
00:16:39,585 --> 00:16:41,963
Not feelin' so
cocky now, are ya?

315
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:45,424
I don't believe it.
Is he apologizing?

316
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:46,759
I take back the part about

317
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,845
not wanting to cause
you any trouble.

318
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:55,059
Did he really just do that?
With one finger?!

319
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,437
Truth is I don't care much
for people like you.

320
00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:58,896
You're overbearing, rude

321
00:16:58,896 --> 00:17:00,982
and always trying
to intimidate people.

322
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:03,442
So I've decided it's about
time to give you boys

323
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:05,236
a little taste of
your own medicine.

324
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:08,656
Hmph! Really? You think
you can bully me?

325
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:09,782
Kenichi...

326
00:17:09,782 --> 00:17:11,117
Y-Yes?

327
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:13,703
I'll give you a quick
jujitsu demonstration.

328
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:16,038
Keep your eyes open, and
try to learn something!

329
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:17,290
You got it.

330
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,208
Should you find yourself
in a situation

331
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,586
where your opponent is
bigger than you are...

332
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:23,212
Shut up and fight already!

333
00:17:23,212 --> 00:17:25,339
First, here's what not to do.

334
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:29,051
You should never face your
opponent directly like this,

335
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:31,179
because you'll eventually
be overpowered.

336
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:33,764
But he's not
budging! How come?

337
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:36,976
I mean it's simple physics, he
should be getting pushed back.

338
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:44,775
He's hooking his toes
into that manhole cover!

339
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:46,027
Ouch...

340
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:51,491
Wait a second! Why are
you screaming? Huh?

341
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:54,368
Okay, now I'll show you
the right way to do it.

342
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:56,829
That's it! Now I'm mad!

343
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:58,789
What you want to do is
make your opponent think

344
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:00,833
you're moving forward, when
what you're really doing

345
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,169
is moving sideways
into his blind spot.

346
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,421
Then, in an actual
jujitsu fight,

347
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:06,756
before you did anything else,

348
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:09,759
you'd attack one
of his vital points!

349
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,469
But that's only
a preparation move

350
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:13,221
so you can get your
opponent off balance.

351
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:15,056
Well, it certainly
seems effective!

352
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:20,478
Now, before your opponent's
punch gets up to speed,

353
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:21,812
you move a half step forward

354
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:24,482
and deflect its
power away from you.

355
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:25,942
And then...

356
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:31,531
...you throw him!

357
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,082
A-mazing! That was the
coolest thing I've ever seen!

358
00:18:41,082 --> 00:18:42,833
I just hope you
learned something.

359
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,126
Oh yeah!

360
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:51,759
Let's see you deflect
some bullets, ya freak!

361
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,512
He's got a gun this time?!
What the heck is with this guy?

362
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,138
That is totally
crossing the line!

363
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:57,765
All right, that does it.

364
00:18:57,765 --> 00:18:59,976
You idiots are far too
reckless for my taste.

365
00:18:59,976 --> 00:19:03,229
What if you'd accidentally
hit an innocent bystander?

366
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:15,616
Come on. It's time someone
taught you some manners.

367
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:17,118
Let go of me!

368
00:19:17,118 --> 00:19:19,078
Oh, and Kenichi?

369
00:19:19,078 --> 00:19:21,539
Sit tight for a
moment, if you would.

370
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,457
This won't take long.

371
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:25,167
Let's get him!

372
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,877
He can't take us all!

373
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:33,968
Remind me never to get
on Sensei's bad side!

374
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:35,803
I almost feel sorry
for those thugs.

375
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:38,222
I didn't know people's
bodies could bend that way!

376
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:45,014
It's like he had some kinda'
super-human strength,

377
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:46,725
especially for
someone his size!

378
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,935
Well according to
him, the human body

379
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:50,895
is made up of three
different kinds of muscle:

380
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:53,648
white muscle that's good
for fast, sudden moves,

381
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:55,191
but lacks endurance,

382
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:58,069
red muscle that's got
endurance but not much power,

383
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:00,280
and in between those two
is a bit of pink muscle

384
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,407
that's supposed to have
both qualities combined.

385
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:04,909
They say the ratio
of the 3 muscle types

386
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:07,412
stay the same your entire life.

387
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:09,247
But ol' Akisame,

388
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:12,584
he ignored conventional wisdom
and followed his own theories.

389
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:14,669
He believed that muscle
type could be changed,

390
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:17,589
and after 20 years of bizarre
training, he had converted

391
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:19,966
all his red and white
muscle to pink.

392
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:22,469
So, while he may not
look all that strong,

393
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:24,679
what you see
is 100% muscle.

394
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:25,805
He's like a rock.

395
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:28,808
I doubt the guy has a
milligram of body fat on him.

396
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:31,394
You mean, he might even
be stronger than you?

397
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:34,939
Did I say that?
Don't be stupid, kid.

398
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:36,816
I don't do all that
freaky training,

399
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:39,360
but I'm no slouch either.
Tell you this, though,

400
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,820
He's one of those guys,

401
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,531
if I never do have to fight
him that's just fine by me.

402
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:46,951
If we ever did get into it,
one of us would wind up dead.

403
00:20:48,828 --> 00:20:51,080
Maybe I should walk
you home. It's late.

404
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,166
You never know, they
might still be out there

405
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,334
waiting to catch you alone.

406
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:56,085
No, that's okay. I can manage.

407
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:58,213
And, hey, if I run into
something I can't handle,

408
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:01,049
there's always the old
"strategic withtdrawl", right?

409
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:02,634
Well, see you tomorrow.

410
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:05,053
--Bye.
--Okay then, be careful!

411
00:21:05,053 --> 00:21:07,597
No way they'd expect me
to walk down the same street

412
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:08,890
where they ambushed
me last time.

413
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,351
Gotta stay one step ahead.

414
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:14,979
I was just about ready
to give up on you Kenichi.

415
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:16,439
You again?!

416
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:17,190
Better believe it!

417
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,692
An' this time I'm draggin'
your scrawny butt to Kisara!

418
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:21,736
Right. I still don't
know who that is.

419
00:21:21,736 --> 00:21:24,072
But first thing's first!

420
00:21:24,072 --> 00:21:26,407
Me an' my little friend here
still owe you some payback

421
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:29,077
for makin' me bleed
yesterday, don't we?

422
00:21:29,077 --> 00:21:31,079
What do I do?

423
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,705
You should know
knives and spoons

424
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:34,082
are just worthless
hunks of metal

425
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:36,918
as long as you can avoid
being hit by them.

426
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:42,215
What's that supposed to be?

427
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:44,467
Like a butter-knife
or something?

428
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:46,094
Don't act like
you're not scared!

429
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:48,680
You were shakin' in your
boots the last time!

430
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,350
And your posture is pathetic.
Your vitals are wide open.

431
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,102
I'll show you pathetic!

432
00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:56,771
And compared to Shigure,

433
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:58,731
you might as well be
moving in slow motion!

434
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:01,150
Shut your mouth, punk!
I'll cut you! You hear me?!

435
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,694
And your grip's bad.

436
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:03,987
I can just...

437
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:09,075
In an actual jujitsu fight,

438
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:12,537
you'd attack one
of his vital points!

439
00:22:12,537 --> 00:22:14,247
But that's only
a preparation move

440
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:16,541
so you can get your
opponent off balance.

441
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:22,922
Furukawa! I just realized
that this is all your fault!

442
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:25,216
Do you have any idea
what I had to go through,

443
00:22:25,216 --> 00:22:26,843
all because you pulled
that stupid knife?! Do you?!

444
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:28,511
You ever been chased
around for an hour

445
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:31,014
by a woman with a sword?!
Oh, and what about having your

446
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:33,725
skin removed a layer at a
time with a sai and a tonfa?!

447
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:35,476
Guess what--it hurts! I'm
probably gonna have nightmares

448
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:37,979
now for the rest of my life!
Oh yeah, did I mention

449
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:39,647
the ten-foot wrestler
that tried to squash me?

450
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:42,192
Or what about the guy that
pulled the gun on me?!

451
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:43,318
Not my idea of fun!

452
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:47,280
Kenichi, I'm glad
to see you're alright.

453
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,448
Hey, are you listening?!

454
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:50,408
Wake up! I want
you to hear this!

455
00:22:50,408 --> 00:22:53,453
Besides, you can't sleep out
here, you'll catch a cold!

456
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,584
Apa. Apachai doesn't
know what to do!

457
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:24,919
This sounds serious.

458
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:26,462
What's the matter? Is
something troubling you?

459
00:24:26,462 --> 00:24:28,631
Mm-hm. Every sparring
time with Kenichi,

460
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:31,175
Apachai can't make
his punches fold back,

461
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:33,052
then Kenichi gets
beat up for real.

462
00:24:33,052 --> 00:24:35,555
Hm. I take it you
mean "hold" back.

463
00:24:35,555 --> 00:24:38,516
That's definitely been a problem
for both you and Kenichi.

464
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:40,893
But, I'm certain it's
one you can overcome

465
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,437
with a little time and training.

466
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:45,815
Apapapapa! That's great!
Apachai will do his best!

467
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:48,526
So next time, Kenichi
won't have to end up dead!
