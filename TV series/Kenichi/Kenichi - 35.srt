[Music]

2
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,949
Why did you drag my
sister into this...

3
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:48,659
That's dirty-
even for Ragnarok!

4
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,370
True... True?

5
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,455
Kenichi!

6
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:55,875
Fine- I'll do it.

7
00:01:59,462 --> 00:02:01,213
Prepare to die, Shirahama!

8
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:12,683
You can hit me as
much as you want.

9
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:14,060
Hold... on...

10
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,978
You shouldn't even be able
to stand right now...

11
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:17,855
Your defenses are
better than I thought.

12
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:19,774
Go ahead and hit me
as much as you want...

13
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:21,651
as long as you
give Honoka back!

14
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:23,486
Well, now that's the spirit...

15
00:02:23,486 --> 00:02:24,904
I'm fine with letting her go

16
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:26,822
if I get to beat
the crap outta you.

17
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:46,425
Now see what you
made me do...!

18
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:48,386
I told ya to stop
squirming around.....

19
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:49,804
This is your
fault, you know.

20
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:55,685
Help me big brother!

21
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,610
This is really
startin' to get old...

22
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,570
It's time we ended this,
don't you think??

23
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,992
Big brother!

24
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,243
I told you to stop!

25
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:19,542
Why...

26
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:21,085
Why'd you do that??

27
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:22,586
You shouldn't be
holding a weapon

28
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:24,338
if you're not gonna
use it properly.

29
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:35,224
This is it, kid!

30
00:03:35,224 --> 00:03:36,767
Kenichi Shirahama!

31
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,857
It's okay.....! I'm safe
and sound now, guys!

32
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:45,443
Kill Loki!

33
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:47,361
Damn you... Hermit!

34
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:56,704
Fine... You're
just a traitor...

35
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,706
I'm sure everyone will
be happy to hear that...

36
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:01,667
Come down and fight
me like a man!

37
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,502
And you too Kenichi
Shirahama...

38
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:05,087
I'll take on
the both of you!

39
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:11,052
That's enough!

40
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:16,057
What's he doing here??

41
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:19,727
The First Fist!

42
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:43,417
Leave him alone, Loki.

43
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:49,924
The First Fist...

44
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:52,385
This can't be good news...
now I'm scared.

45
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:54,011
Why are you
afraid of him??

46
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,805
Cause he's the
leader of a gang...

47
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:57,723
and he doesn't mess around.

48
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:58,933
We're gonna be
in big trouble

49
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,851
if he brought all of
Ragnarok with him...

50
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:02,478
We'll be seriously
outnumbered.

51
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:12,029
Good to see you again,
Kenichi...

52
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:13,114
It's been a long time.

53
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:18,702
I guess you don't
remember me, huh??

54
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:19,912
That's okay.

55
00:05:19,912 --> 00:05:21,414
I'm not worried about it.

56
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:24,291
I know the promise we made
will be fulfilled soon.

57
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:28,003
C'mon Let's go, Loki.

58
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:29,004
No way...!

59
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:31,132
You don't understand
how serious I am...

60
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:33,592
I'm not leavin' til I beat
the crap outta this punk.

61
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:34,760
I'll forgive you this once

62
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,512
for using the
Great Sage Fist's name

63
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,264
for your own
personal gain...

64
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:39,306
But I should warn you,

65
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,850
if you break the
rules again...

66
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,357
How'd he do that??!

67
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:49,608
I wanted to get rid of you

68
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,193
but for some reason
the great Sage Fists

69
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:52,653
wants to keep you onboard.

70
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:57,908
You're lucky we still
need your talent...

71
00:05:57,908 --> 00:06:01,036
but if you don't follow
the rules it's over.

72
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:03,330
Whoa... Did he just
let him off the hook??!

73
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,999
Villains aren't
supposed to play fair

74
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:06,542
and they're not supposed
to give second chances.

75
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:08,419
What's the
matter with him??

76
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:09,837
You dumb ass...

77
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,547
How would you know what
it takes to be a villain-

78
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:13,257
you're nothin' but a pansy.

79
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:14,550
I have the makings
of villain-

80
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,802
I even have the ability
to make a demonic face!

81
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:18,846
Well... If villains are ugly

82
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,431
that explains why
Ukita, Hermit and I,

83
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:22,391
three of the top five
hottest guys in Ragnarok,

84
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:23,601
have changed our ways.

85
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:25,895
Was Loki one of the
top 5 hottest guys

86
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:27,897
because he's not
bad looking either.

87
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:29,857
Yeah... But he's only
slightly above average

88
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,525
so he's barely in.

89
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,236
'Slightly above average'
would be good looking, right??

90
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:36,447
Damn it.
Get the bike, Number 20!

91
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:38,073
Let's get outta here!

92
00:06:38,073 --> 00:06:39,492
C'mon!

93
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:41,744
Wait!

94
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:42,620
What's the
matter, Kenichi?!

95
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,746
Are you feeling okay??!

96
00:06:45,581 --> 00:06:48,125
Wait... I'll never forgive
you for what you've done...

97
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,793
I swear I'm gonna
take you down.

98
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:53,255
Now that's the
spirit, Kenichi.

99
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:56,800
Get angry and then work
your way up to my level.

100
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,885
Listen Hermit...

101
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,261
You need to remember
that our leader,

102
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:00,262
the Great Sage Fists,

103
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:01,513
deals with things a
little differently

104
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:04,183
than most people.

105
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:06,894
He never sends out
direct orders...

106
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,812
As an organization
we are simply there

107
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:12,191
to support him
and his beliefs.

108
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:14,193
I'm sorry Loki used
you like that...

109
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:16,111
It's not too late
to reconsider...

110
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:18,739
It's in your best interest
to stay with Ragnarok.

111
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,199
Forget it...!

112
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,118
I was using you because I needed
a place I felt I belonged...

113
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:24,411
But the Great Sage Fists

114
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,414
has taught us all to
walk our own paths.

115
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,333
That's unfortunate...

116
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,044
Then the next time we meet
we'll be mortal enemies, Hermit.

117
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,715
He... disappeared.

118
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:40,511
Yet another victory for
the Shinpaku Alliance...!

119
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:43,013
So that was Odin
the First Fist...

120
00:07:43,013 --> 00:07:45,057
But why did he act like
I should know him??

121
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:48,018
Hang in there, Kenichi.

122
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:50,020
He'll be okay-
don't get too close...

123
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,522
your boobs'll
suffocate him.

124
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:52,606
Would you shut up??!

125
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,709
Yay.....!

126
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:08,710
We're okay!

127
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:10,795
OW!...

128
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:13,131
Careful Honoka,
I'm really sore.

129
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:14,716
Oh, whoops-I'm sorry ...

130
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:16,634
It's just I'm so
proud of you, brother!

131
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:20,430
Thanks... Glad you're okay.

132
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,764
That was so cute...

133
00:08:21,764 --> 00:08:23,641
I really wish I
had a sibling.

134
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:28,855
Thanks... You saved my sister...

135
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:30,315
Guess I owe ya one...

136
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:31,899
I can't thank you enough.

137
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:34,402
I'm sorry but you
got the wrong idea...

138
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:35,903
The only reason I
saved her from Loki

139
00:08:35,903 --> 00:08:37,196
is cause they were in the way-

140
00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:39,574
I wanna end this
thing right now.

141
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:40,825
Are you kidding, me??!

142
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:42,076
You can't be serious.

143
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:44,120
Hermit, you still
wanna fight Kenichi??!

144
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,371
Of course I do...

145
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:47,749
I haven't changed my mind-
I still hate him.

146
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:50,376
What do you say.....?

147
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:52,754
Are you ready to take
me on now, Shirahama??

148
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:56,049
Yeah...

149
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:58,092
No prob...... Think
I can handle that...

150
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:00,345
You may be a big jerk
but I don't hate you.

151
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:03,306
But you're in no
condition to fight!

152
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:05,099
Sorry but I have
no choice...

153
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:06,601
I mean, I guess
I kinda owe him

154
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:08,978
one for saving my
sister's life.

155
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:10,772
If he wants a fight
then he'll get it.

156
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:18,988
I know you can do it...!

157
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:21,240
The Shinpaku Alliance
will win!

158
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,950
Piss off, ya alien freak.

159
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:31,376
They look lively.

160
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:33,878
I can't believe they have
the strength to fight anymore.

161
00:09:33,878 --> 00:09:36,297
Well, They're youngsters...

162
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:37,924
In all honesty I think
it would be a shame

163
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:39,592
if they didn't fight...

164
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:42,387
after all we already bet
our desserts on them.

165
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:44,972
It looks like Kenichi's
taken on a lot of damage...

166
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:46,015
But I shouldn't be worried-

167
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:48,017
I bet it all on the
caped kid, right??

168
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:49,936
Just how much have
you had to drink?

169
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:52,188
I bet on the caped kid
and you bet on Kenichi.

170
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:56,692
You guys shouldn't
be fighting-

171
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,319
both of you are
really beat up!

172
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:02,865
Just Let them do
their thing... honey.

173
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:07,954
This is the end, Shirahama!

174
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:09,622
When two men have
a score to settle

175
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:11,040
there's no stopping them...

176
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,667
especially when
they're rivals.

177
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:21,718
Look at that- somethin's
up with capey there.

178
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:23,511
So you noticed it too...?

179
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:25,805
He's wasting all
of his energy...

180
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:28,057
No one has the endurance
to keep that up for long.

181
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:46,743
He's really hurt!

182
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,545
Well, Kenichi's injuries are
pushing his limits as well...

183
00:10:57,545 --> 00:11:00,089
It seems this fight is about
to get very interesting.

184
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:03,801
Die!

185
00:11:06,137 --> 00:11:07,388
No way!

186
00:11:07,388 --> 00:11:08,389
Damn... If he
had taken that hit

187
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:10,433
he would've been
totally annihilated!

188
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:12,310
Whoa, that was
Ying Kung Fu!

189
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,145
Ying Kung Fu...

190
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:16,063
In that style
conditioning is used

191
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:17,732
to harden the
exterior of the body

192
00:11:17,732 --> 00:11:19,859
which increases the
user's power...

193
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:22,403
It's considered much more
destructive than Kenpo.

194
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:23,571
Makes sense to me-

195
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:24,906
in karate we do
conditioning too-

196
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:26,616
we hit training poles
with our bare fists

197
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:27,825
to toughen them up...

198
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:29,994
All hand-to-hand
combat styles do it.

199
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,624
That's funny my palms
are as soft as can be.

200
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:43,299
This is the end...

201
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:44,717
Now... die!

202
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:50,389
Aw, hell yeah...!
He blocked it!

203
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:51,516
This is your chance, Kenichi!

204
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:52,767
Stop fighting.....!...

205
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,685
Please I'm begging you!

206
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,068
Kao Loi!

207
00:12:07,323 --> 00:12:08,449
Big brother...

208
00:12:10,117 --> 00:12:11,577
Big brother...

209
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:16,999
Look at them all.....!

210
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:20,086
Dontcha think chrysanthemums
are beautiful !

211
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:21,295
Oh, don't you worry...

212
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:24,048
I'm not gonna let some
stupid sickness beat me.

213
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,968
Big brother you can't
give in, okay.....?

214
00:12:26,968 --> 00:12:28,094
Please promise me.

215
00:12:29,262 --> 00:12:31,013
You can't give in!

216
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:40,523
No...! I will not give in!

217
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,794
Wait... He's unconscious.

218
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:14,015
Kenichi!

219
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:15,474
You did some damage!

220
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:18,436
This isn't good.
He's lost a lot of blood.

221
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:19,687
Will he be okay?!...

222
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:21,480
Hey pretty boy!

223
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,150
That was the best fight
I've seen in a while.

224
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:31,866
Our disciple's
come a long way.

225
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:34,744
And the winner is...

226
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:37,079
Kenichi!

227
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,249
Looks like your dessert
is mine tonight, Akisame.

228
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:42,793
Yes but dessert doesn't
happen until later.

229
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:45,296
Right now we need to get the
caped kid to my clinic...

230
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:47,298
before he dies
from loss of blood.

231
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:50,176
How long have the two of you
been watching all of this?!

232
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:51,385
Since the beginning!

233
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:53,554
I can't believe you guys!

234
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,444
Are you kidding me?!

235
00:14:08,444 --> 00:14:09,737
Let me get this straight,

236
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:12,073
you were hiding in a tree
watching everything go down?!

237
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:13,491
I could've used your help!

238
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:15,368
Honoka was kidnapped!

239
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:17,787
But I'm not sure Master Sakaki
would've been any help-

240
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:19,497
I can smell the
alcohol from here.

241
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:21,248
Nice one.....! Got me.

242
00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:23,959
Stop! This isn't
a laughing matter!

243
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,336
Guess I shouldn't
thank him

244
00:14:25,336 --> 00:14:27,421
for winning me an
extra dessert just yet.

245
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:30,633
Big brother!

246
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:32,927
It's time to change
your bandages!

247
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:35,346
Wait a sec, didn't you
just change them?! Well??

248
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:36,889
It's my job to
change your bandages-

249
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,724
the mustache man
told me to...

250
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,434
He said every
hour on the hour.

251
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:41,811
Say what.....!..?

252
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:44,980
It takes too long
to do it every hour!

253
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,981
That's what you think.

254
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:51,779
Are you trying to
kill me, Honoka??

255
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,448
Ryozanpaku certainly
is a lot more exciting

256
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:55,658
whenever you're around.

257
00:14:58,244 --> 00:15:00,913
Oh hey, Miu!

258
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:02,707
We're glad to have
you back, Kenichi.

259
00:15:02,707 --> 00:15:04,458
Welcome home.

260
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,210
Oh...... wow...

261
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,920
Thank you!

262
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,297
This place was so quiet
when you left us...

263
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:13,634
It almost felt like there
was no one living here.

264
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:14,802
I am home!

265
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:17,304
Cut it out, Honoka!

266
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:18,639
I can't breathe!

267
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:21,642
I'm just doin' my job!

268
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:23,894
Hey... Kenichi...

269
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:26,897
Miu bought a new set-
you wanna play me??

270
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:29,525
Or you can throw
kunai with me...

271
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:31,026
Well.....?
What do you say??

272
00:15:34,697 --> 00:15:37,742
I gotta admit it was pretty
lonely around here without you.

273
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:39,326
In fact, it was so lonely

274
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:40,870
that I decided to
spend my free time

275
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,873
taking pictures
around Ryozanpaku...

276
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:45,708
I don't suppose
you're interested??

277
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,959
The only reason
you were lonely

278
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,586
is you didn't have
anyone to swindle.

279
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:51,422
I get it.
You don't want them.

280
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:53,340
I never said that
I didn't want them.

281
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:57,428
I've done everything
I can, Kensei...

282
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:59,305
The rest is up to you.

283
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:00,681
Master...

284
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:02,433
Can you tell me how
Tanimoto's doing??

285
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:04,226
Well, he seems
to be stable...

286
00:16:04,226 --> 00:16:06,896
But he lost a lot of blood
from that stab wound.

287
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:08,773
Wait a minute,
he was stabbed??

288
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:11,150
Yeah. It happened when he was
saving me from that girl...

289
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,986
I saw it.

290
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:15,446
He's suffered loss of blood

291
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:17,114
and the fighting you
did after he was stabbed

292
00:16:17,114 --> 00:16:19,075
didn't help his situation...

293
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:21,452
It's a miracle that the boy
lasted as long as he did.

294
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,457
But don't you
worry about him...

295
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:28,209
Although we didn't do
a blood transfusion

296
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:31,295
he should recover quickly
with Kensei's acupuncture.

297
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:33,422
Alright... I'll go
check him out, then.

298
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:34,590
I'll go with you!

299
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,800
No... I wouldn't do that.

300
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,677
But why??

301
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:40,137
There's really
not much to be said

302
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:41,639
between winners and losers.

303
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:45,851
Kenichi.....!...

304
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:47,228
You play me now??

305
00:16:47,228 --> 00:16:48,562
No come with me...

306
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:50,064
We can do some sparring...

307
00:16:50,064 --> 00:16:50,856
Well??

308
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:07,776
Where... Where am I??

309
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,444
You've obviously
trained very hard-

310
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:11,446
your muscle definition
is impressive.

311
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:12,572
Who are you??!

312
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,412
I am your master
Sougetsu Ma's brother...

313
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,997
My name's Kensei Ma.

314
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,499
You're Master Sougetsu's
little brother?!

315
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,959
Who admitted me
to this place?

316
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,377
I don't trust
doctors.....!...

317
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,879
And who the hell gave you
permission to treat me?!

318
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:30,340
You were treated
by Akisame...

319
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,259
My specialty is a
little different...

320
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,468
Acupuncture.

321
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,431
Don't think of them as
needles and they won't hurt...

322
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,933
Now I have a question
that I'd like to ask you.

323
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,356
Pretend you're
a man, will you?

324
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,649
there's a good boy.

325
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:51,278
Tell me......

326
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,573
Was my brother
a good master??

327
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,021
He taught me to
kill people...

328
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,065
how to take
someone's life...

329
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,192
He was strict and seemed
to enjoy bullying me

330
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,319
during training.

331
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,988
He was cold-blooded
and ruthless...

332
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,158
And I think he was the
perfect martial artist.

333
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,368
Is that so??

334
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,623
However he did
have one flaw...

335
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,541
When he was drunk he
would talk to me about

336
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,335
how much he cared about
his little brother.

337
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:54,883
I've heard so much about
you and all of it good.

338
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,302
He said even though he could
never live a peaceful life

339
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,137
he hoped his brother
was able to......

340
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:00,639
in Japan...

341
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,265
So I guess...

342
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:04,059
he was talking about you.

343
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,192
What's the hurry, Honoka?

344
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,652
Where are you off to??

345
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,780
It's time to go change the
pretty boy's bandages now!

346
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,704
Hey! What are you doing
out of bed.....?..?...!

347
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:26,873
Didn't they tell you that you
needed to get some rest??!

348
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:28,208
Shut up.....!...

349
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,543
Listen midget...

350
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,170
I don't ever wanna see
you at my house again...

351
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,588
And that's an
order, got it??!

352
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:36,800
You don't have to
leave just yet...

353
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,468
I thought maybe
you and my brother

354
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,763
could hang out a little
and then- you'd be friends.

355
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,182
I'm sorry kiddo but I've got
more important things to do.

356
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,108
I'm a rebel- I'm so tough-
you can't tame me...

357
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,609
meeehhhhh

358
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,210
I'm so proud of
this pine tree.

359
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,171
I just gave it
a little TLC

360
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,214
and look how beautiful
it has become.

361
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,843
Take care of your wounds...

362
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,553
You'll regret
it if you don't.

363
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,932
I used to live
all alone as well

364
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:27,684
so I know what
it feels like...

365
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,478
So I thought maybe
you would benefit

366
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,646
from a little bit of advice
from one of your elders,

367
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,940
my young friend.

368
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,400
You've chosen
to walk a path

369
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,069
that while dignified
is very lonesome...

370
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:40,030
so I should warn you...

371
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,990
That path leads
to nothing...

372
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,367
not a single thing.

373
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,953
Your elders are
always right.

374
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:49,039
They've experienced it all.

375
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,376
I can't believe that Honoka was
hanging out with Tanimoto!

376
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:54,669
And why was she so
desperate for me and him

377
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:57,422
to be friends??

378
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,716
I don't know- it
almost feels like fate.

379
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,511
I know Tanimoto was only
looking out for her safety

380
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,304
when he told her not to
go to his house anymore

381
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,514
but still...

382
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,308
she seemed like she was
really depressed about it.

383
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,771
I mean, maybe we could
become friends someday......

384
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,273
You never know.

385
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,317
Hey everybody, look
who's back.....!...

386
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,528
Natsu Tanimoto's
come back to school!

387
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,449
You've been gone
for such a long time

388
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,743
we were starting to get
really worried about you!

389
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,120
I was in an accident so I had
to take some time to recover.

390
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,872
As leader of the
Shinpaku Alliance

391
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,499
I've got the
world at my feet.

392
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,344
It's good to see you, Miu......

393
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,762
So did you miss me??

394
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,556
Uh... sure.

395
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,100
Hey, I wanna apologize
to you Shirahama...

396
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,351
I know it's been
tough for you

397
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,478
with all those
rumors going around.

398
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,939
What.....?..?...! You mean
that story isn't true??!

399
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,358
So, wait, the accident
wasn't his fault??

400
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,401
No, are you kidding?

401
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,902
He would never do
a thing like that-

402
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,612
the poor guy was framed.

403
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,905
He's crazy!

404
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,365
All of this was his fault!

405
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,702
Well, don't worry I'll make sure
everyone knows the truth.

406
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,954
Hey and one more
thing before I forget.

407
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,626
I've decided to stay but only
until I can exact my revenge.

408
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,796
So I suggest you watch your
back from now on, got it??

409
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,800
Well, I guess I'll
see you guys later.

410
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,801
What's up Heri-...

411
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,761
Oops, I mean...

412
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:28,221
Tanimoto.....?...

413
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,432
Just wanted to let you know
we've got a pipin' hot spot

414
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,809
in the Shinpaku Alliance
reserved for you.

415
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,938
Wait up!

416
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,982
If you join there's
all kinds of perks!

417
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,734
I can even make you
one of our generals!

418
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,776
How's that sound?

419
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:43,111
Huh??

420
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:52,162
[Music]

421
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,960
Whoa, master! What the hell are
you doing hiding out here?

422
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,836
What's wrong with you?

423
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,379
Renka came all this
way to see you!

424
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,672
That's what you think.

425
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,882
Renka just wants to
take me back to China

426
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:29,134
and I'm not ready
to go back!

427
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,469
I wanna stay here!
Don't make me go!

428
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,264
Your life's been pretty easy
since you came to Japan, huh?

429
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,849
Maybe it's time
for you to go back.

430
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,308
You've had a nice
vacation, right??

431
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:38,727
I'd be careful what
you say, Kenichi.

432
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,396
Renka's set her sights on
taking you back with us!

433
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,605
What?! Me?!

434
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:44,607
What does she
want with me?!

435
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:46,526
Uh-huuuuuh.
I'm not going!
