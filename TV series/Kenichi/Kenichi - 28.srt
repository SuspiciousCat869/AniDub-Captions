[Music]

2
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,759
So this Shinpaku Alliance...

3
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,762
It's becoming quite a
nuisance to Kisara's team...

4
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:51,264
Where did they come from?

5
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:53,641
Don't know.

6
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:55,560
But now Hermit's
missing, too.

7
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,772
If they're causing
that much trouble,

8
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:00,982
perhaps it's time
we brought them

9
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:03,234
to the Great Sage
Fist's attention.

10
00:02:04,944 --> 00:02:07,280
Nawwww...

11
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,951
How bout you guys just
leave this one to me...

12
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:13,411
I'll make sure those
Shinpaku kiddies stay

13
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:15,121
in the shallow end
where they belong.

14
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:27,884
Tanimoto's still absent...

15
00:02:27,884 --> 00:02:29,135
He hasn't shown
up at school

16
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:30,511
since you guys
had your fight.

17
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:31,971
I know...

18
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:34,057
He's probably off
training somewhere...

19
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:36,351
So next time he can
really kick my ass...

20
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:46,110
What's that ya got
there, Kenichi?

21
00:02:57,997 --> 00:03:00,500
I guess this letter
must be from her.

22
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,919
Gosh. I never knew you
were so popular.

23
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:07,173
'kay, I won't bother
you anymore...

24
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:09,467
You can get back to
your love letter.

25
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:10,927
No, wait Miu!

26
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,345
No, no, I think
it's great...

27
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:13,638
You just keep drooling.

28
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:15,556
I'll see you...

29
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:17,392
Hey! It's not like that!

30
00:03:17,392 --> 00:03:20,019
Miu!!

31
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:22,355
Hold on, was she
jealous...?

32
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:24,148
There's no way.

33
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,737
Hello... my puppet.

34
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:31,447
Don't sneak up
on me like that!

35
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:32,657
Jeez, Niijima!

36
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:34,033
I'm so sorry.

37
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,493
Did I scare you,
little girl?

38
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:37,120
SHINPAKU FEDERATION

39
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,206
Hey...! What are those
guys doing here?

40
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:42,959
Captain, sir...! We're
here at your request, sir!

41
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,877
I am not your captain...

42
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:47,922
and I would appreciate it if
you'd stop following me around.

43
00:03:47,922 --> 00:03:50,967
Actually, I gathered
everyone here today...

44
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:53,594
Ah, here comes the
rest of our group now.

45
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,181
What's up, Kenichi...?
Why the urgent message--

46
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:58,558
Is everything okay?

47
00:03:58,558 --> 00:03:59,851
Yeah, I'm s'posed
to be supervising

48
00:03:59,851 --> 00:04:01,436
the first years on
their workout...

49
00:04:01,436 --> 00:04:03,271
So can we make this quick?

50
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:04,522
Hey, Takeda...

51
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:06,232
Hey Ukita...

52
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:08,735
Yeah, actually I'm not the
one who called you here...

53
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:11,195
What my partner
means to say...

54
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:12,655
Is that he and I called
you here together,

55
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:15,366
to share our news.

56
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:19,912
Introducing Assault
Commander Kenichi Shirihama!

57
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:22,874
The newly ambidextrous
boxer, Takeda Ikki,

58
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:25,501
The Puncher!

59
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:28,046
And that champion of
justice, that judo wizard,

60
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:30,757
Ukita (mumblemumble)!

61
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:32,008
I give you...

62
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,427
Your three. Unstoppable.
Generals!

63
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:36,429
Add to the roster our
resident genius,

64
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:39,098
the fearless and fearsome,
Haruo Niijima...

65
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:41,017
and a few other
lowly soldiers...

66
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:43,144
and you have before you
the full, in-your-face,

67
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:46,147
official Shinpaku
Alliance!!

68
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:58,659
What happened?

69
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:02,789
Whoa. Easy, Captain Niijima.

70
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:04,415
I think you
should stay still.

71
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:06,084
Yeah. Stay still.

72
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:08,002
Next time your boyfriend's
feelin' lonely,

73
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:10,505
tell him to call a hotline.

74
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:14,008
Speaking of which, how's
your other love life goin'?

75
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:16,052
Same as always, I guess.

76
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,471
Wait, don't go.

77
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:20,306
No need to be shy.

78
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,974
Oh, is that it?
They were just being shy?

79
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:23,267
Cause I was worried.

80
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,393
Yeah, I thought
for a minute

81
00:05:24,393 --> 00:05:25,686
there was dissention
among our leaders,

82
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:26,687
which would've sucked.

83
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:28,189
Well now we know.

84
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:29,816
If they hit us, it's
cause they're shy.

85
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:30,858
I'm just glad the
Captain's here

86
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:32,318
to tell us
what they mean!

87
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:38,032
Shinpaku!

88
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,789
Really... A love letter...

89
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:46,249
Well, how about it...?

90
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:48,459
Gonna meet her like
she asked you to?

91
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:51,337
Well, it's.
Not that. Easy...

92
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:52,922
I don't wanna ruin
things with Miu,

93
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:54,590
you know what I mean?

94
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,301
I weren't aware you had anything
special with Miu to ruin...

95
00:05:57,301 --> 00:05:59,929
No point getting your
heart set on a hot rod

96
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:02,932
when you haven't given any
other roadsters a test drive.

97
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:05,476
I don't see why you're
so worried about Miu...

98
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:07,186
It's not like she's ever
given you the time a' day,

99
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:08,521
am I right?

100
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:10,481
Yeah, I guess
so, I just...

101
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:17,363
I always thought of her as a
goal I was working toward,

102
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:19,282
but now she's a
really good friend,

103
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:20,992
and I won't do anything
to mess that up.

104
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:24,161
I know she's the
one for me...

105
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:26,038
Even if she doesn't.

106
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:28,833
Oh, that's so sweet!

107
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,626
Alright then, kid.

108
00:06:30,626 --> 00:06:33,004
You know what you have to do
about this secret admirer...

109
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:35,298
You meet her and you find
a way to let her down easy.

110
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:37,466
Okay. I just wish I didn't
have to hurt someone

111
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:39,093
who was brave enough
to go out on a limb

112
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:41,178
and tell me she has
feelings for me.

113
00:06:45,474 --> 00:06:47,018
Love plays games...

114
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:48,769
with us all...

115
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:52,899
We are all toys she's
scattered on her floor... ...

116
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,109
or in her
rafters, eh, Miu?

117
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:02,325
Just dusting things off.

118
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:03,743
You can't overlook
the ceiling, you know.

119
00:07:03,743 --> 00:07:05,620
Dusty, dusty, dusty.

120
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,248
Soldiers, wind
up soldiers...

121
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:11,709
Ugh. This is out of tune.

122
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:13,836
Can Kenichi come
out and play?

123
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:16,130
Pretty please?

124
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,798
Hey.

125
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:19,425
Oh, man, you again...?

126
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,969
What are you doing out of
your worm hole so late?

127
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:23,304
Yeah, I'd love
to tell you...

128
00:07:23,304 --> 00:07:25,014
But can these two
go away first?

129
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:27,767
Okay you guys...

130
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:28,935
you can let him go...

131
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:31,312
You don't have to do this
to him every time, you know.

132
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:33,147
We know... So?

133
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:34,774
Is funny.

134
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:36,567
I'm gonna be totally
straight here...

135
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:40,071
I need to borrow your ninja
squad to murder someone.

136
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:42,239
What are you
blabbering about?

137
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,116
See there's this guy Loki,
you might've heard of him,

138
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:45,826
he's one of the
Ragnarok members,

139
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:47,245
anyway he wants to
have a peaceful

140
00:07:47,245 --> 00:07:48,496
sort of get together
with me tomorrow

141
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:50,915
to discuss the
future of our gang.

142
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,210
But isn't Loki
the fourth fist? !

143
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,753
That's right,
which is why...

144
00:07:58,297 --> 00:07:59,840
Your masters will be
waiting to ambush him

145
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,425
with their ninja skills

146
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:05,179
and chop his body into tiny
fish-digestible pieces!

147
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,764
They aren't
going to do that!

148
00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:08,224
Fine, whatever...

149
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:10,142
Then you can take
care of it yourself.

150
00:08:10,142 --> 00:08:11,727
Yeah, no way...

151
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:14,063
Didn't he say he just wanted a
peaceful meeting, anyway...?

152
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:15,356
I don't want to
have anything to do

153
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:17,233
with fighting
Ragnarok anymore...

154
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,693
And besides, I can't...

155
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:20,277
I have something
I have to do.

156
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:22,071
That so, and what
would that be?

157
00:08:23,823 --> 00:08:25,741
You're making
the evil bad eye.

158
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:27,743
We know you're
planning something.

159
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:30,413
I'm innocent...! I haven't
done anything--unhand me,

160
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:31,539
you ruffians!

161
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,165
Kenichi!

162
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:36,168
Are you going to let them treat
your best friend like this? !

163
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:42,550
Well... this
is the place.

164
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,968
Hah.

165
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:45,636
And Loki's in
for a surprise...

166
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:47,888
Thinks I'm stupid enough to
meet him one on one, does he?

167
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:49,432
Let's try six to one!

168
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:52,476
Welcome to the Lark!

169
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:54,228
Yes, hello there, miss.
e have six for now.

170
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:01,068
Ahhhh. There he is...

171
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:03,195
Sitting there like
a sitting duck.

172
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:08,284
Well now, what
have we here?

173
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:09,702
What's the matter, Loki,

174
00:09:09,702 --> 00:09:12,455
afraid to look your arch
nemesis in the eyeball...?

175
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:13,831
If you thought I'd
come here alone,

176
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,082
you were
sorely mistaken...

177
00:09:15,082 --> 00:09:16,500
Sorry... I
should've warned you

178
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,961
I'm known for
my evil genius...

179
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:20,296
Now why don't you
admit your defeat?

180
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:24,675
Please... You are
obviously outnumbered...

181
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:27,053
How could you hope to win
against these brave soldiers...?

182
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:28,512
You'd need an army
at your side,

183
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:29,972
and you're here all alone...

184
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:31,265
not that an army
could beat us--

185
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:32,767
prob'ly need two.

186
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,935
Oh... Two armies, is
that right...?

187
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:37,104
Well that is unfortunate,
isn't it...?

188
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:38,981
I only brought the one.

189
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:52,119
'Fraid you're not the only
evil genius in the room

190
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,412
this time, buddy.

191
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:54,830
Wait! No fair!
You can't ambush!

192
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:57,583
There's too many
of 'em, Captain,

193
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,043
we can't hold
them all back...!

194
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:00,211
Where are the generals?

195
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:02,254
Aren't they supposed
to be here by now?

196
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:04,048
You focus on keeping them
away from your Captain,

197
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:05,674
let me worry about that.

198
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:07,134
Alright.

199
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:10,054
Let's see the great Shinpaku
Alliance in action, huh?

200
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:34,563
[Music]

201
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:37,232
Love plays games...
with us all...

202
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:38,567
hmm hmm hmm hmm...

203
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:39,442
Kensei really
didn't have to buy

204
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:41,111
these snazzy
clothes for me...

205
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:43,029
I mean it's not like it's
a real date or anything,

206
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:45,240
I'm just meeting her so I can
let her down easy is all--

207
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,908
nooo biggie...

208
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:49,661
I wonder if she got all dressed
up to meet me today too.

209
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,962
Ah, jeez, I'm gonna be
late if I'm not careful...

210
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:02,173
I shouldn't have let Kensei
fuss over me for so long...

211
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:03,967
Let's see, the restaurant
where we're supposed to meet

212
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,844
should be around here somewhere,
but what was it called?

213
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:12,559
Somebody protect
the Captain!

214
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:18,857
Niijima! What did he get
himself into this time?

215
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:20,734
My pseudo-date's gonna
be here any minute,

216
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:22,277
I don't have time for this!

217
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:28,158
He really pissed
those guys off...

218
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:31,244
Buut, it doesn't have
anything to do with me...

219
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:32,579
And if I don't get
to this place quick,

220
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,164
the girl's gonna
think I didn't show!

221
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:38,752
Captain...! I don't think
the generals are coming, sir!

222
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:41,212
No...! I swear!
They'll be here!

223
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:42,881
I'm not so sure, sir,

224
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:45,383
I think the commander
would be here by now.

225
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:47,135
I don't care,
I don't care...

226
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:48,261
I'm just passing by

227
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:50,263
and this has nothing to
do with me whatsoever.

228
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:52,557
Commander Shirihama!!

229
00:11:55,685 --> 00:11:58,188
So this Shinpaku
Alliance is worthless...

230
00:11:58,188 --> 00:11:59,564
Although I have to admit,

231
00:11:59,564 --> 00:12:01,191
the crew is pretty
well trained,

232
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:03,318
protecting their captain
with their lives like that.

233
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:07,155
Listen up, peons...!

234
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:08,531
If you let me have
your leader...

235
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,450
then the rest
of you are free!

236
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:19,709
Don't worry, we
won't kill him,

237
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:21,920
we'll just make sure he doesn't
walk into any more ambushes

238
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,338
by breaking both his legs.

239
00:12:23,338 --> 00:12:24,673
Don't listen to him!

240
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:27,050
He's a liar, he won't
let you go anyway!

241
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,052
Oh man, what were
we thinking...?!

242
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:31,304
We can't beat Ragnarok,
they're way too strong.

243
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:36,351
Maybe if the generals
had shown up we could'a--

244
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:38,812
Listen...!

245
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:40,897
We're not giving up on
our commander just yet!

246
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:42,649
Huh? We're not? Really?

247
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:49,447
The Captain and Commander
Shirihama aren't just leaders,

248
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:50,949
they're best friends...!

249
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:52,367
Niijima was there
for Kenichi

250
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:53,702
when he was
being picked on!

251
00:12:53,702 --> 00:12:55,829
He protected him--there's
no way the Commander

252
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:57,330
would leave him here if
he knew what was going on

253
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,207
and he could get here in time!

254
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:00,792
Huuuh...? Oh yeah right...

255
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,293
That's what happened, at
least that's the version

256
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:04,796
I remember anyway, ha ha.

257
00:13:04,796 --> 00:13:06,256
Is that what he told them?

258
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:08,258
That lying jerk!

259
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:09,676
I refuse to believe
this is how

260
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:11,970
the Commander would
repay the Captain...!

261
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,097
He wouldn't just let
him get hurt...!

262
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:16,433
That's not how Shirihama
would treat his friend!

263
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:19,686
My... friend...

264
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:21,396
I know you got into
a fight with Kisara

265
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:23,481
in order to
protect the play.

266
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:26,526
And I want you to
know I appreciate it.

267
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:29,112
Oh, dear...!Look at
your poor face...!

268
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:30,321
Does it hurt alot?

269
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:31,906
Well no...

270
00:13:31,906 --> 00:13:33,158
Wait... I don't get it...

271
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:35,285
how did you find out I had
a run-in with Ragnarok?

272
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:36,703
Uh... well...

273
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:38,955
Niijima told me
all about it.

274
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:46,755
Listen, this is
noble and all...

275
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:49,174
But stay in the way, and
it's gonna get bloody.

276
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:52,844
That's right...

277
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:54,971
Bloody.

278
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:02,604
I give in.

279
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:10,320
I can't ignore the word
'friend' even if it is Niijima.

280
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,821
Shirihama!

281
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:13,990
The Commander's here!

282
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,825
Told you so!

283
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:29,297
Hey guys, sorry to break
up this little party

284
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:30,590
you're having.

285
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:32,634
Hope no one minds.

286
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:34,427
We just let ourselves
in the back way.

287
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,514
Tuh-KAY-duh
and OO-kee-tuh.

288
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:39,682
What the hell are
you doing here?

289
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:42,519
You traitors come to pick
another fight with Ragnarok?

290
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:50,860
Seriously though, what are
you two doin' here, anyway?

291
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,905
Nothin', we were just passing
by and we saw the ruckus.

292
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:54,989
That's right...

293
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:56,574
we heard you say
something about 'friends'

294
00:14:56,574 --> 00:14:59,202
and we figured maybe you could
use a couple more in here today.

295
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:00,745
Besides, I've
got this itch.

296
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:02,288
I've been wanting to try
out my new left hand on

297
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:04,415
one of my old
Ragnarok buddies.

298
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:07,043
They never got to see what
I'm really capable of.

299
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:08,920
This stupid...

300
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,964
damn wire puzzle...

301
00:15:10,964 --> 00:15:13,383
Why won't it...

302
00:15:13,383 --> 00:15:15,927
Just come apart already? !

303
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:22,559
Congratulations, morons.

304
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,685
You've all managed
to piss off

305
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:25,770
the Fourth Fist of Raknarok...

306
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,356
Good job...! Hope
you're ready for me.

307
00:15:28,356 --> 00:15:30,817
Can it, four eyes...! I've
been avoiding fights

308
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:32,777
with badly dressed hoodlums
much scarier than you

309
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:34,946
for longer than you might
think possible...

310
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,823
Now let me introduce
you to my generals!

311
00:15:40,451 --> 00:15:43,246
Hey, guys... Anyone care
if I kill that one first?

312
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,498
Heads up, you two. Ready?

313
00:15:57,176 --> 00:15:58,678
Well would ya look
who's been hard at work.

314
00:16:07,228 --> 00:16:08,730
I have to say, Kenichi,

315
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,106
I was a little
embarrassed.. .

316
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:11,733
But with moves that
good it's no wonder

317
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:13,776
you took us both out
as easy as ya did.

318
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:17,655
Well, as long as
you two are busy...

319
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:19,741
I'll see if Loki
measures up to his hype.

320
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:39,510
We just have to finish
off their leader!

321
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,095
Then the rest of
'em will give up!

322
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,057
You better back off!

323
00:16:47,644 --> 00:16:49,395
Or there's more
where that came from.

324
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:51,397
You just shake it
off, Kenichi...!

325
00:16:51,397 --> 00:16:53,900
We're behind you all the way!

326
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,109
Hey...!

327
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:57,070
Be... careful!

328
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,113
He's known for his feints!

329
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:01,574
Just when you think I'm
going for the eyes...

330
00:17:01,574 --> 00:17:04,661
look out for my sneaky
high kick...! Hah!

331
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:06,371
You've gotta
be kidding me.

332
00:17:08,498 --> 00:17:10,083
How can you even call
that ridiculous move

333
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,960
a feint with a
straight face...?

334
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,461
I see maneuvers a
hundred times better

335
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:15,338
than that one every day.

336
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,470
Do ya think so?

337
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:25,264
You show me
whatever you got...

338
00:17:25,264 --> 00:17:27,892
And I'll show you
it's not enough.

339
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:29,352
Alright...

340
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:30,436
Deal.

341
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:35,066
But you might be surprised
at what you find, tough guy.

342
00:17:43,783 --> 00:17:44,993
Gotcha!

343
00:17:47,036 --> 00:17:48,579
Yamazuki!

344
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,459
And Kao Loi!

345
00:17:55,211 --> 00:17:56,629
You've got nothing......

346
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:02,593
to show me.

347
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,305
-Alright! Way to go, Shirihama!
-Go, Shinpaku!

348
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:07,765
I can't believe it.

349
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:09,392
Loki lost.

350
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:11,144
Aaaand that concludes
our lesson...

351
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:13,354
You have seen the Shinpaku
Alliance's might...

352
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:15,148
Never again question
our power...

353
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:17,817
Our great commander
Shirihama calls on Karate,

354
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:20,403
Judo, Muay Thai and the
Chinese martial arts...!

355
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:22,196
He is history's
strongest disciple!

356
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:23,823
And you will
never forget it!

357
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:26,200
You're painting it on a
bit thick there, Niijima.

358
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,411
Uh, okay, we didn't know
about Shirahama-

359
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,954
-we're really sorry...!

360
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:32,248
But we'll pass the
word along, we swear!

361
00:18:32,248 --> 00:18:33,708
Let's get outta here! Hurry!

362
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,959
Wait a minute, I
have nothing to do

363
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,377
with the Shinpaku Alliance!

364
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:38,004
Don't spread the word!

365
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:40,673
Hey, make sure you
mention us too!

366
00:18:40,673 --> 00:18:42,550
I don't think they
heard you, big guy.

367
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:46,262
Dude, false modesty
really doesn't suit you.

368
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:49,223
Shinpaku...! Shinpaku!

369
00:18:49,223 --> 00:18:52,143
I knew you'd come rescue us,
Commander, I just knew it!

370
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:53,770
To tell you the truth, I
was on my way somewhere-

371
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,271
-I kinda almost didn't.

372
00:18:57,315 --> 00:18:59,359
Oh no! I forgot,
I'm totally late!

373
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,235
If I don't get there
soon I'll miss her!

374
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:03,571
That does it...

375
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:05,281
What we've done here
today, gentlemen,

376
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:07,533
is proof that the Eight
Fists of Ragnarok

377
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:11,079
are mere stepping stones
on our way to greatness.

378
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:13,664
Now, let's see the shamed
face of our defeated foe.

379
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:18,461
What?

380
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:21,339
Is there something the
matter, General Takeda?

381
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:23,341
That's... not Loki.

382
00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:26,719
So you mean we
got the wrong guy?

383
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:29,555
Yeah, the real Loki's face
isn't nearly that funny lookin'.

384
00:19:29,555 --> 00:19:31,057
You idiots...

385
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,309
You think they'd send the
real Loki out after you...?

386
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:34,811
You guys're nothing.

387
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:37,480
He wouldn't waste the energy
on you, and if he did...

388
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,941
none of you guys would
even stand a chance.

389
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:42,568
This is Ragnarok you're
dealing with now.

390
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:44,862
Not some little high
school karate club...

391
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:46,489
I'm only one of
his shadows,

392
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:47,949
just wait til you
experience--

393
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:49,951
Okay! That's enough.

394
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:51,953
And just as I dance on
the face of his lackey,

395
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:53,996
so shall I dance on the
true face of Loki

396
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:55,957
the Fourth Fist soon enough!

397
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:58,960
I'll just have to do a little
more research next time.

398
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,337
This isn't over yet.

399
00:20:01,337 --> 00:20:03,923
Whoo, what an exhausting
day, am I right?

400
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:08,511
Niijima...! Will
you please chill? !

401
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:10,721
Hey, Kenichi.

402
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:12,140
You're a local boy, right,

403
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,016
could you help me out with
some directions here?

404
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:15,191
Maybe.

405
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:20,316
I'm looking for a restaurant
called the Matsue Lark,

406
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:21,776
you know anything
about it...?

407
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:25,154
I got a hot date waitin' for
me and I'm runnin' kinda late.

408
00:20:25,154 --> 00:20:26,239
Hey, what're you lookin
at--don't you have

409
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,032
one of your own to get
to, Takeda...?

410
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:29,868
Jeez, gimme a break.

411
00:20:29,868 --> 00:20:32,328
Uh, that's where I'm
supposed to meet mine.

412
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:34,998
Huh...? But the Matsue
Lark is where I'm going!

413
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:37,333
Um, guys, the
Matsue Lark...?

414
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,835
That's actually the name
of the restaurant

415
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:41,004
you're standing
in right now...

416
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:42,547
Didn't you see the sign?

417
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:43,923
What? !

418
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:45,383
I don't understand,

419
00:20:45,383 --> 00:20:47,302
how do we all have the
same meeting place?

420
00:20:47,302 --> 00:20:48,803
It can't be a
coincidence...

421
00:20:48,803 --> 00:20:50,138
Can it?

422
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:52,265
No... It's too weird.

423
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:54,183
Yoo-hoo!

424
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:02,650
Oh my...! You
all showed up!

425
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,068
I just knew you would!

426
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:06,654
I've been waii-ting...!
So sorry about the map.

427
00:21:06,654 --> 00:21:08,781
It was a teensy bit
hard to understand.

428
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:14,913
I just don't know
what I would'a done

429
00:21:14,913 --> 00:21:16,664
if you boys hadn't shown up!

430
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:19,250
But you were all right in
the nick of time, weren't you? !

431
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,461
My heroes!

432
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:23,254
I'll kill you...!

433
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:24,505
You bastard!

434
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:27,634
Me first! Get back here!

435
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:28,968
You wanna sound
like a girl?

436
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:30,553
I'll make you
sound like a girl!

437
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:34,390
Grab him! Yeah!

438
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,726
Niijima!!

439
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:38,436
Captain...! Run faster!

440
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:44,984
How he is so fast? !

441
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:47,111
I really thought she
was the one, man!

442
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:49,113
I did! Don't be
a pansy, Ukita!

443
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,367
The benefit of running
away all the time

444
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:55,078
is you have loads of
practice for when it counts!

445
00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:57,789
You'll thank me someday,
boys, I promise!

446
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:13,930
I got the video
surveillance

447
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,682
from the other building
like you said...

448
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:17,225
I also got the audio
feed from the bugs

449
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:18,768
I planted in the restaurant...

450
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:21,938
Did you want background
music with these?

451
00:22:21,938 --> 00:22:24,232
It's not a music
video, Number 20.

452
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:26,109
You don't have to
get all creative...

453
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:27,360
Oh, yeah.

454
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,070
Can you get me some
more wire puzzles?

455
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,947
Something harder
this time.

456
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:32,323
Yes, sir!

457
00:22:40,665 --> 00:22:42,959
Hello... So you're the
Shinpaku Alliance.

458
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,794
It's nice to meet you...

459
00:22:44,794 --> 00:22:46,379
Thank you for
taking the time...

460
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:48,214
to show me your weakness.

461
00:22:48,214 --> 00:23:01,519
[Music]

462
00:24:19,013 --> 00:24:20,431
Hello, friend.

463
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:22,141
I brought you information
about the Fifth Fist...

464
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:23,434
Siegfried.

465
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:24,727
I told you, I don't
want anything

466
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:27,146
to do with Ragnarok
anymore! I'm not listening!

467
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:29,357
Go back to your home
planet, why don't you?

468
00:24:29,357 --> 00:24:31,734
Ouch. That's not very nice.
Too bad.

469
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:33,569
I thought you'd like to know
he's called the Zombie

470
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:35,446
because no matter how
often you strike him down,

471
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:37,198
he always rises
from the dead.

472
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:39,242
The Zombie? Seriously?

473
00:24:39,242 --> 00:24:40,827
Hey, wait! Where
are you going?

474
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:42,870
Back to my home
planet like you said.

475
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,081
You don't need me,
isn't that right?
