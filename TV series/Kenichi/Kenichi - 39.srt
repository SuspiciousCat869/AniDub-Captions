00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:11,553
[Music]

2
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:54,181
Now... Why don't we all
just take a breath.

3
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:00,688
Hurry Big Boobs...!

4
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,691
Please... Get that
kitten to a vet now!

5
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:04,900
Yeah. You got it!

6
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:07,903
Don't let her get
away! Get her!

7
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:09,238
Come back here!

8
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:15,494
I'm not gonna let
you get in her way.

9
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:16,829
How's that feel,
traitor...?

10
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:17,663
Now let go!

11
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:19,832
Yeah! We've been waiting for
the chance to kick you

12
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:21,250
while you're down.

13
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:28,424
Cut it out!

14
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:35,097
Hibiki... Are you okay?

15
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:41,312
I hit a girl...!I didn't
mean to- it was a reflex-

16
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:43,397
I swear I'd never
knock down a girl!

17
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,024
Hey... you guys...!

18
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:46,358
that's Kenichi Shirahama!

19
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,152
Good... Forget
about the girl...

20
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:50,112
He's the one
everyone's after-

21
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:52,031
Freya will be thrilled
if we defeat him.

22
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:54,533
Wait... At least tell me
who you are first...

23
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:56,952
Are you girls enemies
of Ragnarok like I am?

24
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:58,662
Not quite... you see...

25
00:02:58,662 --> 00:03:01,165
we're all members
of Ragnarok.

26
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:03,709
I guess you could say we're
old friends of Kisara's.

27
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:07,838
But then she
betrayed us...

28
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:10,716
She's a traitor and she
deserves to be punished...

29
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:13,427
So who better to do it
than her old friends, right?

30
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,013
Now... We've done
enough talking...

31
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:17,431
Prepare yourself...

32
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,641
Kenichi Shirahama!

33
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:22,394
You can't... do that...

34
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,355
You girls have
got it all wrong!

35
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:25,648
If you wanna
punish the person

36
00:03:25,648 --> 00:03:27,525
who betrayed you
then do it...

37
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:30,236
but you have no right
to call them a friend.

38
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:32,279
A real friend
understands...

39
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,323
They see the reasoning behind
their friend's decision

40
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:36,617
and don't consider
it betrayal.

41
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:39,328
Sorry... I've betrayed you
once again, my friend.

42
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:44,833
Well... that goes for everyone
except for Niijima.

43
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,919
I'm tired of listening
to your yapping...

44
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,379
Now prepare yourself!

45
00:03:50,214 --> 00:03:51,841
Sai? !

46
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:53,175
I've got him!

47
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:56,303
Ball and chain? !

48
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,849
Metal fans? !

49
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,268
A staff? !

50
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,439
Tonfa? !

51
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,150
Geez, it's like fighting
a weapons museum.

52
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,152
So you're trained
in weapons?

53
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,572
Well, yeah... you
could say that.

54
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:16,574
What's the matter...? Why
do you keep dodging-

55
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:18,075
why won't you attack us?

56
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,743
Yeah, what kind of
assault captain are you? !

57
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,914
Telling them is probably
only gonna make it worse.

58
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:25,624
Well, you see...

59
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,713
I... I've sworn to myself that
I would never hit a girl.

60
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:34,967
Stop joking around!

61
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:37,177
I knew they'd be angry!

62
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:40,389
And they say
chivalry is dead...

63
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:48,814
But we don't need
your courtesy...

64
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:51,358
we're strong.

65
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,484
Freya!

66
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:55,613
What the hell
just happened? !

67
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:57,573
Did she throw
something at me?

68
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,366
I didn't even
see her coming.

69
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,826
Well...

70
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:02,453
the captain of the
Shinpaku Alliance,

71
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:04,496
Kenichi Shirahama...

72
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,999
You don't seem as strong
as they say you are.

73
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,792
Did you girls
punish the traitor?

74
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:10,252
Yes...

75
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,087
And we found evidence
of her betrayal.

76
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,258
She's pathetic.

77
00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:18,594
Okay, I'll leave
everything up to you.

78
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:19,887
Yes ma'am.

79
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,764
And take care of
this guy, would you?

80
00:05:21,764 --> 00:05:23,015
Yes ma'am!

81
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:24,600
Go for it ladies!

82
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,934
Stop it!

83
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:30,731
Wow... what a strong man...

84
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,107
I'm so scared.

85
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:34,026
What happened to all that
courage you had before?

86
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:35,319
Couldn't hang little man?

87
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:40,366
I've had enough...!

88
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:42,576
Watch out cause I'm
gonna explode!

89
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,079
What...? It's like nothing
even happened to him.

90
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,455
We've beaten the crap
out of him but somehow

91
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:48,582
he doesn't seem to be
phased by our attacks...

92
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,292
He's some kind of monster!

93
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:51,835
What should we do now?

94
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:53,462
I'm finishing this...

95
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:55,589
I don't care if you
are a bunch of girls!

96
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:01,178
I can't... do it...

97
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:03,389
I just can't hit a girl.

98
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:06,058
Shut up you sexist jerk!

99
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:09,687
Ladies... Get in
Valhalla position!

100
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:12,106
Right! Since our single blows
aren't affecting him...

101
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,899
we'll attack all at once.

102
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:17,027
Alright... let's
do this girls!

103
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:20,239
And now... witness our
Valhalla attack!

104
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,824
There's no way you
can keep dodging us

105
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:23,951
when we've got you
surrounded like this.

106
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,787
No one has ever been able
to escape this attack before!

107
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,832
Looks like it's over,
Kenichi Shirahama!

108
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,131
Strategic withdrawal!

109
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,382
No way!

110
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:39,633
You've gotta be kidding.

111
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,677
Oh well... at least I learned
something useful

112
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:43,470
from watching
Niijima in action...

113
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,930
how to retreat.

114
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,432
Don't let him get
away! After him!

115
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,022
So Shigure...

116
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:55,524
How's it going?

117
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:02,948
Look... I'll take care of the
cooking from now on...

118
00:07:02,948 --> 00:07:04,616
I don't want you
burning the place down.

119
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:09,413
Hey... I've got a great
idea Shigure...

120
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:11,457
How 'bout I let you
arrange everything? !

121
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:21,675
My... this is certainly
a different setup.

122
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,386
Hey... why're those
dumplings upside down?

123
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,221
Just... cause.

124
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:28,474
What...?! Well it's
freakin' me out!

125
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:31,477
Shigure... he's OCD
about his food.

126
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:33,562
Where's Kenichi
and Miu...?!

127
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:35,314
The orange duck
is getting cold.

128
00:07:35,314 --> 00:07:37,566
Um... I think you mean
orange chicken.

129
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:45,699
Aw... you gonna go eat all
alone on the roof again?

130
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,159
You know it wouldn't kill
ya to have dinner with us

131
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,286
in here sometime,
Shigure...

132
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:51,538
We promise not to
bite or anything.

133
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,332
Why do I even bother?

134
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:56,794
I'm going to wait...

135
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:58,003
When Kenichi and Miu...

136
00:07:58,003 --> 00:07:59,671
come back...

137
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:00,839
I'll eat...

138
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,132
with... you.

139
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:04,343
Well... consider
my mind blown-

140
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:05,636
I never thought
you'd say that!

141
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:07,221
Must say I'm surprised...

142
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:10,849
I can't remember the last time
Shigure had dinner with us...

143
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,684
It seems that having
Kenichi around

144
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:15,270
has made her a little more
social, don't you think?

145
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:17,773
Kenichi...

146
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:19,650
come... home.

147
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:23,195
Come back here you idiot!

148
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:25,030
I never thought I'd
find myself running...

149
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,407
from a group of
seriously hot chicks...

150
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,618
who're chasing me
with deadly weapons!

151
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:32,788
I'm not ready to
die, hot chicks!

152
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:35,666
He's running so fast even
though he's carrying someone...

153
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,125
Team 2...

154
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,003
Go to District 2
Section 16 immediately!

155
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:41,171
I can't ditch them!

156
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:42,548
Get him! Stop!

157
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:43,757
Come back here!

158
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:02,776
It looks like he's
unconscious...

159
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:03,944
he'll be fine.

160
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,863
Really doctor? !
He's not dead? !

161
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:07,531
Thank goodness!

162
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:09,116
There's nothing to worry
about young lady...

163
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,243
I promise he's gonna
be just fine...

164
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:13,287
So no more crying, k?

165
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,873
K...! You're right.

166
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:17,332
Don't you worry, Noir.

167
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:20,294
You'll be back to
normal in no time!

168
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,421
I'll keep an eye on
him until he wakes up.

169
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:24,047
Just to make sure.

170
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:26,842
Thank you so much, doctor.

171
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:28,051
Um, sir...

172
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:30,554
how much do I owe
you for Noir's visit?

173
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:32,097
Don't worry about it-

174
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:34,725
I'm not going to charge
you for it, miss.

175
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:36,059
'll cover it...

176
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,436
It's fine...

177
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,854
After all, you found this
little kitten abandoned

178
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:40,397
on the street, right...?

179
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:42,524
So it's not your
responsibility to pay.

180
00:09:42,524 --> 00:09:43,984
I tell you what,

181
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,528
I'll even see if I can
find a good home for him.

182
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:49,281
What...?! You really
think you can?

183
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:51,283
I'm not positive.

184
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:53,410
We'll just have
to wait and see.

185
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,996
Oh my goodness! Thank you!!

186
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:59,082
Hey now! What did I tell
you about the crying?

187
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,459
Alright then, I'll
give you a call

188
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:02,085
if anything comes up.

189
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:03,545
I can't thank
you enough, sir.

190
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,300
Kisara!

191
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,135
I completely
forgot about her!

192
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:11,929
Get back here!

193
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:14,598
Leave... me... a-lone!

194
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,141
Hurry ladies!

195
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,982
You gotta be kidding-
there's more? !

196
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:25,984
Now, we've got him.

197
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:27,861
Well... now you're
surrounded...

198
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,488
What will you do?

199
00:10:29,488 --> 00:10:30,948
Yeah, you're not
getting away this time.

200
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,243
You... You've gone too far.

201
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:36,453
Valhalla
attack...! Level 2!

202
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:37,788
Looks like your time's up!

203
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:44,586
Shuriken!

204
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,428
You're late for dinner.

205
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:54,888
Come home...

206
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:55,973
right now...

207
00:10:55,973 --> 00:10:57,432
your dinner is ready...

208
00:10:57,432 --> 00:10:58,892
it'll get cold.

209
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:14,367
Who the hell is that? !

210
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:15,869
Where'd she come from? !

211
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:17,287
She threw those
shuriken so hard

212
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:18,746
they're stuck in the asphalt!

213
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:19,956
Kenichi...

214
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:21,666
I cooked... food.

215
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,377
Then Kensei... stopped me.

216
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:25,670
New plan...

217
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,672
we'll have to take
care of her too.

218
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:28,798
Right!

219
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:30,091
Take this!

220
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:32,010
No! Don't do that!

221
00:11:35,388 --> 00:11:37,056
What? !

222
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:47,650
Get outta here!

223
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,111
Hurry...! You gotta
leave right now...!

224
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:52,530
This woman is
incredibly dangerous!

225
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,574
Shigure... these girls
are friends of mine

226
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:56,326
so please don't hurt them...

227
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:59,204
Um... We're just playing around
so it looked like a fight.

228
00:11:59,204 --> 00:12:01,080
What now? Attack him...

229
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,624
He's lying to us.

230
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:03,875
Right!

231
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:08,129
No... don't...!
What're you doing? !

232
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:15,470
If you choose to aim
your weapons at me...

233
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,347
I promise you
that you'll...

234
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:19,265
end up... dead.

235
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,810
Goodbye hot chicks.

236
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,978
Well...

237
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:26,105
girls?

238
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:28,316
I told you to run!

239
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:29,651
Now you're gonna
end up dead!

240
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,527
I warned you- why
didn't you listen? !

241
00:12:34,072 --> 00:12:35,532
And now...

242
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:37,367
we... fight.

243
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:42,914
She's... for real.

244
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:44,457
She's carrying
a real sword!

245
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:46,209
I think we should
call Freya for help.

246
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,127
Calm down ladies...! We
have to stay focused

247
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:50,088
and confident in
our abilities...

248
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:52,757
We can defeat them
without Freya's help.

249
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:55,385
This must be a test
Freya set up for us.

250
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:57,971
She wants us to prove
ourselves to her!

251
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:59,597
Everyone spread out!

252
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:01,766
Try to keep a safe
distance while attacking!

253
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:06,187
What the hell
is going on...?!

254
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:07,772
Who is that woman?

255
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:09,357
And what's wrong
with Shirahama?

256
00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:11,234
Why's he freaking out?

257
00:13:11,234 --> 00:13:12,777
What happened? !

258
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:15,321
Shigure, tell them
you're not serious!

259
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:16,531
Tell them you're
just kidding!

260
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:17,991
But I'm not kidding.

261
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:19,534
I'm very serious.

262
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:20,201
I'm gonna fight them.

263
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:22,036
You can't go around
beating up people

264
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:23,913
you don't know!

265
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:25,206
We can handle it...

266
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:26,499
Ready, girls?

267
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:27,750
Yeah! Yeah!

268
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,168
Wait!

269
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:31,796
-Kisara!
-You're awake!

270
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:34,132
This is my battle so
I'll take care of them.

271
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:37,760
Now leave...

272
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,221
Just grab your friend
and get out of here!

273
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:41,764
Huh?

274
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:43,141
But you're injured!

275
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:44,976
You're in no condition
to fight right now!

276
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:47,145
There are two things in
this world that I hate:

277
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:50,231
women with big breasts and
women who use weapons...

278
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:52,191
This is my chance to
teach them a lesson.

279
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:53,943
Do you think
mine are... big?

280
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:56,904
Yeah... Very.

281
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,448
Kisara, wait!

282
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,784
I've always thought
fighting with a weapon

283
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:03,119
was a sign of weakness...

284
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:09,334
If a man and woman
are to fight fairly

285
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:11,252
the woman must
have a weapon...

286
00:14:11,252 --> 00:14:12,587
you can use this one...

287
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:13,630
Kisara.

288
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:16,466
I don't need it...

289
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:17,842
I just wanna learn how
to fight on my own,

290
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:20,345
without any tricks.

291
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:22,055
I'm sorry if that's
not what you wanted

292
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:23,556
when you took me on...

293
00:14:23,556 --> 00:14:25,099
But that's how
it has to be.

294
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,771
If that's the way
you feel about it...

295
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:31,022
then I'm afraid you
can't be a part

296
00:14:31,022 --> 00:14:32,648
of the Wall-keer-ee.

297
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:36,194
But I'm sure
we'll meet again.

298
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:39,322
Someday you'll make it to
my level- I'm sure of it.

299
00:14:39,322 --> 00:14:40,990
I'll be waiting...

300
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,408
Kisara.

301
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,453
Shigure!

302
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:49,624
Now sleep... little... girl.

303
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:52,418
Can you hear me...?
You okay, Kisara...?!

304
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:54,379
What do you think
you're doing...?!

305
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:55,880
Why'd you knock
her out like that? !

306
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,257
She's... hurt.

307
00:14:58,257 --> 00:14:59,634
She's been injured...

308
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:01,135
therefore...

309
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:03,262
she... can't fight.

310
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:05,515
Shigure...

311
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:06,849
Let's go home...

312
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:08,017
now...

313
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:10,436
and eat dinner... k?

314
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:13,523
Um... what about them?

315
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:19,487
I should finish
this... huh?

316
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,030
Please just don't
kill anybody!

317
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,407
They're in the way...

318
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:24,117
I'll make 'em... move.

319
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:26,285
Just... don't...
kill... them...

320
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:28,913
And don't use your
katana either.

321
00:15:28,913 --> 00:15:31,374
And don't use the chain
sword or your shuriken...!

322
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:32,500
In fact, don't use
anything sharp!

323
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:35,461
What about this?

324
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:38,172
No I don't want you using
a rice spoon...!

325
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:39,590
Wait... a rice spoon?

326
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,175
Why do you have
that with you?

327
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:42,718
Akisame... made it...

328
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:43,970
for me.

329
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,180
Are you seriously gonna
fight us with a rice spoon? !

330
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,141
You have no idea who
you're messin' with!

331
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:50,184
It looks like we'll just
have to teach you a lesson!

332
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:56,399
What...?! No way...!

333
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,984
How'd she...?!

334
00:15:57,984 --> 00:16:00,027
That's... impossible!

335
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,446
She broke it...

336
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:02,738
no.

337
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:05,116
This... rice... spoon...

338
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:06,951
is no different
than my sword...

339
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:08,286
cause in my hands...

340
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:09,495
it has...

341
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:11,706
the same... strength.

342
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:14,375
A weapon is like the fists
of a karate master...

343
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,377
or the knees of a
Muay Thai boxer...

344
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:19,046
It's an extension
of your body.

345
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,591
If you're wielding a
weapon to gain power...

346
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:23,926
you can never become
it's master...

347
00:16:23,926 --> 00:16:26,929
You need to become the master
of your own body... first.

348
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:30,766
Why are you leaving
the Walkyrie?

349
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:32,685
You realize you're betraying
not only your friends

350
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:34,520
but Freya as well.

351
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,439
I'm sorry but I have
to walk my own path.

352
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:39,066
I have to be
my own master.

353
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:42,487
Damn you!

354
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:45,990
C'mon... we'll
fight without them.

355
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,492
I've had enough.

356
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,495
What the-? !

357
00:16:52,872 --> 00:16:54,332
My clothes!

358
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:01,547
Hey... what's the matter...?

359
00:17:01,547 --> 00:17:03,090
Did I accidentally
hit you...?

360
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,550
Why's your nose bleeding?

361
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,469
No you didn't hit me.
I'm just fine!

362
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:08,846
Don't worry about me!

363
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:11,557
I swear we're gonna make you pay
for this Kenichi Shirahama!

364
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:15,061
Now... let's go...

365
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:17,313
Apachai's gonna starve
to death... soon.

366
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:18,814
I'm right behind you.

367
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:20,024
Wait...

368
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:21,609
Let me go.

369
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,736
Hey... where do you
think you're going? !

370
00:17:23,736 --> 00:17:26,781
I'm sorry I caused you so
much trouble, Shirahama...

371
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:28,533
But now...

372
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,284
I've got some things
to take care of.

373
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,578
Hey, wait! You should let
your wounds heal first!

374
00:17:34,247 --> 00:17:35,540
Shigure?

375
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,626
Kenichi!

376
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:42,338
Miu!

377
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:44,423
I'm so glad you're okay!

378
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:47,969
Yeah...! Well,
thanks to Shigure.

379
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:50,763
So... where's Kisara?

380
00:17:50,763 --> 00:17:52,098
Well, uh...

381
00:18:05,778 --> 00:18:07,488
I've come back, Freya.

382
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:13,744
Well... Look what the
cat dragged in...

383
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:15,454
We've been waiting- I
knew you'd show your face

384
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:17,665
sooner or later.

385
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,711
Listen. I left because I
didn't agree with you

386
00:18:21,711 --> 00:18:23,921
and the path you
wanted me to take...

387
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:26,132
I wanted to prove that a
woman can fight a man

388
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:28,009
on her own without
some stupid weapon.

389
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:30,428
Now...

390
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,808
I think I've proven
that fact to everyone...

391
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:38,644
so I don't need to be a part
of the Eight Deadly Fists.

392
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:40,771
Eliminate the
traitor, men!

393
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:42,481
Yes sir!

394
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:49,947
I just came to
say goodbye...

395
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:52,867
My team and I are no longer
gonna be a part of Ragnarok.

396
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,535
Sorry!

397
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,953
Don't let her get away!

398
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:58,164
-Yes, sir!
-Wait, Loki.

399
00:18:58,164 --> 00:18:59,373
She knows what her
punishment will be

400
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:00,833
for leaving Ragnarok.

401
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,877
Just leave her alone.

402
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:04,629
I don't understand.

403
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:06,714
She was my best
disciple...

404
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:09,592
What's the deal with
the Shinpaku Alliance?

405
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:11,260
It seems like everyone
who's faced them

406
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,013
has started acting
strangely afterwards.

407
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,244
Hey... you're not
qualified to fix that.

408
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,164
Wow...! That was fast...!

409
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,166
So...? How'd the
punishment go?

410
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,669
Everything's going
according to my plan...

411
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,337
As of this evening both
Hermit and Valkyrie

412
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,506
have decided to
leave Ragnarok...

413
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,466
So it looks like the Eight
Deadly Fists are on the

414
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,594
verge of falling
apart now!

415
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,429
One day, hopefully
in the near future,

416
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,848
Ragnarok will be out
of the picture.

417
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,141
Loki...

418
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,768
Don't you wanna share
your secret plans

419
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,270
with your little buddy?

420
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,521
Don't you worry about it.

421
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,190
So far, everything's going
just as I've planned.

422
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,775
But what about when Odin
took your goggles

423
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,944
and showed everyone your face!

424
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,946
I'm sorry, sir...! I
didn't mean it...!

425
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,448
Please don't kick
me anymore!

426
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,950
You kids are late.

427
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,035
Do you have any idea
what time it is? !

428
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,620
Sorry everyone.

429
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,664
Hey... Where's Apachai?

430
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,374
-Apa...
-Over here, starving.

431
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,251
Apa... pa... pa...

432
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,961
We eat!!!

433
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:12,795
Oh, crap!

434
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,548
Calm down, man.

435
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,508
You gonna eat
the plate too?

436
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,677
So...? Do you... like it?

437
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,387
Well... its different.

438
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,806
I'm worried about Kisara.

439
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,141
Why would she leave
without letting her

440
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,767
injuries heal

441
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,103
Miu! Apachai needs more rice!

442
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,354
Coming right up!

443
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,237
Don't worry
she'll be okay.

444
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,781
I can't believe I was so
distracted with the kitten...

445
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,366
I should've made
sure Kisara

446
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,660
got to the
emergency room too.

447
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,912
I'm telling you she's
gonna just be fine...

448
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,414
She's a pretty tough
chick, you know?

449
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,876
Kisara!

450
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,003
You're okay...?!
I was worried!

451
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,713
Of course I'm fine...

452
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,299
I've had some serious martial
arts training, you know.

453
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,717
So... anyway...

454
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,388
How's the kitten...?!
Is Noir okay? !

455
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,098
He's just fine...

456
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,850
The vet said he's
not hurt at all.

457
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,477
Oh, thank goodness.

458
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,187
Oh...! Guess what...?

459
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,938
The vet was a
really nice guy...

460
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,358
And he said he would try
to find a home for Noir.

461
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,734
Are you kidding? !

462
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,529
Well... I guess...

463
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,364
maybe... that's for the best.

464
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,949
Yeah...

465
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,951
I'm sure he'll find the
kitty a great place to live.

466
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,747
Why do I feel like I'm
forgetting something?

467
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,418
What...?!

468
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,712
But... why didn't
you tell us? !

469
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,589
They said that
we could keep it? !

470
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,508
I uh... I'm so sorry...

471
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,176
but you see I didn't
really have a chance

472
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,594
to tell you yesterday.

473
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,304
-Let's go, big boobs!
-Yeah!

474
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,100
This is just great-

475
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,352
we've always wanted to have
a cat in the family.

476
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,479
I promise we'll take
really good care of him.

477
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,190
Thanks a lot- I
love my new kitty!

478
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,692
This family came by and told
me they were looking for a cat

479
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,860
and I thought it'd
be a wonderful home

480
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,237
for the kitten...

481
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,655
Is that okay, ladies?

482
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,864
A family...

483
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,327
Of course... I think
he'll be very happy...

484
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,871
I mean he deserves to have
a family that'll love him.

485
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,248
Right?

486
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,963
Please take good
care of him, okay?

487
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,426
Thanks again! Bye-bye!

488
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,971
It's for the best...

489
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,097
Dontcha think?

490
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,849
Yeah.

491
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,934
Please forgive me!

492
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,152
I said I'm sorry!
Please don't kill me!

493
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,988
Keep going! Tickle him
till he pees his pants!

494
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,407
I even bought a cat
toy for little Noir!

495
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,367
No! No! No tickle!

496
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,577
Stop it! Stop!

497
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,245
Not up there!

498
00:22:51,245 --> 00:23:21,108

499
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,792
I don't understand why
the First Fist, Odin,

500
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,502
is so interested
in my badge.

501
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:22,670
What's up with that?

502
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,922
Well, can you remember
anything special about it?

503
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:25,923
Is it valuable?

504
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,091
I don't think so.

505
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,468
I mean, I bought it at a
general store when I was a kid.

506
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,303
I haven't been back
there in a long time.

507
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,638
I think we should
go check it out.

508
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,640
Maybe something will jog
your memory if you go back

509
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,892
to the place
where you got it.

510
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,727
But I seriously haven't
been back in years!

511
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,063
I don't even know if that
little store is there anymore!

512
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,107
You're never gonna find
out if you don't go.

513
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,108
Might as well
check it out.

514
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,484
Come on! I'll go with you!
