[Music]

2
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,577
Alright...

3
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,621
If any attack of
mine that I try...

4
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,039
is pointless...

5
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,250
That leaves one option...

6
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,045
Let's see how you handle
attacks from somebody else!

7
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,051
Apa!

8
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,678
A-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-PA!

9
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,683
No way!

10
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,604
And the hundred degrees
street fighter...

11
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,404
Let me introduce you

12
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,324
to the master of all Chinese
martial arts, Kensei Ma!

13
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,995
No! Not again!

14
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,208
Now face the maiden of weapons,
Shigure Kosaka.

15
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,881
The philosophical judo master...
Akisame Koetsuji!

16
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,805
Sheer ignorance...

17
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,432
All fighters know that
to study martial arts...

18
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,725
The art of imitation

19
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,186
is the most important
skill required to master.

20
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,191
What's wrong with him?

21
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,405
Unbelievably reckless...

22
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,950
He's combining his Sei and
his Dou powers together.

23
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,665
Kenichi, whether you
remember it or not,

24
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,125
a long time ago
you did something

25
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,502
for which I can
never forgive you!

26
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,586
What...?

27
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,004
What did I do?

28
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:46,903
What an amazing kick!

29
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:48,488
Damn...! Where'd he go?

30
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:52,658
Behind me!

31
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,418
He activated his Seikkuken
in midair just then.

32
00:04:02,418 --> 00:04:03,628
Is that even possible?

33
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,757
By using both the
outward powers of Dou

34
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:10,760
and the inner powers
of Sei, it is...

35
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,721
but it is very,
very dangerous...

36
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,182
And not a choice that
most fighters would make,

37
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:18,017
regardless of
the situation.

38
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:21,270
Oh no!

39
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,438
Kenichi!

40
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,191
Ogata...

41
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:27,235
Are you proud of what
you've led your disciple to?

42
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:30,530
I can't believe it.

43
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,533
I don't think I've ever
seen Akisame mad before...

44
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:34,909
Not like this.

45
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,503
A-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa!

46
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:47,046
A-pa!!

47
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:59,308
I've... never seen
that kind of strength.

48
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:01,561
I know it's amazing, huh?

49
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:03,145
Now die!

50
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:06,315
How's he doing this...?

51
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:08,734
Does he have a
Berserker mode, too?

52
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:10,111
Not quite...

53
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:12,572
From what I'm seeing he's much
fiercer than Berserker...

54
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:15,283
This is another
level entirely.

55
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:17,410
We just have to hope
Kenichi survives it.

56
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:27,128
It's happening already.

57
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:28,921
-Look.
-Yes, I see.

58
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,131
What...? What's happening?

59
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,966
It's the Dou and Sei...

60
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:33,634
The two opposite
forces are competing

61
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,262
for ultimate control
over his body.

62
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:37,763
Releasing them
at the same time

63
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:40,182
is like releasing
simultaneous explosions

64
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:41,893
in a sealed bottle...

65
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:44,478
The payoff is that you
get almost limitless power

66
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,856
while the explosions
remain contained...

67
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:48,316
but the consequence...

68
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:50,151
is that the bottle...
inevitably...

69
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:51,319
must break.

70
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,113
Yeah right...!

71
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:55,489
Like that's the
worst of it!

72
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,992
What happens to your
body is just a part...

73
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,869
It's what happens
to your mind...

74
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:01,454
it's what happens
to your soul

75
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:03,122
we should be worrying
about right now.

76
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:05,666
And that is
Ogata's plan...

77
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,293
To wait and find
out exactly

78
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:09,378
what does happen to the boy.

79
00:06:09,378 --> 00:06:10,922
Yes, of course...

80
00:06:10,922 --> 00:06:13,299
He's using his disciple
as a test subject.

81
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:19,889
Yes, that's right, you're doing
everything perfectly...!

82
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,474
Don't hold back, Ryuto.

83
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:23,934
Show me how magnificent
we both can be.

84
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:32,693
So.

85
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,987
You telling me this doesn't jog
your memory a little bit?

86
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:38,491
About what
happened that day?

87
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:46,707
Think back...

88
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,210
After that mysterious
girl saved the day...

89
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:53,547
-Are you okay, ma'am?
-I am.

90
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,632
Thanks to you.

91
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:57,051
Do you mind if I ask
if this happens a lot?

92
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,345
Oh, dear me, yes.

93
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:02,098
Then I should probably tell
my grandfather about it.

94
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:03,808
That brat!

95
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:04,767
Gimme that!

96
00:07:09,772 --> 00:07:10,773
K- Kenichi?

97
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:12,608
Grandpaaaaa!

98
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:14,276
Yes? What's wrong, Miu?

99
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:16,487
I found some bad
guys, Grandpa!

100
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:18,823
Ohhhh? And where are
they, little one?

101
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:23,994
Hang in there! Everything's
okay, Kenichi! I promise!

102
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:25,454
We don't want any trouble.

103
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:28,833
We were just, you know,
minding our own business.

104
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,919
Was it you who blew
that whistle back there?

105
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,587
Uh... I...

106
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,672
I just...

107
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:35,756
Thank you so much!

108
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,258
It really helped!

109
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:39,093
Uh... Sure.

110
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:42,555
She was incredible, huh?!

111
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:43,723
Yeah.

112
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:46,183
You know what, I think
I do want that badge.

113
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:47,435
Why?!

114
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:48,602
I'm the one who traded
that girl for it!

115
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,104
It's mine!

116
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:52,273
Yeah, but the cat badge
was mine in the first place!

117
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:53,607
You said you
didn't want it!

118
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:54,734
You said it was dumb!

119
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:56,569
Who cares!
Now I want that one!

120
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:57,570
No!

121
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,822
That's why we fought.
Over that badge!

122
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,492
It was the very first time

123
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:05,911
I had ever raised my
fists to anyone...

124
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:07,121
I fought so hard!

125
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,294
Yeah...

126
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:15,588
And if I remember right
I won that battle.

127
00:08:15,588 --> 00:08:17,840
It was a fluke that your
punch got me in the end!

128
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:22,219
Damn it...

129
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:23,262
My ribs...

130
00:08:31,395 --> 00:08:33,606
The thing I could
never forgive...

131
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:36,650
The reason we're on
this roof right now...

132
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,819
like this...

133
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,363
Is because I lost...

134
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:42,656
I lost...

135
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,700
But you gave me
the victory anyway!

136
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:52,500
It's sad...

137
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,834
Really...

138
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:57,087
That someone of your caliber
must be cut down like this...

139
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,422
Kenichi Shirahama.

140
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,801
In fact, who knows...?

141
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:04,220
Perhaps I'll decide to bring
both of them back with me.

142
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:12,186
Who's there?

143
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,526
A master never...

144
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:20,694
interrupts his
pupil's fight.

145
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,488
Ah, yes, no surprise...

146
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:25,783
It would be the
philosophical judo master.

147
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:27,284
And he's not alone.

148
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:34,375
We won't let you
interrupt this fight.

149
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,835
When Sakaki is serious...

150
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:37,419
Apachai is serious...

151
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:39,713
And you should be
big time scared, yes?

152
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,174
Surely not even you
are stupid enough...

153
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:43,926
to try and fight
all six of us.

154
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:47,263
Nobody kills Kenichi...

155
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,265
At least not until...

156
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:50,933
I do... first.

157
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:53,143
Shigure, that's not
really the message here!

158
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,772
Might as well sit back
with the rest of us

159
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:59,775
and watch how this little
experiment of yours plays out...

160
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:00,901
Ogata.

161
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,698
Where did they go?

162
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,826
And do you know
the worst part...?

163
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:10,202
After you beat me...

164
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:12,162
After I lost...

165
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:14,540
You know what
you said to me...?

166
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,668
-"Let's just pretend you won."
-Damn it!

167
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:20,337
And you tried to
give me that badge!

168
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:22,381
So is that all there
is to it, Ryuto?

169
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:26,802
All there is...

170
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:29,054
All there is to it?

171
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:30,598
How can you not realize

172
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:33,142
how much pain your naivety
inflicts on others?

173
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:36,437
I went back that night...

174
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:38,814
Back to the general
store by myself...

175
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:39,940
It took me all night,

176
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,318
but I finally got
a yin-yang badge.

177
00:10:44,862 --> 00:10:46,488
But it was pointless...

178
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:47,531
empty...

179
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:51,702
I realized it wasn't
the badge I needed,

180
00:10:51,702 --> 00:10:55,372
it was what the badge
represented to me...

181
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:57,208
I needed the victory
that went with it!

182
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,294
It was because of that day

183
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:02,212
that I started training
to be a martial artist

184
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:04,465
from such an early age...

185
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:07,134
I suppose I do have
you to thank for that.

186
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:12,348
I kept on fighting.

187
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:15,059
Searching for that
complete victory...

188
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:17,061
Then I met the
Great Sage Fists.

189
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:18,562
And I learned...

190
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:20,189
The reason people live...

191
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:25,361
Is to rid themselves
of weakness.

192
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:28,447
And it's time I said
goodbye to my weakness...

193
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:31,033
Bye bye...

194
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,117
Kenichi.

195
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:54,345
And it's time I said
goodbye to my weakness...

196
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:55,721
Bye bye...

197
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:56,847
Kenichi.

198
00:11:57,681 --> 00:11:58,891
Shut up...!

199
00:11:58,891 --> 00:12:00,059
Idiot!!

200
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:03,062
What?!

201
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:07,650
Damn, I got careless...

202
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,236
I didn't know you had that
much power left in you.

203
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:12,613
Where is he?

204
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:13,697
All this power...

205
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:15,741
You wanted it all just
so that you could win?

206
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:21,413
Well that...

207
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:25,417
is called the path
of Asura... Ryuto!

208
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:26,544
Impossible...!

209
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:29,171
That swing was a
limitless... attack...

210
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:30,506
and he blocked it!

211
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:32,466
Bastard!

212
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,468
If I don't put a
stop to you today...

213
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:37,388
Someday you really
will use your powers

214
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:39,014
to kill somebody.

215
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:40,474
You can't stop me!

216
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:44,478
Once more...

217
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:46,021
Ryuto...

218
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:47,356
For your sake...

219
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:48,565
I will...

220
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:51,193
Defeat you!

221
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:59,785
No!

222
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:01,537
I won't let you win again!

223
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:05,165
The only reason you
beat me back then

224
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:06,625
was because you were bigger!

225
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,043
That's the only reason!

226
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:13,841
Wow... They're so powerful.

227
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,426
With every moment
that passes...

228
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:17,803
Both of them
gain strength.

229
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:21,348
Yes... But unfortunately
for one of them, time is up.

230
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:23,767
Ohhh... it looks very painful.

231
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,060
Why...?

232
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,271
Why do you always
find some strange power

233
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:30,065
that carries you through
to the final moment?

234
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:32,568
That infuriates me more
than anything else!

235
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:39,617
What am I doing...?

236
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:42,328
I have to put up
my Seikkuken...

237
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:44,705
but... my body
won't listen to me.

238
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,878
That's what happens when
you combine Dou and Sei...

239
00:13:50,878 --> 00:13:53,714
There are tragic
consequences...

240
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:55,674
His muscles and joints are
responding to the damage

241
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:56,884
that he's done to them.

242
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:01,680
Just a little more...

243
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,807
Just a little more...

244
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:05,476
Let me move!!

245
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:10,439
Please...! I've come
too close to lose now!

246
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,484
Our disciple saw...

247
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:15,361
without help...

248
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:18,113
that there was something
wrong with that power...

249
00:14:18,113 --> 00:14:19,573
and that's why...

250
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:21,533
he's determined to
stop his old friend.

251
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:53,816
Ryuto... What the...

252
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:55,984
The gasoline tanks in the
building are exploding-

253
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:57,403
somebody get
them out of there!

254
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,948
Right! You guys!

255
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:02,366
We gotta do something!

256
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,659
Yeah, we gotta
help them somehow!

257
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,328
Oh great...! I'm
surrounded by imbeciles...

258
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:07,413
Just my luck.

259
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:17,367
Ryuto!

260
00:15:18,243 --> 00:15:19,328
Ryuto!

261
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:22,122
Tell me...

262
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,248
How do you do it, Kenichi?

263
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:25,334
You owe me that
much, at least...

264
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:28,003
You're just an average guy,

265
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:31,381
no different than any other
guy I run into on the street.

266
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:33,592
While I have an
unparalleled talent...

267
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:35,927
and the training of
an excellent master...

268
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:37,679
I've been working
toward this since

269
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,473
I was old enough
to make a fist.

270
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:44,728
And yet still...

271
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:47,064
It feels like every
time I look behind me,

272
00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:48,357
there you are, waiting!

273
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:56,156
Isn't the answer obvious...?

274
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,699
It's because...

275
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:00,827
No matter what happens
I'm still your friend!

276
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,746
No matter how much
you've changed...

277
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,665
That will always
stay the same.

278
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,841
It looks like that stupid
badge still belongs to you...

279
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,052
Maybe you don't remember
the promise we made back then

280
00:16:17,052 --> 00:16:18,929
but I do.

281
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:20,055
We swore...

282
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:21,014
that when we met again

283
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,058
we'd fight for the
honor of wearing it...

284
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,186
Well you won...

285
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,354
It's yours.

286
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:31,108
Ryuto.

287
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:32,401
Oh...

288
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:34,861
and, tell that
girl for me...

289
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,405
That whistle...

290
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:38,949
I wasn't the one who used
it to save her that day.

291
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,913
Ryuto!!

292
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:53,630
Hey, I made it in time!

293
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,715
Elder!

294
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,759
Your training methods
are too soft, old man,

295
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,802
you'll never make a champion

296
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:01,430
out of your disciple
that way, you know.

297
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,306
You pamper him like
a bonsai tree.

298
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:05,058
Ha! A bonsai...?

299
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,893
That's a good way
of putting it!

300
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,228
What?

301
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,855
But understand,
the bonsai tree

302
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:12,566
we're cultivating
at RyouzanPAku...

303
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:15,193
Will be the strongest
in history!

304
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:18,864
Excuse me, but what do I have
to do with a bonsai tree?

305
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:22,159
There's something you should
understand as well, old man.

306
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:23,452
Well, for old time's sake

307
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:24,744
I'll allow you one sentence

308
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,330
in which to prove your
point, Ogata Ishiinsai.

309
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:30,083
Then here it is...

310
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,501
Don't disappoint yourself

311
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:35,672
by believing Ryouzanpaku will
remain history's strongest...

312
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:38,300
Prepare... for the darkness.

313
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:41,970
That... Was two sentences.

314
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:08,580
They ventilated the
entire warehouse

315
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,040
with their bare hands.

316
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,709
The fire has been diverted!

317
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:14,252
Heh... Can't top that.

318
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,385
How anticlimactic...

319
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:24,429
Sometimes it's hard
to hold myself back

320
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:25,847
and do only
what's necessary.

321
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:27,682
You call that holding
yourself back?

322
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:28,850
Did you see that?

323
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,977
They're my friends.
Those guys're my friends...

324
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:31,937
I know, right?

325
00:18:31,937 --> 00:18:33,271
They're pretty amazing.

326
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:42,948
Heh heh heh.

327
00:18:42,948 --> 00:18:44,991
I think I took us
a bit too high.

328
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,412
Elder. Hey.

329
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:51,665
Hello, son, you're
awake again are you?

330
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:53,208
Very well done, Kenichi.

331
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,793
Very well done.

332
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:56,211
Yeah...

333
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:57,963
Thanks.

334
00:18:57,963 --> 00:18:59,089
What's wrong...?

335
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,423
You seem a little quiet.

336
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:03,260
It's just that...

337
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:07,180
I kinda wanted
my friend back.

338
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,682
Ah, yes...

339
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:11,059
and that's got you down...

340
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:13,979
I certainly understand
where you're coming from.

341
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:15,939
Losing a friend
is no joke,

342
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:17,357
even a bugger
like that one.

343
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:22,195
Take a look down there.

344
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:27,409
That is your
greatest power.

345
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:29,536
Your most precious treasure.

346
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:33,748
Everyone...

347
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:45,594
All my friends...

348
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,972
They're waiting for me.

349
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:54,978

350
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,670
Kenichi you're alive!

351
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,464
I'm so glad you're okay!

352
00:23:53,675 --> 00:23:54,801
Oh, Miu.

353
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,567
I'm back, guys...

354
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:12,110
Your number one disciple.
