1
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:43,151
Now it all makes sense,

2
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:47,822
that way my defensive move
becomes an offensive move!

3
00:01:47,822 --> 00:01:50,200
Please, I just--

4
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,826
I don't want to quit the club!

5
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:55,538
Please don't make me
quit! Karate's my life!!

6
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:58,208
As a reward for your
victory, I've got some info.

7
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,210
The guy who refereed your
little fight session

8
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,128
is pretty fired up, I
think it's only right

9
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:04,047
to give you fair warning
and let you know

10
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:05,298
that he's gunning for you.

11
00:02:05,298 --> 00:02:06,716
He what?!

12
00:02:06,716 --> 00:02:08,426
Are you kidding me?

13
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:14,224
No... What am I going to do?

14
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:17,018
Hey man, can I ask you something
without you makin' fun of me?

15
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:18,103
Yeah, sure.

16
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:19,562
You know that new girl in class?

17
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:22,273
What was her name again? Miu?

18
00:02:22,273 --> 00:02:24,401
Do you think she'd go
on a date with me?

19
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:26,903
In my opinion, you don't
have a chance in hell...

20
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:29,364
because I was gonna ask
her to go out with me!

21
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:33,368
How stupid are you, you've
never even talked to her!

22
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:35,120
Of course, I haven't
talked to her either.

23
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,830
I don't know how
to approach her.

24
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,833
She's weird, in a 'hot'
way, kinda spacey.

25
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,544
I haven't seen her talk to
anyone, she can speak, right?

26
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:45,088
Shut up, she's about
to talk to somebody.

27
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:46,631
It's not a guy, is it?

28
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:49,759
Hello, anybody home?

29
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,386
No way that's
weak-knees Kenichi!

30
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:52,929
I've decided I'm
going to sign up

31
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:55,140
for the Rhythmic
Gymnastics Club.

32
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,475
Have you thought about which
activity you're going to take up

33
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:59,853
now that you've left
the Karate Club?

34
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:01,021
Maybe Judo?

35
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:03,481
And the Kendo Club's
not so bad either.

36
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:05,734
The... the...

37
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:08,486
The Gardening Club.

38
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:10,905
Uh, Like as in
plants and flowers?

39
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:15,952
You sure you don't want to join
another Martial Arts Club?

40
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:17,620
Is anybody there?

41
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,830
Hellooo?

42
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,541
And from that day on, Kenichi
devoted his life to watering

43
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,210
innocent flowers who never
cornered him in alleys or tried

44
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,045
to kick his face
down his throat.

45
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,881
They lived happily ever after.

46
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,007
That look in his eyes...

47
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,633
He's cracking
under the pressure.

48
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:33,678
I have to go, the
flowers are calling me.

49
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:36,514
Snap out of it, Kenichi, it's
almost time for class to start!

50
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:38,433
What in the world
has gotten into you?

51
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,642
Allow me to answer that.

52
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:41,603
Okay...

53
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:44,064
Pardon my nosey intrusion,
but that's that's what I do.

54
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:45,607
My name is Haruo Niijima,

55
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:47,859
and I am Kenichi's closest
of close friends.

56
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:50,487
Oh, you're one of
Kenichi's friends?

57
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:52,822
That's right, I am
his closest friend.

58
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:54,324
And a friend of my close friend

59
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:57,744
is a friend I'd like
to get close to.

60
00:03:57,744 --> 00:03:59,871
Oh, well nice to
meet you, I'm Miu.

61
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:01,247
You've gotta be kidding me!

62
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:04,834
Aw, c'mon, anybody but that guy!

63
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:07,378
School always seems to interfere
at the worst moment...

64
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:10,340
I really hate to cut this short,
but I hate expulsion even more,

65
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,176
so how about we finish this
conversation during gym class?

66
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,093
Farewell.

67
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:15,804
Okay see you later!

68
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:22,560
Uh...

69
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,271
So the number of electrons
within the atom...

70
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,398
uh...

71
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:29,150
Um, Tsukuba,

72
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,694
Could you please put
those walnuts away?

73
00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:33,238
I know you're not trying to be,

74
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:36,366
but they are
somewhat distracting.

75
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:38,743
Tsukuba...

76
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,460
Uh, Just pretend I didn't
say anything, do as you like.

77
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,712
Uhh. The atom, yes. Where was I?

78
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:51,089
Something about the atom...

79
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,882
I, uh...

80
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:57,095
Kenichi Shirahama...

81
00:04:57,095 --> 00:04:59,180
What a scrawny little brat.

82
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,432
The kid's got no
natural talent at all.

83
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:05,645
But somehow after a week, he
suddenly knows how to fight?

84
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:07,146
It must have been a fluke.

85
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:08,815
Either that...

86
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:12,652
...or he's just been
pretending to be a weakling.

87
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:17,240
In any case, I'll find
out soon enough.

88
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,534
So he's in the Karate Club too?

89
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:22,412
Yes, he refereed Kenichi's last
fight and I'm afraid he's taken

90
00:05:22,412 --> 00:05:24,789
quite an interest in his
abilities as a sportsman.

91
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:26,291
I've heard that he's
become rather keen

92
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,376
on the idea of
testing his skills.

93
00:05:28,376 --> 00:05:29,669
I don't understand?

94
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:30,920
It's a nice way of saying

95
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,006
that he wants to beat
the snot out of him.

96
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:35,091
Oh, he just wants to fight?
You had me worried,

97
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:36,718
I thought Kenichi was
in real trouble.

98
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:39,929
Well, I admire your optimism,
Miu, but it's not gonna be that

99
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:43,141
easy for Kenichi, this Tsukuba
guy is pretty serious--

100
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,309
Tsukuba?!

101
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,936
He's never lost a match, I've
seen him spar and he's always

102
00:05:46,936 --> 00:05:49,230
up against at least
two guys if not more.

103
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,565
That guy is so strong,

104
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:53,776
he could breaks rocks with his
bare hands like it's nothing!

105
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:56,487
And I've seen him
snap a baseball bat...

106
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:58,031
...with a single kick!

107
00:05:58,031 --> 00:05:59,365
That's no biggie.

108
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:02,327
This is bad. This guy
must be a black belt.

109
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:04,871
Maybe he is in real trouble.

110
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:06,414
But enough about Kenichi.

111
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:08,958
Tell me about you, your
family, your measurements,

112
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,835
do you like pointy ears?

113
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:13,004
You know what they say
about big ears, right?

114
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:16,966
Oh no!

115
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:20,386
Didn't anybody ever tell you
not to sneak up behind a girl?!

116
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:21,804
Hey, are you okay?

117
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:23,139
I didn't hurt you, did I?

118
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:24,766
How long before
he hunts me down?

119
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:26,267
Today? Tomorrow?

120
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:27,727
The day after?

121
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:31,439
How long do I have to live?!

122
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:38,821
You know what you look like?

123
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:40,281
A loser.

124
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,699
Wait, what's that
supposed to mean?

125
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,202
She's saying you have a
look of defeat about you,

126
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:46,371
now that you've realized your
"great victory" the other day

127
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,331
has only led to even
greater problems.

128
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:51,709
Wait, can this guy
actually read my mind?

129
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,378
Moping won't do you any good.

130
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:57,256
No, the best fix this problem
is more rigorous training!

131
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,843
Akisame sensei!

132
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:02,053
Yes?

133
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:05,556
Isn't... there...

134
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:07,809
a... faster...

135
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:08,810
way...?

136
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,602
Of course.

137
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:12,397
There is? 'Cause Tsukuba's
gonna find me any time now.

138
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:14,691
Is it like some kinda secret
ancient technique or something?

139
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:17,151
No, faster training
requires faster running.

140
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:20,780
Do I look like a horse to you?!

141
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,365
No, a horse would run faster!

142
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:25,076
Now shut your mouth
and move your legs!

143
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:26,411
This training is gonna kill me

144
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:28,538
before Tsukuba ever
gets the chance!

145
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:31,332
Now, nice and slow
in medium stance.

146
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:34,335
Good, yes, just like that.

147
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:35,753
And now you've got it.

148
00:07:35,753 --> 00:07:37,880
Martial arts are
rooted in the legs.

149
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,924
Those with weak legs
have no foundation

150
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:41,384
for their skills to grow on.

151
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:44,262
Sure, that makes sense, but how
many of these do I have to do?

152
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:46,931
Just another 9,566,to go.

153
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:48,099
What?

154
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:50,143
It's Apachai's
teaching time now!

155
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:51,352
Apaaa!

156
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:59,235
Apaapapapapapapapapapa!

157
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:01,988
Okay, Apachai's fists are done
being warmed up, Kenichi!

158
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:03,406
Am now ready to fight to death!

159
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:05,366
We should spar now, yes?

160
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:06,159
Apa?

161
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:07,577
Thanks, anyway but
I just remembered

162
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:09,495
I gotta take care of something!

163
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:11,080
Poor Kenichi.

164
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,123
Miu.

165
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:13,750
You went and taught
him a technique

166
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,209
behind our backs, didn't you?

167
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:17,336
What, but who told you,
how did you find out?!

168
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:20,339
Come on, everybody knows.
We're not as dumb as we look.

169
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,466
I'm guessing he took down

170
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,718
some Karate Club punk
at his school, right?

171
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:25,470
--Yeah, pretty much.
--Apa! Apa! Apa!

172
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,431
I'm sure you just wanted to help
him defeat this bully, but you

173
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:31,100
didn't think about what the
outcome was gonna be, did you?

174
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,478
About all the other bullies
that are just waitin' in line

175
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:36,481
to take his place? He's
already caught the eye

176
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:39,275
of some bigger,
stronger guy, hasn't he?

177
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:41,486
Well that's a yes if
I've ever seen one.

178
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:43,154
Too bad I don't
take on disciples

179
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:45,198
or I might actually give a damn.

180
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:47,742
Everybody else knew this kind
of thing was gonna happen

181
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:50,870
so they made a point not to
teach him any techniques.

182
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,164
The kid doesn't even have
an ounce of muscle on him,

183
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,999
yet he's already got
fight-hungry thugs

184
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,460
looking to eat him for dinner.

185
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,004
He doesn't have
a chance in hell.

186
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:04,092
Tell my family I love them!

187
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:05,593
Come back, Kenichi!

188
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:08,137
Kenichi?

189
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:09,931
Kenichi!

190
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:10,932
Kenichi...

191
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:12,600
What's wrong?

192
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,185
That you, Honoka?

193
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:17,688
Wait a minute, what's going on?
Don't tell me you died too?

194
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:19,899
It's so sad, we're both dead.

195
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:23,194
But at least I'll have my sister
to keep me company in heaven.

196
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:26,197
And we'll always be happy.

197
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:27,907
Always...

198
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:30,701
Snap out of it, you're not
in heaven, you're at home!

199
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:31,744
I'm home?

200
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:33,955
Wait, then that means...

201
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:35,873
Apachai didn't kill me?!

202
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:40,378
I'm still alive!

203
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:41,170
Mom!

204
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,298
Kenichi thought he was dead
and he's freaking me out!

205
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:56,066
Look at you, bruised and covered
in band-aids; battered...

206
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:57,526
You do know there
are better things

207
00:09:57,526 --> 00:10:00,153
to spend your
allowance on, right?

208
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:03,573
Am I supposed to watch you
come home like this every day?

209
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:05,575
What kind of legitimate
business does this

210
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:08,370
to its paying students?

211
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,164
The effective kind.

212
00:10:11,164 --> 00:10:12,249
You--

213
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:14,042
you wouldn't understand, Dad.

214
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:17,003
This is the only way I'll ever
learn to protect myself!

215
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:17,963
Hey!

216
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:19,673
Kenichi, wait up!

217
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:22,592
Those guys at that dojo
that are the real bullies.

218
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:25,178
Kenichi! Come back!

219
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:27,931
What are we gonna do?

220
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:29,766
No matter how many
times I tell them,

221
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:32,185
they keep running on the stairs.

222
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:33,186
Saori...

223
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:34,438
Yes, dear, what is it?

224
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:38,483
Our poor little baby
boy is in trouble!

225
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:40,777
We can't just stand back while
he's getting hurt like this,

226
00:10:40,777 --> 00:10:43,238
we have to do something
to protect him, we have to!

227
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:45,157
Listen, dear, he wouldn't
have chosen this dojo

228
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:46,658
if it wasn't safe.

229
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:49,494
We have to trust
him on this one.

230
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:50,746
Are you sure, Saori?

231
00:10:50,746 --> 00:10:53,623
But he's just a child! He's too
young and innocent to realize

232
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:54,875
this dojo has evil intentions!

233
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,084
Our son's life is in danger,

234
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:58,420
and there's nothing
we can do to help him!

235
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,546
Wait.

236
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:03,633
Awaken, Sebastian!

237
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:08,972
We'll have to deal with
this ourselves, old friend.

238
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:12,976
Just like we delt with those
pesky squirrels in the backyard.

239
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,770
Are you ready for some action?

240
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,980
Sebastian...

241
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,356
Um, dear?

242
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,485
Kenichi has always
run to us for help

243
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:24,154
or hid whenever there
was any trouble.

244
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:27,199
He's always been afraid
to live life to the fullest.

245
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,868
Now he's chosen to
stand up for himself.

246
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:32,871
So I think we should let him
try and fight his own battles.

247
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:35,207
Sleep now, Sebastian!

248
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:39,753
Once again,
my love, you're right.

249
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:41,671
There's no need
to worry about him.

250
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:44,883
With our DNA, he's destined
to become a strong man!

251
00:11:47,594 --> 00:11:50,639
I'm a little worried
about your DNA, though.

252
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,685
They're waiting by the
back gate for you, too.

253
00:11:55,685 --> 00:11:57,521
They're from the Karate Club.

254
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:00,524
Tsukuba must have ordered
them to look for me.

255
00:12:00,524 --> 00:12:02,526
There's only one
thing to do.

256
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:04,277
Strategic withdrawl!

257
00:12:04,277 --> 00:12:07,197
This isn't considered running
away, it's my plan of action.

258
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:10,617
This way I'll live
to fight another day!

259
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:13,161
Whatever you say, Kenichi.

260
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:15,372
He maybe running
from the thugs now,

261
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:18,375
but I can tell he's
getting stronger everyday.

262
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:40,146
Wow...

263
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:41,314
So beautiful!

264
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:43,275
How does she do that?

265
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:45,735
That's right, I'm the
best in the class.

266
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:48,363
The lack of competition
around here is just sad.

267
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:49,531
Look at that!

268
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:51,700
Incredible! Whoa!

269
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,411
Oh my golly,
she's so flexible!

270
00:12:54,411 --> 00:12:56,580
How do you even do that?

271
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:00,333
Wow!

272
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,293
You're so nimble!

273
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:02,544
Totally effortless!

274
00:13:02,544 --> 00:13:05,005
You must be Miu Furinji.

275
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:07,757
Transfer student, right?

276
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:09,551
What are you doing over here
over here in the corner?

277
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:10,677
Word is you've been training

278
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:12,721
at an expert level
since junior high.

279
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:13,889
A talented girl like you

280
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:16,808
shouldn't be sitting on the
sidelines. That's just stupid.

281
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:18,268
You should be the
center of attention,

282
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:21,855
show all of us amateurs
what you can do. Come on.

283
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:24,065
Why don't you teach
us a thing or two?

284
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:29,779
Well, what are you
waiting for, show us.

285
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,323
Oh, please, Miu!

286
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:33,867
Yeah, we'd love to
see what you can do!

287
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,702
Okay? I'll hold your
glasses for you.

288
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:36,703
Huh?

289
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:37,996
Don't be shy!

290
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:43,877
Oh no, this is exactly what
I didn't want to happen.

291
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:46,588
I was trying so hard
not to stand out.

292
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:51,051
Alright then. Well
here goes nothing.

293
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,262
This should be
good for a laugh.

294
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:57,015
Let's see what you're made
of, little miss perfect.

295
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:10,820
No way...

296
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,448
I've never seen anyone
move so gracefully!

297
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:16,868
She's amazing...

298
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,453
But it's not just grace.

299
00:14:18,453 --> 00:14:21,289
I can't put my finger
on it. The control...

300
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:22,707
The precision...

301
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:24,542
like she's cutting the air...

302
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:27,963
That's it!

303
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:31,132
It's like she has the
elegance of a sword.

304
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:48,650
Here's a towel for you.

305
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,068
Oh, thank you very much.

306
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:51,194
With you on the team,

307
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:53,113
we'll definitely take
the championship!

308
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:54,864
Isn't she great, Takashima?

309
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:56,283
Huh?

310
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:57,784
Yeah, great.

311
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:01,830
Will you teach me
some moves, Miu?

312
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,580
Oh, me too!

313
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,873
And me, and me!

314
00:15:03,873 --> 00:15:05,667
Yeah, me too!

315
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:08,920
I think I'm really qualified
to teach anything.

316
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,255
Nicely done, Miu.

317
00:15:12,424 --> 00:15:15,844
But don't let this go
to your head, okay girly.

318
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:18,096
Alright, girls, time
to hit the showers.

319
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,889
Okay!

320
00:15:22,642 --> 00:15:24,644
But what did I do wrong?

321
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:27,272
I was only doing what
she asked me to.

322
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:28,815
I don't get it...

323
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,489
Now that class is out,
those Karate Club jerks

324
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:39,200
are gonna be scouring
the halls looking for me.

325
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,702
Okay, got my shoes.

326
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:42,662
Now, all I gotta
do is find Miu

327
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:46,458
and escape out the
first floor window.

328
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,917
All clear on the right...

329
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,627
...and all clear on the left.

330
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:50,587
And behind me...

331
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:52,547
I'm clearly in trouble.

332
00:15:58,344 --> 00:15:59,179
Can't we...

333
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:01,765
Can't we, talk this out Tsukuba?

334
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:20,283
C'mon, Kenichi...

335
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,160
What's taking you so long?

336
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,624
Come on, you don't
have to do this!

337
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:29,000
Please just let me go!

338
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,254
You already know you can beat me
so what's the point of fighting?

339
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:34,506
The point?

340
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:36,591
I never said I was
making a point.

341
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:38,510
I just wanna fight
you, Shirahama!

342
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:41,137
No.

343
00:16:41,137 --> 00:16:43,431
I won't fight you
without a reason.

344
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:47,143
Running away?

345
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:50,522
Everyone was right about you...

346
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:53,817
You really are nothing
but a coward.

347
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:55,735
No...

348
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:56,903
Shut up!

349
00:16:56,903 --> 00:16:59,656
Take it Back! Who are
you calling a coward?

350
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:03,952
Looks like you're
gonna have to make me,

351
00:17:03,952 --> 00:17:05,495
but I don't think you can.

352
00:17:12,127 --> 00:17:13,545
So fast!

353
00:17:21,136 --> 00:17:23,096
Come on, quit wasting my time!

354
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:24,472
Why aren't you fighting back?

355
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:26,391
Don't try to act like
you don't have skills,

356
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:28,893
I've seen you in action. Now
quit playing dead and get up,

357
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:31,479
Kenichi or I'm gonna have
to beat you while your down.

358
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:44,409
You think this is funny?

359
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:47,412
You really are just a
worthless amateur, aren't you?

360
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:50,123
It was just a fluke
that you beat Daimonji!

361
00:17:57,255 --> 00:17:58,590
Take it back!

362
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,887
That's enough. Let go.

363
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:08,725
Let go of me now!

364
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:12,520
I'm warning you kid, you've
already lost, so just give up.

365
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,605
Kid!

366
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:14,439
Let go!

367
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:30,246
Impossible!

368
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:31,873
He bruised my ankle.

369
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:34,292
How can an amateur be so strong?

370
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:37,837
No way, unless he really
is faking his weakness.

371
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:38,671
Hey!

372
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:40,340
Get up, you worthless loser!

373
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:47,388
Doesn't make any sense.

374
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:55,640
Does anyone know if Kenichi
is home from school yet?

375
00:18:58,017 --> 00:19:00,270
Hey, I've been looking for you.

376
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,689
What happened today?
I waited forever.

377
00:19:02,689 --> 00:19:04,899
I was actually starting
to get worried about you.

378
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:07,777
It's not very nice to
keep a girl waiting--

379
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:09,654
You're covered in bruises!

380
00:19:09,654 --> 00:19:12,574
So that's where you were,
Tsukuba found you, didn't he?

381
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:15,535
If I was there I
would have helped you.

382
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:17,495
I'm fine, Miu.

383
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:20,999
Nothing happened, I just
fell down the stairs.

384
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:22,625
Your bruises didn't
come from a fall!

385
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,418
Come on!

386
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:26,629
Tell me the truth Kenichi!

387
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:29,632
I'm not lying, I fell
down the stairs.

388
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:31,551
That's it...

389
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:32,677
...honestly.

390
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:34,929
Anyway, I need to
get started training.

391
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:39,434
Wait, Kenichi, come talk to me!

392
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:40,894
Just leave him alone.

393
00:19:40,894 --> 00:19:42,520
But Sakaki...

394
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:45,148
Why?

395
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:46,649
Listen, Miu.

396
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:48,610
He doesn't want to see you now.

397
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,780
Sometimes it's too painful
for a man to show his face.

398
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,115
Especially to a woman.

399
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:56,284
Oh, I see.

400
00:19:56,284 --> 00:19:58,036
Poor Kenichi.

401
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:00,872
Hm...

402
00:20:00,872 --> 00:20:04,167
It doesn't seem like any of your
bones are broken or fractured.

403
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,878
Nothing seems to
be dislocated either.

404
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:10,632
That doesn't mean it
doesn't hurt like crazy.

405
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:15,220
The important thing is that
you made it back safely.

406
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,596
Safely?

407
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:19,516
Quit laughing, this isn't funny.

408
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:24,395
I worked so hard to train
and it didn't even matter.

409
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:28,483
It didn't help. Tsubaka beat me
without even breaking a sweat.

410
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:36,366
I'm sorry, it's not funny,
I shouldn't have laughed.

411
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:39,953
What do you plan
on doing about it?

412
00:20:39,953 --> 00:20:42,705
Would you do the same thing
to him, that he's done to you,

413
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:44,082
if you were given the chance?

414
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:49,295
All I wanted to do
was prove to him

415
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:52,757
that he was wrong about me,
but all I could do was tell him.

416
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:55,093
And that wasn't going
to change anything.

417
00:20:55,093 --> 00:20:56,761
I had to show him!

418
00:20:56,761 --> 00:21:00,098
But when it came down to
it, I had nothing to show.

419
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:04,060
No matter how hard I tried,
I just couldn't do it.

420
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,187
I'm not strong enough.

421
00:21:06,187 --> 00:21:09,107
I need strength
and I need courage.

422
00:21:09,107 --> 00:21:11,526
But I don't think
I'll ever have either.

423
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:18,491
Alright!

424
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:21,160
Tomorrow you will begin
technique training!

425
00:21:26,124 --> 00:21:28,877
His sense of justice
is remarkable.

426
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:30,962
I never dreamed I would
hear the same words

427
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:35,425
I spoke to my master
repeated back at me like that.

428
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:37,510
Kenichi!

429
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,430
Apachai is ready for
your ultimate training!

430
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:44,851
Apachai, as much as I
appreciate your enthusiasm,

431
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:47,604
I'm not sure you're capable
of the proper limitations.

432
00:21:47,604 --> 00:21:49,439
Apa?

433
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,608
Apachai no has limits!

434
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:54,402
I is teaching no limit fighting!

435
00:21:54,402 --> 00:21:55,778
That's not what
he meant, Apachai,

436
00:21:55,778 --> 00:21:57,405
that's not what he
meant! Save me!!

437
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:59,908
Don't worry, Kenichi!

438
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:02,785
Only limit is limit of
fear, so do not be afraid!

439
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:04,454
I show you to
get past fear

440
00:22:04,454 --> 00:22:06,915
and become great
fighter some day!

441
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:08,082
Okay sure!

442
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:10,209
Apapa!

443
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:12,086
I guess he was so excited,

444
00:22:12,086 --> 00:22:14,380
he didn't hear you
say 'starting tomorrow'.

445
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:20,053
Well, I'm glad that he's happy.

446
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:23,014
He's just excited to
have his first disciple.

447
00:22:23,014 --> 00:22:24,891
♪ Oh, Apachai teach
you how not to fear! ♪

448
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:26,517
♪ Apachai kick you
right in the rear! ♪

449
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:28,895
Wow, he's so happy to
teach me that he's singing.

450
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:31,898
Apa, Apa, Apa,
Apa, Apa, Apa, Apa!

451
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:35,360
Oh, wow! He's so fast I
can't even see his punches.

452
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,820
Apa, Apa, Apa, Apa, Apa!

453
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,032
Look at that, he's punching
right through that-- that wall!

454
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:43,868
Well, Apachai sure is
getting into this, isn't he?

455
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:45,954
It almost... looks fun.

456
00:22:45,954 --> 00:22:48,748
Will somebody please explain to
Apachai what limitations mean?!

457
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:52,085
Limits are good!
We need limits!

458
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:23,593
C'mon, Kenichi, you're not
really giving up, are you?

459
00:24:23,593 --> 00:24:25,803
You're never going to win
with that kind of attitude.

460
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:28,264
I had no idea that it would
be so hard to learn!

461
00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:29,932
Didn't you just tell me how much

462
00:24:29,932 --> 00:24:31,726
you wanted to learn
these techniques?

463
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:33,269
You might be in agony now,

464
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:35,021
but that's how you
know you're learning.

465
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:37,023
What a horrible way to learn!

466
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:39,525
Nothing's easy, Kenichi,
but if that's what you want

467
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:41,444
then I guess you're not
ready to become stronger.

468
00:24:41,444 --> 00:24:43,029
No, I will get stronger!

469
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:45,531
Forget what I said, Sensei,
I don't want the easy way out!

470
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:46,199
Once more, please!

471
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:48,534
Okay, now that's the spirit.
