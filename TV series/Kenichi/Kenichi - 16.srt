1
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:47,392
Well, I'm worn out.
Should we call it a day?

2
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:49,310
Sure, that's cool with me.

3
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,230
So, Kenichi, I was wondering...

4
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,233
Maybe we could go home
together? I mean, walk home--

5
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:57,235
Hey, Kenichi!

6
00:01:57,235 --> 00:01:58,111
Hi!

7
00:01:58,111 --> 00:01:59,863
Gymnastics practice
just let out,

8
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:02,032
so I'm ready to go home
whenever you are, okay?

9
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:06,578
Okay, I hear her, but I
have no idea where she is.

10
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:09,247
So, I couldn't help but notice

11
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:11,124
that you always seem
to walk home together.

12
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:13,501
Is that, because you two--

13
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:17,589
Yep! Kenichi and I
live together now!

14
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:20,425
I-I had a feeling that's
what it was, but wow!

15
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:23,720
Not that it's any of my
business, but you move fast!

16
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,681
C'mon, Miu! Sh!

17
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:28,266
Yeah, we've actually
been talking about

18
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,768
him moving into my house.

19
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,853
It-it's not what
sounds like, Izumi!

20
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:35,148
I'm just staying with her so she
can help me practice my moves!

21
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:36,274
That didn't sound right.

22
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:38,568
Hey, Kenichi? I don't
want to interrupt,

23
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:40,070
but I'm not sure
if you're helping.

24
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,031
Maybe we should go before this
gets blown out of proportion.

25
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:45,325
Are you serious, Miu? You're
the one who's making it out

26
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:46,868
to sound like
something it isn't!

27
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:49,245
Okay, well, I'll see
you tomorrow, Izumi.

28
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:51,039
Sorry, Miu. You ready to go?

29
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,791
As long as you're sorry.

30
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,210
I didn't mean to freak
your friend out.

31
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,505
She asked me, y'know, and I
just have a problem with lying.

32
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:02,050
I don't get why it's so shocking
that you're living at the dojo.

33
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:09,099
They're living together?

34
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,850
Finally some dirt on her!

35
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,477
♪ Someone's gonna
get expelled! ♪

36
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,688
Well, she's surprisingly chipper
for someone who's only 2nd best.

37
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:17,357
You never know,
maybe it's comfortable

38
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:20,610
living in Miu's shadow.

39
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,572
Miu Furinji, you're gonna
regret the day you were born!

40
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,284
I got it!

41
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:32,705
Hello? Yeah, this is Miu.

42
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,541
Sure... Okay.

43
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,084
What?!

44
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:38,086
Miu, what's wrong?
What's the matter?

45
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:40,088
Apa?

46
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:42,757
I'm so confused, this
doesn't make sense.

47
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:45,802
Our homeroom teacher just called
to tell me that he's coming here

48
00:03:45,802 --> 00:03:48,263
tomorrow to conduct a
mandatory home visit.

49
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:49,722
What? They're coming here?

50
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:52,517
I don't get it, why you?
You're a perfect student.

51
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:56,271
Well, whatever it is, I'm sure
there's no reason to panic.

52
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:58,523
Gimme back my snack before
I make you eat your teeth!

53
00:03:58,523 --> 00:03:59,607
Apapapapapapapa!

54
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,025
So what's the deal, Shigure?

55
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:03,027
You gonna shave your legs,
or should I do it for you?

56
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:04,612
Would you, like a shave?

57
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,906
Please keep it down,
I'm trying to concentrate!

58
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:11,911
If it gets any louder in here,
my statue will go deaf!

59
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:15,498
Get your own food, dammit!

60
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:17,792
Yeah, maybe you should panic.

61
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:22,714
Now line up, face forward!

62
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:24,257
Silence!

63
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:29,846
Listen close, everyone!

64
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:31,681
We're in trouble,
this is not a drill!

65
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:34,642
Effective now, Emergency Plan K
is in action!

66
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:37,353
You'll do as you're told
and won't do anything else!

67
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:39,731
Failure is not an option here!

68
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:41,649
Hey, aren't you
overreacting a little?

69
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,569
I mean it's just a couple of
bookworms comin' over, right?

70
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,070
It's no problem, Miu.

71
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,324
What'd you think we can't
handle a couple of teachers?

72
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:50,283
Apa!

73
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:52,327
I'll teach the teachers
what teaching is!

74
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:53,077
Apapapapa!

75
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:54,204
No!

76
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:57,040
Don't you dare do anything like
that, even if you're joking!

77
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,626
In fact, no more
jokes! No humor!

78
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:01,294
Or you'll get me
kicked out of school.

79
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:02,587
Yeah, Miu, speaking of which,

80
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:04,380
Getting kicked out
of school? What about it?

81
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,757
It's probably a good idea

82
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:07,425
if they don't find out
I'm living here.

83
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:10,637
Y'know, they might think
we're living together.

84
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:11,888
There's nothing
to worry about.

85
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:13,848
Nobody would think that.

86
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,725
But, just to be safe,
you will be out of sight.

87
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:17,769
And besides, I need you
running the backstage.

88
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:18,770
Good grief.

89
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,313
Now then, back to the plan.

90
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:23,233
We need to create the illusion
of a healthy, happy family.

91
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:26,194
Congratulations, Akisame.
You'll act as my father.

92
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:29,030
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
I just can't do it tomorrow.

93
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,783
I'm unavoidably busy.

94
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:33,284
Then it's all over.

95
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:34,869
I'm gonna get kicked
out of school.

96
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:37,121
Hey, c'mon.

97
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,998
Um, Miu?

98
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,459
Don't worry, everything
will be okay.

99
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,211
The first thing you have to do
is get them out of the house.

100
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:45,630
Do whatever is necessary,
they can't be here.

101
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,298
I promise you, they
will end up doing

102
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:48,549
something crazy and stupid.

103
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,968
You know we can hear you, right?

104
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,304
That won't work. Somebody
has to play my parents.

105
00:05:53,304 --> 00:05:55,348
I don't have any, remember?

106
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:58,351
My only family member is my
grandfather and he's gone off

107
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:01,229
to the west seeking social
reforms or something.

108
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,189
If someone doesn't
play my parents,

109
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:04,816
they'll find out
I'm here alone.

110
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:07,235
But that's okay, Miu, there's
nothing wrong with that.

111
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:09,445
Just tell them the truth and I
promise they'll understand.

112
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:11,030
But it's my dream
to have a family!

113
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,742
Why can't I have that for just
one day so I can be normal?!

114
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,495
And I already signed my parents'
names on my transfer documents,

115
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:19,038
so I can't take it back now.

116
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,624
Yeah, I'm pretty
sure that's forgery.

117
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:23,793
But, Miu doesn't lie
about anything.

118
00:06:23,793 --> 00:06:25,503
So if she's willing
to go this far,

119
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:26,963
then she really must want this.

120
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:29,924
That old man. What a
bad time to be gone.

121
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:31,384
He didn't know, Apachai.

122
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:32,719
But still, he should have known.

123
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,471
It's okay, you let
Apachai take care of it.

124
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:37,390
Apachai will father Miu
for her teachers

125
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,726
and I'll be the
best father ever!

126
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:42,270
Thank you, but we're clearly
from different countries.

127
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,647
Then I'll happily take
the role of your father!

128
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:46,107
I have a daughter,
so they'll likely

129
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:47,984
recognize my natural
paternal instincts.

130
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:50,153
What did I just say about
different countries?!

131
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:52,322
But that only leaves...

132
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:55,199
Well, if you're
gonna twist my arm.

133
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,160
Is your face okay?
It looks like it's smiling.

134
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,037
He doesn't even know
how to wear a shirt!

135
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:01,497
There's no other choice,
so I guess he'll have to do.

136
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:03,916
Ow, that was a little harsh.

137
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,836
Okay, but that still leaves
us with the role of your mom.

138
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:12,884
Not. It.

139
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:15,470
Well, I guess you don't
really have a choice here.

140
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,347
Just confiscate all
of her weapons first.

141
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:19,640
Maybe it's not too late to
hire a professional actor.

142
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,518
To be honest, I'm not
sure that I approve

143
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:24,562
of you deceiving your
teachers like this.

144
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:26,773
I mean, they are just trying
to look out for you, right?

145
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:28,483
But if I tell them
the truth then,

146
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:30,360
they'll know that I lied!

147
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,320
Listen, Miu puts up
with you night and day

148
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,655
and does everything for you!
Don't you think it's about time

149
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,158
that you all did
something for her!

150
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:39,494
Grab his other leg!

151
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:41,162
I didn't mean it,
I didn't mean it!

152
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:42,455
Apachai could be brother!

153
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:45,291
From a different country?!

154
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,001
Are you ready, Ono?

155
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,252
Yes!

156
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:50,380
If you're going to assist
me on this home visit,

157
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,049
you need to act as
professionally as possible.

158
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:54,092
Of course I will.

159
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:56,010
This is just my
first home visit.

160
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,637
I'm so excited!

161
00:07:57,637 --> 00:07:58,679
Listen, Ono,

162
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,265
don't let your excitement
impair your awareness.

163
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:03,017
You can never be
sure of what lurks

164
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:05,103
behind the doors
of a student's home.

165
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:09,315
Our job is to observe and
judge, not to make friends.

166
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:11,484
Well, there's still
one thing I don't get.

167
00:08:11,484 --> 00:08:13,403
Why are we investigating
Miu Furinji?

168
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:14,612
She's an 'A' student,

169
00:08:14,612 --> 00:08:16,948
and she has a perfectly
clean background record.

170
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:19,951
Miu is an excellent student,
yet I'm suspicious.

171
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:22,703
Maybe it's just my imagination,
but there's something about her

172
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,665
that doesn't seem normal.
She's well mannered, friendly,

173
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:28,334
and intelligent, but
doesn't seem to fit in.

174
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:31,212
I may be mistaken, but I
could've sworn I saw her

175
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:33,923
attacking other students
on the roof one day.

176
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:36,551
And if that's not enough
to arouse suspicion,

177
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:38,720
I've been informed that
she's currently living

178
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,596
with her supposed boyfriend.

179
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:44,142
Well now, not that
it's any of my business,

180
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:46,269
but I felt I should tell
you that Miu is living

181
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:49,605
with another male student.
I'm just so concerned for her.

182
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:50,898
She'll have to be
expelled, right?

183
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,900
I must confirm this
information first.

184
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,277
Living with someone?

185
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:56,487
Oh, young love! How romantic!

186
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:57,572
Ono!

187
00:08:57,572 --> 00:08:58,906
I know, I know!

188
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,367
As teachers, we can't let
something like this slide.

189
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:03,870
Don't you understand,
such a reckless decision

190
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,914
could destroy her performance
at school and her future.

191
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,291
Sure!

192
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,625
Then let's get going.

193
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,252
Yeah, I'm right behind you!

194
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,424
I'm a professional
fashion designer.

195
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:18,301
Alright you two.
Once again, from the top.

196
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:21,012
I want to hear your name, age,
and occupation. No stuttering.

197
00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:22,930
Saiga Furinji, 38 years old.

198
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,809
I work in the aviation field,
as a commercial airline pilot.

199
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:29,353
How many times are you going
to force me to repeat this, Miu?

200
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,397
Shizuha Furinji, 36.

201
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:33,065
Professional fashion designer.

202
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:35,401
Not an expert in
martial arts weaponry.

203
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:37,487
You know, there's something
about the two of them together

204
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:38,571
that's just not quite right.

205
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:40,948
It's working fine, they're just
not working hard enough!

206
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,617
You realize that I don't
know the first thing

207
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:43,993
about airplanes, right?

208
00:09:43,993 --> 00:09:46,788
Why can't say that I'm a
pro-wrestler or something?

209
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:48,498
Or maybe we could
say I'm an assassin.

210
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:49,791
You're a pilot and that's that!

211
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,126
I wrote pilot on my
transfer files for school!

212
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:53,377
Alright, sorry!

213
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:55,087
Just read the
material thoroughly

214
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:56,589
and everything will be fine.

215
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:57,757
Okay...

216
00:09:57,757 --> 00:09:58,799
How's it going?

217
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,010
Great. Do you have
Apachai under control?

218
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,887
Yes, I told him to find
someplace to hide

219
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:04,680
until the smoke has cleared.

220
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,975
Anybody home? Hello?
It's Mr. Yasunaga.

221
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:08,810
They're already here!

222
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,020
I've gotta hide! Right now!

223
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,564
Wow, that's a big gate.

224
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:19,654
Well that's odd, I don't
see anybody around.

225
00:10:19,654 --> 00:10:21,447
Is this an automatic gate?

226
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:25,117
Apa...

227
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:26,661
Apapapaaa.

228
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:31,332
Are you alright Ono?
What's the matter?

229
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:33,167
There was a person,
no, a giant--

230
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,670
a giant person perched on
top of the gate above us!

231
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,046
He was right up there!

232
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:38,840
Oh! I didn't realize
you were already.

233
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,091
Welcome to my home!

234
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,385
Come on in, my parents
are waiting for you.

235
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:44,804
Hello Miu, we're sorry
to bother you like this

236
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:47,306
at the last minute.
Please, Ono, relax.

237
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:49,851
I can't have you acting
crazy in front of a student.

238
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:52,103
I am not crazy,
he was tan and muscular!

239
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:54,230
Please, why don't you
both come inside?

240
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,566
Sure.

241
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,067
Look, quickly! Above the gate!

242
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,944
I'm not crazy, he's
right there! See?!

243
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:00,987
Ms. Ono?

244
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:02,822
Come, on, in.

245
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:04,949
The heat must be getting to you.

246
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:08,536
Apachai was only trying to help.

247
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:10,621
The gate is too heavy
for the teacher to open.

248
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:12,498
I swear! I saw him!

249
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:18,768
Wow, you have a
very impressive home.

250
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:21,771
Not really, it's just big.

251
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:23,523
And these are my parents.

252
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,446
I'm Yasunaga, Miu's
homeroom teacher.

253
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:31,281
And I'm Ono, his assistant.

254
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:33,658
I'm Saiga Furinji, age 38.

255
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:35,660
My occupation is, uh--

256
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,706
Um, I'm airplane!

257
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:41,207
He's an airplane?

258
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:45,462
No, no, I meant my field of work
is, I meant, I'm a field pilot!

259
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:47,047
What's a field pilot?

260
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:48,381
No! What's wrong with him?

261
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:50,967
Oh, this is not good.

262
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:52,260
He's nervous!

263
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,055
Uh, how about my age?
Did I already tell you that?

264
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:57,015
Wait, am I 36 or 38?

265
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:58,016
Who cares?

266
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:00,560
What's going on here?
Is this some kind of joke?

267
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,521
Don't be rude, mother.
Introduce yourself.

268
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:10,070
My name is Shizuha Furinji.
I'm 36 years old.

269
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,280
I'm a professional
fashion designer,

270
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,115
and I don't like bees.

271
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:16,743
How'd she hide that knife?
I patted her down thoroughly!

272
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:18,453
I-I-I-I--

273
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:20,372
My mother collects
knives for a hobby

274
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,916
and my father, well he
just loves to joke, heh!

275
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,167
As a hobby?!

276
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:25,627
I don't know...

277
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:28,713
For a second there she had
the cold eyes of a killer!

278
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:30,423
Maybe we should just
burn the house down.

279
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:32,467
This couldn't possibly
get any worse.

280
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,232
There's something very strange
going on with this family.

281
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:50,986
They're hiding something.
I can feel it in my gut.

282
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:53,405
Miu's told me that you
fly international flights.

283
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,031
That must be exhausting.

284
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:59,119
I'm planning a trip soon.
Which airline do you work for?

285
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:00,328
Uh...

286
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:03,456
I work for Jaro!

287
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:06,042
The Japanese Advertisement
Review Organization?

288
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,544
Is he talking about
that commercial

289
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:08,878
that's always playing?

290
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:11,631
Having a healthy body must
be an asset to a pilot.

291
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:15,635
I mention it because you appear
to have a very strong build.

292
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:17,303
That's because I punch
the striking post

293
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:19,139
at least 10,000 times every day.

294
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,934
I see. And where do you do that?

295
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:26,855
In the cockpit,
on the plane ride.

296
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:30,817
Miu was right, you sure
do like to joke around.

297
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:34,571
Oh, Father! You're just
being ridiculous now!

298
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:35,947
Okay, that's the sign!

299
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:38,032
I told her she should've
cast me as the father.

300
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:41,286
Oh, well, at least she was
able to make him wear a shirt.

301
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:43,913
I'll get it!

302
00:13:43,913 --> 00:13:45,707
Father, it's for you.

303
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:48,626
It's somebody from the airline.
He said it's urgent.

304
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:52,756
Oh, well, y-yeah if it's
from the plane phone, um--

305
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:55,258
Well it was nice to meet you,
thanks for looking over Miu.

306
00:13:55,258 --> 00:13:56,926
Of course.

307
00:13:58,928 --> 00:14:00,638
Thank you.

308
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:03,475
No problem, Father. You just
sit here and take your call.

309
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,726
So, Mrs. Furinji--

310
00:14:04,726 --> 00:14:05,602
What, baldy?

311
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:07,854
Did she just call me baldy?!

312
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:11,149
You haven't said too much.

313
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,568
Tell me, which company
do you work for?

314
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:16,905
In addition, do you recall Miu's
report card from the 8th grade?

315
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:20,450
And how much exactly did Miu
weigh when she was born?

316
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,286
I'm a freelance designer
for various companies.

317
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:25,246
I'm currently starting
my own business.

318
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:28,291
Miu's eighth grade report
card is: History-A,

319
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:32,629
Social Studies-A, P.E.-A,
Math-A, English-B,

320
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:36,633
Science-B, Home Ec.-A.
She was born on January 14th

321
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:40,804
at 10:40 AM and weighed
precisely 3014 grams.

322
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:43,389
Anything else you
want to know?

323
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:45,433
Oh, Shigure,
you're the greatest!

324
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:47,644
She memorized all of the
material I gave her!

325
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:50,480
Excuse me! Can you tell me
where the bathroom is?

326
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,566
Ono, put your hand down!

327
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:55,360
Here, I'll show you where it is.

328
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,821
I apologize for
her behavior, Miu.

329
00:14:57,821 --> 00:14:59,030
Your mother is very beautiful.

330
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,157
She doesn't even look
old enough to be your mom.

331
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:03,952
Oh, thanks. She's very kind too.

332
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:06,329
Well, here's the bathroom.

333
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:07,539
Thanks for showing me.

334
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,459
Now if you'll excuse me...

335
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:14,921
Come to think of it, what
was Yasunaga telling me?

336
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:16,339
You can learn a lot
about a family

337
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:18,758
by inspecting their bathroom.
They may have the cleanest

338
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:20,927
house on earth, but you
can discover much more

339
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:23,638
from the state of their toilet.

340
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:27,016
It's my duty to
look at their toilet!

341
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:29,686
Apachai's not hiding in here,
this room is empty.

342
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:31,354
Please go away now.

343
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,525
Apa!

344
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:38,361
I saw the giant again!
He's hiding in the bathroom!

345
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:39,988
I apologize for her behavior.

346
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:42,991
It's her first home visit,
and I think she's a bit nervous.

347
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:44,993
Don't worry. Really.

348
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:48,246
Yes, but how about
we put an end to this.

349
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:50,165
Why don't you go ahead
and come clean with me?

350
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:52,125
You're not Miu's
mother, are you?

351
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,128
Being a teacher, I've met
many of my student's parents

352
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:58,006
over the years, and you're
obviously not a mother.

353
00:15:58,006 --> 00:15:59,883
Not only are you far too young,

354
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:04,762
but there doesn't seem to be any
connection between you and Miu.

355
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:07,348
She's clumsy, doesn't like
to be alone, worries about

356
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:09,893
what other people think,
and tends to be scatterbrained,

357
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:12,770
but she's a really good kid.
She was afraid you wouldn't

358
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,522
understand if she
told you the truth.

359
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:17,483
Try not to be too hard on her,
she didn't mean any harm.

360
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:19,444
We came here today
to investigate a rumor

361
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:21,362
that a male student has
been living with her.

362
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:24,449
True or not, you've deceived
us for some reason.

363
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:26,659
I regret that it's come
to this, but Miu must

364
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:29,621
be properly disciplined
for arranging this hoax!

365
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:33,499
Well...

366
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:36,085
Then you leave me
with no other option.

367
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:38,671
What, what are you--
Now, wait a minute,

368
00:16:38,671 --> 00:16:40,381
I'm sure there's plenty
other options here!

369
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:42,050
No!

370
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,512
I knew it! This is
a Yakuza hideout!

371
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:48,598
This way! Hurry, you
gotta get out of here!

372
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:49,849
Kenichi Shirahama?!

373
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:51,643
What are you doing here?

374
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:56,356
I caught him, Yasunaga!
I caught the giant!

375
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:58,024
I told you he was real,
I'm not crazy!

376
00:16:58,024 --> 00:17:00,526
What are you're doing, Shigure?
You can't kill him!

377
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:03,696
I wasn't gonna kill him.
I just wanted to scare him

378
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:05,406
so he wouldn't go
blabbing to the school

379
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:08,159
about Miu not having a family.
I'll kill him if he does.

380
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:09,327
C'mon, you've gotta run!

381
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:11,663
They lose control when
they get too excited!

382
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:17,251
Miu!

383
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:19,087
I think it's time for
a strategic withdrawal!

384
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:20,922
What's wrong with these people!

385
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:25,343
Kenichi!

386
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:27,428
What's going on here?
Don't tell me, you're the one

387
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:29,222
that's been living
together with Miu!

388
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:30,556
No, no, it's not
what you think it is!

389
00:17:30,556 --> 00:17:32,642
Yes, we're living, but we're
not "living together"!

390
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:35,186
You idiot! What do you think
"living together" means?!

391
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:41,234
What kind of madhouse is this?
Are these people insane?

392
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,944
No, they're all really
nice people, I promise!

393
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:45,446
They just don't have very
good social skills, that's all!

394
00:17:45,446 --> 00:17:47,240
Hey, they're heading this way!

395
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:51,911
Don't look back,
just keep running!

396
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:01,754
Oh, my. Am I seeing this?

397
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:02,755
Oh, c'mon!

398
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:05,967
Why did I have
to pick this room?

399
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:08,636
Uh, are you okay sir?

400
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:10,638
I've never seen anything
like this before.

401
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:13,224
As a history teacher, I've
devoted my life to the study

402
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,977
and appreciation
of Japanese culture.

403
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:19,022
But this is the most magnificent
collection I've ever seen.

404
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:20,648
They're so beautiful.

405
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:22,608
Such intricate
carvings and detail.

406
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:24,944
The craftsmanship
is remarkable.

407
00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:28,698
I can hardly believe it.
These aren't stolen, are they?

408
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:30,491
And there are scrolls
of literature as well!

409
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:33,286
He really likes this stuff.

410
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:36,039
I can't begin to describe the
mastery of this calligraphy.

411
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,582
The strokes are fluid
and spontaneous,

412
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:39,542
but perfectly elegant.

413
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:42,545
There is only one living artist
that could have possibly--

414
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:47,050
Kenichi, you okay?

415
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:54,265
Look out behind you!

416
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,019
He's a goner!

417
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,729
This is the worst day ever!

418
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:04,609
Apa?

419
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:08,978
Are you alright?
Do you need any help up?

420
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:14,355
So sorry to have
kept you waiting.

421
00:19:14,355 --> 00:19:19,235
I am her grandfather,
Miu's actual relative.

422
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:22,405
Grandpa made it after all.

423
00:19:22,405 --> 00:19:24,532
You wouldn't believe how
much I had to go through

424
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,325
in order to hunt him down.

425
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:27,702
Akisame!

426
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:29,746
But you told us you
were busy today.

427
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:31,247
You said that you
had something urgent

428
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:33,124
you had to take care of.

429
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:34,917
I went to look
for her grandfather.

430
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,669
Turned out be pretty
urgent, right?

431
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:39,088
You? Are you...

432
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:41,924
Are you the artist responsible
for everything in this room?

433
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:43,009
Literature...

434
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:44,093
Painting...

435
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:45,011
Pottery...

436
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:46,095
Sculptures...

437
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:47,305
Are you the renowned artisan

438
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:49,474
who mastered every
craft imaginable?

439
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:52,185
Are you the Akisame Koetsuji?

440
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:56,105
Is there a single thing
this guy can't do?!

441
00:19:56,105 --> 00:19:58,441
So he isn't living
with Miu, he's merely

442
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:02,069
residing here as a pupil?
I had no idea this was a dojo.

443
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:03,988
And I never would've
guessed it was the dojo

444
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:05,072
of the grand master.

445
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:06,949
I'm sorry for screaming
and jumping on your back.

446
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:08,826
And I'm sorry for bursting
through walls with you.

447
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:11,329
Despite the misunderstanding,
it's been an honor.

448
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:12,830
We are honored as well.

449
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,292
It's always a privilege to
meet one of Miu's teachers.

450
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:19,087
Please understand our disciples
were looking out for Miu.

451
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:21,297
They're a little misguided,
but please forgive them.

452
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:22,298
Disciples?

453
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:24,008
He didn't mean it.

454
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:26,177
I'm really sorry
for everything.

455
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:29,055
I didn't wanna
lie to you, but--

456
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,140
There's no need
to apologize, Miu.

457
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,018
To be perfectly honest, I'm
jealous you two get to study

458
00:20:34,018 --> 00:20:35,561
with the grand master Koetsuji.

459
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:37,271
The grand master?

460
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:40,650
That guy becomes more and
more of an enigma every day.

461
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,068
And Kenichi.

462
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:45,655
I'd noticed that you've
seemed more confident lately,

463
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:47,073
though I couldn't
figure out why.

464
00:20:47,073 --> 00:20:48,825
But now, I think I understand.

465
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:51,744
You've been training
to become a great artist!

466
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:56,249
I have to admit,
I'm quite impressed!

467
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:58,417
I might as well
let him think that.

468
00:21:01,587 --> 00:21:03,297
It's like a bomb
went off in here.

469
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:05,299
It'll take forever to
clean all this stuff up.

470
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,467
Where's Miu?

471
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,594
I'm sure she's
exhausted after today.

472
00:21:08,594 --> 00:21:10,471
You should probably let
her have the day off.

473
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:14,267
I don't need any help, I can
clean up the mess in here.

474
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:18,354
That's very thoughtful,
I'm sure she'll... What?

475
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:20,773
That's a surprise.
Look what I found.

476
00:21:20,773 --> 00:21:22,483
Oh, did you make that?

477
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:24,402
Let me guess,
it's an early carving?

478
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:25,528
Something you made back

479
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:27,697
when you were still
young and inexperienced?

480
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:31,117
No, it isn't. It was actually
carved by a great man.

481
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:33,161
It was a gift, from him.

482
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:37,623
The Saiga Furinji.

483
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:41,419
Not only was he Miu's Father,
he was my closest friend.

484
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,922
Thank's everyone.

485
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:47,508
Thank you for
all of your help.

486
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:49,802
Thank you.

487
00:21:49,802 --> 00:21:52,221
I know at times they
can be frustrating,

488
00:21:52,221 --> 00:21:56,767
but even though they may not
be blood, they are family.

489
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:58,895
Aren't we lucky?

490
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:03,983
Holy crap, these guys
don't know the meaning

491
00:22:03,983 --> 00:22:05,526
of the word patience.

492
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:10,823
Sakaki, you don't need more
than three bottles of sake.

493
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:13,367
Stop Apachai, you're gonna
knock down the entire house!

494
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:15,536
Kensei, i'm not training
with you anymore.

495
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:17,204
Go away you old pervert.

496
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:22,251
Shigure, please quit throwing
your suriken in the house.

497
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,837
Poor Miu. Those guys
hassle her so much,

498
00:22:24,837 --> 00:22:27,256
she can't even get away
from them in her sleep.

499
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:33,221
I get it though. These people
are nothing like my family,

500
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,640
but they're the closest
thing she has to one.

501
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,310
And she cares about them as
if they were her relatives.

502
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,186
Okay!

503
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:42,188
Who wants some sake?

504
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:47,151
Family is accepting your
loved ones for who they are

505
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:49,195
and looking past
their shortcomings.

506
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:53,616
Considering what we're able to
accept we are definitely family.

507
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:22,079
Miu! We've got a
serious problem here!

508
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,581
There's a bunch
of guys out front

509
00:24:23,581 --> 00:24:24,623
that wanna challenge the dojo!

510
00:24:24,623 --> 00:24:26,333
Really? That sounds exciting.

511
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,334
This is serious, Miu!

512
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:29,253
They said they won't
take no for an answer!

513
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:30,379
Where are all the masters?

514
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:33,299
Oh, they all went out
to go do something.

515
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:34,508
What do we do?!

516
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:36,052
We invite them inside.

517
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:37,803
It's not polite to
keep them waiting.

518
00:24:37,803 --> 00:24:39,513
You show them in and
I'll prepare the tea.

519
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:40,473
Are you serious?!

520
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:42,975
You can't entertain these
guys, they're not guests!

521
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:44,685
They wanna challenge us!

522
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:46,896
I guess I have no other choice.

523
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:48,064
I have to fight!
