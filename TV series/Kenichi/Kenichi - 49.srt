1
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:12,554
[Music]

2
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,683
Enough playing around-
I'm ready to attack!

3
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,688
Impossible!

4
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,814
I dodged it!

5
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,108
How'd his punch get
past my defenses?

6
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,192
Gungnir attack!

7
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,823
It's the Gungnir...!

8
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,701
That's the name of Odin's
perfectly accurate javelin!

9
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,245
He really can see through
everything just like Odin.

10
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,873
He even saw through
Kenichi's dodge!

11
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:03,999
How'd you like
that attack?

12
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,585
My gungnir never
misses its target.

13
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,711
What do you think?

14
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,629
Not bad, huh?

15
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,925
Ya know it's weird...

16
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,260
There's something
about this place-

17
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,179
didn't we used to play
superheroes here?

18
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,305
Yeah...

19
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,890
I remember you always
had to be the good guy

20
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,350
whenever we played...

21
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,268
and I ended up being
the villain every time.

22
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,523
This time it'll
be different...

23
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,817
I'll gladly play
the villain today!

24
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:41,815
Finally.

25
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:47,403
Everyone has some bad memories
of when they were little...

26
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:48,738
But it takes
something dramatic

27
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:50,657
to hurt a child's spirit.

28
00:02:59,332 --> 00:03:00,542
That day at the
General Store,

29
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:01,793
we met a girl who was crying

30
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:06,089
because she didn't get
the badge she wanted.

31
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:09,008
So I watched you trade my
badge for the one she got...

32
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:10,969
she wanted the cat
badge so badly.

33
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:12,262
She was so happy.

34
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:16,474
And then we watched
her defeat them.

35
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:19,894
We watched her take
on those three punks

36
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:21,813
right in front of us,
like they were nothing.

37
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:26,526
As gracefully as a feather
floating in the wind.

38
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:28,528
Wow... she's amazing!

39
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:30,822
That was the day I knew

40
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:34,075
I wanted to become a
martial artist like her...

41
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:36,077
And I thought you were
with me, the whole time-

42
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:39,330
I pictured you training
as hard as I did.

43
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,498
But you weren't...

44
00:03:40,498 --> 00:03:42,917
It turns out I left you
behind, didn't I...?

45
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,130
Kenichi!

46
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,548
Outta my way!

47
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:52,927
What's wrong have you
had all you can take...?

48
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:55,013
Thought you had more
strength than that.

49
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:56,431
Thing about power...

50
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:58,308
Is that it
attracts people...

51
00:03:58,308 --> 00:03:59,559
it can control them...

52
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,769
and it can
destroy them, too.

53
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:04,564
There's nothing quite
like it, Kenichi.

54
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:06,399
Shirahama, sir!

55
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,610
Shinpaku slash!

56
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:12,238
Where'd he go?

57
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,323
Idiot.

58
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:15,950
Where'd this
thing come fro...

59
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:21,581
No, wait!

60
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,082
Don't touch that!

61
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,503
Matsui!

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,385
That's my badge!

63
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:38,681
We made a deal so
this is mine now.

64
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,768
You're good but I'm afraid

65
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:43,603
you've still got a lot
to learn, my friend.

66
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:45,104
But why...?

67
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:48,149
Why do you want that
silly badge so badly?

68
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:49,484
Don't be stupid

69
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:51,819
this has nothing to do
with that silly badge...

70
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:53,905
Ten long years ago...

71
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:56,741
Kenichi did something to me
that was unforgivable...

72
00:04:56,741 --> 00:05:00,286
So I simply wanted
to return the favor.

73
00:05:00,286 --> 00:05:01,871
Something unforgivable?

74
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:07,293
To fight is to use the
skills you have attained.

75
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:09,379
Through rigorous training
or exceptional talent,

76
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,339
it doesn't matter.

77
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,258
Whoever loses obviously lacks
the required amount of both,

78
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:16,552
and deserves defeat...

79
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:19,806
Why do you waste your energy
defending such weaklings?

80
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:22,141
Because somebody has to stand
up for the innocent people

81
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:23,893
who can't defend themselves...

82
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:25,436
Or else they'll always
be pushed around

83
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:28,231
by egotistical
bullies like you!

84
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:29,315
It seems that even though

85
00:05:29,315 --> 00:05:31,442
we witnessed the same
fight that day...

86
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:33,152
we each grew up with
a different take on

87
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:35,697
what exactly it
was that we saw.

88
00:05:35,697 --> 00:05:37,657
Your idiot masters should
have set you straight.

89
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:38,866
What did you call them?!

90
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:39,909
A-pa-pa?

91
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:42,370
That wasn't nice!

92
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,747
Very rude.

93
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:45,748
What? What?

94
00:05:45,748 --> 00:05:47,750
What's he talking
about down there...?

95
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,544
I hate not being able to
read lips like you guys!

96
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:51,504
I hate it! Will someone
please translate for me,

97
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:53,214
it's not fair,
I wanna know too.

98
00:05:56,134 --> 00:05:58,052
That's my disciple...!

99
00:05:58,052 --> 00:05:59,721
Keep it going, my boy.

100
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:03,725
I don't care what
you call me... Odin.

101
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:07,854
But I'm not gonna let
you insult my masters.

102
00:06:07,854 --> 00:06:10,732
Really...? Now you're trying
to defend your masters...?

103
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:12,608
Stupid boy.

104
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:14,694
My master, the
Great Sage of Fist,

105
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:16,654
got rid of those
feelings in me long ago.

106
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:20,116
He's incredible...

107
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:21,993
He has true power!

108
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,501
I trained in karate...

109
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:32,045
and in boxing...

110
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:34,130
Enough! He's down,
let him go...!

111
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,758
My only goal was power.

112
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:38,342
I said let him go, or
you're disqualified!

113
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:40,053
Ah-suh-mee-uh! Stop!

114
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:45,850
But no matter
how hard I tried,

115
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,144
I couldn't achieve the
level I strove for...

116
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:49,270
It wasn't enough!

117
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:51,606
That's when it happened.

118
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:56,152
How dare they
disqualify me.

119
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:58,029
The guy lying
unconscious on the mat

120
00:06:58,029 --> 00:06:59,947
is who won that fight...?

121
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:01,908
That doesn't make any sense...

122
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:04,869
They need some new rules.

123
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:06,704
Ah, whatever...

124
00:07:06,704 --> 00:07:08,956
I just need to find something
new to learn, that's all.

125
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,001
What's going on here?

126
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,422
There's no need to be
concerned about me...

127
00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:18,883
you can both come at me
at once if you want...

128
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:20,301
Oh, and don't worry...

129
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:22,178
I swear I'm not a bad guy.

130
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:23,513
If you both die...

131
00:07:23,513 --> 00:07:26,182
I'll get back to your
families for a proper burial.

132
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:30,144
I don't like this guy.

133
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:31,270
Let's kill him!

134
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,694
I saw moves I'd
never seen before.

135
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:40,863
They went against everything
I'd ever learned.

136
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:49,914
I still remember
the shiver

137
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:52,583
that went down my
spine as I watched...

138
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,418
Even then I knew
what I was feeling

139
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:56,129
wasn't just fear.

140
00:07:58,381 --> 00:07:59,924
There was something else,

141
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:03,427
something inexplicable
running in my blood.

142
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:05,304
Wait! Please!

143
00:08:05,304 --> 00:08:08,516
Why did you do that?

144
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:11,519
Death matches are
illegal now...!

145
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,688
Aren't they?

146
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:16,190
But death matches
are essential.

147
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,483
That's why I did it...

148
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,154
My goal is to restore
the martial arts

149
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:23,447
to their former glory!

150
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:25,116
After years of
searching...

151
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:26,701
finally...

152
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:28,661
I had found what
I was looking for.

153
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:32,999
A merciless attacker whose
intention is to destroy,

154
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:35,209
that is the true
martial artist.

155
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:36,961
You see...

156
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:39,505
I learned my lessons well
under the Great Sage of Fists.

157
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,007
Wrong...!

158
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:43,301
Without a heart, all we
have left is violence!

159
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:54,604
My ribs...!

160
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:55,646
It's okay...

161
00:08:55,646 --> 00:08:56,606
They're not broken.

162
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:02,445
I have to hand it to you,
you are pretty durable.

163
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:04,530
My attacks don't
seem to faze you-

164
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,324
are you made of lead
or something...?

165
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:08,117
Even lead can be
bent, you know.

166
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:12,830
This has to stop.

167
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,458
Well, Kenichi?

168
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,251
Why are you waiting...?

169
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:18,753
Come at me with
all you've got...

170
00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:19,837
don't hold back.

171
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:24,300
Damn it...!

172
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,386
If he can read my every move,
then what's the point...?

173
00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:29,597
How can I attack...?

174
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:33,392
No...! There must be some way!

175
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:34,602
The punch!

176
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:38,731
Do something
unexpected, Kenichi!

177
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:39,315
What?

178
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:40,733
Odin uses two things

179
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:43,736
to predict his opponent's
movements in a fight!

180
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:45,321
The first is your body.

181
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:47,365
He watches you for
signals of an attack.

182
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:48,366
The second...

183
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,660
is rhythm...!

184
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,662
He's observed your movements
in previous fights...

185
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:54,121
he knows your patterns!

186
00:09:58,668 --> 00:10:00,545
The proof is that he didn't
use the GUNG-near technique

187
00:10:00,545 --> 00:10:02,213
on you from the beginning...

188
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:04,382
it's because he couldn't,
don't you see, my friend?!

189
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:06,550
No...!

190
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,261
He hadn't discovered
your rhythm yet,

191
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:09,470
so he wasn't able to employ

192
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,640
his favorite fighting
style until now!

193
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,142
Thanks for the free
analysis... Siegfried.

194
00:10:15,142 --> 00:10:16,435
Kenichi...

195
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:18,646
what loyal if useless
friends you've found yourself

196
00:10:18,646 --> 00:10:20,690
since we were children.

197
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,650
You just have to use
the same combination

198
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,778
you used on me that night we
were fighting at the docks.

199
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:26,570
Is he right?

200
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:34,161
Karate, Muay Thai,
Kenpo and Judo...

201
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:35,871
If I combine them
all into one attack

202
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:38,416
it'll be hard for him
to predict what I do.

203
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,459
Are you done
strategizing...?

204
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,336
Honestly, I don't know
why you bother.

205
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:43,921
It's quite pointless...

206
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:46,465
when you can't even
get close to me!

207
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:48,259
Come on, Kenichi!
Fight back!

208
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,846
I have to break his
concentration somehow...

209
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:53,598
so I can try that combo.

210
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:00,980
He's absorbing every blow.

211
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,106
And he's getting closer!

212
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:06,444
You can't take this forever,
you little punching bag,

213
00:11:06,444 --> 00:11:08,029
everyone has their limits!

214
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:17,705
Well...

215
00:11:17,705 --> 00:11:20,666
I guess you've
finally had enough.

216
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,751
No...

217
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:22,752
Not quite.

218
00:11:24,378 --> 00:11:27,923
Permission to
step forward?

219
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:29,008
What are you doing?

220
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:30,301
Are you talking
to yourself?

221
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:32,928
Granted!

222
00:11:55,317 --> 00:11:56,443
Granted!

223
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:01,369
By attempting an attack

224
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,746
in such close proximity
to his opponent...

225
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,414
Prepare to attack...!

226
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:07,375
Now! He made it almost
impossible to dodge!

227
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:10,169
Just like last time.

228
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:25,977
That was close.

229
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:33,025
What an amazing punch.

230
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:34,735
If I hadn't
used two hands,

231
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:36,237
my bones might've
shattered.

232
00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:44,495
Impossible.

233
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:46,372
He deflected that
amazing punch...

234
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:48,082
like it was nothing.

235
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:49,834
His defense is flawless...

236
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,711
it's almost inhuman...

237
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:52,920
how terrifying...

238
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:54,797
Look out!

239
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,428
Thor!

240
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:01,846
Hey Siegfried...

241
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,097
keep your eyes open.

242
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:07,101
Alright fine. One more.

243
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:09,812
Too late...

244
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,063
You showed your hand...

245
00:13:11,063 --> 00:13:13,149
You won't catch me off
guard with that one again.

246
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:17,445
Which means- this...

247
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:19,030
Is over!

248
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:24,577
Shirihama!

249
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:26,162
Kenichi, be careful!

250
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:30,625
Oh no you don't...!
Concentrate...

251
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,427
My demon king, your
powers are most fearful

252
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:43,512
and quite timely!

253
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:44,889
Shinpaku!

254
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:49,227
Come on, it was just
a coincidence...

255
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:50,561
You morons.

256
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:52,063
What a shame.

257
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:54,357
That would've made a beautiful
ending, don't you think?

258
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:58,319
No...

259
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:00,029
You really want more...?

260
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:01,280
I've seen through

261
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,366
every single one of your
attacks so far...

262
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:06,744
why don't you just give
up before you get hurt?

263
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:09,872
Not... yet!

264
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:17,713
You can barely stand.

265
00:14:17,713 --> 00:14:19,298
How do you expect to put
up any sort of a fight

266
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:20,549
in this condition?

267
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:22,259
Or perhaps you have
some kind of death wish

268
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,762
I don't know about?

269
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,889
Oh no!

270
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:29,058
This isn't good...!

271
00:14:29,058 --> 00:14:30,768
My body won't
stop shaking!

272
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:34,480
Damn it!

273
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,899
I guess I should just put
you out of your misery.

274
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,902
Shaking...! Stop!

275
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:48,703
There.

276
00:14:48,703 --> 00:14:50,621
Shaking's gone.

277
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:52,081
Alllll better.

278
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,127
Well, you haven't
changed...

279
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:58,045
You're still as
weird as ever, huh?

280
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:01,757
Alright...

281
00:15:01,757 --> 00:15:03,634
If any attack of
mine that I try...

282
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:06,012
is pointless...

283
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:07,638
That leaves one option...

284
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:12,351
Let's see how
you handle it...

285
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:14,395
when the attacks come
from somebody else!

286
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:22,361
What's he up to?

287
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:24,613
His body movements have
changed completely.

288
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:25,990
A-pa-pa!

289
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,241
Look at him move!

290
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:29,910
Do you see what
Apachai sees, Shigure?

291
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,995
I think I do!

292
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,751
Apa!

293
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:41,797
Apa! Apa! A-pa-pa!

294
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:43,174
I don't know what scheme

295
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:44,884
you're cooking up in
that little brain...

296
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:48,220
but it'll prove just as
useless as the others...

297
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,847
No one has ever
defended themselves

298
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:51,974
against my perfect
Gungnir attack before...

299
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,267
just give up now.

300
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:56,395
A-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-PA!

301
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:58,230
Impossible!

302
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,648
Apa!

303
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:04,361
Am I reading him wrong?
What's going on?!

304
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:05,863
I can't predict
his attacks!

305
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:08,324
Yes! Kenichi's movements
have changed entirely!

306
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:10,076
They have? They look
the same to me!

307
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:11,786
I see.

308
00:16:11,786 --> 00:16:13,829
A-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa...!

309
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:15,206
Apachai is the best!

310
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:17,917
Apachai is fighting bad
guy from way over here!

311
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,752
He's copied him exactly...

312
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:21,796
He looks just
like Apachai!

313
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:24,340
A-paaaa!

314
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,550
The Death God of the
Muay Thai underworld...!

315
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,553
Apachai Hopachai!

316
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:32,681
I'm here to take you straight
back to hell with me, bastard!

317
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:35,226
A-pa-pa...!

318
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:37,603
I may not come close to
Apachai's abilities...

319
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:39,563
But I've learned a
thing or two from him!

320
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:41,148
Apachai Roundhouse!

321
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:42,900
I need to calm down...

322
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,151
and put up my Seikuken.

323
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,407
One. Two... Three...

324
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:52,576
That's it, I've got
the rhythm now...

325
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:54,703
Ha! So you switched
to Muay Thai...

326
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:56,163
Well you almost got me,

327
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:57,998
but I'm afraid it's not
quite going to be enough!

328
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:02,670
No way!

329
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:06,173
My goodness...!

330
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:09,385
Kenichi has completely
changed his rhythm again!

331
00:17:09,385 --> 00:17:10,845
But what does that mean?!

332
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:13,055
So now it's karate, is it?

333
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:14,640
That's not all...

334
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,935
It doesn't look like he's
changing his style exactly...

335
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:21,105
it's more like he's transforming
into someone else...

336
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,064
How odd.

337
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:26,944
And I'm the 100th
degree street fighter...

338
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:28,946
Known as Shio Sakaki!

339
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:33,826
Everybody look, now
Kenichi is being Sakaki

340
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:34,827
See how he's standing!

341
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:36,245
He is funny angry
like Sakaki always is!

342
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:37,621
Even his laugh
sounds like you.

343
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:38,706
It is you, yes Sakak...?

344
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:40,082
That is not how I stand,
that is not how I laugh

345
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:41,417
and I am not funny angry!

346
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,461
See? That's how he looks now.

347
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:45,671
No it isn't!

348
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:47,548
Yes. It is.

349
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:49,425
Brilliant, Kenichi.

350
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:52,344
You did precisely what
needed to be done.

351
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:54,930
You saw that your own
patterns were being read,

352
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,390
and so you modeled
your movements

353
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,352
after the Ryouzanpaku masters
you train with every day.

354
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:01,562
I'm confused.

355
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:03,814
Hasn't Kenichi always been
using karate and muay thai

356
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:05,357
as part of his
fighting style?

357
00:18:05,357 --> 00:18:06,692
He didn't just
change his style.

358
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:08,611
He changed his rhythm.

359
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:09,904
His persona...

360
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:12,114
That's why his opponent
was caught unawares...

361
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:13,240
Do you see now?

362
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,951
That's pretty smart.

363
00:18:17,912 --> 00:18:19,538
Fascinating...

364
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:21,248
A rookie, and a
weakling at that,

365
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:23,209
able to impersonate
his masters...

366
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:24,752
able to imitate
their styles

367
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:27,421
so thoroughly during a fight
that he fools his enemy.

368
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,053
Sometimes the most
difficult lessons we learn

369
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:36,138
are the ones we
never forget.

370
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:37,056
Eh, Kenichi?

371
00:18:41,143 --> 00:18:42,645
Keep your eyes open!

372
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:49,944
Keep running!

373
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:51,654
I can't!

374
00:18:51,654 --> 00:18:53,489
This is no time
to relax, Kenichi!

375
00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:56,367
I'm dying!

376
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,369
Hey. Fix that wall for me.

377
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:01,163
A- pa!

378
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:04,708
Find your Seikuken!

379
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:07,586
No matter how difficult
it may have been,

380
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:10,089
you learned your lessons
well, Kenichi...

381
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:12,174
And that is what martial
arts training is about!

382
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:17,429
You may be able to
predict all of my moves,

383
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:19,557
but you don't know anything
about my masters!

384
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:25,771
Let me introduce you

385
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:28,857
to the master of all Chinese
martial arts, Kensei Ma!

386
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,318
He changed again!

387
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:38,158
Hey... No fair...
Not nice...

388
00:19:38,158 --> 00:19:40,953
I don't really sound
like that, do I?

389
00:19:40,953 --> 00:19:42,705
You do... Sometimes.

390
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:45,082
Oh no... I'm that silly?

391
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:46,542
I think it's kinda cute...

392
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:51,130
No! Not again!

393
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:56,218
Now face the maiden of
weapons, Shigure Kosaka.

394
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:58,637
I know I'm not nearly
at Shigure's level...

395
00:19:58,637 --> 00:19:59,930
But I can handle...

396
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,515
her double...

397
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:02,808
slash.

398
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:03,684
Look, now he's me!

399
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:05,853
A-pa-pa!

400
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:07,021
This is ridiculous,

401
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:09,148
why don't you pick a style
and stay with it...?!

402
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:10,399
Or... are you...

403
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:12,067
Just a copycat after all?!

404
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:18,907
The philosophical judo master...
Akisame Koetsuji!

405
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:24,955
Sheer ignorance...

406
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:28,042
All fighters know that
to study martial arts...

407
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:30,627
One must always begin
with the art of imitation.

408
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:35,382
I'm going to wet myself!

409
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:38,218
I must admit that is a
pretty good imitation...

410
00:20:38,218 --> 00:20:39,845
and an excellent
philosophy.

411
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,267
Ryuto, don't move!

412
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:53,381
Are you okay?
Stay still.

413
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:57,844
Don't you dare touch me.

414
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:05,309
Ryuto...

415
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:07,562
Please, just I don't
understand why...

416
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:09,063
Why do you hate
me so much-

417
00:21:09,063 --> 00:21:10,982
what did I do to you?

418
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:12,608
You don't know...

419
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:15,152
You really don't
remember, do you...?

420
00:21:15,152 --> 00:21:16,487
Poor little Kenichi
wants to know

421
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,489
why I hate him so much.

422
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,503
But you can't
possibly understand.

423
00:21:32,503 --> 00:21:34,380
Not with that naĂŻve
little brain of yours,

424
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,048
so happy in its ignorance.

425
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:46,142
No...! Is he doing
what I think he is?

426
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:00,197
I knew it.

427
00:22:00,197 --> 00:22:02,158
I knew he'd end
up here one day

428
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:04,035
if I just lead him in
the right direction.

429
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:09,915
What's wrong with him?

430
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,134
Unbelievably reckless...

431
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:23,638
He's combining his Sei and
his Dou powers together.

432
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:31,812
Kenichi...

433
00:22:31,812 --> 00:22:33,230
whether you
remember it or not,

434
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,565
a long time ago
you did something

435
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:36,442
for which I can
never forgive you!

436
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:46,327
[Music]

437
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:21,338
I learned the truth
from my master,

438
00:24:21,338 --> 00:24:23,424
the Great Sage of Fists...

439
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:25,551
the only way
humans can evolve

440
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:28,054
is by exterminating the
weak and the helpless.

441
00:24:28,054 --> 00:24:29,305
If you believe that,

442
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:31,056
and if I let you
continue like this,

443
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:32,808
you will walk
the path of Asura...

444
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:34,226
I can't let that happen!

445
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:36,312
Kenichi, please
be careful...!

446
00:24:36,312 --> 00:24:38,647
Odin has become an
unstoppable monster.

447
00:24:38,647 --> 00:24:40,149
There's nothing
you can do!

448
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:42,109
On the name of
Ryouzanpaku...

449
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:43,527
for your own sake...

450
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:45,696
I swear I will
stop you, Ryuto!
