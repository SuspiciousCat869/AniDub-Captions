[Music]

2
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:45,768
This is phenomenal!

3
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:49,480
Akisame, I can't thank you
enough for this massage chair-

4
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,940
it does a great job of
loosening up my tension.

5
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,776
It feels
absolutely amazing!

6
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:54,652
That's good...

7
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:56,403
Miu's wanted to get
you one for a while

8
00:01:56,403 --> 00:01:57,905
but I knew I could
piece together

9
00:01:57,905 --> 00:01:59,198
a custom chair for you-

10
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:00,366
I'm glad that you like it.

11
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,201
Little Miu...
I'm honored to have

12
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:05,788
such a great granddaughter
and such wonderful friends.

13
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:07,498
I think that you're
overreacting.

14
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,423
If you want me to go
faster don't you think you

15
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:18,509
should maybe lighten
the load a little??

16
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,054
Sorry Kenichi but training
for the double palm

17
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:23,639
is serious business......

18
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,391
Now quit whining
and go faster.

19
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:27,226
Don't forget...... make
sure your foot is making

20
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:28,894
full contact with
the treadmill-

21
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:30,479
that'll help build
up your back...

22
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,897
We've gotta get you to
start building up some

23
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:33,816
more muscle on your body
or you're never gonna be

24
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:35,234
much of a fighter.

25
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:37,027
How much longer do
I have to do this? !

26
00:02:37,027 --> 00:02:38,987
Let's make it 2,000 reps.

27
00:02:38,987 --> 00:02:40,280
2,000 reps? !

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,658
But you only made me
do 1,000 yesterday!

29
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:44,368
Well, we've gotta build up
your stamina some how...

30
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:45,744
Tomorrow we'll
do 5,000 reps

31
00:02:45,744 --> 00:02:47,079
and the next day it'll be 10.

32
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,247
You've gotta be kidding!

33
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:49,873
Double each day? !
That's insane!

34
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:52,459
I'm already doing as much
as I can and you want more? !

35
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,086
Hang in there- you'll
be fine Kenichi...

36
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,337
What happened to that
determination

37
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:57,214
you had the other day??

38
00:02:57,214 --> 00:03:00,008
That was before you
made me do this!

39
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:02,469
I'm gonna train so hard
that I break the floor!

40
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:04,263
And I won't give up...

41
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:06,306
Not until that happens!

42
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:08,350
I may have said
that before...

43
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,893
But my body's
gonna break down

44
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:11,770
long before I break
through the floor!

45
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,440
And that's what training
is all about, kid!

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,525
Anybody here??

47
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:20,112
I'm here to take
over your dojo...

48
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:22,740
You will surrender to me!

49
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,867
Oh, wow... a visitor.

50
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:26,076
I've got it...

51
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:27,703
I'll take care
of this one.

52
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:28,746
Kensei, wait!

53
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:30,706
Don't worry- it
won't take long.

54
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:33,417
Damn... He beat
me to it again.

55
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:34,460
What's wrong.....?...

56
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,128
I thought I told you
to pick up the pace!

57
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:40,215
How dare you mock me!

58
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:43,177
I'm not leaving until
I've defied your dojo!

59
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:45,220
Go ahead and give
it your best shot.

60
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,430
You idiot...

61
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,765
Here I am disgracing
your dojo

62
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:49,808
and you're not even
gonna challenge me??

63
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:51,185
I order you to bring
out the master

64
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:53,187
of your dojo
immediately !

65
00:03:53,187 --> 00:03:55,773
I'm afraid you're going to
have to fight me instead...

66
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,357
The elder just got
back from a trip

67
00:03:57,357 --> 00:04:00,861
and he's resting
inside, right now.

68
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:02,863
I was gonna let you off the
hook cause you're a shrimp

69
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:04,281
but now you've
pissed me off!

70
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:05,574
A shrimp?

71
00:04:05,574 --> 00:04:06,909
Prepare to die!

72
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:18,170
And now... Double...... palm!

73
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:23,383
Uh-oh!

74
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:29,473
No.....!...
My power source!

75
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:34,144
Sorry... I got a
little carried away-

76
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:35,687
don't know my own strength.

77
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:37,898
Please be more
careful, Kensei.

78
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:39,650
Forgive me. I'll take him
straight over to your clinic.

79
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,109
I got him pretty good

80
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:43,070
so I'm sure he's gonna
have a hefty bill.

81
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,364
Kenichi... I'll fix this
thing as fast as I can...

82
00:04:45,364 --> 00:04:47,074
Then we'll
continue training.

83
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:48,450
Isn't that great news? !

84
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,035
Akisame will
have you back up

85
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:51,662
and training in no time!

86
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:53,288
They're insane!...

87
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:55,707
Why can't I just
have a normal life??

88
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:58,502
Okay everybody,
it's snack time... ..!

89
00:04:58,502 --> 00:05:00,963
I made you all
coconut jelly today.

90
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:02,422
Coconut jelly?

91
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:04,383
That sounds
pretty sweet...

92
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,968
Can I make rice
wine with it??

93
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:07,302
No, you can't.

94
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:14,351
Seconds please!

95
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:15,978
I only made one
for each of you.

96
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:17,855
Akisame, listen...

97
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:20,482
Do you think maybe you could
add a foot massager this time??

98
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:21,692
Definitely...

99
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:24,194
It'll add resistance and
pump up Kenichi's training.

100
00:05:24,194 --> 00:05:25,571
Oh yeah.

101
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:27,698
Speaking of which,
where did Kenichi go??

102
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:30,033
50 thousand times,
100 thousand times,

103
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,159
a million times...

104
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,828
They're trying to kill me!

105
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:38,625
I ran here fast
as I could.

106
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,085
Did Kenichi
really come home? !

107
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:41,378
Yeah...

108
00:05:41,378 --> 00:05:43,255
He's back home
safe and sound...

109
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:45,299
He said that he learned
everything there was to know

110
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:46,758
so the dojo
let him leave!

111
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:48,886
Yeah.....?... That's my boy!

112
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:50,762
I thought you were
handling a big business

113
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:53,015
deal in Osaka
tonight, dear.

114
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:55,267
You know what I always say-
don't sweat the small stuff...

115
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:56,977
Kenichi...... come
on downstairs...

116
00:05:56,977 --> 00:05:58,270
I wanna see you!

117
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,229
Honey, tell me
what happened!

118
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,397
Did you just
up and leave??

119
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:04,276
Congratulations, son.
I'm proud of ya.

120
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,945
Honoka emailed me with the
good news and I came home

121
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:09,072
as quickly as I
possibly could.

122
00:06:09,072 --> 00:06:11,700
I can't tell you how happy
I am to see ya, my boy.

123
00:06:14,328 --> 00:06:16,455
There's no need
to cry, dad...

124
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:18,373
I can't tell him that
I chickened out

125
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:20,209
cause my training
was too hard.

126
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,585
Listen dear......
I hate to nag

127
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:23,545
but you finished
that meeting right??

128
00:06:23,545 --> 00:06:25,047
Hey I know...

129
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,882
Why don't we go have sushi
tonight to celebrate??

130
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,385
Leave me alone
already.....!...

131
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:32,512
I gonna destroy
this thing!

132
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:34,181
That was your coworker,
wasn't it.....!..?

133
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:35,599
If you lose your job-

134
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:36,892
Anyway, Kenichi.....!... .

135
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:38,936
Tell me some wild
stories about the dojo!

136
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:41,021
Do you think we can do
that tomorrow, Dad.....?

137
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:42,439
I'm really tired.

138
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,857
Would you answer me? !

139
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:45,400
What happened with the
business deal.....?

140
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,361
Don't make me hit you!

141
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,475
Man... Now I've
really done it...

142
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,561
I wonder if Miu's
worried about me??

143
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:02,522
I can finally get some rest.

144
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:14,117
He ran away.....?...
Are you... sure??

145
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:16,244
But I wasn't even gone
for very long......

146
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:18,163
and you let him get away?

147
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:19,581
Where'd you go Shigure?

148
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,416
Lingerie shopping?
Public bath?

149
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,127
Any details you wanna
give I'll take 'em.

150
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:26,337
Apachai's sad
Kenichi's gone...

151
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:29,048
He left because you guys
made him do hard training.

152
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,633
Hey... It's not our fault.

153
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:31,885
What should we
do now.....?...

154
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,470
Do you think maybe I
should go by his house

155
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,846
and have a talk with him??

156
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:37,098
No, just leave him alone.

157
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:40,268
I'm sure, Kenichi will
come back when he's ready...

158
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:42,604
for now...... we'll wait
patiently for our disciple

159
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:44,230
to return to his masters.

160
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,817
Poor Kenichi...

161
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:53,406
Big brother, wake up!

162
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,536
What's up.....?...
What do you want??

163
00:07:58,536 --> 00:07:59,913
Guess what.....?...

164
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,207
I met someone cool that
I wanna introduce you to!

165
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:04,334
I think you'll like him-
he's a martial arts master

166
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,877
just like you!

167
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:07,545
Are you talking about the
guy who rescued you

168
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:08,880
while we were out shopping?

169
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,381
I've heard enough
about him...

170
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:11,716
Dontcha think it's time
you find something else

171
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:14,093
to talk about??

172
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,637
Sorry but I've got more
important things

173
00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:17,472
on my mind right now.

174
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:19,807
But I really wanted the
two of you to meet......

175
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:21,935
He's rich and he's
got a big house.

176
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,562
I think that he might even
be the same age you are...

177
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:26,356
Even though he kinda looks
mean when he fights.....

178
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:28,525
I think he's a
really nice guy!

179
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:29,984
I don't think he has
any friends cause

180
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:31,819
he's so scary looking
when he fights...

181
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,279
But he's cool and you
both do martial arts

182
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,822
so you should be friends!

183
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:36,157
I think it would
really cheer him up.

184
00:08:36,157 --> 00:08:37,867
So will you go with me?
Pretty please? Come on!

185
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:39,244
Shut up.....!...

186
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:41,371
I don't have time to worry
about anyone else right now.....

187
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:42,872
Besides, why would I
wanna be friends

188
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:44,123
with some stupid
guy you met? !

189
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,796
Uh, Honoka...

190
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,881
You're an idiot,
big brother!

191
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,928
Honoka!

192
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:01,224
A-pa-a-a-a-a-a!

193
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,729
Hey! Watch out!

194
00:09:10,775 --> 00:09:14,153
I'm sorry...... I can
be so clumsy sometimes.

195
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,073
Whatever... How many
vases does that make?

196
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:19,075
-That's three!
-And you're proud??

197
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:20,493
Don't worry,
I'll clean it up!

198
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,036
Hey wait!

199
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:27,375
I wanted my brother to
come with me today

200
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,460
but he's not in a
very good mood...

201
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,546
I don't know what his
problem is lately...

202
00:09:31,546 --> 00:09:32,881
So I'm gonna see
if Apachai

203
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:35,091
and Shigure wanna
come with me.

204
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,010
I'm not in a good mood
either, you know......

205
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,887
How 'bout you
stop cleaning...

206
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:40,597
and don't bring anyone
else over here-

207
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:43,016
I'm having a hard enough time
getting you to leave midget.

208
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,685
I'm not a midget-
I'm just fun-sized.

209
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,353
Oh well, time
for the laundry.

210
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,523
Would you cut it
out already? !

211
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,691
I don't want your help.

212
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,984
I don't wanna
be your friend.

213
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:54,569
I just want you to leave!

214
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,865
Why do men always have
to be so dishonest??

215
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,326
I have to get ready for
training this afternoon...

216
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:03,995
So beat it, would
ya.....? I'm busy.

217
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,539
So what're you gonna do
once you get super strong??

218
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,499
I'll kill all the
people I don't like.

219
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:10,585
And what're you gonna do
after you've killed them??

220
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:12,837
I'll find more people I don't
like and I'll kill them.

221
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:14,005
Well, then what're
you gonna do

222
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:15,548
after you kill
those people??

223
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,300
I'll find more people
I don't like...

224
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,760
and I'll kill them too.

225
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,553
But, if you keep looking
for people you don't like

226
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,971
you might find that you
don't like anyone

227
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:23,598
in the whole world.

228
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:25,516
That's right... I know
who my enemies are-

229
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:26,726
it's me against the world!

230
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,356
"You against the world"...

231
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:33,650
You crack me up.

232
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,693
No... someone like you who
grew up in a good home

233
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:37,820
could never understand.

234
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,447
Nobody understands...

235
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:41,157
they never will...

236
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:44,494
Well, Natsu...

237
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:47,246
From this day forward I will
be your foster father...

238
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,540
I've devoted my entire
life to my business

239
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,751
so I've never had
children of my own...

240
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,337
Therefore, you will inherit
the Tanimoto Corporation

241
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:56,965
and be responsible for
the company's future.

242
00:10:56,965 --> 00:10:59,342
I'll teach you
everything I know.

243
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:01,135
If you meet my
expectations

244
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:03,721
then I will pay off all of
your sister's medical fees.

245
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:05,348
But if you don't...

246
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:06,516
then I'll have no choice

247
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:08,685
but to throw the two of
you out on the streets.

248
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:10,895
I'm serious, Natsu.
Don't let me down.

249
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,109
Who's there??

250
00:11:17,985 --> 00:11:19,278
Hey... I just
thought I'd drop in

251
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,488
and see how you're doing.

252
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:21,781
Loki, you bastard...

253
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,658
How'd you get in my house?

254
00:11:23,658 --> 00:11:25,535
You don't seem too
happy to see me...

255
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:27,453
It was easy getting in-
Number 20's a pro

256
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,913
at picking locks.

257
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:30,540
Yeah... Easy.

258
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,916
Don't get all worked up.

259
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,793
I'm not here to
fight you, okay?

260
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,962
I just came here because
I have a message.

261
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,214
I'll take care of
Kenichi Shirahama...

262
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:40,633
so don't you even
bother with him.

263
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,635
Kenichi Shirahama??

264
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:43,886
Screw you...

265
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:45,138
I thought I made it clear

266
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,639
that I don't take
orders from anyone.

267
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,182
Now I suggest you
leave this house

268
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:51,352
before you have to be
dragged out in a body bag.

269
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:52,687
Now hold on...

270
00:11:52,687 --> 00:11:54,772
this order didn't come
from me or Odin...

271
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:56,691
It's an imperial
command handed down

272
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:58,609
by the Saint of
Fists himself.

273
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:04,449
Hey... You're a bad
guy, aren't ya? !

274
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:07,201
I can tell just by looking
at your ugly face...

275
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:08,870
You're not gonna
beat him...

276
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,163
Kenichi Shirahama
is my brother

277
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,706
and he could
kick your butt!

278
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:13,875
What... You're
Shirahama's sister? !

279
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,168
That's right...

280
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,962
My brother is a good guy-
a champion of justice...

281
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:19,464
He may be kinda
down right now,

282
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:22,550
but that won't stop him from
beating up all of you bad guys!

283
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:25,970
What a surprise...

284
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,139
Didn't think I'd find
that punk's sister here.

285
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,515
What're you doing? !

286
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,267
Hey! Put me down!
I can't move!

287
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,435
You're squishing me!

288
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:35,772
You're more useful
than I thought, Hermit.

289
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:37,732
She's Kenichi
Shirahama's sister? !

290
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,171
Hey, is that
Shirahama.....?...

291
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:02,090
It looks like he's trying
to hide out from someone.

292
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:04,801
Hey there...

293
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:07,011
Miu's been looking all
over for you, ya know...

294
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:08,679
I think she was wanting
you to walk her home.

295
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,973
Mi-Mi-Miu!

296
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,353
Sorry but you've got the
wrong guy! Gotta go!

297
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:17,063
That was definitely
Shirahama.

298
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,689
He's so weird.

299
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,900
I can't face
Miu right now.

300
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,360
Not after I chickened
out on my training

301
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,028
at Ryozanpaku.

302
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:25,696
I'm so embarrassed!

303
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:28,199
I wanna go crawl
in a hole and die!

304
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:30,243
I gotta find somewhere
to hide until Miu's left

305
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,078
school for the day!

306
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,039
Welcome to another thrilling
Shinpaku Alliance meeting...

307
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,999
Our numbers are low
so I need you guys

308
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,252
to concentrate on
recruiting new members.

309
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,878
Do whatever you gotta do.

310
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:45,383
Well... I was late so you guys
discuss while I eat my lunch.

311
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:48,761
Ugh. What the hell
is he eating?

312
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,263
That doesn't look
like lunch...

313
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,932
It looks like some kinda
weird science experiment.

314
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,392
Why are you here, Kenichi-

315
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:56,769
shouldn't you be walking
home with your honey?

316
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,479
Hey come to think of it...

317
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,647
he's right...

318
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:01,148
you said you didn't want
anything to do with the

319
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:03,025
Shinpaku Alliance so
why are you attending

320
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,569
Niijima's
little meeting??

321
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:06,320
Uh... Just checkin'
in.....!...

322
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,114
You see, I gotta keep
an eye on Niijima

323
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,575
to make sure that
he's behaving.

324
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:12,952
Miu will never
look for me here.

325
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,829
I just have to wait
till she goes home...

326
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:16,539
What about the two
of you.....!..?

327
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:17,999
I never thought you
guys would wanna join

328
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:20,251
Niijima's silly
Shinpaku Alliance.

329
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:22,086
It's not... what
you're thinkin'.

330
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:23,838
We never really
wanted to join

331
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:25,715
but somehow he was able
to talk us into it.

332
00:14:26,924 --> 00:14:28,009
Please! I'm begging you!

333
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:29,218
I need a strong
guy like you

334
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:30,720
in the Shinpaku Alliance...

335
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,763
Just come to one meeting
and see what it's like.

336
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:34,140
Jeez, you're annoying...

337
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,475
I already said no- I'm
not a delinquent anymore.

338
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,896
Hold on! The Shinpaku Alliance
is totally delinquent-free!

339
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:41,022
It's a group of students
who are focused on

340
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:43,357
fighting for peace!

341
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:44,984
And you're one of the best
fighters in the whole school-

342
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,737
you'd be an excellent
addition to our group.

343
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:49,155
-No...
-You're an amazing boxer-

344
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,364
don't you wanna
show everyone

345
00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:53,075
how incredibly awesome
you are at it?

346
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,535
I don't know.

347
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:56,370
Your friends need
you to protect them.

348
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,747
You wouldn't go and
neglect your friends

349
00:14:57,747 --> 00:14:59,248
would you, Takeda?

350
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:00,958
You can't resist fate!

351
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:03,502
I'll even make
you a leader...

352
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,171
you in or you out??

353
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,422
I'm in...

354
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:07,924
It's my fate...

355
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:10,426
I have to help protect
my friends and my school.

356
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:11,761
Good to hear.

357
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:13,262
Then I'll see you at
tomorrow's meeting.

358
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,017
It was the
strangest thing...

359
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,435
I still can't figure
out what kinda voodoo

360
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:21,145
he used to talk
me into joining.

361
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:23,481
Whoa... He did the same
thing to me too!

362
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:25,244
He brainwashed them!?

363
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:29,202
I gotta get to work...

364
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:31,412
You ladies can sit here
and chat all day if you want

365
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:33,373
but I've gotta get online
and make things happen

366
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:35,208
if you know what I mean.

367
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,211
It's imperative that we get
some new recruits... and fast.

368
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:39,504
Is that a computer...

369
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:41,089
Holy crap!

370
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:43,466
I just threw this one
together using

371
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:46,511
what I found in the trash-
not too shabby, huh Ukita?

372
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:47,554
It's the modern age!

373
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:49,472
We need to have
technology on our side!

374
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:51,933
This computer has a 3
gigahertz dual core processor

375
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:53,434
and 2 gigabytes
of RAM!

376
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:55,853
Whoa... I have no idea what
you're talking about

377
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:57,188
but it sounds awesome!

378
00:15:57,188 --> 00:15:58,815
What the hell is
Niijima doing?

379
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:01,192
His stupid computer
can't help us in a fight.

380
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:02,986
Oh, hey Kenichi...

381
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:04,904
I got some news for ya.

382
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:07,240
Word on the street is
that weird guy is back.

383
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,616
What guy?

384
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:10,285
Natsu Tanimoto...

385
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:12,328
you know, Hermit.

386
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:13,705
Tanimoto's back? !

387
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:15,415
Yeah, and evidently
he's been running around

388
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:17,208
beating up
everyone he sees.

389
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,751
Rumor has it he's been
doing some serious

390
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:20,461
martial arts training.

391
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:22,463
It makes you wonder
if maybe he's randomly

392
00:16:22,463 --> 00:16:24,382
starting fights with
delinquents on the street

393
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:27,093
as a kind of warm-up
to fighting you.

394
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:29,053
So he's back...

395
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:31,264
And I bet he's
counting on a rematch.

396
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:35,643
Don't worry, kid...

397
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:38,396
You gotta remember to stay
calm- don't get nervous...

398
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:39,897
If you start getting too riled
up then you'll lose focus

399
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:41,316
and they'll get ya...

400
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:42,650
I've got a
question for ya.

401
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,736
Yeah... What's up?

402
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:46,738
Is it true that you can meet
hot chicks over the internet?

403
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:47,905
Cause you know...

404
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:49,324
that's what I hear.

405
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:51,492
You can but only if you're
diligent about it-

406
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:54,162
the internet's a lot like
the real world that way.

407
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:55,455
I see...

408
00:16:55,455 --> 00:16:57,415
so I have to be diligent
if I wanna meet hot chicks...

409
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:58,791
now I get it.

410
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,543
That's it! I'm done...

411
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:03,212
I'm sure we'll get plenty
of new recruits now.

412
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:04,088
What do you think?

413
00:17:08,176 --> 00:17:09,510
I never gave you permission

414
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,762
to put my picture
on the internet!

415
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,180
That website's not
gonna recruit anyone

416
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,765
or get us hot chicks!

417
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:16,225
You've got mail!

418
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:18,186
Look I've already
got new mail...

419
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:20,188
And I just finished
updating the website...

420
00:17:20,188 --> 00:17:22,231
I'll show all of you
haters what's up.

421
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:24,317
Let's see... what've
we got here...

422
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:26,569
"How are you doing,
Commander Niijima?

423
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:29,113
I was just surfing the web
when I stumbled upon your page.

424
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:30,573
What a happy accident."

425
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:32,283
They even put a
little smiley face.

426
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:34,744
What... Come on, you've
gotta be kidding me?

427
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:36,454
I can't believe
someone sent an email

428
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:38,873
to Niijima's creepy
website- how weird!

429
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:40,166
Hey... is it a girl...

430
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,376
Well, Is it? !

431
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:44,128
"My name is Loki and I'm
a member of Ragnarok.

432
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:45,838
Perhaps you've
heard of us?"

433
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:47,382
So her name's Loki?

434
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:48,466
That's cute.

435
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:51,928
Let me reply, Loki is
a pretty cute name.

436
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:54,138
Wait. No way...

437
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:56,140
-Loki? !
-The Fourth Fist...

438
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,142
But I thought it
was a hot chick!

439
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:00,269
Oh no, now he's in
the chat room...

440
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:03,314
He asks, "Is Kenichi
Shirahama there?"

441
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,149
Yeah, he's here...

442
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:07,193
He says, "It's about
time we finish this.

443
00:18:07,193 --> 00:18:08,611
I'll be waiting for
you by the church

444
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:09,779
in the third district.

445
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:12,031
Show up alone."

446
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:13,157
Huh... This sounds like a trap-

447
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:16,619
I wouldn't go if I
were you, Kenichi.

448
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:18,246
It's an attachment.

449
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:31,968
Kenichi come back...

450
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:33,803
It's a trap... Let's
come up with a plan

451
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:35,888
and go after him together-

452
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:37,473
You with me, Ukita?

453
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:38,641
Hell yeah!

454
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:40,727
Whatever you do don't
lose track of Kenichi.

455
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,524
I finally found you.

456
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:47,608
Where have you been?

457
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:48,734
I was worried...

458
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:50,653
Are you ready to come
back to Ryozanpaku now-

459
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:52,238
the masters have been
waiting for you.

460
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:56,117
Kenichi wait!

461
00:18:56,117 --> 00:18:57,452
We just found out
Kenichi's sister

462
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:59,245
was kidnapped by Ragnarok.

463
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:01,456
What... Honoka was kidnapped? !

464
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:03,666
Damn it! How did
this happen? !

465
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,751
What the hell do they
want with Honoka? !

466
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:09,756
You know now that
I think about it,

467
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:13,301
I guess we were kinda
hard on the little guy.

468
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:17,054
We put him through
some intense training.

469
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:19,015
I know he's been gone for
quite a while but

470
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:21,601
I have faith that Kenichi
will return to Ryozanpaku

471
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:22,977
when he's ready.

472
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:25,521
I don't know what to do with
all this time on my hands...

473
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:26,939
Thanks for comin' to play
Pachinko with me though-

474
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:28,441
it helps pass the time-

475
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:30,485
I had no idea that you
were so good at it.

476
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:32,028
Well... neither did I-

477
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:33,362
it's the first time
I've played-

478
00:19:33,362 --> 00:19:34,614
but I got the hang
of it pretty quick.

479
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:35,823
Yeah...

480
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:37,617
I feel bad cause you
never gambled before

481
00:19:37,617 --> 00:19:40,161
and I brought you over to the
dark side outta sheer boredom...

482
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:41,496
Kenichi...

483
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:43,831
I wish you would just come
back to Ryozanpaku already.

484
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:47,043
Hold on. Is that him?

485
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:48,628
I'm impressed- it
seems as though

486
00:19:48,628 --> 00:19:50,254
he is keeping up
with his training.

487
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:52,006
I don't know- it doesn't
really look like

488
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:53,633
the kid's out for
a leisurely run.

489
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:54,800
Yeah, you're right...

490
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,010
He's running
with an urgency

491
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,386
that I've never seen before-

492
00:19:57,386 --> 00:19:59,013
something must
have happened.

493
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:00,848
I sense fire.

494
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:03,100
He's incredibly angry.

495
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,769
Wanna follow him?

496
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:06,312
Who knows? Might
be interesting.

497
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,483
I... can't... run anymore...

498
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:12,235
TaKAYda... wait.

499
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:14,737
I'm sorry man but I've
gotta keep up with Kenichi!

500
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:16,197
I've been trailing
him this whole time

501
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:19,075
but he's so fast he's getting
farther and farther ahead of me.

502
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:21,994
Is that...

503
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:23,788
Master Ko-et-soo-jee?

504
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:31,754
If he loses this fight
I'll tie him up

505
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:33,631
and drag him back
to the dojo.

506
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:36,300
Good idea- it sounds like
someone's been lonely

507
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,177
without their
disciple around.

508
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:39,595
C'mon! You feel the same!

509
00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:45,017
No wonder Kenichi's
so freakin' fast...

510
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:47,061
Just look at his
masters go...

511
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:55,695
I can't believe that
Alien-lookin' freak job

512
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:58,281
created a webpage for
the Shinpaku Alliance.

513
00:20:58,281 --> 00:21:00,324
He's got guts,
that's for sure.

514
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:02,285
So what now... You got in...

515
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:03,911
What're you
gonna do to it?

516
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:05,329
His security is weak

517
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:07,874
so we're gonna hack
into the damn thing.

518
00:21:07,874 --> 00:21:10,042
What the-? This is
harder than I expected.

519
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,377
Damn it. What's that mean?

520
00:21:11,377 --> 00:21:14,797
Dummy... You're supposed to
offer a lady tea!

521
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,135
Could ya at least
get me some water...

522
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:20,344
My throat's all
dry and scratchy

523
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:22,763
from screaming all day.

524
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:25,933
And, just where do you
think you're going, Hermit??

525
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:27,560
I'm gonna go get
the kid some water.

526
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,395
She doesn't need it- the
brat's not gonna die

527
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:31,063
from a scratchy throat...

528
00:21:31,063 --> 00:21:32,857
I suggest that you
go sit down now.

529
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,070
Stop it, Hermit!

530
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,534
You really don't want
do this, my friend-

531
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:46,996
remember I have orders from
the Great Sage Fists.

532
00:21:46,996 --> 00:21:48,789
If you know what's good
for ya you'll let me down.

533
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:56,839
My plan didn't work out the
way I thought it was gonna...

534
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:59,050
Thanks to you it
worked out even better.

535
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:02,011
So I'll thank you
by giving you

536
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:04,472
what you've wanted all
along- another fight...

537
00:22:04,472 --> 00:22:06,265
And this time
Kenichi Shirahama

538
00:22:06,265 --> 00:22:08,267
has no chance of winning.

539
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:10,227
Consider that an order
from the big man himself-

540
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:12,229
that means there'll
be no backing out...

541
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:13,689
You owe him big time Hermit

542
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:16,233
so you'd better not
go and betray him.

543
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:18,402
The Great Sage Fists
has put me in charge

544
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:20,154
so you answer to
me now, got it?

545
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:44,804
It's you...

546
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:49,684
Tell me where my
sister is, Hermit!

547
00:22:49,684 --> 00:23:24,093
[Music]

548
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:19,523
Damn you're naive.

549
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:21,400
Lemme give you a few words
of advice, Shirahama...

550
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,569
The only way you can
stay alive in this world

551
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:25,780
is by living a life
full of lies.

552
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,156
That's not true, Hermit!

553
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:28,741
I know better than that!

554
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:30,659
As long as you have the
heart to trust others

555
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,411
that's all you
need to live.

556
00:24:32,411 --> 00:24:33,704
"The heart to
trust others"?

557
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:35,956
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard!

558
00:24:35,956 --> 00:24:37,333
You idiot! Don't you see?

559
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,293
The truth is worth
absolutely nothing!

560
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:40,711
That's not true!

561
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:43,255
I'll show you how important
it is to trust others.

562
00:24:43,255 --> 00:24:45,674
Even if I have to use
my two fists to do it!

563
00:24:45,674 --> 00:24:47,176
Prepare yourself, Hermit!
