[Music]

2
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:42,975
Hey, would ya cut it out?

3
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:45,185
There's no reason for
you to be following me.

4
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:47,145
I promise we're not
following you...

5
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:48,730
we just happen to have the
same route home, that's all.

6
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,648
He's right.

7
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:52,776
What's up, Tanimoto?

8
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:54,653
We'll see you in
class tomorrow, right?

9
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:56,280
Yep... First thing
tomorrow morning!

10
00:01:58,198 --> 00:01:59,408
Dontcha get tired of having

11
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:01,952
to switch between your
different personalities...? Jeez

12
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:04,162
I can't even tell which one
is the real you anymore

13
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:05,664
Hermit or Tanimoto.

14
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:07,541
Why dontcha mind
your own business.

15
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,876
Instead of bugging me

16
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:10,919
you should be worrying
about what's coming.

17
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,045
Don't start getting cocky

18
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,506
just because you beat
some Ragnarok guys.

19
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:15,674
What do you mean?
I'm not cocky!

20
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:18,010
What makes you say that?

21
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,845
You may have defeated the
others relatively easily

22
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:21,096
but the top three fists

23
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:23,098
are gonna be harder to
beat than you can imagine.

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,019
They even, have a special
nickname they go by...

25
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,020
they're the "Three of Cards"-

26
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,564
the strongest members
of Ragnarok.

27
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:33,025
Fighters were amazed
by their strength.

28
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:35,068
So the "Three of Cards"
began training others

29
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:38,071
and that is how
Ragnarok was formed.

30
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:41,283
They use their power to invoke
fear in their opponents.

31
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:43,994
All three are incredible
fighters in top condition.

32
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,832
They're the main reason I
decided to join Ragnarok...

33
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:49,917
You see...

34
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:51,418
I wanted to learn how to
gain followers the way

35
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:53,003
that they were able to.

36
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:55,380
They're true leaders and
they're incredibly smart.

37
00:02:57,215 --> 00:02:58,508
But still...

38
00:02:58,508 --> 00:02:59,927
If ya had to go up
against them in a fight

39
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:01,720
you'd have a chance
of winning...

40
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,722
They can't be that tough.

41
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:04,806
They are...

42
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:07,351
I'm pretty sure I'd lose.

43
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:09,978
Especially against the
First Fist, Odin...

44
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:12,272
I've never been able
to beat that guy...

45
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:13,565
Some say...

46
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:15,651
that he was trained by the
Great Sage of Fists himself.

47
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:17,945
Hold on...

48
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:19,863
you mean... the
guy who saved you

49
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:21,823
when you were a kid is
the First Fist's master?

50
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,956
Maybe you can take him...

51
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:33,001
After all, you've got plenty of
masters on your side, don't you?

52
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:34,544
Well, yeah...

53
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,632
But I don't know how much
they'll help against him.

54
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:42,052
Well, then you better
start training harder...

55
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:43,679
Every second you
waste talking to me

56
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,138
the Three of Cards
are out there

57
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:46,974
honing their skills
and getting stronger.

58
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:50,268
Jeez...

59
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:52,854
You have no idea how good
you have it Shirahama.

60
00:03:52,854 --> 00:03:54,189
It pisses me off.

61
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:00,696
He may be tough on the
outside but he's kinda nice...

62
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:02,155
I'm glad he was
able to warn you

63
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:03,615
before you had to face them.

64
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:06,618
You know...

65
00:04:06,618 --> 00:04:07,828
It scares me that
Tanimoto said

66
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:09,621
he wouldn't be
able to beat them.

67
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:12,916
So they're the
Three of Cards, huh?

68
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,882
It's gone!

69
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:23,135
I can't find my
badge anywhere!

70
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:24,511
And I always try
to keep it on

71
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:26,263
the collar of my
favorite shirt!

72
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:29,474
Master Sakaki...!

73
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:31,351
Have you seen my
badge anywhere?

74
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:34,271
What...? You talkin' about that
yin yang thing-a-ma-bob...?

75
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:35,397
Haven't seen it.

76
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:37,149
I don't understand...

77
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:38,525
Where could it be?

78
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,670
Hey, Kenichi!

79
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:01,798
Are you ready
to go shopping?

80
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:11,099
Found it...

81
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:11,850
Look.

82
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:15,520
Damn it, Tochumaru!

83
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,689
What the hell do you think
you're doing with my badge?!

84
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:19,775
Hey... Give it
back to Kenichi...

85
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:20,776
Now.

86
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:23,070
Let go you little rodent!

87
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,405
He gets like this whenever
he really wants something.

88
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:29,576
Hey Tochumaru!

89
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:32,287
What if we trade that
badge for a new bike?

90
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,538
What do you think?

91
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:35,207
I made it just for you.

92
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:38,293
You can even change gears just
like on a full size bicycle.

93
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:51,098
Well... I'm glad he
wasn't too upset.

94
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:52,516
You've sure hung
on to that badge

95
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:53,850
for a long time, Kenichi...

96
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,186
Is it special?

97
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:57,562
Uh... yeah...

98
00:05:57,562 --> 00:05:58,855
To be honest...

99
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:00,524
I kinda forgot why it
was so special to me

100
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:03,026
but it's special
nonetheless...

101
00:06:03,026 --> 00:06:04,653
I just wish I could
remember why, you know?

102
00:06:07,155 --> 00:06:08,573
That's why you
don't remember.

103
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:09,991
It was when you
were 6 years old.

104
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:10,867
No wonder.

105
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:12,702
It's hard to remember
that far back.

106
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:16,331
The only thing I can remember

107
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:18,750
is that I traded somebody
a cat badge for this one.

108
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:22,003
You don't remember that much

109
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:23,880
about your childhood
either, do you...?

110
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,757
Do you remember
anything that far back?

111
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:27,050
Kinda... yeah...

112
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:33,431
Anyone else want
to challenge me?!

113
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:35,851
I'll take you all on...!

114
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:40,564
Man, woman, child,
even wild animals!

115
00:06:40,564 --> 00:06:42,649
I guess you could say I
have selective memory

116
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:43,984
when it comes
to my childhood.

117
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:46,695
But still...

118
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:48,738
I have lots of
happy memories...

119
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:52,325
time spent with my grandfather
that was relatively peaceful...

120
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:55,996
and I won't ever
forget those moments.

121
00:06:55,996 --> 00:06:58,081
Yeah...? Why don't you
tell me about 'em...?

122
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:59,583
I'd love to hear more about
what your childhood

123
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,001
with the elder was like.

124
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:03,086
Nope... My little secret.

125
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:07,048
What...? But that just
makes me more curious, Miu!

126
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,009
I just realized
something weird...

127
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:10,719
Remember when the
First Fist showed up?

128
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:12,679
He acted like he
knew me somehow...

129
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,101
Very soon I will finally be able
to make good on that promise

130
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:20,061
we made so many years ago...

131
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:25,483
A promise...? But what's
he talking about...?

132
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:26,860
I can't remember...

133
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,612
Did I promise him
something...?

134
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:30,363
There. You see, I got nothing.

135
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:32,407
My childhood memories
are so fuzzy-

136
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:34,868
maybe I did know
him a long time ago.

137
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:36,203
Oh and another thing...

138
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:37,704
He seemed to be
really interested

139
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:39,748
in my badge for some
reason, didn't he?

140
00:07:39,748 --> 00:07:41,166
I didn't even
think about it...

141
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,501
What if he's the person I
traded the cat badge with

142
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:44,711
to get this yin yang?!

143
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:47,923
If you can't
remember something

144
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:49,508
you should trace
your steps...

145
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:51,551
So maybe we should go
see if the general store

146
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,220
where you got the badge
is still open.

147
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,554
Come on, Kenichi.

148
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:56,598
I mean, it's worth a
try, dontcha think?

149
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:58,266
The general store...?

150
00:07:58,266 --> 00:08:01,102
What...?! You mean, go back
to the town I grew up in.

151
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:02,479
Now?

152
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,022
It's been such a long
time the place probably

153
00:08:04,022 --> 00:08:05,774
isn't there anymore.

154
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:07,150
We might as well
check it out...

155
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,568
I'll go with you...

156
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:10,195
It'll be easier for
you to remember

157
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:12,239
if you go back to
where it all happened.

158
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:13,782
Um... okay.

159
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:18,370
We'll come by and pick
these up on our way back.

160
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,957
Wait... you've had the
key this whole time?

161
00:08:21,957 --> 00:08:23,208
Well of course...

162
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,210
What if we had gotten jumped
while we were shopping?

163
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,753
I would need your help!

164
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:30,340
So you've... always
had them... great.

165
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,967
But I couldn't tell you

166
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,594
cause then you'd make me take
them off instead of training.

167
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:38,431
Yeah... Whatever you say, Miu.

168
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:40,058
Forget about that we've
got more important things

169
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:41,351
to think about
right now...

170
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:42,978
Lets go find that
general store!

171
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:52,095
This place is so urban now.

172
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:54,180
It didn't look anything
like this when I lived here.

173
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,682
Yeah, it looks
totally different.

174
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:58,100
Oh, uh...

175
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,811
After grandfather and
I traveled the globe

176
00:08:59,811 --> 00:09:01,896
we ended up here for
a little while...

177
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:03,523
In fact, I used to
play in a park

178
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:06,192
that's not too far
from where we are now.

179
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:08,945
Weird... You guys used
to live here too...?

180
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:10,279
What a small world.

181
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:14,659
Let's see...

182
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,911
I think that it may
be over this way.

183
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:26,295
Hey that house!

184
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,882
I know this place.

185
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:32,343
I used to walk past
this house all the time.

186
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:33,636
Oh wow...

187
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:36,305
Well, I'm glad to see the
town hasn't completely changed.

188
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:40,351
I almost feels like I've just
gone back in time, you know?

189
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:56,284
Just being here brings
back so many old memories.

190
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:57,577
I used to climb
on that fence

191
00:09:57,577 --> 00:10:00,371
and watch the
trains pass by.

192
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:01,622
Yeah, I know...!

193
00:10:01,622 --> 00:10:03,958
I used to climb to the top
of that tree over there...

194
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,459
I trained my eyes

195
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:08,838
to be able to read the
advertisements inside the train.

196
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:10,256
And I remember
I got in trouble

197
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:12,508
for drawing all
over that wall.

198
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:13,926
That telephone pole!

199
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:16,679
Grandfather pushed it
down during my training.

200
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,097
I remember it all...

201
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:20,182
That happened the same day we
took on a gang of delinquents

202
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:21,601
who were causing
trouble in the area

203
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,311
and chased them out of town.

204
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:25,062
I almost feel
sorry for her.

205
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:27,940
She's got the weirdest
childhood memories.

206
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,483
Hold on a second...

207
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:31,152
I just realized all I
can remember are things

208
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,904
that happened during
my training.

209
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:36,908
Yeah, but that's better
than nothing, right?

210
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:38,576
I mean look at me and
my random memories-

211
00:10:38,576 --> 00:10:40,703
it's pretty pathetic,
dontcha think...?

212
00:10:40,703 --> 00:10:42,246
I wish I could
remember more.

213
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:46,167
That park...

214
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:50,671
I recognize it...!

215
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:52,632
I used to hang out
here all the time!

216
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:55,593
C'mon Miu!

217
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:00,514
The general store's
just past this park.

218
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:06,771
This was the short cut I
used to take to get there!

219
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:07,939
There it is!

220
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,106
Hurry up!

221
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:16,405
I can't believe its still
here after all these years.

222
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:17,573
It's funny...

223
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:19,533
This place doesn't seem
to have changed at all.

224
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:26,916
Hey Kenichi?

225
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,751
This store... I
guess you could say

226
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:31,879
it has a lot of sentimental
value to me too...

227
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,298
I have a very special
memory of this place.

228
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:44,850
Is that...?

229
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,185
When I was a little girl...

230
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:47,728
I came to this
general store

231
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:49,188
and bought a
yin-yang badge

232
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:54,527
which I traded with
someone for this cat badge.

233
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:55,861
Oh yeah!

234
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:57,530
I remember now!

235
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,323
There was this little
girl that was upset

236
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:01,701
because she didn't
get the right badge.

237
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:02,785
I had the one she wanted

238
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:05,454
so I traded it with her
for the one she got...

239
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:06,789
The same one I wear now.

240
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:12,294
Oh, thank you!

241
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:14,171
But... how'd you
figure out it was me?

242
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:16,132
I mean, it could've
been anybody.

243
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:18,301
I recognized you
the day we met...

244
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:20,720
You really haven't changed
all that much, Kenichi.

245
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,054
Uh...

246
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:26,142
the sky?

247
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:30,229
Oh no!

248
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,356
Oh my gosh...!
I'm so sorry!

249
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:34,900
You came outta nowhere.

250
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,610
Ah man, all my books.

251
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,320
Here, let me help you.

252
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:42,241
No, its fine, I'm good.

253
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:43,743
But thanks anyway.

254
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:44,702
I appreciate it.

255
00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:49,165
But I wasn't
completely sure

256
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:51,083
until I asked
about your badge...

257
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,335
Then when you told me you
traded a cat badge for it,

258
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:54,795
I knew.

259
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:57,506
You know that represents the
yin and the yang, right...?

260
00:12:57,506 --> 00:13:00,176
They're part of the ancient
Taoist philosophy in China.

261
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:02,511
Oh... I always
wondered what it was.

262
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:05,014
I picked it up at a candy
store a long time ago-

263
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:07,016
I traded a kitty
pin for it.

264
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:08,517
I was just a little
kid back then,

265
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:10,436
so I don't remember
much about it...

266
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:12,605
But I really haven't
taken it off since then.

267
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:15,608
And... that's when I knew
for sure that it was you!

268
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:17,610
You've known all
this time...?

269
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,196
But why didn't you
tell me sooner?

270
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:21,322
My, my...

271
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:23,908
Certainly didn't
expect to see you here.

272
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:25,159
No... the First Fist!

273
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:29,246
Hey...

274
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:30,623
It's been quite
a long time...

275
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:31,832
Kenichi.

276
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:51,227
I wondered when you were going
to come back here to visit.

277
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:52,978
You... How did you
know we were here?

278
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:54,688
Yeah...

279
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:57,191
There's no need
to get so angry...

280
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:59,944
I just thought that maybe
you'd like to reminisce...

281
00:13:59,944 --> 00:14:02,029
Why don't we drop
the rivalry for now?

282
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:07,576
It's amazing...

283
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:09,912
Kenichi's become
so powerful...

284
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:12,164
It must be hard for
him to hold back.

285
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:13,707
He's been through
hellish training

286
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:16,544
and all of it to beat the person
standing in front of him now.

287
00:14:20,297 --> 00:14:21,382
Calm down...

288
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,967
I didn't come
here to fight you-

289
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:24,760
I'm not even wearing
my Ragnarok glove-

290
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,720
I just came to talk to you.

291
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,638
To talk to me?

292
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,432
Hey Kenichi...

293
00:14:30,432 --> 00:14:32,268
Dontcha think you should
be a little more careful...

294
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:33,727
Don't take your
guard down yet-

295
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,855
he's the leader of the
group who kidnapped Honoka.

296
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:37,273
True... but still...

297
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:39,358
he's not the one who did
the actual kidnapping

298
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:40,860
so I'm hoping that
he'll be reasonable

299
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,236
if we try to talk to him.

300
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:44,155
Can't believe
it's still here...

301
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:47,199
This place hasn't changed
at all since we were kids...

302
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,076
Not only the store itself
but also the little old lady

303
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:51,162
that works behind
the counter...

304
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:53,789
She doesn't look any different
than she did ten years ago.

305
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,500
Makes you wonder if she's
some kinda demon or something.

306
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,127
I gotta admit she's
pretty scary looking-

307
00:14:58,127 --> 00:14:59,253
it wouldn't surprise me.

308
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:03,841
Uh...

309
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:07,094
Tell me, how are your
parents doing these days?

310
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:08,596
They're doing just great!

311
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:09,763
Thanks for asking.

312
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:10,723
Your dad...

313
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:12,892
does he still go
clay pigeon shooting?

314
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:14,143
Yeah, he does...

315
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:16,312
In fact he won an
award not too long ago.

316
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,191
I remember he was
always a good shot.

317
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:21,734
Yeah... Still is!

318
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:25,321
Who the hell is this guy?!

319
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:32,077
I can tell Kenichi doesn't
remember him at all.

320
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:34,163
You know, I really had no
idea that it was you...

321
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:35,414
well, that is...

322
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:38,709
Until I saw your badge.

323
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:42,296
I'm so glad you remembered
our promise, Kenichi.

324
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:43,297
Yeah...

325
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:44,381
sure...

326
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:45,799
promise... right.

327
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,885
I think the park across the
street would be perfect,

328
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:49,637
don't you...?

329
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:50,763
Shall we get started?

330
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:51,764
Hey, uh...

331
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:52,765
What're we doing?

332
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:55,226
You mean...

333
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:57,519
You don't remember?!

334
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:01,440
Do you even remember
what my name is?!

335
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,609
I'm really sorry but
it slipped my mind!

336
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:04,610
I knew it.

337
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,778
He forgot.

338
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:12,933
I want this whole
box right now!

339
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,935
Thank you... your change...

340
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:16,603
is three million yen.

341
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:18,021
Um...

342
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:19,272
uh...

343
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,697
Hey...! I recognize the
way you opened that snack!

344
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:36,122
Don't tell me you're...
Ryuto Asamiya?!

345
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:38,291
So now you remember me...

346
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,835
I see you're just as slow
as you ever were, huh?

347
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:42,128
I can't believe this!

348
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:43,922
It's been like
10 years, right!

349
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:45,507
How are ya?!

350
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:47,968
I think we've already
covered all this, haven't we?

351
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:50,220
You were the only kid that
was shorter than me growing up

352
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,429
so I never would
have expected you

353
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:53,431
to end up being so
tall, you know...?

354
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:54,766
You sure had me fooled.

355
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:57,727
You haven't changed
a bit, Kenichi.

356
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:04,025
So... do you remember the
promise we made back in the day?

357
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:06,987
I remember sitting on this
bench all day and drinking soda.

358
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:11,324
All my memories are
coming back now...

359
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:16,329
What'd you get...?
C'mon, show it to me!

360
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,831
There was that one time

361
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:20,208
when you got some kind of girly
cat badge out of the machine...

362
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:23,420
Do you want it?
You like cats, dontcha?

363
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,379
No.

364
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:27,173
It'd be a waste
to throw it away.

365
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:29,342
That's when you forced me
to take your stupid badge.

366
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:30,885
What...?!
That didn't happen...?!

367
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,762
You told me you
wanted the cat badge!

368
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:36,141
No... Don't think so.

369
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:38,601
That's when this strange
little girl came up to me.

370
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:44,232
'Scuse me...

371
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:47,235
She asked us how to use one of
those capsule toy machines...

372
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:50,238
And with one coin...

373
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:51,573
her dreams were shattered.

374
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:54,409
I don't want this big ole,
ugly yin-yang badge!

375
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:56,286
I wanted a cute
kitty cat badge!

376
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:58,288
What am I supposed
to do with this?!

377
00:17:58,288 --> 00:18:00,498
I remember I had
to beg grandfather

378
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,542
for the coin to
use that machine.

379
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:04,502
I kinda threw a
temper tantrum.

380
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:09,132
Grandpa please...!
I wanna badge!

381
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:10,300
Okay...

382
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:14,679
She was so sad.

383
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:17,849
Hey, um...

384
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:19,976
I was wondering...

385
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:21,353
Do you want this cat badge?

386
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:26,608
I don't really want it
cause it's a little girly

387
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:28,693
and since you're a girl I
think that you should have it.

388
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:32,280
Really?

389
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,367
But my grandpa will
get mad at me...

390
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,160
Cause you're a stranger...

391
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,746
I can't take
things from you.

392
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:40,997
We'll trade...!

393
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:44,376
That way he can't get
mad at you, right?

394
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:46,836
Please...? I think your
badge is much cooler

395
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:48,755
and it's better for a boy.

396
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:49,923
You think so...?!

397
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:51,383
You really wanna trade?!

398
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:57,472
Thank you so much!

399
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:02,143
What a great day-

400
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:04,145
I can't remember anything
after that though.

401
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:06,189
Something very important
happened after that...!

402
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:08,608
Drink more soda- maybe
it'll help jog your memory!

403
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:11,903
This is ridiculous.

404
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:17,826
Oh yeah...! After we traded
something scary happened...!

405
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,246
I tried so hard to
forget all these years...

406
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:24,833
Just thinking about it
totally freaks me out.

407
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,001
Three big, scary guys
came into the store

408
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:29,295
and started harassing
the old lady.

409
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:32,090
What's wrong ya can't
hear us, old bag?

410
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,216
Ryuto...

411
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:34,717
I think we should
get outta here.

412
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:37,220
Leave her alone!

413
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:46,187
You guys shouldn't
pick on old ladies!

414
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:49,774
Right...

415
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:52,193
I remember how that girl
stood up to those guys.

416
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:53,403
Yeah...

417
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:55,488
I was so scared I
kept my eyes closed.

418
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:57,866
Jeez... what a wuss.

419
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:59,743
And I still remember
her moves...

420
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:00,952
She was amazing.

421
00:20:04,414 --> 00:20:06,291
She was so
incredibly graceful

422
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,585
she floated like a
feather in the sky...

423
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:11,254
Before I knew it
everything was over...

424
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:12,714
and the little
girl was gone-

425
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:14,215
never to be seen again.

426
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:16,342
That's right...!
I remember...!

427
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:18,094
That's when we made
the promise...!

428
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:19,512
We promised to
train super hard

429
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:22,098
so that we would be as strong
as that mystery girl one day!

430
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:24,267
Now, I remember
everything...

431
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:25,810
So much happened that day-

432
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,854
I always knew that this
badge was important to me

433
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:31,065
but I could never
figure out exactly why.

434
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:32,942
Oh Ryuto, I almost forgot...

435
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:35,487
Let me introduce you to someone
I think you'll wanna meet.

436
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:38,615
Ta-da!

437
00:20:38,615 --> 00:20:41,201
This is the girl I traded
badges with way back when.

438
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:43,244
I'd like you to
meet Miu Furinji.

439
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:47,499
What a crazy
coincidence, huh...?

440
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:48,666
And to think we've
both been living

441
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,293
at the same dojo
all this time!

442
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:06,309
So... now I get it.

443
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:08,686
Do you think you could clarify
something for me, Kenichi?

444
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:11,689
I want you to tell me...

445
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:14,651
what martial arts
means to you.

446
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:15,860
What's with you
all of a sudden?

447
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,153
Just answer me!

448
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:19,989
Well, uh...

449
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:22,242
I don't know...

450
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:23,993
When it comes
down to it...

451
00:21:23,993 --> 00:21:25,537
I guess I wanna
be able to fight

452
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:28,706
for justice and peace
in the world, you know?

453
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:31,251
You're just as hypocritical
as you were then...

454
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:32,752
It's sad that you
haven't learned anything

455
00:21:32,752 --> 00:21:34,587
after ten years.

456
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:36,172
Wait a second, Ryuto...

457
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:38,424
If you really are the
leader of Ragnarok...

458
00:21:38,424 --> 00:21:39,759
then I have to ask you...

459
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,511
Why won't you stop
the meaningless fights

460
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:43,471
between Ragnarok and
the Shinpaku Alliance?

461
00:21:45,098 --> 00:21:47,141
Meaningless fights...?

462
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:51,229
You just don't get it,
do you Kenichi?

463
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:52,272
There's no such thing

464
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:53,982
as a meaningless
fight in martial arts

465
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:55,733
every fight has meaning!

466
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:57,569
Whenever you beat
a new opponent...

467
00:21:57,569 --> 00:21:59,988
you get one step closer
to the ultimate power

468
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:01,614
that every fighter dreams of!

469
00:22:01,614 --> 00:22:02,782
You've dreamt of it-

470
00:22:02,782 --> 00:22:04,742
you made the same
promise I did!

471
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:10,081
I'll ask you this...

472
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:11,499
one more time...

473
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:15,545
Take responsibility as the
First Fist of Ragnarok.

474
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:18,172
Stop your meaningless fights
with the Shinpaku Alliance.

475
00:22:20,383 --> 00:22:23,136
I told you there's no such
thing as a meaningless fight.

476
00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:26,139
Very well...

477
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:27,932
I'll take responsibility...

478
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,228
And I'll answer you as
the First Fist, Odin.

479
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:38,359
We'll continue to fight...

480
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:40,778
And I will carry out the
real promise we made that day

481
00:22:40,778 --> 00:22:42,155
which you seem
to have forgotten.

482
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:46,534
The real promise?

483
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:47,535
What does he mean?

484
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:53,291
[Music]

485
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:19,127
What a waste.

486
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:21,713
To think that the best martial
arts masters in the world

487
00:24:21,713 --> 00:24:23,589
would choose you
as their disciple.

488
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,842
They've squandered their
efforts on a weakling.

489
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:27,885
What'd you say?
Wanna say it to my face?!

490
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,722
It's time to bring out your
killer instinct, Kenichi.

491
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:33,516
Otherwise you'll never be
able to defeat my Seikuuken.

492
00:24:33,516 --> 00:24:35,768
What the hell is that?!

493
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:37,603
Wow, you think
you can defeat me

494
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:40,189
and you don't even know
anything about Seikuuken?!

495
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,567
This fight'll be over
before it begins.

496
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:45,695
Shut up! Your stupid Say-coo-key
or whatever can't save you

497
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:47,113
when I kick your ass!
