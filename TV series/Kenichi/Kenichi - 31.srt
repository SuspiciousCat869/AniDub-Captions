1
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:12,554
[Music]

2
00:01:41,178 --> 00:01:42,554
Patience...

3
00:01:42,554 --> 00:01:44,765
We'll wait for
our disciple...

4
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:48,477
That's our responsibility
as masters.

5
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:50,729
What do you all think
of Kenichi's progress?

6
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,731
He's been training with
us for a while now

7
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:54,650
but he still seems
pretty slow.

8
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,734
Well, it's not as though

9
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:58,237
he really had any
talent to begin with.

10
00:01:58,237 --> 00:02:01,114
There's nothing more we
can do at this point.

11
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:02,616
We've taught him
everything we can.

12
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,829
Now it's all up
to Kenichi...

13
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:12,626
He will progress if
he can learn to use

14
00:02:12,626 --> 00:02:15,003
what we've taught
him in battle.

15
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:16,588
I have to try it...!

16
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:17,881
Here we go!

17
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,344
Pay attention to what
happens with your other arm!

18
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:23,595
When you use a karate punch

19
00:02:23,595 --> 00:02:25,055
it should feel
like your arms

20
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:26,765
are connected to a
pulley behind you.

21
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:27,975
You got it, kid?

22
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:32,145
In kenpo you wanna draw
out your strength

23
00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:35,065
but you also want your arms to
be more extended and relaxed.

24
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:37,484
Don't hold yourself
back- let your arms fly!

25
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:41,363
A Judo chop uses
the same physics

26
00:02:41,363 --> 00:02:43,448
as a downward sword slash.

27
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:45,117
You're basically
challenging the balance

28
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:47,244
of a four sided object.

29
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:49,371
You use your body to
chop your opponent.

30
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:52,332
Kenichi...!

31
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:54,459
Muay Thai is not
only a sport...

32
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:55,878
There have been many
soldiers back home

33
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:57,254
who have used it
on the battlefield

34
00:02:57,254 --> 00:02:58,547
fighting for their lives...

35
00:02:58,547 --> 00:02:59,881
Apachai's master told him

36
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:02,217
you must punch with
all your strength...!

37
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:04,344
Make your punch go
through your opponent!

38
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,683
I couldn't dodge it...!

39
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:11,268
He keeps punching!

40
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:13,979
How many beats are
in this one punch?!

41
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:15,272
I can't count the beats.

42
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:16,815
I can't find the rhythm...

43
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:17,649
No...

44
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:20,694
There is no rhythm!

45
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:24,990
That punch...

46
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:29,536
That was quite an
excellent punch.

47
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:31,622
The way you used the
force of gravity

48
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:33,165
to strengthen it like that...

49
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:34,750
I lost.

50
00:03:38,712 --> 00:03:40,088
Impossible!

51
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:42,174
How could he have
defeated Siegfried?

52
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:45,135
Damn...!I can't wait to
get my hands on that punk.

53
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:46,720
He ruined the
perfect plan.

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,765
Oh...?I'm sorry, Loki...?

55
00:03:49,765 --> 00:03:51,433
Things not going your way?

56
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:54,311
Did you underestimate
your enemy...?

57
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:57,230
So who is this formidable
opponent of yours?

58
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,899
Kenichi Shirahama.

59
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:12,537
Kenichi Shirahama...?

60
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,540
Kenichi...

61
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,417
Don't tell me it's him...

62
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,603
Ow... that hurt.

63
00:04:37,604 --> 00:04:39,606
So you think that because
you beat Siegfried

64
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:40,982
you'll be able to beat me...?

65
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:41,984
I'm sorry Kenichi

66
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:43,610
but you should know
better than that by now.

67
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,903
What's wrong with me...?!

68
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:46,321
I can't beat you.

69
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:47,906
It seems like no matter
how hard I train

70
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:49,574
I can never catch
up with you...!

71
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:52,077
All that hard work
and for nothin'!

72
00:04:55,414 --> 00:04:56,456
Don't hurt me.

73
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,917
Sorry Honoka.

74
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,377
I didn't mean to...

75
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:02,212
I was just in
sparring mode.

76
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:04,047
Well, don't
bully my brother.

77
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:05,382
It was practice...!

78
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:07,634
Honoka... stop it.

79
00:05:07,634 --> 00:05:08,969
Go away, big boobs!

80
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:10,762
Um... Kenichi...?

81
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:12,389
Why don't we call it a day.

82
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:16,685
Don't worry, I got
her outta here...!

83
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:19,312
I'll do anything to
protect my big brother!

84
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:21,273
I asked you to leave me
alone while I'm training.

85
00:05:21,273 --> 00:05:22,983
Right?

86
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:25,193
Apachai would ya please keep a
close eye on her from now on?

87
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:27,487
Quit treating me
like a little kid!

88
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:28,572
Oh I sorry...

89
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:31,241
Apachai was busy concentrating
on his next move.

90
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,582
And that is the
double palm.

91
00:05:38,582 --> 00:05:40,834
It lets you break down
your opponent's defenses

92
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,544
while attacking at
the same time...

93
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:44,212
Now... I think it's about time

94
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:45,881
we taught you
this technique.

95
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:48,091
Hello...?Are
you listening?

96
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,177
Miu beat me again today.

97
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:51,678
She's so strong...

98
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:52,637
Ooh...

99
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:53,930
I guess I'm just
not cut out

100
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,807
for all this martial
arts business.

101
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:56,933
I'm no good at it.

102
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:58,685
I'm a big ole loser.

103
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:01,188
I'll never become a master...

104
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:03,356
Kenichi... What is it?

105
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:05,650
So you're worried

106
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,819
that since you don't have
the natural talent-

107
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:09,279
no matter how
hard you train

108
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,281
you'll never be
able to beat Miu.

109
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:12,449
I'm starting to think that

110
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,743
my win against the
Fifth Fist was a fluke...

111
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:17,496
I guess I got
lucky that day.

112
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:19,039
I'm just a regular guy.

113
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,457
No matter how hard I train

114
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:23,418
I can never catch up to someone
who trains just as hard

115
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,253
but also has a
natural talent.

116
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:31,426
Apa...

117
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:34,054
Aa-pa-pa...

118
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:35,639
My goodness...

119
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,058
I've never heard such a
heavy sigh from you, Apachai.

120
00:06:38,058 --> 00:06:39,392
He's down 'cause he
hasn't been able

121
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:41,269
to beat Kenichi's
little sister...

122
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,355
She wins every game
that they play.

123
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:44,815
How 'bout this, Apa...

124
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:46,900
-why don't you and I play?
-Really?

125
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,318
You go first...

126
00:06:48,318 --> 00:06:49,694
You might learn
a thing or two.

127
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:54,407
Hey wait... What about your
terribly depressed disciple?

128
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:05,544
I lost.

129
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:08,255
Sakaki that was easy...!

130
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:10,340
I'm sorry but... you suck...

131
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,926
Kensei... can you
come play with me?

132
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:16,054
Me...? But I'm busy trying
to cheer up Kenichi.

133
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:17,347
Oh well...

134
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:18,723
I guess one game.

135
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:23,687
Are you guys good at
anything besides fighting?

136
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:24,813
Apa?

137
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:27,732
Master Koetsuji,

138
00:07:27,732 --> 00:07:30,151
you said you're a pro at
both Shogi and Go, right?

139
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:32,195
And I've never lost at
a game of Othello...

140
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:34,239
I'll play against you...

141
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,907
But don't be
upset when I win.

142
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:39,536
Damn Akisame...

143
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:40,620
That game was so close

144
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,122
I was startin' to
get a little worried.

145
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:43,540
Whoa...! Crazy...!

146
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,418
He beat Apachai but
only by a single point!

147
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:49,087
Yeah...

148
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:50,672
And I wasn't holding back.

149
00:07:50,672 --> 00:07:51,840
What'd you say?

150
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,883
Seriously?

151
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:54,301
Aa-pa-pa-pa...

152
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:56,595
I realized something
during that game...

153
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:59,306
It's not that we are
becoming weak as players...

154
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:02,309
It's that Apachai's skills
are growing exponentially.

155
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,315
It makes sense.

156
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:10,400
He plays the
game everyday...

157
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,444
Even when Honoka's not here...

158
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:14,529
he keeps playing... alone.

159
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:22,537
I guess Honoka's
not coming today.

160
00:08:22,537 --> 00:08:25,498
Oh well, Apachai will
play against himself.

161
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,460
He's played with that
Othello set so much

162
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,005
that the pieces have started
to wear away in the center.

163
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:38,094
They keep getting
thinner and thinner...

164
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:39,346
Why didn't you tell us...?

165
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:40,680
We'd get you a new one.

166
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:53,068
Master... I'm ready
to learn it...

167
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,319
the double palm...

168
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:56,112
do you mind showing
me one more time?

169
00:08:56,112 --> 00:08:59,157
What...? You
wanna do it now?

170
00:08:59,157 --> 00:09:01,034
You must remember,
Kenichi...

171
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:02,744
Miu is always training...

172
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:04,579
Even while you were
moping around here.

173
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:12,128
I'm gonna catch up...

174
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:14,381
I know I can do it if I
don't waste anymore time.

175
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:19,135
You're not the only
aspiring martial artist...

176
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:20,929
There are others who have
felt the same pressure

177
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:22,222
you feel now.

178
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:23,723
The opponents you
are about to face

179
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:25,308
or will face in the future...

180
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,018
They've been in
your position...

181
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:28,645
They're in the midst
of their own training

182
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:31,273
and they've had to work
just as hard as you have.

183
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:33,024
You're right...!
I'm gonna train so hard

184
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:34,985
that I break
through the floor!

185
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:35,986
And I won't give up...!

186
00:09:35,986 --> 00:09:37,654
Not until that happens!

187
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:55,964
Hold on a second.

188
00:09:55,964 --> 00:09:57,382
I don't get it.

189
00:09:57,382 --> 00:09:59,718
If Apachai is such a
great Othello player

190
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:02,178
then how come he's constantly
losing to Honoka?

191
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:05,348
Don't tell me she's better
than Master Koetsuji!

192
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:07,100
Well, you don't
bully my brother.

193
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,351
It was practice...

194
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:16,234
Akisame, it's
time for dinner!

195
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:19,571
Right... I'll be there
in just a few minutes.

196
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:20,989
I have to practice.

197
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:41,179
That all ya got?

198
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:47,936
I've had a slight change
of heart, Valkyrie...

199
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,771
I'll go ahead and
lift your ban today.

200
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:50,772
Watching your
team's defeat

201
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:53,024
was punishment
enough on its own.

202
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:55,360
Yes... I greatly
appreciate it...

203
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,903
Thank you, Odin.

204
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:58,405
You know...
I never thought

205
00:10:58,405 --> 00:11:01,241
one of the Eight Fists would
lose to a single person...

206
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:03,952
I'm sure Siegfried'll be
outta commission for a while.

207
00:11:03,952 --> 00:11:05,579
Shinpaku Alliance...

208
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,081
I can't wait to
return the favor...

209
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:11,418
I'm dyin' to get my hands
on Kenichi Shirahama.

210
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:16,548
If the leader of the
Shinpaku Alliance

211
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:19,968
really is the same
Kenichi Shirahama...

212
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:22,095
then I can finally fulfill
the promise I made

213
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:23,847
when we exchanged emblems.

214
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:29,352
I win by a landslide!

215
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:32,272
Are ya gonna take me on as one
of the Eight Fists or what...?

216
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:33,398
Well...?

217
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:35,567
What do you think?

218
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:38,236
So... what number are
ya gonna give me...?

219
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:39,779
Why don't you guys just
make me a replacement

220
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,031
for that idiot, Hermit?

221
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:44,451
Listen punk...

222
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:46,036
You're way outta
your league here.

223
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:48,455
Oh yeah...?

224
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:50,915
Who do you think you are talkin'
to me like that?!

225
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:58,840
No way.

226
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:03,386
Quite an entrance...

227
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:09,976
Welcome back...

228
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,353
good to see you again...

229
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:14,356
Hermit.

230
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:33,083
None of you will touch
Kenichi Shirahama.

231
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,419
I will be the
one to kill him.

232
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:38,672
I'm a little sad you
didn't contact me...

233
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:40,965
Lemme guess, you were
off training again...

234
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:41,883
Right, Hermit?

235
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:48,932
Look, I understand

236
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:51,393
that you wanna have one final
showdown with the kid...

237
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:53,687
but I'm stuck in this now
and I wanna see how it'll end.

238
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:00,527
As punishment for leaving
Ragnarok without notice...

239
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:02,737
I think you should write
"I'm sorry" 100 times

240
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:04,322
on a sheet of paper for us.

241
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:10,078
I will be the one to take
down the Shinpaku Alliance...

242
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:12,789
and to kill Kenichi
Shirahama...

243
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:15,166
We don't need
your help anymore.

244
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,751
Shut up, Loki...

245
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:18,169
I don't have to
answer to you.

246
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:19,671
Wha?!

247
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:21,005
That's enough, you two.

248
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:26,636
I'll give you another
chance, Hermit...

249
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:28,680
But know that I do
not accept failure.

250
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,561
Damn it. Do you know
what this is gonna do

251
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:37,355
to Ragnarok's reputation?

252
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:38,898
This is bad news.

253
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:40,859
Hermit's always
been a loose cannon.

254
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:45,864
I might have a hard time
controlling him later.

255
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,326
I've never seen Hermit so
serious about an opponent.

256
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:52,912
You're pretty good,
Kenichi Shirahama.

257
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:57,167
But the next time you
face him he'll kill you...

258
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,710
You're a dead man.

259
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:06,885
Jeez...

260
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:09,220
I shouldn't be here I should
be training at the dojo.

261
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,889
Oh c'mon... it'll be fun.

262
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,057
Now quit whining-

263
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:13,600
you know taking your
little sister shopping

264
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,185
is one of your
brotherly duties.

265
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:16,853
But I don't wanna...

266
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:19,522
Now if it was
shopping with Miu...

267
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:21,608
Oh, Kenichi!

268
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:30,158
You mean you haven't
gotten over her yet...?

269
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:32,327
Are you saying that big boobied
bimbo is more important to you

270
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:33,995
than your adorable
little sister...?!

271
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:35,079
What's the matter with
you, ya big dummy!

272
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:36,664
They must be siblings-
isn't that cute.

273
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:38,166
I get it! I get it...!

274
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,126
Cut it out!

275
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:41,461
Man...

276
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,129
I'm so glad that I could
help you see things

277
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:44,464
from my point of view.

278
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,594
It's so pretty!

279
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:50,804
Yeah, yeah...

280
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:52,263
It's pretty.

281
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:53,515
I bet it's
really expensive.

282
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:54,682
Keep up, Honoka.

283
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:55,975
I'm leaving you behind.

284
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,769
I just wanna look a
little bit longer.

285
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:02,232
You wanna repeat that, punk?

286
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:04,400
C'mon. Tell us what you said.

287
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,860
Yeah... Speak up.

288
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:08,738
I... don't know...

289
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:10,532
I asked you guys
to calm down.

290
00:15:10,532 --> 00:15:12,033
No, before that...!

291
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:13,785
Do you have the nerve
to say it again, loser?

292
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,036
Oh... that...

293
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:15,954
I, uh...

294
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:18,039
I guess...

295
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,124
I said you're dead
men walking...

296
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:22,210
And that I'll take all
3 of you bastards on

297
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,462
if we can just go somewhere
a little less crowded...

298
00:15:24,462 --> 00:15:25,713
that what you heard?

299
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:30,093
Why don't we go into
that alley over there?

300
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:31,845
I don't wanna scare
anybody, you know?

301
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:33,596
What the hell is
up with this guy?

302
00:15:34,931 --> 00:15:35,765
I gotcha!

303
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:40,645
You suck...!

304
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:43,064
You guys shouldn't be ganging
up on one person like that!

305
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:44,774
Fights are supposed
to be one-on-one.

306
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:47,610
Al least that's what the guy
with the mustache told me.

307
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,320
Oh... really...?

308
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,531
Well, thanks a lot for
buttin' in with that info...

309
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:53,533
I've never wanted to hit
a little girl before...

310
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:58,246
But now...
I've changed my mind!

311
00:15:58,246 --> 00:16:01,875
My big brother is a
fighter for justice!

312
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,877
Alright big brother...!
Go get him!

313
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:08,006
Where'd he go?

314
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:09,465
Die you little brat!

315
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:16,848
-No way!
-Damn you!

316
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:26,858
Whoa! A fight!

317
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:28,693
Wow! It's just
like the movies!

318
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,655
Hey! Hold on a second,
pretty boy!

319
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:39,370
You're not gonna leave me all
alone out here, are you...?

320
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,581
Help me Mr. retty
Boy it's dangerous...

321
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:42,749
I'm adorable.

322
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,298
Could ya be a little
more delicate?

323
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:51,758
You're worse than Apachai!

324
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:54,844
So many people!

325
00:16:57,347 --> 00:16:59,015
Hey Honoka!

326
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:00,183
Where are you?!

327
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:04,145
Where did she run off to?

328
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:05,229
It's gettin' late-

329
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:07,920
I should be on my way
back to the dojo by now.

330
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:12,979
Are we going to
see a doctor?

331
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:14,981
Doctors can't be trusted.

332
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:17,191
So I've brought you here.

333
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:18,151
Where's "here"?

334
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:20,445
My house.

335
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:27,076
Be more gentle, would ya?!

336
00:17:27,076 --> 00:17:29,287
Alright, I'm done.
Now get out of here.

337
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:31,289
You can't just throw
me outta here...!

338
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:34,167
What if your
bandaging is lousy?!

339
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:35,960
Oh wow.

340
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,003
That's awesome...!

341
00:17:37,003 --> 00:17:39,005
My knee doesn't
hurt at all!

342
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:40,381
You're not so
bad after all!

343
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:42,759
Get goin'.

344
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,094
Wow, I've never seen
such a big house!

345
00:17:45,094 --> 00:17:46,679
Ooh! What a beautiful statue-

346
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,639
it looks expensive!

347
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:51,267
You must be really rich
to have such a big house

348
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:52,477
in the middle of the city...

349
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:54,395
So tell me... how much
are you really worth?

350
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:55,855
Millions or Billions?

351
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:56,981
Why is this covered?

352
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:58,399
What a waste.

353
00:17:58,399 --> 00:17:59,734
Stop it.

354
00:17:59,734 --> 00:18:02,779
A rich guy like you doesn't
bother to offer a girl tea?

355
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:04,572
-How rude.
-Just get outta here!

356
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:05,740
Oh well I'll go
make the tea

357
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,076
it's my way of saying
thanks for saving me.

358
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:09,744
I don't want tea- I
want you to leave!

359
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,667
I didn't know...

360
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,294
you live here by yourself!

361
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:19,879
Leave now!

362
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:21,881
You don't have anything
in your refrigerator!

363
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:23,174
Don't tell me you
eat fast food

364
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:25,843
and convenience
store food everyday.

365
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:26,969
Hey...

366
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:29,222
Looks like we're
not having tea...

367
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:30,515
I'm gonna take
what I can find

368
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:33,142
and try to make a home cooked
meal for you, sound good?

369
00:18:33,142 --> 00:18:34,018
Please go!

370
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:39,524
Just... like her.

371
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,152
What is wrong with you?!

372
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:44,487
Have you ever cooked
a meal before?!

373
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,577
I suck at home ec.

374
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:53,037
What kinda girl am I?

375
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:03,297
Don't do it!

376
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:05,216
You don't have to force
yourself to eat it!

377
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:10,471
Hey big brother...

378
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:13,057
I made something very special
for you to eat today.

379
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:18,563
It's been a long time

380
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:20,231
since anybody cooked
a meal for me.

381
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,735
I'll go make some more!

382
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:27,238
No, that's okay-
I've had plenty.

383
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:29,907
Now... It's time
to start cleaning!

384
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,409
Would you please
just go home?

385
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:33,703
Someone's gotta take
care of this dust!

386
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:35,413
How long has it been since
you cleaned the place?!

387
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:45,631
What a nice picture.

388
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:47,341
Is that your dad and
your little sister?

389
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:49,010
Put that down right now!

390
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,391
Don't worry about me...

391
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:56,642
Just get outta here.

392
00:19:59,228 --> 00:20:01,314
You know, when you get angry
your face changes back

393
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:03,483
to how it looked when
you were fighting.

394
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:05,693
Hey, you wanna see what
your face looks like

395
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:06,694
when you're in a fight?

396
00:20:08,154 --> 00:20:10,490
Like this!

397
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,866
What?

398
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,829
You're laughing!

399
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,122
That's awesome...!

400
00:20:18,122 --> 00:20:20,082
It must be a pretty
good impression!

401
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:21,501
Cut it out! Seriously!

402
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:22,835
Stop!

403
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:28,674
I'll see ya later,
Mr. retty Boy.

404
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:29,884
Until next time!

405
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:31,344
Please don't come back.

406
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:39,101
Man, she's a weird kid.

407
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:43,856
Hey Honoka,
where are you...?!

408
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:45,399
Time to go home...!

409
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:47,443
Come on out...!
We gotta go!

410
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:57,620
A-pa...

411
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,830
You're never gonna
beat me, Apachai!

412
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,916
Wow.

413
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:05,127
I gotta admit... Kenichi's
sister has got mad skills.

414
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:07,296
She might even be more
talented than Kenichi

415
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:08,256
at martial arts...

416
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:09,298
You think?

417
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:11,634
Could we play one more...?
Pretty please?

418
00:21:11,634 --> 00:21:14,303
Sure thing...! I'll play
Othello with you anytime!

419
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:16,097
I bet you guys
had a great time

420
00:21:16,097 --> 00:21:17,974
shopping together
this afternoon!

421
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:20,184
I'm jealous...
You're so lucky...!

422
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:22,103
It must be fun to
have a sibling!

423
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:23,729
You've gotta
be kidding me!

424
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:25,815
You have no idea how long
I wandered the streets

425
00:21:25,815 --> 00:21:27,024
looking for her!

426
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:29,527
She told me she went to
some strangers house!

427
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:31,696
And that's not good-
she should know better...

428
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:35,074
You're a little kid...
be careful...

429
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:37,868
But he saved me from
those big jerks...!

430
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:39,829
He's not a bad guy-
I can tell...

431
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:40,871
He's nice...

432
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,748
He totally saved my life!

433
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:44,041
Listen...

434
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,002
Just cause the guy beat up
some delinquents to help you

435
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:47,587
doesn't mean
he's a good guy...

436
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:50,298
You can never tell just
by looking at someone!

437
00:21:50,298 --> 00:21:52,800
I was really worried
about you, Honoka...

438
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,177
Are you even
listening to me?!

439
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:57,013
Now, now, calm
down Kenichi.

440
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:59,390
Although...
You are right.

441
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,684
You can't always judge
a book by its cover...

442
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:05,229
Someone who seems nice on the
outside could be evil inside...

443
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:06,647
I learned that
with Tanimoto.

444
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:10,568
The man who tried
to kill me...

445
00:22:10,568 --> 00:22:13,654
The Sixth Fist of
Ragnarok, Hermit.

446
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:16,115
Shut up...!I've been
playing a role my whole life

447
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:17,408
so that I
could someday...

448
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:19,452
rule over both the
darkness and the light!

449
00:22:19,452 --> 00:22:21,454
Then when I'm ready
the entire underworld

450
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:23,247
will bow down before me!

451
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:24,999
I wonder what
he's planning...

452
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:26,667
I know he's up
to something.

453
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:29,587
Hey Kenichi, don't worry
about that right now.

454
00:22:29,587 --> 00:22:32,465
Right now... You need to
focus on the double palm.

455
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:34,050
Yes, sir...!
I can do it...!

456
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,509
I'll keep training...

457
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:37,178
Until I break
through the floor!

458
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:41,849
He must be good if he was
able to beat Siegfried.

459
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:43,392
Well, if he wasn't good

460
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:45,061
then he wouldn't
be worth fighting.

461
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:49,398
I will beat you
next time...

462
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:51,233
Kenichi Shirahama!

463
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:57,239
[Music]

464
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:20,448
What are you doing?!

465
00:24:20,448 --> 00:24:22,533
I'm warning you- if
you touch me you die!

466
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:25,119
Sorry little girl but I'm
gonna be using you as bait

467
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,079
to lure out your
brother, Kenichi.

468
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,622
You can't do that!

469
00:24:28,622 --> 00:24:30,958
If you hurt my big brother
I'll never forgive you!

470
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,085
And just so you know-
my brother is strong!

471
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:35,087
You baddies are
no match for him!

472
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:36,714
He's gonna show
you who's boss!

473
00:24:36,714 --> 00:24:38,883
I guess I'll just have
to prove you wrong.

474
00:24:38,883 --> 00:24:39,967
Next time you see Kenichi

475
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:42,595
he'll be crawling on the
ground begging for mercy.

476
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:44,180
He's not gettin' past me.
