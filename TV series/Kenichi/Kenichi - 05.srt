1
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,944
We'll use that? For what?

2
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:46,782
How am I supposed to throw
this thing, it's too heavy!

3
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:49,285
So! Are you finally
ready to do something?

4
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:50,452
Yes!

5
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:53,581
Alright then, let's teach you
something worth knowing!

6
00:01:58,043 --> 00:01:59,879
No way!

7
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,214
The Yamazuki of Bassai...

8
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:03,674
It's an ancient technique

9
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:06,385
that's rarely used in
sports karate fighting.

10
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:09,263
How perfect.

11
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,599
Bad news for you, those
guys are with Ragnarok.

12
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,267
What's Ragnarok?

13
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,977
Oh, nothing big,

14
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:17,980
just the most powerful
gang in the entire city.

15
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,399
You are in some seriously
hot water, old chum.

16
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:22,026
There's no escaping, Ragnarok.

17
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:24,028
They're probably waiting
on every street for you

18
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:25,946
and I bet they already
know where you live.

19
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,197
But this is what you get

20
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:28,532
for telling everybody
about your fight.

21
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:30,993
I knew you should have
kept quiet on the subject.

22
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:41,128
I see. It sounds like
you're in a bit of trouble.

23
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,505
What makes you say that?
Aside from the fact that

24
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:46,216
I'm gonna get my face kicked
in by a gang of vicious thugs?!

25
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:49,595
Heh. You couldn't stop bragging
about your win yesterday.

26
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:52,514
What, did you think
that'd be the end of it?

27
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:55,059
Well I didn't think I'd
have a whole gang of--

28
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:57,102
Wait a second! You
guys already knew

29
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:58,812
what was gonna happen
to me if I won that fight.

30
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,314
You knew that if I beat Tsukuba,

31
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,858
I'd have every thug
in town gunning for me!

32
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:05,110
And you didn't think that's
something I'd wanna know?

33
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,362
Say we had told you,

34
00:03:06,362 --> 00:03:10,199
would that have prevented you
from standing up to Tsukuba?

35
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,910
Don't chicken out, what you need
to do is to keep on training and

36
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,454
getting stronger until you're
the best fighter at school.

37
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:17,456
I can be the best fighter
in the whole world

38
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:19,416
and it still won't help
me solve my problem!

39
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,794
Life is a battle!
You welcome the challenge!

40
00:03:21,794 --> 00:03:24,296
That may be the life you
want but it's not for me!

41
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:28,050
Fine then. You tell
me what you wanna do.

42
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,594
I... I don't know.

43
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:42,898
Kenichi!

44
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:45,859
Tell us where he is!

45
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,278
Those goons are
looking for me.

46
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:50,406
Man, how did I get
myself into this mess?

47
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:52,241
I'll get him good.

48
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:56,787
I'm gonna beat him down and dunk
his head right in the toilet!

49
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:58,789
Put that little piece of
crap where he belongs!

50
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:01,667
I-I'm not really running away.
I'm not a coward, after all.

51
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,961
I'm just avoiding getting
into a pointless conflict...

52
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:06,714
...with a well-timed
strategic withdrawal.

53
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,511
Is someone there?

54
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:17,683
Are you okay?

55
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,356
Izumi...

56
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:26,025
How's it going?

57
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,151
Um...

58
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:27,818
What?

59
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:29,820
No, it's really
not a big deal.

60
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,739
If you've got something
to say, just say it.

61
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:32,531
Well...

62
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:34,658
Tell me, am I getting on
your nerves or something?

63
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:37,578
What? No, it's
nothing like that.

64
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,830
I was just wondering,
I'm a little bit curious

65
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,082
why someone like you would
join the Gardening Club.

66
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,042
It's just that...

67
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:45,461
it's not exactly a popular
choice around here.

68
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:47,379
Well, since I was a kid,

69
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:49,882
I've always been interested
in flowers and stuff.

70
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:52,468
But people used to pick on
me and give me a hard time.

71
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:55,637
They'd say 'flowers are for
girls' and they'd call me lame

72
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:57,765
but I figure to heck with them,
I'm gonna keep on doing

73
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,267
what I wanna do and I don't
really care what people say.

74
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,477
You surprise me.

75
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:03,854
I hear these rumors
about you all the time.

76
00:05:03,854 --> 00:05:06,857
I had this idea that you'd
be really intimidating.

77
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:09,818
Intimidating? What kind
of rumors did you hear?

78
00:05:09,818 --> 00:05:12,988
They say you're the strongest,
meanest kid in the whole school!

79
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:15,324
Right... Well you shouldn't
believe everything you hear,

80
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:18,035
especially if it comes from
that freak show Niijima--

81
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:19,661
There's my best friend
in the world!

82
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:22,372
I've been looking for you,
you aren't easy to find!

83
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:23,999
Niijima! You've been
running your mouth

84
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:25,918
telling lies about me
again, haven't you?!

85
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,878
Maybe I have and maybe I haven't

86
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,671
but what difference
does it make to you?

87
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:31,548
Just stop spreading
rumors about me okay?!

88
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:33,926
But a rumor's not a
rumor if it's the truth.

89
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:35,844
Hey, Kenichi asked you nicely.

90
00:05:35,844 --> 00:05:38,347
So why don't you just leave
him alone, you big meanie!

91
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:39,848
Who asked you, four-eyes?

92
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:41,767
Niijima! You told me yourself

93
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:44,686
that you really hate
twisted information, right?

94
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:47,189
Well, I don't mind it so much,

95
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,483
as long as I'm the one
doing the twisting.

96
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,318
I've had enough of
your crap for one day.

97
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,071
Get out of here before your
stink kills all the plants.

98
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,490
But aren't you even interested
in what I have to say?

99
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,283
Get lost, Niijima.

100
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:01,578
Fine, be that way. But
If he knew what I know

101
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,790
about the gang of thugs chasing
him he'd listen alright.

102
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,750
I swear, that guy'll
be the death of me!

103
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,752
You have some really
weird friends, huh?

104
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:11,797
Take that back! That
moron is not my friend!

105
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:13,799
If you say so...

106
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:15,717
Leave me alone you freak!

107
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:18,679
Miu!

108
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:22,516
Why would you say that
to me? That's so mean!

109
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,394
I thought we could walk
home together after school.

110
00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:26,895
But if you want me to leave...

111
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:29,440
I am so sorry.
Please don't cry!

112
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,358
I'll see you later okay?

113
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:43,120
Apachai's turn!

114
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,663
Now you dodge!

115
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:46,290
Apa!

116
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,292
So, how come you
no like to dodge?

117
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:52,045
We try a slow one!

118
00:06:57,176 --> 00:06:59,219
Am I still alive?

119
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,096
So sorry about that, Kenichi.

120
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:03,974
Next time Apachai
promises to give you break.

121
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:06,351
He broke me pretty
good this time.

122
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,395
Stop screwing around
and get up kid!

123
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,646
If you lay on the
ground all day,

124
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:12,065
there won't be any time
left for us to train you.

125
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,610
I don't get it, these
guys are masters.

126
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,361
Why are they so
eager to train me?

127
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:17,446
Could it be...?

128
00:07:17,446 --> 00:07:18,405
Does this...

129
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,033
...mean you think I could be a
great martial artist like you?

130
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:21,909
No.

131
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,744
Apapa!

132
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,954
I can't believe you
answered that in sync!

133
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:27,956
I get it! I'm awful!
I'm a loser!

134
00:07:27,956 --> 00:07:29,708
I'm gonna get killed
by those thugs anyway,

135
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,585
I might as well end
it all right now!

136
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:32,836
No Kenichi, stop!

137
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:36,590
You know, no one beats you
at beating yourself, kid.

138
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,634
You've got self-defeat
down to an art.

139
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:39,718
You're gonna have to fight

140
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:42,179
and now you're scared
about it, so what?

141
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:45,098
Best thing you can do at a time
like that is punch a pole!

142
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,726
Punch it hard, punch those
fears square in the face!

143
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:49,478
Then when you get
some confidence back,

144
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:50,812
you punch again!

145
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:53,815
You punch that pole until
you can't punch anymore!

146
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:55,192
'Cause when the
stuff hits the fan,

147
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,611
your training's the one
thing you can count on!

148
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,614
And if... it's not enough?

149
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,367
Then you'll lose, but what of
it? Martial arts isn't just

150
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,994
about getting strong, it's about
learning to face your fears.

151
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:08,580
You do that,
and the rest is easy.

152
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,873
Y-Yeah but what if--

153
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:11,124
Enough with the questions...

154
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,252
Let's get back to
doin' something useful.

155
00:08:13,252 --> 00:08:15,295
Now look. Sometimes
it doesn't matter

156
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,505
how mentally
prepared you are.

157
00:08:16,505 --> 00:08:18,674
When the real fight comes,
you still might find

158
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:20,592
your punches aren't packing
the power you need.

159
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:21,051
Right.

160
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:22,594
If you end up in that situation,

161
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:24,471
don't feel pressured
to form a fist.

162
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,516
Instead of clinching up, hold
out your hand out like this.

163
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:29,101
Nice and easy.

164
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:36,650
Keep it loose like a whip
and aim for the teeth.

165
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,236
If I did, couldn't that end up
breaking the other guy's jaw?

166
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:42,030
Of course it could! That's how
you know you're doin' it right!

167
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,370
I really do want
to be stronger.

168
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,834
But still, I don't want to
fight anyone. I hate violence!

169
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,086
Punch the pole! Punch the pole!

170
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:57,838
At this rate, it seems
our young disciple

171
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,590
is going to have some difficulty
finishing what he's started.

172
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,341
Indeed.

173
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,969
The kid needs to suck it up
and find some courage.

174
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:06,763
Well, maybe we can help...

175
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:09,099
I brought you a towel, you
wanna take a little break?

176
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:10,183
Thanks.

177
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,602
That's it!

178
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:12,436
Oh yeah...

179
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:15,605
I think this is going to be fun!

180
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:16,273
Kenichi!

181
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:17,441
Oh right!

182
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:18,942
Keep punching the pole!

183
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:20,235
Why don't you and Miu go

184
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:22,154
on a little date
together this Sunday?

185
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:23,572
What?

186
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:24,656
What?

187
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:26,908
What part of "go on a date"
don't you understand?

188
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:28,327
A-A real date?

189
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:29,995
You mean like just
the two of us?

190
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:30,662
Of course.

191
00:09:30,662 --> 00:09:34,499
You bet we'll go!
All-right! Yoo-hoo!

192
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:37,502
This is grea--!

193
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:42,049
But we don't...

194
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:42,883
...have to?

195
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:46,094
Sorry it's a reflex. You
shouldn't sneak up behind me!

196
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:47,971
Yeah. Got it.

197
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:49,973
So we're still going
on the date, right?

198
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:52,726
I'm up for it if you are.

199
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,603
And what do you know?
I happen to have

200
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:55,896
2 free tickets to the movies!

201
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,189
That's very nice but--

202
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:58,732
Go on, take 'em!

203
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,275
You kids deserve a little fun.

204
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:01,026
Sure...

205
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:03,528
All right! She said yes!
We're goin' to the movies!

206
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:06,698
Not so fast, kid, you've
still got punchin' to do.

207
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:07,949
Right!

208
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:09,368
Punch the pole!

209
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,477
And we're off!

210
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:37,688
You kids have a great time now!

211
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,440
Come on, let's go!

212
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,066
Hurry up or we're
gonna miss the train!

213
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,276
Right!

214
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,946
Guess we cut it a
little close, huh?

215
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,156
Oh yeah...

216
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,367
Good thing you're so
fast, or this would be a--

217
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,453
OH, I'm sorry about that.

218
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,622
No, that's okay.

219
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,166
She seems pretty excited
about being on this date.

220
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,751
Maybe she likes me...

221
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,753
I'm really excited
about this date.

222
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,588
I've never seen a movie
in a theater before!

223
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,466
What? Are you serious?

224
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,843
She isn't into me at
all, she's just happy

225
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,971
about going to see a movie
at the stupid theater. Figures!

226
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,682
There's my best friend
in the whole world!

227
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:27,102
Man, I have been looking
for you all over town!

228
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:30,105
Hello there! How
have you been?

229
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:31,774
Come on, there are
some more open seats

230
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,234
--at the back of the train.
--What?

231
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,819
Kenichi, wait, where're
you going buddy?

232
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,904
Aren't you even curious
why I was looking for you?

233
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,197
This isn't our stop;

234
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,115
we're supposed to get
off at the next station.

235
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:41,325
Don't worry about it!

236
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:43,702
Wait I've got some info!

237
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,789
Don't you wanna hear what I
have to say? No Kenichi wait!

238
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,041
I feel kinda bad we
just left him like that.

239
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,334
He'll be alright.

240
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,003
Besides we're only one stop
away from where we need to be.

241
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,255
I figured we could walk it.

242
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,091
I guess walking there
wouldn't be so bad.

243
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,093
I'll bet you anything that
creep's waiting for me

244
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,719
at the next station.

245
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,556
This is so nice,
it's been a long time

246
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,141
since I've taken the day
off and gone for a walk!

247
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:13,232
So you think you can dodge
me that easily, huh, Kenichi?

248
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,150
Never underestimate me!

249
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,988
That jerk Niijima's
gonna ruin my date.

250
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,490
How in the world did he know
we were going to be here?

251
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,534
What is he some sort of
mind-reader or something?

252
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,869
What's wrong with you?

253
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,288
We better hurry and get in
there or we'll miss the show.

254
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,289
Well uh...

255
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,915
you see uh...

256
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,668
Man, if I can't figure out
a way to get rid of him,

257
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,712
this date's gonna go
from bad to worse!

258
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,381
Oh, we'd better hurry
or we'll be late!

259
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:39,633
Miu wait.

260
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,884
What?

261
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,787
Miu, listen.

262
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,289
Uh, yeah?

263
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,460
I'm starved! You
wanna get some food?

264
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,044
Huh?

265
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,086
I'm so hungry!

266
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,672
When we were walking I got
this craving for a hamburger.

267
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,216
What do you say we ditch
the movie and get some grub!

268
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:23,427
Oh no, but I've never
been to the movies,

269
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,678
and we've got
these free tickets...

270
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:28,515
I said I'm hungry!
I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

271
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:30,309
Alright, fine! I get it!

272
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,187
We can go get some food, just
don't eat the tickets, okay?

273
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,147
I know they'll be here soon.

274
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,776
Welcome to the Burger Palace!
What can I get for you?

275
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,653
Let's see... well...

276
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,155
Geez, there are so many options
I don't know what to get

277
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,158
but I guess I'll have the spicy
chili burger and some fries.

278
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,161
No just give me the
master hotdog. No, the burger..

279
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,038
Come on, it's not like
this is your first time

280
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,790
going to a fast-food
place, right?

281
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,750
Actually, I don't get
out to eat very often

282
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,585
to tell you the truth.

283
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,803
Huh. I guess Miu's got it
pretty tough over there.

284
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,930
Then I'm gonna make
sure this is the best day

285
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,390
she's ever had
in her entire life!

286
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,226
Starting now, we're gonna
have a great time!

287
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,561
I think my mouth is on fire!

288
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,498
Meow...

289
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,503
Uh-oh! I'm gonna get you, kitty!

290
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,880
Here, kitty-kitty-kitty!

291
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,298
He should've been here by now,

292
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:45,008
where in the heck
could that guy be?

293
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:47,052
Hey! You're friends with
that weak-kneed punk,

294
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,220
Kenichi, aren't you?

295
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,595
Huh?

296
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:51,807
Do yourself a favor and
tell me where to find him!

297
00:14:58,981 --> 00:14:59,648
Here.

298
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,025
Oh, thanks.

299
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,818
Yep. This sure has
been a lotta fun!

300
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,194
I've really had a nice time.

301
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,655
We never did get around to
seeing that movie did we?

302
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,741
But we did a lot of
other cool stuff, right?

303
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,034
I guess...

304
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,080
I mean "yes," I'm sorry.

305
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,458
I kinda spaced out
there for a second.

306
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,584
Ah, let me guess.

307
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,086
You've never been to an
amusement park before either.

308
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,379
No I haven't...

309
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,214
Grandpa never had
a chance to take me.

310
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,008
We were too busy
training every day.

311
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,305
Sometimes I feel
like I missed out.

312
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,600
I would've loved to try
a ride like that, just once.

313
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,185
Let's do it!

314
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,353
Come on let's go take a spin
on the merry-go-round.

315
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:41,106
You wanna try it, right?
Well here's your chance!

316
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,441
No time like the present.

317
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,860
But, well the
thing is, I just uh...

318
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,779
When you feel like you
really wanna do something

319
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,656
you should just take
a leap and go for it!

320
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:50,949
Nice move...

321
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,702
So far so good.

322
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,079
Don't be scared, there's
really nothing to worry about.

323
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,873
Yeah, okay...

324
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,006
These kids' rides
can be pretty boring.

325
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,883
I hope she isn't disappointed...

326
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,562
Wow, so this is how it feels,

327
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,691
to finally be the one waving
from this side of the ride.

328
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:27,945
That's great. She looks
like she's having fun!

329
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:31,406
Are you positive you still
wanna see that movie?

330
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:34,117
Yeah! Besides, aren't you
the one who told me if I really

331
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:36,161
wanted to do something I
should just "take a leap"?

332
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,663
Yeah...

333
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,959
Except now we're probably gonna
have to dodge Niijima again.

334
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,252
Would you look at that!

335
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,003
I guess he gave up on me!

336
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,171
Where is Kenichi?

337
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,715
Don't make me ask you again
or I promise you'll regret it!

338
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:51,009
I already told you guys that
I don't know where he is!

339
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,678
You stubborn little weasel!

340
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,680
You better start
singing like a bird!

341
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,599
Please don't hurt me! I swear to
you, I don't even know the guy!

342
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,853
Don't lie to me, a minute ago
you two were thick as thieves,

343
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,021
"best friends in the
whole wide world!"

344
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,773
Niijima?

345
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,358
Let's go, or we'll
miss the movie!

346
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,861
Wait, we've gotta help
him out, he's your friend!

347
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,405
Who's my friend? That guy?

348
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,074
Look, it really doesn't have
anything to do with us.

349
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,035
Are you actually gonna
pretend you didn't see that?

350
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,790
I'll be the hero...

351
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,501
That's right,
Kenichi Shirahama the hero.

352
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,588
I'll beat up the thugs
and defend the innocent.

353
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,093
This is your last chance
to come clean you punk!

354
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:33,886
Let him go!

355
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,553
Huh?

356
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,221
You came to save me!

357
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,515
I told you guys he
was my best friend,

358
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,767
now teach them a lesson
they'll never forget!

359
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:42,978
So, you're the one who's
been bragging to everyone

360
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,396
about beating Tsukuba, huh?

361
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,565
I haven't been
bragging about anything!

362
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,485
Oh no! My legs are
starting to shake!

363
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:53,155
Would you look at that! The
tough guy's a little scared!

364
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,949
Crap! This guy looks
like a monster!

365
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,452
I'm really gonna enjoy
making you bleed!

366
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,578
Calm down...

367
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,079
There's no getting
away from this now.

368
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,789
I just have to
trust my training!

369
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:05,626
Don't feel pressured
to form a fist...

370
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,211
Here it comes!

371
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,719
Not too shabby, kid.
That kinda' hurt.

372
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,220
Uh, really?

373
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,140
Now I get to return
the favor. You ready?

374
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,476
Here comes the pai--

375
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,191
'Cause when the
stuff hits the fan,

376
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,985
your training's the one
thing you can count on!

377
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,236
I'm so proud of you!

378
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:33,904
Thanks!

379
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,865
I guess it was pretty awesome.

380
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:41,203
Hey wait. Who knocked
out those other guys?

381
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,039
You idiots. I told you
Kenichi was my best buddy

382
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,332
but, you wouldn't
listen to me!

383
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,751
This guy is a master of
all kinds of martial arts!

384
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,128
Karate, kick-boxing,
weird Chinese stuff

385
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:51,880
you've never even heard
of! That's right!

386
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,132
And he's busting his
butt day in and day out,

387
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,926
so you better
watch your backs...

388
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,636
How does he know that
I've been training?

389
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,846
Is he stalking me or something?

390
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:02,849
My boy's not scared of Ragnarok,
bring it on whenever you want!

391
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,851
That's enough! Put
a cork in it already!

392
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:08,522
I don't even know who
these "Ragnarok" guys are!

393
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,191
Isn't it suspicious these
thugs somehow knew

394
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,234
you'd be here today?

395
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,986
Well, now that
you mention it...

396
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,445
I did try to warn you.

397
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,113
Huh?

398
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,699
Some creepy old guy with a
weird hat was handing this out

399
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,118
in school to anyone who would
read it, including those thugs!

400
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,124
What? How did they--

401
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:28,176
"Kenichi's Itinerary"?!

402
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:30,595
It's not bad enough every
bully in school is after me,

403
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:32,889
you guys have to
tell 'em where I am?!

404
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:36,017
Yes well, actually, it
was all Akisame's idea.

405
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,022
It was what I like to call the
"carrot and stick" approach.

406
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:44,734
Come again?

407
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:47,236
You see, kid, when I had
you punchin' that pole,

408
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,447
you looked like you were about
ready to throw in the towel.

409
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:53,076
So we figured we'd try to help
you grow a little backbone.

410
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:54,744
Are you people insane?

411
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:56,245
You used Miu as bait

412
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:58,748
so those thugs would attack me
and I'd have to fight them?!

413
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:00,917
Well, you already ran away
from those punks once.

414
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:03,836
We had to find a way to snap
you out of your little funk

415
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,088
before it became
a bad habit.

416
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:06,464
It's no different
from the lioness

417
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:08,758
who throws her cubs from the
cliff to make them stronger.

418
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:10,260
Perhaps cruel, but
it's "tough love".

419
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,553
Well, I don't need
love like that okay?

420
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:14,055
Hey, whether you like it or not,

421
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:16,015
those bullies are
comin' for you!

422
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,392
It doesn't matter what you do,

423
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:19,310
you're gonna have to
fight 'em sooner or later!

424
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,980
That's right. Remember the enemy
will never stop attacking you.

425
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,064
I get that...

426
00:20:23,064 --> 00:20:24,983
But you don't have
to help 'em do it!

427
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:27,735
Remember, a man doesn't
choose his path in life,

428
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:29,487
only whether or
not to walk it.

429
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:32,407
Huh?! Are you forgetting they
used you as a "carrot?!"

430
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:34,200
That's okay. I can
forgive them...

431
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,034
...for now.

432
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,245
What is all this
commotion about?

433
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:39,372
Oh, hi, Hayato.

434
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:43,668
I see. This is quite a mess.

435
00:20:43,668 --> 00:20:46,379
Hey, Kenichi. My grandfather's
had a lifetime's

436
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,547
worth of experience.

437
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:49,966
We should see what he thinks
what you should do next.

438
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,801
Uh... right.

439
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:53,678
Now this may surprise you...

440
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:57,932
When I was a boy, the older boys
at the dojo picked on me.

441
00:20:57,932 --> 00:21:01,728
You got picked on? I never
would've thought that.

442
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,187
Of course I made sure

443
00:21:03,187 --> 00:21:06,441
I paid them back 100 fold
for what they did.

444
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:10,194
Yes, once you beat one
person, even if you never

445
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:12,905
want to fight again,
others will challenge you.

446
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:17,118
I was constantly attacked
until I had no choice

447
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:19,412
but to wipe out
the other dojos!

448
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:22,165
And then one day I woke
up and I was an old man!

449
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:24,000
Oh no!

450
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,043
Alright, look.

451
00:21:25,043 --> 00:21:27,503
He's saying once you're in
a fight you can't just stop.

452
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,672
You can't quit right in
the middle of a battle.

453
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:30,882
Keep on fighting!

454
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:32,759
That doesn't help me at all!

455
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,136
Who said anything about helping?

456
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:39,307
We were wondering
if there was any way

457
00:21:39,307 --> 00:21:41,184
Kenichi could resolve
this peacefully.

458
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:42,393
Tell me, son.

459
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:45,396
Have you already decided you're
never going to run away?

460
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:47,231
Well, sort of...

461
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:50,777
If that's true, you must
prepare yourself to fight!

462
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:53,446
They say, a man does not
choose his path in life,

463
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:56,616
only whether or not to walk it!

464
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:59,327
Take a look at these, it
should calm your nerves!

465
00:21:59,327 --> 00:22:00,995
What's this?

466
00:22:00,995 --> 00:22:02,413
No way...

467
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:06,000
Were you following
us the whole time?

468
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,376
I'll never forgive you for this!

469
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:09,170
You letch! You pervert!

470
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,546
I only took those pictures

471
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,465
because I thought you
might like to have them...

472
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:14,133
Looks like you struck
out this time, kid.

473
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,219
If you want I can give
you a few pointers.

474
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:18,262
Next time Apachai want
to come along too!

475
00:22:18,262 --> 00:22:20,848
Long walks and merry-go-rounds
look so much fun!

476
00:22:20,848 --> 00:22:27,021
For the first time in my life
I feel like I'm the normal one.

477
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:27,897
What are you doing?

478
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:30,483
I thought I told you to
bring me the Shirahama kid.

479
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:33,236
Yeah, we tried, but
he was too strong.

480
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:34,737
Hm...

481
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:51,045
Then I suppose it's time that
I paid him a visit myself.

482
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,427
Apachai is so happy!

483
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:24,472
Kenichi is going to spend
the night at Ryozanpaku!

484
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:26,265
Boy, spending the night
for training, huh?

485
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:29,101
This stinks. it's not like it's
been a walk in the park here!

486
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,811
What's the matter, Kenichi?
Aren't you happy?

487
00:24:30,811 --> 00:24:33,397
Apachai's happy because we're
training all night long!

488
00:24:33,397 --> 00:24:35,733
It must be nice
to be so carefree.

489
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:38,402
That's not true at all!
Apachai can be very serious,

490
00:24:38,402 --> 00:24:39,987
Apachai thinks seriously
all the time.

491
00:24:39,987 --> 00:24:42,323
Like, how I should punish
you when you run away,

492
00:24:42,323 --> 00:24:43,950
or what I should do
if you stop breathing

493
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,742
during training exercises!

494
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:47,453
This is gonna be the
worst night of my life...
