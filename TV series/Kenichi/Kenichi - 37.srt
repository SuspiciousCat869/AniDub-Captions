00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:11,553
[Music]

2
00:01:41,954 --> 00:01:43,196
Seriously, does
anyone know

3
00:01:43,196 --> 00:01:45,531
what the boss
was thinking?

4
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:47,074
If he hadn't stepped
in like that

5
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,035
I could've finished off
Kenichi Shirihama and Hermit

6
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:51,120
on the same freaking day!

7
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,998
I don't understand
the problem.

8
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:55,291
Oh have you heard...?

9
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,544
There's a rumor about
our favorite boss...

10
00:01:58,544 --> 00:02:00,755
Looks like he's been doing
some martial arts training

11
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:02,381
with the Great Sage
Fists for some time.

12
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,345
And here we peons can't
even get ourselves

13
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:09,305
an audience with
the man on top.

14
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:10,306
Loki's correct...

15
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:12,350
The reason I joined Ragnarok
was for the opportunity

16
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,101
to train with the
Great Sage Fists...

17
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,354
And I've never so
much as seen his face.

18
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,983
Wouldja take it
down a notch, Thor?!

19
00:02:20,983 --> 00:02:23,277
Who cares...? Heh...

20
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,904
The only reason I
joined this gang was

21
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:28,032
so I could figure out how to
use my sumo in real life...

22
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:29,867
Now I'm a better fighter
than I've ever been

23
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:32,245
and I figured it out
without anyone's help...!

24
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:34,205
I say who needs a teacher!

25
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:35,665
Hah... Oh sure,

26
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,458
if you're satisfied
beating on high school kids

27
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,169
and street trash then
you're doin' just fine.

28
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:42,129
You wanna fight me, Freya?

29
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,506
My pleasure...

30
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:45,258
Think you can take it?

31
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:47,969
Ah...! We're not supposed
to fight each other;

32
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,220
you know that.

33
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,180
Truth is, Berserker...

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,767
Sometimes I think that you're
better suited to be our leader.

35
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:03,401
Won't be much longer now.

36
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:05,569
The seeds have
been planted.

37
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:14,287
My deathblow, huh?

38
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:16,330
Hey Kenichi, I just
thought you should know

39
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,541
that you already
have a death blow...

40
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,751
but it seems like you haven't
figured that out, ya know?

41
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:21,711
Lately when I'm
in a fight,

42
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:22,837
I get so involved in it

43
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:24,755
I'm not thinking about
what moves I'm using-

44
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:26,465
so I don't even know what
she's talking about.

45
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:29,844
Shinpaku!

46
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:31,637
Oh no.

47
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:40,438
Shinpaku!

48
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:42,356
Sharpen up those salutes, men!

49
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,108
Straight arms...! And you!

50
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:46,444
Why aren't your feet
shoulder-width apart? !

51
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:49,238
Niijima! Why are you
making them do that?

52
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:51,490
Shinpaku!

53
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,825
You're drifting
up too high again.

54
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:54,827
You wanna keep
your arm down.

55
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:57,580
No! How'd they suck
you guys into this?

56
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,748
Shin...

57
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,916
Oh, hey, Kenichi...!
Check us out...!

58
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,877
We're lookin'
pretty sharp, huh?

59
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:04,795
Shinpaku!

60
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,297
Damn! I'm too late.

61
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:07,590
They've been infected.

62
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:12,636
Huh. Your deathblow. Sure...!

63
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:14,555
You used it that one
time, don't you remember?

64
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,848
I did? When?

65
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:17,975
You talking about
your Killer Combo?

66
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:19,894
Huh...? My what combo?

67
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:21,687
I've got in my
log right here. See...?

68
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:23,647
It's what I'm naming
the combination of moves

69
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:26,692
you used to school Loki at
the Matsue Lark that time.

70
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,486
A karate move
called Yamazuki...

71
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:30,821
followed by a Muay
Thai Kao Loi...

72
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:32,656
and then a Chinese
martial arts head butt...

73
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:34,283
You finished him off
with a judo move

74
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:36,660
called the Falling Tree.

75
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,788
I'm calling it
your Killer Combo.

76
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:41,707
Yeah, that's the one,
pretty impressive stuff...

77
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:43,417
a move that combines all
the different kinds

78
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,377
of martial arts training
you've learned...

79
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:48,672
I'd say it's a fitting
death blow for you, Kenichi.

80
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:50,341
A combination using
all the different

81
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:52,301
fighting techniques
I'm learning.

82
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:53,886
Oh! I almost forgot.

83
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:55,721
I have some information
that might be interesting

84
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,431
to you do-gooders.

85
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,058
There's a new hotspot
in town offering

86
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:01,727
underage gambling over
one-on-one combat.

87
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:03,229
They're betting on fights?

88
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,522
Apparently one of
the eight fists

89
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:06,315
and his followers
started it all.

90
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,404
The seventh fist, Thor...

91
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:15,199
He uses Sumo wrestling
moves in street fights.

92
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,742
It's rare for me to
get my hands on

93
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,494
such detailed information

94
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:20,746
about any of the Fists
whereabouts, Kenichi...

95
00:05:20,746 --> 00:05:22,164
Very rare...

96
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:24,792
If I were you I
wouldn't waste it.

97
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,627
What, so you want me to
just attack them head-on?

98
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,421
Yes, exactly.

99
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,714
I'd watch my step if
I were you, buddy...

100
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:33,050
He's probably just using
you for his own gain again.

101
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,594
Well...? Is he right,
Niijima, are you using me?

102
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:38,264
-Yes.
-Of course.

103
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:41,142
You stupid alien parasite!

104
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:43,978
What...? This doesn't
change anything!

105
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:45,896
You wanna hit Ragnarok
where it hurts,

106
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:47,565
you're gonna have to face
one of the Fists sometime

107
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:48,858
and you know it!

108
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:50,568
You have to defeat the
ones the riff raff

109
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:52,570
are afraid of or
what's the point?

110
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:55,990
He's right...

111
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,366
I hate to fall in with
one of Niijima's

112
00:05:57,366 --> 00:06:00,035
ridiculous plans again...

113
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:01,245
but Ragnarok's dangerous.

114
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:03,122
They have to be stopped!

115
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:04,582
No kidding.

116
00:06:04,582 --> 00:06:06,375
You're finally taking
the fight to them, huh?

117
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,752
Good for you, kid.
It's about time.

118
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:11,672
Well... I haven't really
decided anything for sure...

119
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,424
I guess I just I don't
know how I feel about

120
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:15,634
instigating violence;
you know what I mean?

121
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:17,428
It's true that the art
of karate teaches us

122
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:20,473
not to instigate violence
without provocation...

123
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:22,349
but those jackasses
kidnapped your sister-

124
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,810
I say we call this
one a counterattack.

125
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,938
Yeah... it's just martial arts
are meant for self defense...

126
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,024
I'm not sure when using
my training on my enemies

127
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:31,692
first is justified.

128
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,408
I'm trying to have a
serious conversation here!

129
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:41,160
What's wrong with you? !

130
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,620
(ahh)... I'm sorry...

131
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,788
That's just a bit
nostalgic for us.

132
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:46,498
What do you mean?

133
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:47,875
Well...

134
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,253
this is a line all martial
artists must learn to negotiate.

135
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:52,838
I remember tiptoeing
around it myself

136
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:55,049
when I was about
this little.

137
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:58,719
Apachai also worry this way
from the moment he was born.

138
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,346
Don't worry about it...

139
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:02,973
It's just another
part of your training.

140
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:05,434
It's okay if you haven't
found the answer...

141
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:08,437
You just keep thinking about
it like you're doing now...

142
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:10,773
and one day, when the
answer comes to you,

143
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:12,399
it'll be your own.

144
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:20,908
They didn't really
answer my question--

145
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,159
they just shrugged me off.

146
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,079
I see what they
mean, though,

147
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,664
it's kind of a
personal question.

148
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:28,165
-It is?
-But...

149
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:29,667
just this once...

150
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,627
I think... you should
fight... 'Kay?

151
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:33,087
I should fight...?
Just like that.

152
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,424
You'll try your best not
to hurt anyone too badly,

153
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,718
of course, and to resolve
this all quickly...

154
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:41,095
But I'm sure you'll
be very honorable

155
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:42,763
about the whole thing.

156
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:46,809
I should fight...

157
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:48,394
but still be honorable...

158
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:49,603
Right.

159
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,112
Well look at that...

160
00:07:58,112 --> 00:07:59,280
I don't know
what happened...

161
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,990
but I think you're ready.

162
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:04,743
Alright then...

163
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:06,579
let's go crash us a party.

164
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:16,297
Yeah!

165
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,465
Kick his ass!

166
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,092
That's where Thor
and his lackeys

167
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:22,761
gather their little
gentleman's club.

168
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:26,056
Other than a few
bloodthirsty bystanders,

169
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:28,851
almost everyone here is
a member of Ragnarok...

170
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:31,145
If we attack them head-on we'll
be lucky to come out alive.

171
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:33,022
Maybe not.

172
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:35,024
As part of my training,
my karate master taught me

173
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:38,068
how to win a fight when
you're heavily outnumbered.

174
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:40,904
Now sometimes the numbers
aren't gonna be in your favor...

175
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:42,740
When that happens, the
worst thing you can do is

176
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,284
lose your energy right
before you fight the boss.

177
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:47,369
So you fight the strongest
guy you can find,

178
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:48,912
right off the bat.

179
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:50,164
I can't even warm up,

180
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:52,875
I have to start with the
strongest guy? That's stupid.

181
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,835
I see...

182
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,421
So you wanna go mano a
mano with the boss, huh?

183
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,339
Yeah, but only if you
can come up with

184
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:01,008
a way to make it happen.

185
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,509
Come on, Niijima...

186
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,595
It's our only chance.

187
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,432
I guess I can
think of something.

188
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:10,059
Alright, listen up, boys...!

189
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,686
I want you to blend in
with the audience for now.

190
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,563
Not you two...! You'll
have to stay here

191
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:16,732
or someone'll recognize you.

192
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:18,609
I told you to stop
ordering me around!

193
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:20,194
Calm down...

194
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:22,029
Don't you know the real
heroes of the story

195
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,365
always show up at the last
minute to save the day?

196
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:32,557
Hold it! Who told you
about this place?

197
00:09:32,557 --> 00:09:34,183
Actually, it was
Taichi Koga,

198
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:35,643
so I suggest you get
out of our way.

199
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:36,811
Koga the Kicker?

200
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:39,314
Man, I didn't know...!
Go on in, sorry!

201
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:41,107
Thank you! (Come on)

202
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,318
I almost forgot what
a good liar he is.

203
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:44,694
It's almost scary!

204
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,032
Hey Look! It's the
Shinpaku Alliance!

205
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:50,575
Uh oh...!

206
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:52,118
-That's bad.
-Great, Niijima!

207
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:53,369
How'd they know?

208
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:55,204
Matsui! You idiot!

209
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:56,247
What are you doing? !

210
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:57,665
Put it away!

211
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:02,629
Doesn't matter if
we're recognized now.

212
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:05,089
Dude...! You gotta
put the flag down now!

213
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:06,382
No! Never...!

214
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:08,468
I can't let this symbol of
justice touch the ground!

215
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:15,058
Where is the
Shinpaku Alliance?

216
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:16,726
He's here...! It's
him, Kenichi,

217
00:10:16,726 --> 00:10:18,770
the Seventh Fist
of Ragnarok, Thor!

218
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:24,984
-That guy is huge.
-Watch out, Kenichi!

219
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:36,371
Just stop this pointless
violence, you delinquents!

220
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:40,124
Oh what manners...!

221
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:41,501
I'd have thought
Ragnarok members

222
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:43,753
would be much better
trained, such a pity...

223
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:45,588
The Shinpaku Alliance
comes all the way out here

224
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:47,674
to extend a direct
challenge to the Seventh Fist

225
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:49,342
and look
what happens...

226
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:52,095
His idiot gang ambushes
an innocent audience!

227
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:53,304
He's doing it!

228
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:56,349
He's manipulating them
just like we planned.

229
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:58,101
No they did not...!

230
00:10:58,101 --> 00:11:00,603
If anything, you're the ones
who ambushed us...!

231
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:02,355
I was just inside mindin'
my own business.

232
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:03,940
Of course! And we're not
judging you for hiding!

233
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,984
It's completely
understandable.

234
00:11:05,984 --> 00:11:07,193
Start laughing.

235
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,410
Oh look, the great big Sumo
wrestler's growling at us...!

236
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,870
Too bad... I guess that's
all he's gonna do.

237
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:21,999
Hey...! You
wanna fight me? !

238
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:24,085
Uh oh...! Now he's mad!

239
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:25,962
I'll take on any challenger
who's stupid enough

240
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:28,548
to get in my
way on purpose!

241
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:30,550
I held up my end
of the bargain...

242
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,926
Now he's all yours.

243
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:34,053
Yeah... Thanks, I think...

244
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:35,596
But I wish you'd warned
me your end of the bargain

245
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:37,348
was gonna make
him so angry.

246
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:40,768
Are you ready...? Come out
and face me, challenger!

247
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,019
I came here to make
a bet with you, Thor,

248
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:43,354
not just
looking for a fight!

249
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:44,731
Make a bet...?!

250
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:47,483
You're already gambling
with your life, loser!

251
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:49,068
Now listen up,
here's the deal...!

252
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:50,403
I don't care what
you want from me

253
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:51,988
if you manage to
win this fight...

254
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:55,116
But if I win there's only
one thing I want from you!

255
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:57,577
I want you to leave
the Ragnarok gang...

256
00:11:57,577 --> 00:11:59,370
And stop fighting.

257
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:03,207
Laughter.

258
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:04,667
What's wrong, Thor,
are you scared of him?

259
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,836
-Shut up!
-And stop.

260
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:08,463
Alright, fine...

261
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:10,757
I accept your
ridiculous terms.

262
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:12,967
But I've got some
terms of my own!

263
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:15,511
Terms of his own?
That's not good.

264
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:17,680
We're losing momentum!

265
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,724
Hah...! So
let's hear them!

266
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:21,184
I accept!

267
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:23,895
You what? ! That's
terrible negotiation!

268
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:26,147
He just wrote this
guy a blank check!

269
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:28,066
Good... We'll
fight in the pit.

270
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:32,361
Don't you ruin my carefully
laid plans, big shot!

271
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:33,946
Thank you for everything
you've done, Niijima...

272
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:36,324
I couldn't have gotten this
far tonight without your help.

273
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:38,159
You couldn't have?

274
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:41,913
Listen, if his request
is that you give up

275
00:12:41,913 --> 00:12:43,456
the Shinpaku Alliance
you're just gonna have

276
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:45,249
to find some way to
talk him out of it.

277
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:47,085
Wha...? Okay...

278
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:49,003
If that's the bet,
I'll lose on purpose.

279
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:51,005
Hey! Kenichi Shirihama...!
You coming?

280
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:55,343
Yeah... but how did
you know my name?

281
00:12:55,343 --> 00:12:57,595
My friend Siegfried told
me to look out for a kid

282
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:59,305
in the Shinpaku
Alliance...

283
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:01,557
He said the kid's called
Kenichi Shirihama

284
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:04,101
and he's a small
guy with good eyes.

285
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:06,687
Thor, I'm going on a
journey of self discovery.

286
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:11,109
Siegfried?

287
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:12,944
He thought you were
worthy of fighting...

288
00:13:12,944 --> 00:13:14,946
and Siegfried has
good eyes, too.

289
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:25,248
Shinpaku!

290
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:27,959
We fight in this four
sided metal arena...

291
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,961
and we don't stop
until one of us admits

292
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:32,797
his defeat or until one
of us cannot stand.

293
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:34,340
Prepare yourself...

294
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,883
Shirihama!

295
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,218
I--Wait!

296
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:38,469
Here I come!

297
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:39,720
Hey! Who said I was ready? !

298
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:45,977
Not many men can dodge a
blow from me like that.

299
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:47,103
Aren't you supposed to
explain your terms

300
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:48,646
to me before we fight?

301
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:50,857
Sure... If that's
what you want...

302
00:13:50,857 --> 00:13:52,817
I only have one
demand here.

303
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:55,194
After I pound you
into the ground...

304
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:00,950
You're going to dedicate
yourself to remaking

305
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,661
the face of the Sumo
wrestling world!

306
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:05,872
I whaaa?

307
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:20,386
Siggy's one of the strongest
fighters I know...

308
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:22,722
If you could beat someone
as fierce as him...

309
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:24,640
I must have
you on my side!

310
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,143
Um... You want me to
practice Sumo?

311
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,480
No, I want you to
be one of the best!

312
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,107
Thanks for the meal!

313
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:37,194
But Kenichi... Why are you
leaving Ryouzanpaku? !

314
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:38,946
No...! Can't
let that happen!

315
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,740
Now! Let's do this thing!

316
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:48,039
You have no idea...

317
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,458
just how strong a Sumo
wrestler's body is

318
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,169
and how powerful
he can be!

319
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:56,714
Your puny fists have no
effect on me, little boy!

320
00:14:56,714 --> 00:14:58,090
Bastard!

321
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,554
Underneath all the fat on my
body is a layer of muscle

322
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:05,640
like a suit of armor!

323
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:11,562
A Sumo fighter's hit
isn't like a punch-

324
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,230
-its force is spread out...

325
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,441
so we don't wear gloves
for protection...

326
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:17,401
Not like those scrawny
boxers who wrap their

327
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:19,695
fists up so no
one gets hurt!

328
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:21,197
Hey! Who're you
callin' scrawny? !

329
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:22,073
Easy there.

330
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:24,825
How do you like that?

331
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:29,246
This guy's a monster!

332
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,957
How about this? !

333
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:37,046
The strength of my leg muscles
is my ultimate weapon...

334
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:39,173
I've altered sumo moves
to account for them

335
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:41,175
and developed a new
fighting technique...

336
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:43,135
I call it Fighting Sumo...!

337
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:44,178
You like it?

338
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:47,848
No. Impossible!

339
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:52,770
I have to admit,
that really hurt!

340
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,063
No way...!

341
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:56,565
How can he still be able
to stand after that?

342
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:01,153
So let me just make
sure we're clear...

343
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:02,571
you meant what
you said...?

344
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:05,241
You swear you'll leave Ragnarok
if I beat you in this match,

345
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:06,409
fair and square?

346
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:10,913
I wouldn't hold your breath on
winning here tonight, kid...

347
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:12,665
But I will tell you
that a Sumo man

348
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:15,126
always keeps his promise.

349
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,544
Think about it.

350
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:19,338
Haven't you ever heard
of a Judge's Seppuku?

351
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:20,965
Yeah... I think so...

352
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:23,009
it's when... a judge...
makes a mistake.

353
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,135
You idiot!

354
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:25,761
Why do you think the judge
of the highest ranked

355
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:28,764
Sumo wrestling match has a
knife with him in the ring...?!

356
00:16:28,764 --> 00:16:30,933
It's because he's sworn to
use it to commit seppuku

357
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:32,852
if he makes any error in
judgment during the fight!

358
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:37,189
Man that's an
extreme sport.

359
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:38,649
Sumo was never
meant to be a sport

360
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,526
you ignorant
little pipsqueak!

361
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:42,028
It's a martial art that
great men have dedicated

362
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:43,988
their lives to
just like... me!!

363
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:52,830
And someday... when I've
finished my training...

364
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,249
I'll show the world!!

365
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,126
My Fighting Sumo
technique will be taught

366
00:16:57,126 --> 00:16:59,920
in every athletics class,
in every school...

367
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,714
There will be Sumo rings
in all the parks

368
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:03,299
for children to learn...

369
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:06,844
and they'll all hope
someday to master my craft!

370
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:08,137
The men considered
most handsome

371
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:10,056
will have Sumo
fighter's bodies!

372
00:17:10,056 --> 00:17:12,266
Y'want my hot body?

373
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,894
My fighting technique
will rise above all other

374
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:16,854
martial arts as the most
sought after discipline

375
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:18,272
in the world!

376
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:20,775
This guy's ambitions are
even bigger than his body.

377
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:24,153
No joke, but I like what he
said about handsome big guys.

378
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:25,654
That's disgusting.

379
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:28,866
And that's why I
can't let you win.

380
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:30,534
I have a dream, too...

381
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:32,078
It's to put a
stop to Ragnarok!

382
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:36,999
You really don't get what
I've been saying at all,

383
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,459
do you Shirihama...?

384
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:40,503
That- won't- work!

385
00:17:40,503 --> 00:17:42,713
You have to retreat...!
Don't let him catch you!

386
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:50,304
I see...! That's why
they're in the ring!

387
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,056
It doesn't matter how much
faster some one is-

388
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:53,849
-they can't get too far
away--all that counts is

389
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:55,518
how powerful
your attacks are!

390
00:17:55,518 --> 00:17:57,603
Do you get it now?
รกThis is pointless...

391
00:17:57,603 --> 00:17:59,063
There's no way you
can win against me

392
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:00,606
while we're playing
by my rules,

393
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:01,690
so why don't you
give up now?

394
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:06,445
Just accept your new place
training by my sideรก

395
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:08,656
And together we will usher
in the age of Sumo!

396
00:18:11,742 --> 00:18:13,327
What should he do? He can't
attack and he can't evade.

397
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:14,995
I don't know.

398
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:16,997
With that metal ring he
can't foul himself out either,

399
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:18,582
how's he s'posed to get
outta this one alive?

400
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:23,129
You two really don't know
Kenichi at all, do you...?

401
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:25,089
Look closer.

402
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,591
I've seen Kenichi in a lot
of tough spots in his life,

403
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:29,635
and if he really wanted
to run away I'd know.

404
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:34,723
So this ring...

405
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:37,059
It's just like any other
Sumo ring, is that right?

406
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:38,978
Yeah, that's right...

407
00:18:38,978 --> 00:18:40,521
so what's your point, kid?

408
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:52,116
Oooh. So you're gonna
fight me head on, are ya?

409
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:54,827
Should be interesting!

410
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:00,693
You know your punches
won't affect me--

411
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:03,237
I'm curious to see what
you have in mind.

412
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:04,655
Yamazuki...!

413
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:06,532
Kao Loi...!

414
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:07,700
Headbutt!

415
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,992
Yeeees...

416
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:10,411
He's doing it...! Hah!

417
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:11,787
Yeah, but something
isn't right, look!

418
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,542
And the Falling Treeee...

419
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:18,293
The Falling Tree is
a good maneuver

420
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:19,795
if your opponent is
about your size.

421
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:21,171
Or smaller...

422
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:22,881
But with such a big
difference between them...

423
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:28,012
That knee thing actually
hurt a little bit...

424
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:30,305
But just a little.

425
00:19:31,056 --> 00:19:32,641
Now let go!

426
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:35,310
There.

427
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:45,154
Where did he find all
the power for that?

428
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,325
Why do you think I made him
the leader of the Shinpaku?

429
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,375
No way...!

430
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,877
That's impossible!

431
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:12,306
The Falling Tree!

432
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:19,271
Whoa!

433
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:26,528
Quick! Finish
these losers off

434
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:28,697
while they're still in the
shock of humiliation!

435
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:29,948
Don't do that!

436
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:31,575
Oh...

437
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:33,243
no... you won't!

438
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:34,828
Stop, all of you!

439
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,125
This is his victory...

440
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,627
He played by the rules...

441
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:43,212
And he beat me
fair and square.

442
00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:48,842
But... you're just gonna
let him walk away?

443
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:56,850
A true Sumo fighter would
not dishonor his craft

444
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,310
by ignoring the
terms he agreed to

445
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,770
at the beginning
of the match.

446
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,396
No matter what the
outcome may be!

447
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,733
After all that talk
about Sumo honor

448
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,401
he can't very well
ignore his own rules,

449
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,778
now can he...?

450
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:09,530
That's his weakness.

451
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,449
Of course... Not everyone here
considers honor a weakness

452
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:14,368
like you, you
freak of nature.

453
00:21:14,368 --> 00:21:17,037
I can't believe my Fighting
Sumo technique is dead...

454
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:19,456
That was my dream-
what do I do now?

455
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:22,459
What are you
talking about?

456
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:24,169
All I wanted from you if
you lost was a promise

457
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:26,630
that you'd quit
Ragnarok...

458
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,966
I don't remember asking
you to give up any dream.

459
00:21:31,844 --> 00:21:33,804
I hope you keep developing
your new Sumo technique,

460
00:21:33,804 --> 00:21:35,305
just like you planned...

461
00:21:35,305 --> 00:21:38,350
I think it's a
amazing idea...

462
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,310
I wish you luck.

463
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,522
Well I'll be damned...

464
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:45,691
You are a pretty interesting
guy, aren't you?

465
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:55,200
I think we'll fight again
sometime without the ring!

466
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,869
Uh, yeah, I tell you what,
I'll think about it

467
00:21:56,869 --> 00:21:59,079
when my internal
injuries finish healing!

468
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,497
You did it!

469
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:02,457
We knew you could
beat him, General!

470
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:04,084
Whoa, hold on.

471
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:05,335
Guys, I'm still
in a lot of pain!

472
00:22:05,335 --> 00:22:07,421
ah...! Lemme
down, seriously!

473
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:09,464
ahh! I really don't
mind walking!!

474
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:14,928
Well, Shinpaku leader...

475
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:16,763
You have some pretty well
trained followers

476
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:18,807
for one of them to
fight like that.

477
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:20,100
Followers...?

478
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,810
tsk tsk...

479
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,021
Kenichi Shirihama's
no follower.

480
00:22:24,021 --> 00:22:26,189
Just a bad friend.

481
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:30,235
A friend...

482
00:22:30,235 --> 00:22:31,987
So that's it...

483
00:22:31,987 --> 00:22:33,530
I knew there was something
different about this

484
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,491
Alliance of theirs, I
couldn't put my finger on...

485
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:37,743
The difference is,

486
00:22:37,743 --> 00:22:39,620
they actually seem to like
the guy they're following.

487
00:22:43,123 --> 00:22:45,000
Men! Take us
onward and upward,

488
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,336
to infinityyyyyy and beyond!

489
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:48,837
Owowowowowow!

490
00:22:48,837 --> 00:22:50,213
Niijima! Get off!

491
00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:51,924
I'm one big
bruise already!

492
00:22:51,924 --> 00:23:23,080
[Music]

493
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:20,929
Hey! Kenichi, isn't that
Kisara from Ragnarok

494
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:22,681
over there by that alley?

495
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:23,890
Huh.

496
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,351
Yeah, I think it is...!
But what's she doing...?

497
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:28,353
She's kicking boxes...

498
00:24:28,353 --> 00:24:30,022
there's a cat in that box!

499
00:24:30,022 --> 00:24:31,356
And she's kicking it!

500
00:24:31,356 --> 00:24:33,025
We have to go kill her.

501
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:34,985
Whaaaaat? Miu! Calm down.

502
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:37,029
Eaaasy!

503
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:38,655
Don't worry. I'm kidding.

504
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:41,366
I'll only rip out the
unnecessary organs.

505
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:43,243
I've never seen
you like this, Miu.

506
00:24:43,243 --> 00:24:46,079
You're actually
kind of... scary!
