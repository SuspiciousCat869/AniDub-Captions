[Music]

2
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:40,430
Please Elder...

3
00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:44,560
I need you to teach me
a death blow technique.

4
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,813
Why are you asking about death
blows all of a sudden, boy?

5
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:50,190
Because every martial
artist should have one...!

6
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,234
Whether its some kind of
ultimate punch of doom thingy...

7
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:54,444
or maybe its some kind of
super crazy kicking fury...

8
00:01:54,444 --> 00:01:56,280
or maybe some kind of
awesome combination of both.

9
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,699
You know...
Something special...

10
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:01,159
Now that I've become
a real martial artist.

11
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,036
I mean, everyone else has
some kind of finishing move

12
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:04,705
and I should too...

13
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:06,874
I don't wanna stick
out like a sore thumb.

14
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:08,333
Now hold on...

15
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,878
A death blow is not
something that can be taught-

16
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,588
you have to invent it...

17
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:14,339
You have to look deep
within yourself

18
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:16,425
in order to find it...

19
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:18,176
Then it will come to you.

20
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:19,845
But before you
do anything else

21
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:21,054
I suggest you decide

22
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:23,807
what kind of fighter you
want to become, Kenichi.

23
00:02:23,807 --> 00:02:25,517
Gotcha...!

24
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:26,893
I just need to figure
out the characteristics

25
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:28,061
of my style first.

26
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:29,438
I'll start tomorrow!

27
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:30,939
I'll pay close attention
to my training

28
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,566
so I can invent
my death blow!

29
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:39,656
Is he training by himself?

30
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:43,785
I knew it, he's totally
helpless without me.

31
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:44,995
I can't wait...

32
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:46,371
Wow...

33
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:48,624
I'm telling you my death
blow is gonna be awesome-

34
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:50,000
just you wait and see!

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,877
I see you're just
as stupid as ever.

36
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:56,381
What kind of death blow
are you gonna come up with?

37
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:57,549
The "super pansy
ear flick"?

38
00:02:57,549 --> 00:02:59,176
Who said that?!
Come out here?!

39
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,975
Renka...?!

40
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:08,810
But what are you
doing here?!

41
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,562
How did you
find Ryozanpaku?!

42
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:12,356
I got Hakubi good 'n drunk

43
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:15,192
and he told me all
about this place.

44
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:18,612
It's nice to meet you- I'm
Kensay Ma's daughter, Renka...

45
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:21,448
I've come here to bring my
father back to China with me.

46
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:23,367
So, you're Kensei's daughter-

47
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:25,077
make yourself at home...

48
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:26,161
Nice to meet you.

49
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:28,246
I'm happy you remember me...!

50
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:30,957
I thought for sure you
would've forgotten me by now.

51
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:34,169
Don't be silly how could
I ever forget you, Renka.

52
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:36,046
Yeah... I'm learning a bunch
of different disciplines

53
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:37,214
at the moment...

54
00:03:37,214 --> 00:03:39,675
Let's see, there's Karate,
and Jujitsu, and Muay...

55
00:03:39,675 --> 00:03:41,551
What is this, a
dinner buffet?

56
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:42,427
You don't just take
one of everything

57
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:43,804
and see what tastes good!

58
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:45,389
You pick a discipline and
stick with it, you jerk!

59
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,099
Well, I'm sure you
wanna see your dad

60
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,350
so I'll go and
get him for ya

61
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,061
Thanks but that's
not necessary.

62
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:53,146
Just where do you think
you're going Daddy?

63
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:54,731
Oh no, forgive
me, Renka...

64
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,442
But I'm not ready to go
back to China just yet.

65
00:03:57,442 --> 00:03:59,319
I'll tell mama
about Ryouzanpaku!

66
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:02,614
No... Please
don't do that...!

67
00:04:02,614 --> 00:04:04,908
You don't want mama
to kill your daddy!

68
00:04:04,908 --> 00:04:07,411
You ditched the Phoenix Alliance
and left mama and Hakubi

69
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:09,830
in charge of your
10,000 disciples!

70
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,123
When are you gonna
stop goofing off

71
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:12,582
and come back to China?!

72
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:14,251
But I'm not goofing off...!

73
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:16,002
The masters of Ryozanpaku

74
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,255
are training history's
strongest disciple!

75
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:20,132
Surely you're not
talking about this loser?!

76
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:21,216
Hey...

77
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:23,844
I guess...

78
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:25,846
I can see why you've
been so busy...

79
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:28,223
I mean, that weakling needs
all the help he can get.

80
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:29,766
I'm a weakling?

81
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,102
What's with all
the excitement?

82
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:33,353
Yeah, what's happening?

83
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:35,897
What?! You're
Kensei's daughter?!

84
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:37,065
It's nice to meet you...

85
00:04:37,065 --> 00:04:38,608
My name's Renka.

86
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,819
Now I know you told us
that you had kids...

87
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,738
But I gotta admit I never
would've expected

88
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:45,073
you to give birth to such
a good lookin' girl.

89
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:48,493
Mama gave birth- not me.

90
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:50,829
Yeah, but you don't look
like you helped at all...

91
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,873
How come she not
bald with a mustache?

92
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:53,957
She's a woman.

93
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:56,710
So I guess you're
really serious

94
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,587
about taking your dad
back to China with you,

95
00:04:58,587 --> 00:04:59,421
aren't you Renka?

96
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:00,547
Of course I am!

97
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:02,799
And since you're
his best disciple...

98
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:05,802
I think you should come back
to China with us, Kenichi!

99
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:08,555
That is not gonna happen.

100
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:10,807
Oh I'm sorry I didn't
mean to interrupt.

101
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:17,189
I swear this isn't
what it looks like Miu-

102
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:18,982
this girl barely knows me...!

103
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,650
Listen I'm never
gonna leave Ryozanpaku

104
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,319
so you should just
give it up already...!

105
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,612
Now if you'll excuse me

106
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:25,489
I have to go and think
about my death blow.

107
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:29,618
What is this
weird feeling?!

108
00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:35,332
I've had a change
of heart, Daddy.

109
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:38,418
We can hold off on China.

110
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:40,587
I think a change of
scenery would be nice...

111
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:42,589
So I'm gonna stay here
for couple of days.

112
00:05:53,058 --> 00:05:56,061
The characteristics of my
style of martial arts...

113
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:58,396
How the hell am I
gonna figure that out?

114
00:05:58,396 --> 00:05:59,231
You're not gonna
do it alone.

115
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:01,858
Want some help?

116
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:05,320
Who knows? Maybe a little
sparring will help inspire you.

117
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,446
I think that's
a great idea...

118
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:07,531
But I think
it'd be better

119
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:09,032
if you sparred
with somebody new

120
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:10,826
cause you just might learn
something about yourself,

121
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:12,953
you know?

122
00:06:12,953 --> 00:06:14,496
Well, I guess
you have a point.

123
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:15,580
Told ya.

124
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:20,544
I'd probably be better
off sparring with Miu.

125
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,712
That's okay. I've got plenty
of other things to do.

126
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:23,797
See ya!

127
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:28,051
Go ants go!

128
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:33,348
What is with this
crazy feeling?!

129
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:35,100
Hey everybody!
Its time for dinner!

130
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,271
Goodness that looks great!

131
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:40,605
What's the occasion?

132
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:41,731
Apa!

133
00:06:41,731 --> 00:06:43,859
Even though she wants
him to go back to China

134
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:46,736
I thought we should celebrate
Kensei and Renka's reunion...

135
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:48,321
So I made something
a little bit special.

136
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:51,408
I'm sorry Kenichi...

137
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:53,869
but I thought that you might
be trying to grope me...

138
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:56,496
So punching you in the
nose was just a reflex.

139
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:58,540
Why are you going
easy on him, Renka?!

140
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:04,379
Hey Miu why's my dinner smaller
than everyone else's...?

141
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,382
And of a different species?

142
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:08,508
I'll give you mine...

143
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:09,634
-Say 'Ah!'
-Thanks...

144
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:10,594
Ah!

145
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,016
Miu could I have another
bowl of rice, please?

146
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:17,851
You've got rice
on your face.

147
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:20,770
Here you go, Kenichi.

148
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,739
Thank you so much
for the lovely meal.

149
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:31,990
It was no problem at all.

150
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,033
Did you have enough food?

151
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:34,826
Do you want some rice...?

152
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:36,369
Just say "Ah!"

153
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:40,415
Oh, I can get
you your own!

154
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:42,709
Um... I... don't
want anymore.

155
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,885
Wow I've never seen Miu
in such a bad mood before...

156
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:53,219
I get the impression

157
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:56,097
that she doesn't really like
Renka hanging around Ryozanpaku.

158
00:07:56,097 --> 00:07:57,349
I was so scared at dinner

159
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:59,142
that I didn't
know what to do.

160
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:03,688
I didn't want it
to come to this...

161
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:06,274
but... as long as
I have it with me.

162
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:08,693
Death blows even a
monkey can learn!

163
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:10,612
If my masters caught
me reading a Daigakukan

164
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:13,198
"How-to" on death blows
they would kill me.

165
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:14,366
But something
about reading

166
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,785
always seems to help
to calm me down.

167
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:17,869
What are you reading?

168
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,289
What's the matter...?

169
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:22,874
Why are you
trying to hide it?

170
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:24,626
It's nothing!
Forget about it, okay?

171
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:26,586
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about-

172
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,838
is that the kinda stuff
you're in to...? Well?

173
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:30,715
She thinks I'm reading
something perverted...!

174
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:32,425
Wait, who cares
what she thinks.

175
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:34,928
That means my
secret is safe.

176
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:36,304
Come on! Let me see it...!
Just really quick!

177
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:38,098
Now way...!
Forget about it!

178
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:42,978
I feel horrible about
acting that way at dinner.

179
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:45,730
Hopefully these snacks
will help him forgive me.

180
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,023
Ow that hurt!

181
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:48,066
Don't touch me like that!

182
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,276
Be more gentle!

183
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:51,361
It's kinda hard
to control myself

184
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:52,862
when you're on top
of me like this!

185
00:08:56,574 --> 00:08:58,743
Apachai, how would you
like a little snack?

186
00:08:58,743 --> 00:08:59,577
Apa!

187
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:03,540
There's only one way to
destroy the evidence! Eat it!

188
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,625
I just can't seem
to figure you out.

189
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:11,423
The masters here took you
on as a disciple despite

190
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,757
the fact that you lack

191
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:15,427
any kind of natural
marital arts ability...

192
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:18,471
You must have worked really
hard to get where you are now.

193
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,598
But what made you decide to
start learning martial arts?

194
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:21,808
Why didn't you
just give up

195
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:23,601
after the first time
someone beat you?

196
00:09:26,187 --> 00:09:27,856
I have someone
to look up to.

197
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:30,066
Oh really?

198
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:31,318
Yeah...

199
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:32,819
You see, there's
this girl I know

200
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:34,821
who took on a gang of
delinquents all by herself

201
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:37,365
without ever giving
it a second thought.

202
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:40,368
She didn't freak out or get
scared like most people would.

203
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:42,328
She faced them like
it was nothing.

204
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:45,665
And when I finally
saw her fighting style,

205
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:47,751
which is as smooth
as the wind,

206
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:50,170
something in me
changed forever...

207
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,756
I realized that I deeply
respected this girl...

208
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:54,424
and I still feel
the same way today.

209
00:09:56,718 --> 00:09:59,554
I know that it's gonna take
me a really long time...

210
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:01,639
even so... my goal
as a martial artist

211
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,559
is to finally be able to
protect her one day...

212
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,394
I train so hard in the
hopes of becoming half

213
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:08,021
as good as she is.

214
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:09,189
That make sense?

215
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:15,653
See...? Its not that
difficult to figure me out.

216
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:19,449
Yeah, I think
I've got it now.

217
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:22,535
Apachai left rice ball for
Miu to give to Kenichi.

218
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,165
Oh, hey. What's up, Renka?

219
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:29,793
We leave now.

220
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:32,796
The only reason he cares about
you is he met you first...

221
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:34,422
You're just lucky,
that's all.

222
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:38,343
Girls are scary...

223
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:45,433
What? You wanna go at it...?

224
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:47,352
Cause I'll take you
on right now.

225
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:52,690
Aw, Renka you make
the cutest cat ever!

226
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,317
Just look at her!
Isn't she precious?!

227
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:56,111
I know Miu loves cats

228
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:58,405
so I'll use that
against her!

229
00:10:58,405 --> 00:11:00,448
Why the hell are you messing
with my head like that?!

230
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:02,367
Not my fault you
fell for it, bimbo!

231
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:09,958
You make me so angry!
I hate you!

232
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,127
That's funny I didn't
know cats could talk-

233
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:13,336
you're not a very
good one, are you?

234
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:21,636
I ate the whole
"How-to" book...!

235
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:23,763
My stomach is killing me...!

236
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:26,266
I can't train anymore.

237
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,143
Well... I can handle this.

238
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:32,564
I could've told you that
it's not good to eat paper.

239
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:35,191
Ow... Do you have
to do that...?

240
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,651
I'm already in pain.

241
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:56,625
I keep thinking about
what the elder said.

242
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,919
I don't know what kind of
fighter I want to become.

243
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,670
What does that even mean?!

244
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,465
I've gotta figure it out if I
wanna create my death blow.

245
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:05,926
So I'll keep
training until I do.

246
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:08,929
Watching you train made me
realize something, Kenichi.

247
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,181
While your death blow training
seems pretty thorough

248
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:13,433
I think its missing one
very important thing...

249
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,852
So if you want me to tell
you what that thing is...

250
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:17,229
I suggest you come
with me tomorrow

251
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:18,647
and I'll show you
what you're missing.

252
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:21,107
What's she gonna do?
Give me a private lesson?

253
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,234
Do you really think that

254
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:24,903
my training is lacking
something... important?

255
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:26,780
Yes, something
very important...

256
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:30,742
Your training needs
to be more fun!

257
00:12:30,742 --> 00:12:33,203
I should be training
at the dojo.

258
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,206
What's the matter, Kenichi?!

259
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,541
Let's go on the
water slide!

260
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,917
Come on!

261
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,961
I'm never gonna come
up with my death blow

262
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,380
if I waste my time hanging
out at the water park.

263
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,798
Take that, bimbo!

264
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,174
Score one for Renka!

265
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:47,425
I'm gonna get close to him

266
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:49,010
and there's no one
here to stop me.

267
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,099
Hey...! What took
you guys so long?

268
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,852
Wait a minute, what are
you guys doing here?

269
00:12:57,852 --> 00:12:59,062
A-pa!

270
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,064
Yup. And I'm here too!

271
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:02,065
But why?!

272
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,233
Why're you so surprised

273
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,068
you're the one who
invited everyone...

274
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:06,903
And you said it
was Kensei's treat.

275
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:08,488
I don't remember
inviting you...

276
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,906
And why would my dad pay?

277
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,869
I put a tracking
device in here

278
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,495
so I could find you...

279
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,206
Tochumaru helped
me with it.

280
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:20,250
Now, I can't let you
have all the fun, Renka.

281
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,211
What kind of idiot father

282
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:25,630
tries to get in the way of his
own daughter's happiness?!

283
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,799
My dear, I'm simply
trying to teach you

284
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:30,468
that happiness is hardly
ever easily attained...

285
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:33,138
I'm sorry but you don't always
get what you want, my dear.

286
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:34,764
Okay it's time to
begin your training.

287
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:35,807
Right!

288
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,434
No more training!

289
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:39,144
Master Ko-et-soo-gee...

290
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:41,813
Dontcha think everyone
deserves a day off?

291
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:43,273
I think you're right...

292
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:45,734
I haven't had a real day
off in a long time...

293
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:47,277
So I'll let the
others train him.

294
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:48,612
I'm sinking...!

295
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:50,196
What's with the dumbbell?!

296
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,574
It'll help you build
muscle in your legs... hush.

297
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:54,451
Look! She's overworking him!

298
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:57,203
No, that weight is much
lighter than the norm.

299
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,663
Remember kids...

300
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:00,790
Don't try any of this
crazy stuff at home!

301
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,958
You have to stay afloat

302
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,336
while keeping your
chest above the water.

303
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:05,462
Next!

304
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:09,549
So what are we gonna do
with this water slide?

305
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,134
Climb up it.

306
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:13,762
Climbing against the current
helps strengthen your legs.

307
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:15,513
-No way.
-Would someone show him...

308
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:17,766
-uh, Miu?
-Sure! No problem!

309
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:19,392
We'll be right behind you.

310
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,352
See you at the top.

311
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:26,524
I said I'm going second...!

312
00:14:26,524 --> 00:14:28,026
-Let go dummy!
-Stop... it...

313
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:29,402
What the hell are you
trying to teach me?!

314
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,529
How to be an old,
bald-headed pervert?!

315
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:37,452
Ahhh!

316
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:38,620
What now?!

317
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,246
She was moving so
incredibly fast

318
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,331
I couldn't catch up to her!

319
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:42,666
Are you ready...?

320
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,876
Cause we're gonna do 100
laps of forward kicks

321
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:46,503
in the 50 meter pool!

322
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:51,216
My feet are
getting heavy...

323
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:52,759
Come over here, Kenichi!

324
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,552
C'mon let's play!

325
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:57,764
Well... I guess it's nice to
have a change of scenery.

326
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,141
Repetition can
make us lazy.

327
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:01,935
Kenichi!

328
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,895
A new atmosphere
is good...

329
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:07,399
It keeps us from becoming
complacent and can inspire us.

330
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,401
Check out that woman
in the loincloth!

331
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:11,861
She's swimming
up the waterfall!

332
00:15:15,031 --> 00:15:17,992
That kinda looks like fun.

333
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:19,202
Those two...

334
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:20,704
What are they doing here?

335
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,499
I- I don't think
I can move.

336
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:25,709
Are you alright, Kenichi?

337
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:27,293
Get your hands off him!
Who do you think you are?!

338
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,670
I'm the one who's supposed
to be taking care of him

339
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,130
not you, you big,
blonde bimbo!

340
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,715
Stand back and give
him some air, would ya?!

341
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:34,342
You're gonna suffocate
him like that!

342
00:15:34,342 --> 00:15:37,137
Would you cut that out!
I hate you!

343
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,555
Ree-ewe and Show-kaht-sue.

344
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:40,098
They work for Hawk-uh-bee!

345
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:41,433
Oh no!

346
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,977
I bet they're here
to take me back!

347
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,895
So, you understand
the mission... right?

348
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:47,605
Yeah... We're to bring
her back to China

349
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:48,690
no matter what...

350
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,483
no going easy
on her either.

351
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,819
Hawk-uh-bee must've told them
about Rio-zahn-pah-koo.

352
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:56,030
We're gonna bring
Renka back to China...

353
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,074
Even if it kills us.

354
00:15:58,074 --> 00:15:59,784
I've got an idea...

355
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:01,286
Come with me, Miu. Hurry!

356
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:03,913
Things are about to
get a little crazy-

357
00:16:03,913 --> 00:16:07,667
for some reason the
Chinese mafia is here.

358
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,253
Since Sougetsu's death
they've targeted Hakubi...

359
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:14,466
I'm worried they may have
come here to take me hostage.

360
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:15,633
Don't try anything.

361
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,260
Just come peacefully
now, Renka...

362
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,386
We don't want trouble.

363
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:28,438
You're not too
bad for a girl.

364
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:30,273
Look, I don't wanna
fight you guys-

365
00:16:30,273 --> 00:16:31,524
not in my swimsuit.

366
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:32,776
Then you shouldn't
have gotten involved

367
00:16:32,776 --> 00:16:34,068
in the first place, huh?

368
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:35,653
Have fun, bimbo.

369
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:37,155
Those guys are
two of the best.

370
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:38,448
Good luck.

371
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,713
Had enough yet?

372
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:01,721
Kenichi!

373
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:02,889
You lay a hand on Miu

374
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,642
and you're gonna have
to answer to me!

375
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:08,228
He didn't lose his balance and
fall when they attacked him!

376
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,022
His legs are so strong
he hardly even budged!

377
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:13,441
Leg strength is crucial
in martial arts...

378
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:14,734
and it looks like
Kenichi's strength

379
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,153
is at an almost
untouchable level!

380
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:20,073
I don't know who you are but
I'll take you on anyway...

381
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:23,368
The name's Ryuu also known
as the Praying Mantis fist.

382
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:26,746
I'm the wielder of the
piercing leg kick... Shokatsu.

383
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,457
I'm the first disciple
of Ryozanpaku, Kenichi...

384
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:30,917
I accept your challenge.

385
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,585
I really wish I
could help him.

386
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,212
I'll just cheer him on!

387
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:36,297
Go Kenichi, I know
you can do it!

388
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,260
Hey, look...!
he's having fun...

389
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,970
He made some
friends at the pool.

390
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,388
But they're gonna fight.

391
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:45,849
Those guys are Hakubi's
top two disciples...

392
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:48,226
They must've been sent to
take Renka back to China.

393
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:49,310
I see...

394
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,437
So they're
Hakubi's men, huh?

395
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,814
I look forward to seeing

396
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:55,692
which of our disciples
comes out on top.

397
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:57,986
Kenichi, be careful...!

398
00:17:57,986 --> 00:18:00,530
Show-kaht-sue's known across
China for his powerful kicks-

399
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,823
so watch out for his legs...!

400
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:03,741
But he'll attack
using his arms too!

401
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:13,251
About time I pull out
my piercing leg kick!

402
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:15,378
That all ya got?!

403
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:16,713
What...?! No way!

404
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:23,887
Such amazing leg power...

405
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:25,930
His masters must've
trained him hard.

406
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,266
Well, of course.

407
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:31,144
Damn you...! I'm
gonna take you down!

408
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,855
Since the first day Kenichi
stepped foot in Ryozanpaku

409
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,274
we've focused his training
on increasing his strength.

410
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:38,735
It's essential when
learning martial arts.

411
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:46,034
You gotta watch out for his
one-two combination punches!

412
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:56,211
You're comin' with me!

413
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:57,837
You bastard!

414
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,426
That wouldn't have happened
if he had worn a loincloth.

415
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:04,802
I tried to tell him.

416
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:09,557
Damn it! This water
is slowing me down!

417
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:14,979
How the hell
did he do that?!

418
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,481
He kicked me out
of the water!

419
00:19:16,481 --> 00:19:17,982
That's beyond
human strength!

420
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,362
Wow it's like he's a completely
different Kenichi...!

421
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,197
But why is he going so far?

422
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:27,617
Oh Kenichi.

423
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:29,786
Even so, my goal
as a martial artist

424
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:32,038
is to finally be able to
protect her one day...

425
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,873
I've gotta keep
his legs pinned!

426
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,544
My breath!

427
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,046
Helpless runt.

428
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,464
Is he laughing at me?!

429
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,362
Get outta there...!

430
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:06,114
I've had enough
of the two of you!

431
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:12,120
Did you just see that?!

432
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,330
Yeah, that was the
coolest thing ever!

433
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,500
Maht-soo-ayy Park has really
stepped up their attractions!

434
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,210
There was even a hot
chick in a loincloth

435
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,378
swimming up the waterfall!

436
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:26,062
I get it now...

437
00:20:26,062 --> 00:20:29,065
So you guys were sent by
Hakubi to take Renka back home.

438
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:31,943
I thought you were members
of the Chinese mafia.

439
00:20:31,943 --> 00:20:33,778
I am really
sorry about that.

440
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,780
You don't have to
apologize to them...

441
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,866
I mean, they're just Hakubi's
lackeys so who cares...?!

442
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:41,953
Ow. I'm sorry my daughter
caused you so much trouble.

443
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:43,246
You know Renka...

444
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:45,581
If you spend all your time
goofing off at the pool...

445
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:47,959
you're never gonna become a
martial artist of our level.

446
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,378
Now, now, calm down...

447
00:20:50,378 --> 00:20:52,255
Well... I must
say I'm surprised,

448
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:54,757
cuz Master Hakubi made
it sound like Ryozanpaku

449
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:56,259
was full of a bunch
of crazy people-

450
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:58,177
but that's not
the case at all...

451
00:20:58,177 --> 00:21:00,179
You all seem
pretty normal.

452
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,265
Anyways, it's you time
to go back home, Renka.

453
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:04,934
Things have been tough for
master Hakubi since you left.

454
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:05,935
What...! Really?!

455
00:21:05,935 --> 00:21:07,562
I'm afraid so...

456
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:09,272
He's been drinking to
ease his loneliness

457
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:10,356
but in his drunken state

458
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:12,149
he's begun attacking
any mafia members

459
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:13,901
he can get his hands on.

460
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:16,988
Renka... Please... come home!

461
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:19,156
Wow, the Ma family
sure is scary.

462
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:21,075
Alright I'll go
back with you.

463
00:21:21,075 --> 00:21:22,785
He's so annoying...

464
00:21:22,785 --> 00:21:26,247
But I guess I really shouldn't
have left him alone like that.

465
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:28,082
Deep down she's
kinda nice.

466
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:35,798
Okay Renka,
let's get going.

467
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:37,717
Hey Kenichi, I just
thought you should know

468
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:39,844
that you already
have a death blow...

469
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:42,305
But it seems like you haven't
figured that out, you know?

470
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:43,890
But... What are
you talking about?

471
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,683
You have these
really awesome moves

472
00:21:45,683 --> 00:21:47,602
that I've seen you use
repeatedly when you're fighting

473
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:49,937
but I don't know
if you realize it...

474
00:21:49,937 --> 00:21:53,107
I noticed while I was watching
you fight the two of them...

475
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:55,151
Since you're not really aware
of the moves you're making

476
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:57,737
you're unable to see their
potential as a death blow...

477
00:21:57,737 --> 00:21:59,905
But I promise
you it's there.

478
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:01,282
Once you've figured
out what it is

479
00:22:01,282 --> 00:22:02,700
and you've learned
how to use it properly

480
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,328
give me a call, okay?

481
00:22:05,328 --> 00:22:07,330
I need someone to
protect me too.

482
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:10,958
You haven't seen the last
of me, ya Blonde Bimbo!

483
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,960
Come back again
soon, kitty!

484
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,878
Meow- meow- meow!

485
00:22:16,297 --> 00:22:18,174
One day that boy's
gonna be mine!

486
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:25,473
So my death blow is something
I may have used before, huh...?

487
00:22:25,473 --> 00:22:28,100
If that's the case, I should
be able to figure it out again.

488
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,978
I appreciate
the hint, Renka.

489
00:22:30,978 --> 00:22:33,105
Um, Shigure...?

490
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:35,900
Next time we go to the
pool can you wear this...?

491
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,027
It's less revealing.

492
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:39,570
Yeah, but that
thing looks...

493
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,072
uncomfortable.

494
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:43,866
Miu shouldn't be pushing that
bathing suit on Shigure...

495
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:47,078
I think she's looks smokin' hot
in that loin cloth, don't you?

496
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:48,621
I think you're an old perv

497
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:51,207
who has a weird obsession with
scantily clad young women.

498
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:57,213
[Music]

499
00:24:18,335 --> 00:24:19,378
Hey guess what, Kenichi!

500
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:20,755
We found Thor's lair!

501
00:24:20,755 --> 00:24:22,381
You know, the Seventh
Fist of Ragnarok?

502
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:24,216
We need to strike
while the iron's hot!

503
00:24:24,216 --> 00:24:26,135
But we can't just go in
there and pick a fight!

504
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:27,219
That's not the
right thing to do.

505
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:28,929
Are you sure about that?

506
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:30,681
Ragnarok keeps
coming after you...

507
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:32,308
why not beat 'em
to the punch?

508
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:34,101
Just think about all the
poor, innocent people

509
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:36,145
who are gonna get hurt
if you don't fight!

510
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:38,397
Come on, go show him
what a hero you are!

511
00:24:38,397 --> 00:24:39,899
If you don't do
it then who will?!

512
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:41,317
Alright, alright,
I get it.

513
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:43,527
But I don't know anything
about the Seventh Fist.

514
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:44,904
Who is this Thor guy?

515
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:46,489
Guess I'm gonna find out.
