1
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:47,962
Kenichi saw an
opening and took it!

2
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,698
Y-you sneaky little
snot-nosed punk!

3
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,575
You waited and struck
me right at the moment

4
00:01:56,575 --> 00:02:01,038
I relaxed my stomach muscles!

5
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,665
Kenichi. A man's worth is
determined by whether or not

6
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,209
he can strike a blow
at the critical moment.

7
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,797
Time to die, punk!

8
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,306
Hey, buddy?

9
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,433
I heard you say you wanted
to challenge a master,

10
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,144
so why are you messin'
with our disciple?

11
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,395
You're Sakaki?!

12
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,148
Sure am. Now how
'bout that challenge?

13
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,692
L-let go! You're crushing
the bones in my wrist!

14
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,944
Hey, Kenichi,

15
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,154
I've been watching you take
care of our guests here.

16
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,865
That was a nice strike.
You barely hesitated at all.

17
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,619
Y-you mean you were here and
watching this whole time?!

18
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,915
C'mon get a grip, it's okay!
You handled it perfectly!

19
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,712
The party's over!

20
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,884
Ow! Kenichi, let go!
You're grabbing me too tight!

21
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,344
I can't breathe and
you're smashing my--

22
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,222
Geez. It's not
over already, is it?

23
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,557
Oh, man, you gotta
be kidding me.

24
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,644
And I thought Crab Head guy
was a ferocious fighter!

25
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:11,108
Master Sakaki makes him look
like a choir boy in comparison!

26
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,527
These guys have gotta be the
lamest bunch of challengers

27
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,737
I've ever faced in this dojo!

28
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,079
Master, there's something I need
to ask you, and it's a matter

29
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,582
of life or death! Would you
please give me a day off?

30
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,917
A break? Why?

31
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,128
Well, if you haven't noticed,
I've been training like crazy

32
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,922
for three weeks straight
without a single day off!

33
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,632
I need a break,
just for one day!

34
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,718
--Say yes! Please, please!
--Sure. Why not?

35
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,262
I thought you'd say that,
but I had to try at least.

36
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,724
Oh, well. Thanks anyway.

37
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,516
You're serious?!

38
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,309
Of course I am. You're right.

39
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,854
You have been training hard
and you deserve a break.

40
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,939
In fact, come to think
of it, we all do!

41
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,191
Let's all go to
the beach tomorrow!

42
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,698
Master, you're the best! Really!

43
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,991
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

44
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:04,035
You've brightened up my
day in more ways than one!

45
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:08,415
Alright! The beach! Woo hoo!

46
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,792
It's been three weeks since
I moved into the dojo.

47
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,294
My skills have
definitely progressed,

48
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,045
but my relationship
with Miu hasn't.

49
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,507
But a day at the beach with
her is gonna change all that!

50
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,092
What? The beach? Really?

51
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,928
Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow
morning! Pack your swimsuit!

52
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,638
Oh, I'll have to
buy a new one.

53
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,892
I've outgrown the one
I bought last year.

54
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:32,105
This top is so tight! I'm
about pop out of this thing!

55
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,857
Oh, God! Thank you for these two

56
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:38,528
very bountiful, bouncing,
bosomy blessings!

57
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,865
Ah! Kenichi! What happened?!
You're bleeding!

58
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,331
Up until now, I thought
this was a waste of money.

59
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,417
But at long last, I can
finally put this book to use!

60
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,169
I doubt it.

61
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,837
What the-- How did you...

62
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,048
You and her? No way.

63
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,425
I wouldn't get my expectations
up if I were you.

64
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,843
It'll hurt less when
she turns you down.

65
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,720
Thanks for the
vote of confidence!

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,972
When she turns you down,
please don't hurt yourself!

67
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,890
Life is worth living!

68
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,352
Were all of you spying on me?

69
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,813
Ah! You're in on this too?!

70
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,523
Well, you're wrong, got it?!

71
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,693
Just wait! You'll
see! You'll all see!

72
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,494
Wow! I've never
seen seagulls before!

73
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,912
There are so many of them!

74
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,080
A-pa!

75
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,373
Wanna find out how they taste?

76
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,084
What?! No, stop!

77
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,545
Seagulls are for
watching, not eating!

78
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,798
Okay then. Whatever.

79
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,551
You guys sure had me fooled.
You live in a dingy dojo

80
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,554
like a bunch of hobos but you're
actually rolling in dough.

81
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,682
If you weren't, you couldn't
have bought this fancy boat!

82
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,519
Fancy? This old thing?
You must be joking!

83
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,688
We didn't buy this
vessel, we built it.

84
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,897
You built it?!

85
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,232
Look. You missed a spot.

86
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,734
Oops! Apachai is bad painter.

87
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,902
Wait a minute!

88
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,322
You mean you guys actually
built this tub yourselves?

89
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:08,201
You did? I'm too young to die!

90
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,287
Don't worry, little
one! You're safe.

91
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:14,040
I've been to the island
many times on Sekitoba 2.

92
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,709
Did he say "two?"

93
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,836
Um, so tell me,
if this is "2,"

94
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,754
what happened to Sekitoba 1?

95
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,507
We don't appear to be
picking up any speed.

96
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,510
I'll go see what's
wrong with the engine.

97
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,013
Apachai, what happened
to the first boat?

98
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,651
Miu, can you take over as
navigator for just a bit?

99
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,320
Oh, sure thing!

100
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,865
What's wrong, engine?
We need a lot more horsepower.

101
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:51,786
At the rate you're going, we'll
never make it to the island.

102
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,247
Our little engine that couldn't
has reached his limit.

103
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,374
The only thing keeping him
from totally sputtering out

104
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,544
is the thought of
seeing Miu in a bikini.

105
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,463
I gotta see some boobies!

106
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,424
Well, then. Do you think we
should switch this clunker

107
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,301
out for a model with
a lot more power?

108
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,178
Hm...

109
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,804
Yeah!

110
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,599
Let's do it!

111
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,392
Go time!

112
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,273
Apapapa!

113
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,234
Wow! This is really awesome!

114
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:28,240
I guess Akisame must have
solved our engine problem, huh?

115
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,033
At the rate we're going,
we'll reach the island

116
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,743
in just a few minutes, Grandpa.

117
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,496
It's "Captain" Grandpa today!

118
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,998
Ah! Land-ho! We're here!

119
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,084
My favorite vacation spot!

120
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,963
I discovered it myself!
Furinji Island!

121
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,716
What do you think?
Beautiful isn't it?

122
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:51,137
Hey, has Miu changed
into her bikini?

123
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,601
Whoa! I knew it!

124
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,103
You guys are super-rich!

125
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,647
You'd have to be to buy a
vacation home like that one!

126
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,692
Actually, we built
that ourselves, too.

127
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:08,530
Apapapapapapa!

128
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,198
♪ Saw the tree,
build the house, ♪

129
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,283
♪ saw the house, build
the saw, saw, saw. ♪

130
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,576
Hold up, big guy.

131
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,705
We already built
the house, remember?

132
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,791
Y-you mean they built
this thing, too?!

133
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:29,300
Hey! Kenichi!
Come join us! Hurry up!

134
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:35,223
Yeah! Get a move on!
What's taking you so long?!

135
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,725
I love beach photos!

136
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,019
Well, what are you waiting for?
They're calling for you.

137
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:39,936
You better get going.

138
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,731
You wanted a face full of
boobies, well there they are.

139
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:48,653
Yeah, that's true. I do wanna
join her, it's just that...

140
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:52,699
Why do I have to do it from the
top of this cliff? It's suicide!

141
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:56,536
Hey, Blondie! What the heck
is he doin' up there?

142
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,204
Uh...

143
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,664
Listen up, Kenichi.

144
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,417
There's one thing that every
martial artist must have.

145
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,627
It's a little thing
called courage.

146
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,505
It's the most important thing
in a fight. If you're too scared

147
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,549
of what might happen,
you've already lost.

148
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,634
If you wanna win, you
have to have courage,

149
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,679
and lack of it is your biggest
weakness right now.

150
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,474
It's affecting your progress.
If you don't conquer this now,

151
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,352
you'll never move
to the next level.

152
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,520
That's why we've planned
out some highly intensive,

153
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,023
courage building activities
while we're here on the island.

154
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:28,193
What?! I have to train here?!

155
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,779
I've got courage! I beat
up Crab Head, didn't I?

156
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,906
Besides, you told me I
could have the day off!

157
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,866
You can if you pass the test.

158
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,743
Have you ever heard
of Pentecost Island?

159
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,746
It's in the South Pacific. Young
men there test their courage

160
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,624
by jumping from high towers
with a vine tied to their feet.

161
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,375
It's a tribal coming
of age ceremony.

162
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,836
And the origin of
modern day bungee jumping.

163
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,089
Here's the test. If you
can jump from here,

164
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,883
we'll excuse you from any of
the training we have planned.

165
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,469
No way! I'm not here for
a coming of age ceremony!

166
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,679
Those other guys
had a vine at least!

167
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,682
Plus, there could be lots
of sharp rocks down there!

168
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,245
She's nuts! That's dangerous!

169
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,915
Especially dressed like that!

170
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,167
Wh-Why did you throw
your life away?!

171
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,337
Shigure!

172
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,967
Shigure!

173
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,807
No rocks here. Jump.

174
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,893
She jumped right in
without even thinking.

175
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,813
Great. That sucked all
the fun right out of it.

176
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,877
Now you have no
excuse not to jump.

177
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:56,500
Oh my god! Shigure!
That was a close call! Whew!

178
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,252
She's right! The next
time you do that,

179
00:10:58,252 --> 00:10:59,670
please wear a
proper swimsuit!

180
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,839
That's not what I meant!

181
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:07,470
But at the beach,
I always wear, this.

182
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,138
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

183
00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:12,391
If I... If I tell
you two something,

184
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:16,437
will you promise me that you
won't tell Miu about it?

185
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:19,732
The truth is...

186
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:21,984
...I don't know how to swim!

187
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:29,575
So? That's no excuse.

188
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:32,203
It just makes
things more exciting.

189
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:34,330
Enough talk. Jump off the cliff.

190
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,666
Right now. Either that
or you start training.

191
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,543
Th-That's like asking
me to choose how to die.

192
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:42,588
Now, now. With that
kind of pressure,

193
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:44,965
even a fearless person
would hesitate.

194
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,884
Do you have any better
ideas, old man?

195
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:48,427
How would you get him to jump?

196
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:52,223
I'd approach him quietly
and get as close as I could.

197
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:54,600
And then what would you do?

198
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,727
Grab him quickly and do this!

199
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:58,521
If you wanna learn
how to swim,

200
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:03,484
the best way is to
jump in head-first!

201
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:04,485
Somebody help me!

202
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:06,404
While inventive, that
defeats the purpose.

203
00:12:06,404 --> 00:12:09,031
Kenichi really needs to
work up the courage himself.

204
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:17,248
We were trying to make
him face his fear.

205
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:18,749
All you did was add to it.

206
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:23,295
Hm. You're right. He must
jump from that cliff on his own.

207
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:25,381
We'll make him jump off
again once he wakes up.

208
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:26,674
And if he can't, it's nothing

209
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:28,384
but back-breaking
training for two days.

210
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:30,636
Yes, I agree!

211
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:32,847
Uh-oh! Not good!

212
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,443
Try dodging this,
you little coward!

213
00:12:45,443 --> 00:12:47,778
Faster, boy, faster!

214
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:50,990
No matter what I do, at this
rate I will definitely die!

215
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,075
As the saying goes "when
you only have two options,

216
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:55,161
pick the third". Well,
I'm picking the third!

217
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:57,872
I'm getting the hell
off this island!

218
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:12,470
He what?!

219
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,055
He ran away? Are you sure?

220
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:16,849
Well, it certainly seems so.
It happened when I went

221
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:21,479
to check on him to see if
he'd regained consciousness.

222
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:21,979
Kenichi!

223
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:22,730
Eep!

224
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,524
Where do you think you're going?

225
00:13:25,524 --> 00:13:27,943
Look! I think Miu's
top just came undone!

226
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:29,904
What? Where? Over
where? Show me!

227
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:33,199
I've got to get
a picture of this!

228
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:35,993
And that's how he
escaped from me.

229
00:13:35,993 --> 00:13:37,787
I'm so embarrassed.

230
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:39,622
I'd be, too, if I were you.

231
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:42,500
Oh, brother. This
island's small.

232
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,294
Then again, it's big
enough to get lost on.

233
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:47,421
And it can be dangerous,
too. If you didn't know

234
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:49,840
where you were going, you
could stumble off a cliff.

235
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,427
What was he thinking?
Well, we don't have any choice.

236
00:13:53,427 --> 00:13:55,137
We'll have to split up
into search parties,

237
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:59,558
and hunt Kenichi
down like a dog!

238
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:05,105
This isn't what it looks like.
I am not running away!

239
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,816
It's a strategic withdrawl.

240
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:08,943
I don't wanna die, so
I'm leaving, that's it!

241
00:14:08,943 --> 00:14:11,821
And that's what we usually
call running away!

242
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:15,282
Who said that? Who said
that? Where are you?

243
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:20,120
See? Look, it's a "sand
bongo!" Bom-bom-bom-bom...

244
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,455
Hey, wait! That's weird!

245
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:22,540
Where did everybody go?

246
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,417
That's funny. I could have sworn
they were all here a minute ago.

247
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:28,963
Hm. Apachai is gonna
take a quick look around.

248
00:14:28,963 --> 00:14:31,173
You stay put. Apachai
will be back soon.

249
00:14:31,173 --> 00:14:33,092
'Kay!

250
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:53,654
Hey, wait! Now that I think
about it, I'm on an island.

251
00:14:53,654 --> 00:14:58,158
The only way to get home is by
boat, and there's only one here.

252
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:00,953
They've probably got it
under armed guard by now!

253
00:15:00,953 --> 00:15:03,414
The only reason I came
here was to be with Miu!

254
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:05,457
My dream of spending a
romantic evening on the beach

255
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:09,712
with her has turned
out to be a nightmare.

256
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:11,672
I guess the only
thing I can do now

257
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:16,594
is try to make it through
the next two days.

258
00:15:16,594 --> 00:15:18,929
I'll find a place to lay
low, and not worry about

259
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:20,973
cliff-jumping or training.

260
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:29,064
And just take it easy in this
beautiful island paradise!

261
00:15:38,365 --> 00:15:40,451
It's Shigure.

262
00:15:56,717 --> 00:15:57,885
Aagh!

263
00:15:57,885 --> 00:16:01,388
She saw me! I'm dead meat!

264
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:04,141
Why are you running
away from me?

265
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:06,268
Well, to make a long
story short, if I don't,

266
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:10,356
I'm going to die on this island.

267
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:12,358
And then they said
if I didn't do it,

268
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,068
I'd have to train for
two straight days!

269
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:15,736
All because I wouldn't
jump off that cliff!

270
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,738
Isn't it horrible?

271
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:19,448
This was after I told
them I couldn't swim!

272
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:21,158
Totally insane, right?!

273
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:22,451
Mm-hm.

274
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:27,289
I'd jump right in if I knew how
to swim, but I never learned to.

275
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:32,336
It's easy. I could even
teach you how, Kenichi.

276
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:34,088
If you want. Do you?

277
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:40,219
Um, I appreciate this and all,
but if your method of teaching

278
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:42,262
involves me possibly
getting hurt or even killed,

279
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:43,013
count me out.

280
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:45,349
This river has a flow.
Do you feel it?

281
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:47,643
Uh, yeah I do.

282
00:16:47,643 --> 00:16:50,521
Then listen closely.
If you're scared of water,

283
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:52,690
and you try to fight
against the flow,

284
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,400
there's a good
chance you'll drown.

285
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,319
However, if you relax
and go with the flow,

286
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:59,530
you have nothing to worry about.

287
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,531
Come on!

288
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:13,846
Remember what I said.
Relax and go with the flow.

289
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:34,992
Whoa! I'm moving!

290
00:17:34,992 --> 00:17:36,410
This is amazing!

291
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,953
Just by moving my arms and legs,

292
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:39,997
I'm able to keep
up with the fish!

293
00:17:39,997 --> 00:17:42,458
Oh, man! I'm swimming!

294
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:49,882
I don't believe it!
I was actually swimming!

295
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:54,178
That's good. You wanna learn
how to swim and breathe?

296
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:59,141
Whenever you're swimming
and need to take a breath,

297
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:01,352
turn your head to the side
like this to breathe.

298
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:02,853
Hey, I've heard
of this method.

299
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:05,898
It's called freestyle
swimming, isn't it?

300
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:08,025
Yes. Some people call it that.

301
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:09,944
It was mentioned in
a book I read called,

302
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:13,072
"Learn How To Swim
In Three Days."

303
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:15,783
Let's try it again.
Assume the position.

304
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:23,540
Never inhale underwater.

305
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,959
Exhale instead.

306
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,752
Just breathe out. Not in.

307
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:29,630
But if I do that, won't I
run out of air eventually?

308
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,340
Why do you think
I taught you those

309
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,008
breathing exercises earlier?

310
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:44,144
She's right! This
is pretty easy!

311
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:47,398
That's it. You've got it now.

312
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:51,902
Alright! I can finally swim!

313
00:18:51,902 --> 00:18:54,446
Not too hard once you
get the hang of it, huh?

314
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:56,782
That's the same way that
I was taught how to swim

315
00:18:56,782 --> 00:19:00,035
when I was young.

316
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:03,539
Did Shigure actually just
smile there for a second?

317
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,457
Maybe. I don't know.

318
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:08,210
I guess it could have been the
way the light was hitting her.

319
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,337
But then again, I could
swear that was a smile.

320
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:12,047
If it was, that
was the first one

321
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:13,966
I've ever seen on her face.

322
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:18,887
Looks like you've learned
the basics of swimming.

323
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:20,514
Any questions?

324
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:22,725
No!

325
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:26,103
Excellent. Then you have
nothing to fear anymore.

326
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:26,562
Right?

327
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:28,397
Huh?

328
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,318
W-w-wait a minute!
I can't do this yet!

329
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:36,780
It's too soon! Don't'cha think
I need some more lessons first?

330
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,366
You said you'd do this if you
knew how to swim, remember?

331
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:40,868
I meant I'd do it after weeks

332
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:42,202
of extensive swim
training, not now!

333
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:43,746
Well, well. What do you know?

334
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:45,748
Our little lost disciple
has finally been found.

335
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:48,709
So I guess we scoured the
mountains for nothing, eh?

336
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,377
He's been with
Shigure all this time?

337
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:51,337
Hey, look where he is.

338
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:53,047
Maybe he's going to
give it another try.

339
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:54,798
For his sake, I
certainly hope so.

340
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:56,008
No! Stop!

341
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:58,927
There's absolutely nothing that
can make me jump off this cliff!

342
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:03,015
Hey, Kenichi! This is
the coolest thing ever!

343
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:05,601
You shouldn't be out
there alone! Oh, geez!

344
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:06,935
Come back in now!

345
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:09,938
Hey! Apachai told
you to stay here!

346
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:12,608
Oh, no! How'd she
get so far out there?

347
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:16,195
Kenichi, jump into the
water and come play!

348
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:18,989
Huh? Whoa! Check
it out! Dolphins!

349
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:21,116
And it looks like a
whole pod of 'em, too!

350
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:23,535
Look closer! Those
aren't dolphins!

351
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:34,797
Apa!

352
00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:35,381
They're sharks!

353
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:36,173
Oh, no!

354
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:38,717
Honoka!

355
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:45,891
I'm coming!

356
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,710
Help!

357
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:21,927
Leave her alone!

358
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:28,100
Kenichi!

359
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:46,243
Elder!

360
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:02,676
There's another one!
It's gonna eat us!

361
00:22:05,596 --> 00:22:10,184
We're going to eat it!
Shark fin soup, anyone?

362
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:13,687
Thank you for
saving our butts.

363
00:22:19,276 --> 00:22:22,321
Oh man I was so scared!

364
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:24,865
But your courage
outweighed your fear.

365
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:27,492
You've impressed
me today, Kenichi.

366
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:30,579
For some time now, you've also
reminded me of someone.

367
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:31,955
Really? Who's that?

368
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:33,499
Me believe it or not,

369
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:35,959
but back when I was around
your age, of course.

370
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,377
You?

371
00:22:43,926 --> 00:22:46,720
Honoka! Kenichi!

372
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,765
I'm so glad you guys are okay!

373
00:24:21,023 --> 00:24:22,941
I know you've been waiting
for this, Kenichi,

374
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:24,026
and now it's time.

375
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:26,069
I hope you're ready to move
on to technique training.

376
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:29,197
Actually, Master, can it
wait just a little longer?

377
00:24:29,197 --> 00:24:31,033
But why? Is there a problem?

378
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:32,701
Understand that every
day you put it off,

379
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:35,329
is another day that
Ragnarok grows even stronger.

380
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:38,373
If you insist, so be it.
I just hope it isn't too late.

381
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:40,667
It might be hard for you
to understand, Master,

382
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:43,462
but there's something I
have to take care of first.

383
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:45,339
If I don't do it now,

384
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:47,341
Well, I'll never be able
to go any further!
