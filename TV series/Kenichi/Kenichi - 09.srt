1
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:53,061
Begin!

2
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:55,105
Apaaa!

3
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:57,232
Apaaaaa!

4
00:01:57,232 --> 00:02:00,235
Aaa-papapapapapapa!

5
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:02,320
Aapaaaaa!

6
00:02:08,577 --> 00:02:11,037
Aapaa!

7
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:13,123
They should've asked if
they could use my statues.

8
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:15,959
What exactly are they doing,
other than making a big mess?

9
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,920
Well, It was supposed to be
an exercise in self-restraint.

10
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,506
Hate to say it, but I
don't think its working.

11
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,260
Tch!

12
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:29,598
Stupid, stupid!, Apachai don't
know how to not kill opponent!

13
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:31,892
My fists won't
listen to my brains!

14
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:32,934
Hey, look.

15
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:33,977
Apa?

16
00:02:33,977 --> 00:02:36,688
It lives! Apachai
didn't kill it to death!

17
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:37,480
I did it!

18
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,691
This is the first time I
haven't made broken pieces

19
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:41,067
of everything in my way!

20
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:44,237
I can now teach Kenichi
Muay Thai without killing him!

21
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:47,407
Apaaa!

22
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,833
Why don't we take Miu
to see a movie, I mean,

23
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,586
that'd be a good way to get
to know her, don't ya think?

24
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:00,629
What, with both of us?

25
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,132
Hey. You seen
Kenichi Shirahama around?

26
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:07,385
It's the Take-Down Trio
from Ragnarok!

27
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:10,263
Heh. Hey did ya hear that?
We're celebrities now.

28
00:03:10,263 --> 00:03:12,807
Then they should know what I'll
do to 'em if they don't answer.

29
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,936
But we-we don't even
talk to that guy!

30
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:18,313
It's true! We don't
know where he is,

31
00:03:18,313 --> 00:03:21,066
he always runs off and
disappears during lunch!

32
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:23,610
That's very noble of you to
try and protect your buddy.

33
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,571
Thing is, "noble" starts
to hurt real quick.

34
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,783
Are you protecting him?
What's wrong with you?!

35
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:31,618
We're talking to
freaking Ragnarok,

36
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:34,496
of course I'm not
covering for him!

37
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:37,082
Seriously, I swear to you,
I don't know where he is!

38
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:39,042
You think I'm dumb enough
to believe that he could just

39
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:41,461
vanish like that
without anyone noticing?

40
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:43,213
Don't treat me like
I'm stupid, kid.

41
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:44,756
We've tried to
follow him before,

42
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:47,342
but he always gives us the
slip and disappears somehow!

43
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:50,345
It's true! He and this girl
Miu always take off together!

44
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:51,680
Hey, I know that girl!

45
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,432
She wears a purple leotard,
She looks sweet and innocent,

46
00:03:54,432 --> 00:04:00,105
She's built like a supermodel
but she's a monster in disguise!

47
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:03,858
That, doesn't, sound like Miu...

48
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:05,652
Miu has braids
and wears glasses.

49
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:08,655
Really? You're telling me this
guy has two girlfriends?

50
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:11,032
Like I needed another
reason to kick his teeth in.

51
00:04:11,032 --> 00:04:14,411
Your voice is getting in the way
of me telling you to shut up.

52
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,041
Ukita? You think
he's here somewhere?

53
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:24,754
I've got you now!

54
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,465
Check it out.

55
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:31,052
I figure he's trying to hide
right beneath our noses.

56
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:32,762
The hell is that?

57
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,476
This guy's got a serious pair
trying to mock us like this.

58
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:45,692
Your face! Ukita...

59
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:48,153
You got all worked up
over a stupid doll!

60
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:49,404
Way to go tough guy!

61
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:51,656
Am I missing something or
is Takeda the only person

62
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:53,616
who thinks this is funny?

63
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:54,826
That punk's gonna pay.

64
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:57,996
No one humiliates me
and gets away with it!

65
00:04:57,996 --> 00:04:59,080
Where is it?

66
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, that's weird. I hope
I didn't drop it somewhere.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,085
What's wrong, did
you lose something?

68
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:06,504
Yeah, Apachai made me
this weird voo-doo doll

69
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:08,298
and told me to keep
it in my backpack.

70
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:11,051
The whole idea of any kind of
voo-doo really creeps me out

71
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:13,261
but he said that
it would protect me.

72
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:15,055
He's actually a pretty
nice guy, y'know?

73
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:16,473
Yeah, I've gotta agree with you.

74
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:18,767
He's one of the nicest
guys that I've ever met.

75
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,770
He just doesn't know how
to control his own strength.

76
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:24,814
Man, this sucks.

77
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:27,609
How much longer am I gonna
have to sneak around like this?

78
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:29,527
You just need a
little more training.

79
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:31,780
Once you're able to show
those bullies who's boss

80
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,198
you'll be able to relax.

81
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:35,367
Hold on, so you're saying

82
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,827
I can't relax 'til I've
fought every bully in school?

83
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:40,288
Yup, that about sums it up.

84
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:42,415
They haven't been able
to find us up here yet

85
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:44,876
so you can relax a little.

86
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:47,378
This training is starting
to wear me out.

87
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:48,379
Miu?

88
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:51,716
Stop, Miu, please!

89
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:52,967
Niijima?!

90
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:56,888
Well, your hair-trigger reflexes
are on the mark, as usual.

91
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:59,307
You can run, but you
can't hide, Kenichi.

92
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:01,643
Well, I wouldn't have
to hide if people like you

93
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:03,436
would just mind your
own freakin' business!

94
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:07,107
Every time I get Miu
alone, he shows up.

95
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:09,484
There are severe implications

96
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:10,985
to my discovery of
your hiding place.

97
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:12,737
If I can find you,
so can Ragnarok.

98
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:15,490
What's that supposed to mean?!
Are you their spy or something?

99
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,450
I'm not a spy,
I just work the angles.

100
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,078
But I recommend you
find a new hiding spot.

101
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:22,664
Information's a valuable
commodity and this hiding place

102
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:26,292
of yours should fetch me plenty
of worthwhile intel in return.

103
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:28,837
Don't worry, though. You'll
be long gone and safely hidden

104
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:31,381
in some new spot by the time
they come looking for you.

105
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:34,717
This con should work a few more
times before they catch on.

106
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:36,427
Wow, I guess you really do know

107
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:38,179
how to work the
angles, don't you.

108
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:39,639
Let's get out of here, Miu!

109
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,183
There's no need to hang around
and listen to this alien freak.

110
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:44,686
Don't get too close to him you
don't wanna catch any evil.

111
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:47,230
Leaving so soon? And I thought
you'd want to hear the latest

112
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,900
information on Ukita the thrower
and Takeda the Puncher.

113
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,069
What kind of info?
Come on, spill it.

114
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:54,779
I would if you asked me nicely.

115
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:56,447
Please tell me the info.

116
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:58,700
Say 'pretty please,
Great God Niijima'.

117
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,452
Pretty please,
Great God Niijima, tell me now!

118
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:02,912
Kiss my shoe.

119
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,084
Oh, wow!

120
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:11,254
This must be that "male bonding"
I've heard so much about.

121
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:14,215
Alright, then.

122
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:17,218
This fellow here is
Ukita Kozo. He was expelled

123
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:20,263
due to his highly competitive
and aggressive nature.

124
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:22,098
His specialty is
the shoulder throw,

125
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:23,892
which he used on a
teacher who flunked him.

126
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:26,394
Technically, his fighting
index is around 80,

127
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:28,563
while yours--
you're just around 62.

128
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:29,439
In other words,

129
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,192
you don't stand the slightest
chance against this guy.

130
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:32,901
Come on,

131
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:35,153
you can't rate a fighter's
ability with statistics.

132
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:37,697
I'm so proud of him.
He's finally getting it!

133
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:39,449
Yeah, yeah. But the
worst of your worries

134
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,701
is another senior, Takeda Ikki.

135
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:44,537
Not only is he ruthless, but
he's a former lightweight boxer.

136
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:45,872
He's a boxer?

137
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:48,458
Yep, he's a professional
fighter. Word is he was

138
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,543
the premiere rookie til he
dropped out of the league.

139
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:52,629
What's a guy like that doing
fighting for Ragnarok?!

140
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:55,715
How should I know that? What
makes any man give in to evil?

141
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:58,134
It happens all the time. No
matter the 'cause, you know

142
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:00,511
the effect, and that's all you
should be concerned with.

143
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,180
What do I do?

144
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,349
There's only one option!

145
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:08,519
All of that running he did
with Akisame's paying off.

146
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,104
I wish he wasn't running away,

147
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:11,189
but you've gotta
start somewhere.

148
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:13,566
Geronimo!

149
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:16,236
Geronimo!

150
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:18,863
They look so intense!
What are they doing?

151
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:20,198
--Now rock!
--Paper!

152
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,867
--Scissors!
--Go!

153
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:24,619
Oh man, this is the
most extreme game

154
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:26,871
of Rock, Paper, Scissors
that I've ever seen!

155
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:30,917
There goes my
theory of strategy.

156
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:31,584
Yeah.

157
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:34,128
Apachai just stuck his
hand out without thinking.

158
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:37,090
Apachai never won
paper hand game before!

159
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,883
If you guys hadn't kept
changing your hands

160
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:40,051
this wouldn't
have happened!

161
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:41,636
I'm glad you're
having a good time,

162
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:43,888
but I'm in some serious
trouble over here!

163
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:46,182
We weren't just playing
some stupid game, moron!

164
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:48,059
We were trying to
decide which one of us

165
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:49,811
is stuck with training
your scrawny ass next.

166
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:50,979
You're playing
Rock, Paper, Scissors

167
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:52,272
to decide who's gonna train me?!

168
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:53,481
Uh Sakaki...

169
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:56,567
I thought we had agreed
to keep that our secret.

170
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:59,904
Kenichi! Apachai the lucky
one to train you next!

171
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:03,449
Don't worry, Kenichi.

172
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:06,327
Muay Thai is extremely effective
in competitive fighting.

173
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:08,580
It'll definitely help
you against that boxer.

174
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,582
A boxer? That's quite a dilemma.

175
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:11,708
Uh yeah...

176
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,334
That's why I'm
freaking out right now.

177
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:14,669
Well, assuming you only have

178
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,629
a short amount of
time to prepare,

179
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:18,673
Muay Thai's your
most reliable option.

180
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,760
Is that true, Apachai? If
I start learning Muay Thai,

181
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,637
do you think I'll
be able to beat him?

182
00:09:24,637 --> 00:09:25,638
Of course you can!

183
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:28,099
Muay Thai is the only
way to kill a boxer!

184
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:29,600
I should trust him.

185
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,563
Through all my failures he's
continued to believe in me.

186
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:36,482
He trusts me, so
I'm gonna trust him.

187
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:38,693
Just try and take
it easy on me, okay?

188
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:39,861
Of course I will!

189
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:42,280
I'll take it easy on you
as the mountains are high

190
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,364
and the oceans are deep!

191
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:45,366
The statue didn't die
so you won't either!

192
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:46,200
What statue?

193
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,286
Okay, Apachai, you're
kinda hurting my hands--

194
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:49,704
you can let go now.

195
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:55,450
Kenichi! Are you ready?

196
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,743
Uh, yeah...

197
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:57,869
Ready as I'll ever be.

198
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:00,205
Muay Thai is the art
of bare hand man killing.

199
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:02,457
It'll help you kill
your way out of any fight!

200
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:03,333
Um, but...

201
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,336
I just wanna learn how to
defend myself against a boxer...

202
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:08,380
You think about
complicated stuff like that

203
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,464
after your opponent is dead!

204
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:12,050
Use your thinking for killing
or it'll get you killed!

205
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,052
That was my impersonation
of my master!

206
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:15,762
So, were you scared?

207
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:18,140
I'm starting to have
second thoughts about this.

208
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,934
Apachai, before getting
into technique training,

209
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:23,061
why don't you explain the
history of Muay Thai first?

210
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:25,146
Well, it was invented
for killing people.

211
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:27,691
Knock it off with the
killing talk, will ya?

212
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:30,485
Muay Thai is an ancient
martial art that was originally

213
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:32,487
developed to train soldiers
in the protection of the

214
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:34,865
Siamese Kingdom, before
they became known as Thailand.

215
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:35,907
Wow...

216
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:37,742
I believe that's what
Apachai meant to say.

217
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:39,911
Yes, that is what
Apachai meant!

218
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:41,454
It sounds like it was created

219
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:42,956
as a very practical
means of defense.

220
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:45,792
That's right! My master would
tell me story from long ago

221
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,461
when king called Nareswan
was captured by soldiers

222
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,006
of his enemy. But they told
him that if he could defeat

223
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:53,258
their strongest soldier,
they would let him free.

224
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:55,969
But not only did he feat
best fighter, he also beat

225
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,804
all their soldiers and
returned to his country.

226
00:10:57,804 --> 00:11:00,515
And he beat them
all using Muay Thai!

227
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:02,475
That's awesome! Okay, I'm sold!

228
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,102
I wanna learn, please teach me!

229
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:07,731
Great! I first teach
you Tan Guard Muay!

230
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:10,192
So, what is this
Muay Guard Tan thingy?

231
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:11,443
Tan Guard Muay!

232
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:13,361
It is the basic
stance of Muay Thai.

233
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:14,696
Like this, right?

234
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:15,864
That's it! Now...

235
00:11:15,864 --> 00:11:17,073
Tee Sok.

236
00:11:17,073 --> 00:11:19,659
The use of knees and elbows are
very important in Muay Thai.

237
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:21,494
Which, in fact, is rather rare

238
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:23,788
as most contemporary martial
arts have banned the use

239
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:25,540
of knees and elbows
in tournament fighting.

240
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,833
Really? How come?

241
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,919
If you use them wrong you
can kill your opponent.

242
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,087
That's right.
However, in Muay Thai,

243
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:32,839
they specifically focus
on these moves.

244
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,299
Yeah? And why's that?

245
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:37,510
Because, if you use them right
you can kill your opponent.

246
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,180
There's too much killing
in this martial art!

247
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,016
You're never gonna be
a man acting like this.

248
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:45,310
All martial arts are
built upon the premise

249
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,811
of conquering your opponent.

250
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:50,649
Misused, any of them can become
simply a means for violence.

251
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:53,652
Their lethal nature is basically
a question of conscience.

252
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:54,778
Question of conscience?

253
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:57,989
If one has chooses to use it
for his own selfish desires,

254
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:00,617
then it becomes nothing
more than brutish violence.

255
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:04,037
However, if you genuinely intend
to use it to protect yourself

256
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:07,040
and others, and only when it's
necessary, then even the most

257
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,334
lethal martial art
can be honorable.

258
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:11,795
You must look deep into your
heart and ask yourself:

259
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:14,756
do you want your skills to bring
misfortune and pain to others?

260
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:16,258
No, of course not!

261
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:18,343
Then you have nothing
to fear from Muay Thai.

262
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:20,261
It's not the technique
that harms others,

263
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:23,056
it's the desire in
one's heart to do so.

264
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:24,641
Now carry on with your training.

265
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:25,809
Right!

266
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,144
Apa!

267
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,078
What's the deal, Kisara? You
sure are taking your sweet time

268
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:47,706
trying to recruit new fighters.
This thing is gonna go down

269
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:50,000
any day now and you're actin'
like it's no big deal.

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,293
Shut up, Tsuji.

271
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:53,712
This isn't a joke, Kisara!

272
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:56,381
We need a crew of tough
guys ASA freakin' P!

273
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:58,174
I told you to shut up.

274
00:12:58,174 --> 00:12:59,843
You got my character killed.

275
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:02,262
Y'know the problem here?
It's him! None of this

276
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:03,972
would be happening if
you'd let me run things

277
00:13:03,972 --> 00:13:04,931
instead of that boxer--

278
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:07,726
Hey Kisara! We just found
out that Shirahama kid's

279
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:09,853
been hiding on the
school roof during lunch.

280
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:11,855
Give us one more day
and we've got him.

281
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:14,149
Hey. What's your
problem, lightweight?

282
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:16,443
You not gonna say hello
to an executive member?

283
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:19,738
I could've sworn I said
'hey Kisara' when I came in.

284
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:22,157
You gotta respect
your higher-ups.

285
00:13:22,157 --> 00:13:23,908
You may not work
for me directly,

286
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:26,119
but I'm an executive member
and you're just a grunt.

287
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,746
Say hello, punk.

288
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:31,666
I said hello to the
one who matters.

289
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,836
Oh yeah? You really think
you're pretty slick, don't you?

290
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:41,760
You sure are jumpy, I was
just stretching my arm.

291
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,678
Oh, by the way,
do you need this?

292
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,680
It's the button
from your sleeve.

293
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:49,017
No thanks I've got plenty.

294
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:54,189
Not bad, lightweight.
But y'know somethin'.

295
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:55,774
Just 'cause you're
fast doesn't mean

296
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:57,859
you can save
yourself in a fight.

297
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,947
Damn it!

298
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:05,408
If my character
dies one more time,

299
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:07,202
then you're all dying with him!

300
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:11,414
Alright, Kenichi! You're
doing basic moves great!

301
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:12,957
I think you're ready to move on.

302
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:14,501
Let's practice
with punching next!

303
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:15,460
Sure!

304
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,253
C'mon, shoot me with
your best hit!

305
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:20,090
I guess Apachai really did
learn how to restrain himself.

306
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,885
He doesn't seem to be as
crazed as he was before.

307
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:26,096
What's the matter, Kenichi?
Come on, I can take it!

308
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:27,722
Punch me with all you got!

309
00:14:27,722 --> 00:14:29,849
I don't care how scared
you may be Kenichi--

310
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,102
you're not allowed
to cop a feel!

311
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:34,062
My fight or flight
instinct took over.

312
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:36,356
It told me it was time
for flight. I'm sorry.

313
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:39,025
What's wrong, Kenichi? Apachai
thought punching was fun?

314
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:42,112
If it's not fun,
you just hit harder!

315
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:45,323
Are you sure? You're
positive you can hold back?

316
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:49,702
You make me so sad!
The statue didn't die!

317
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:53,998
Apachai try so hard! I practice
so much to control strength,

318
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:56,626
but I can do nothing
right! I lose confidence.

319
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:58,670
I can't do it
anymore, I give up!

320
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,088
No way! um...

321
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:01,756
I was joking, Apachai!

322
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:03,925
I can't wait to
do some punching!

323
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:05,093
Really?!

324
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:08,596
Now you see! Hitting
isn't scary, it's fun!

325
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:11,224
Yeah! It really, is, fun!

326
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:12,976
Now, you try to dodge one!

327
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:13,726
What?

328
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,854
A-pa pa pa pa!

329
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:20,108
--Ohhhh.
--Kenichi!

330
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,987
You almost kill the kid,
and all you can say is 'oh'?

331
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:25,780
Please, wake, up!

332
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,407
Oh, dear, did he finally do it?

333
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:28,658
It looks like it.

334
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:30,326
Apachai held back, I promise!

335
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:31,870
My fists were
light as a feather,

336
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,329
I barely even touched him!

337
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:37,500
Hey guys, I think
he killed Kenichi!

338
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,669
Calm down, I'm sure he's fine.

339
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:41,129
With all the training
he's been through,

340
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:42,714
a single punch wouldn't--

341
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,467
Begin cardiac compression!

342
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,594
One two three four...

343
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:49,012
One two...

344
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:50,138
Whoa, where am I?!

345
00:15:50,138 --> 00:15:51,973
See? It was nothing
to worry about.

346
00:15:51,973 --> 00:15:54,642
What's wrong with you, people?!

347
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:00,690
Yay, Apachai!

348
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,275
Let's all climb on Apachai!

349
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:05,278
Can you throw me in
the air and catch me?

350
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,531
Sure! But I have to feed
the pigeons first, okay?

351
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:09,824
Come on, pigeons! Eat up!

352
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:11,659
Oh wow!

353
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:15,330
You're like a tree
to those pigeons!

354
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,497
Man, that guy.

355
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:19,709
Kids and animals just
can't get enough of him.

356
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,337
Hey, Apachai?

357
00:16:22,337 --> 00:16:25,632
Is there something wrong?
You don't look very happy.

358
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:27,634
I'm sorry, Apachai's
thinking about

359
00:16:27,634 --> 00:16:29,802
a tiny big mistake
he made yesterday.

360
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:32,472
It's tiny and big
at the same time?

361
00:16:32,472 --> 00:16:34,724
That doesn't make sense!

362
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:36,017
Apapapapapa!

363
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:37,560
It doesn't, does it?

364
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,438
It was tiny because it was hard
for me to see what I did wrong.

365
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:42,690
Cheer up, Apachai, it's okay.

366
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,734
Yeah! You're right,
I'm happy now!

367
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:47,111
No more being sad for me,
let's go play tag!

368
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:50,698
Yay! Apachai, you're the best!

369
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:54,077
Well, looks like I've
managed to go another day

370
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:55,620
without getting into
a meaningless fight.

371
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,746
Yeah.

372
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:58,665
I think the equipment
shed is the perfect place

373
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:00,375
for us to eat lunch from now on.

374
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,043
Those Ragnarok guys will
never find us there!

375
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:04,295
It's the last place
anyone would look.

376
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:06,714
Kenichi never
ceases to amaze me.

377
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:08,675
I can't believe he's
in such a good mood

378
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,134
after what happened yesterday.

379
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:11,844
I guess I don't give
him enough credit.

380
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:14,222
Maybe he's tougher
than I thought he was.

381
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:18,142
Now where's Apachai?
I'm ready to roll!

382
00:17:18,142 --> 00:17:19,644
You sure, Kenichi?

383
00:17:19,644 --> 00:17:22,605
I can't wait to get started!
I mean, he taught me so much

384
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:24,524
yesterday that I can
hardly remember it all!

385
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:25,650
But you almost--

386
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,944
A-pa pa pa pa!

387
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:30,530
Do you really think
it's a good idea?

388
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,865
I think it's a great idea!

389
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,826
It's not like I can stop now!

390
00:17:34,826 --> 00:17:36,703
There's so much to
learn! I've just begun!

391
00:17:36,703 --> 00:17:39,455
How could he
forget almost dying?!

392
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:42,584
A temporary loss of memory,

393
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:43,918
probably from the concussion.

394
00:17:43,918 --> 00:17:45,712
Don't worry,
happens all the time.

395
00:17:45,712 --> 00:17:47,380
What do you mean temporary?!

396
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,924
It's been a whole day
since it happened!

397
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:51,259
Akisame!

398
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:52,051
Hm?

399
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:53,803
I think that you
need to give Kenichi

400
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:55,221
a thorough physical exam!

401
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:56,180
Really, why's that?

402
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,932
Because he has
absolutely no memory

403
00:17:57,932 --> 00:17:59,392
of what happened
to him yesterday!

404
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:01,936
I guess we dodged that lawsuit.

405
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:04,397
Hey! I'm worried about him!

406
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:07,358
I was just kidding.
Believe it or not, Miu,

407
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:10,028
memory loss is pretty common
in the world of martial arts.

408
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:11,946
I checked him out
yesterday, though.

409
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:13,406
He's only slightly concussed.

410
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:14,282
You're sure?

411
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:16,743
Would you two quit yappin'?!

412
00:18:16,743 --> 00:18:18,703
I'm more interested in
what Apachai's doing

413
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:21,748
than your medical concerns.
Just be happy the kid's alive.

414
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:23,541
Come on and fight already!

415
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,835
I can't believe these people.

416
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:30,632
Apapapapapa!

417
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:38,765
I'm afraid that's still too much

418
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:41,017
Aapaa! Why am I so stupid?

419
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:43,102
I try so hard but
I can't do it!

420
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:45,772
Apachai put all of his strength
into trying to hold back,

421
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:47,774
but his punches
are still too strong!

422
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:49,567
Listen to me Apachai,

423
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:51,694
You tend to spend
your afternoons playing

424
00:18:51,694 --> 00:18:53,613
with the children in the
neighborhood park, don't you?

425
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:56,616
Apachai get along with
everybody especially kids.

426
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:59,535
I'd like you to try this.
When teaching Kenichi,

427
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:01,746
try not to think of it
as martial arts training.

428
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:03,873
Try to pretend that you're
playing with the kids

429
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:05,333
in the park instead.

430
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,418
Where are you Apachai?!

431
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:10,421
I don't get it, why is he so
hard to find all of a sudden?

432
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:12,715
Normally the big lug would be
forcing me to train with him

433
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:15,093
whether I like it or not.

434
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:17,261
Hey, Shigure, have you
seen Apachai around?

435
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:18,429
Yeah, he's over there.

436
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:20,181
Cool, thanks.

437
00:19:20,181 --> 00:19:22,058
We're gonna do some
more punching practice.

438
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:23,726
Before you do...

439
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:25,436
Wear this.

440
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:27,814
What? Why do you want
me to wear that thing?

441
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:30,483
It's to protect your brain from
being knocked out your mouth.

442
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:33,027
That's really nice of
you to offer but, um...

443
00:19:33,027 --> 00:19:34,696
Gotta go see ya later!

444
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,035
The more I get to know her
the more she freaks me out.

445
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:42,912
Hey, Apachai!

446
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:47,547
I promise to hold back
with all my might!

447
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:49,716
Right! Whoa, total déjà vu.

448
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:51,676
This seems strangely
familiar for some reason.

449
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:53,261
Come on! Let's get to punching!

450
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:54,554
Kenichi...

451
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,306
You had better not
be cheating old man.

452
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:58,391
Oh!

453
00:19:58,391 --> 00:19:58,850
Yeah!

454
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,809
There you go!

455
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:02,687
And when you get closer,
you go to grab for my neck!

456
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,355
You can do it!

457
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:07,400
C'mon Kenichi! Finish it off!

458
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,236
Watchin', old man? Don't know
if your advice is gonna hold,

459
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:11,821
he's starting to get
that look in his eye.

460
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:13,615
Everything's fine, just fine...

461
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:15,283
For as long as he can remember,

462
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:18,119
Apachai has risked his life
fighting ruthless opponents

463
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,954
in the underground
Muay Thai circuit.

464
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:22,373
He's unable to control
his strength because

465
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:25,293
any sign of restraint would
have gotten him killed.

466
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:28,088
Despite this, there is a true
gentleness within him.

467
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:31,925
That is the defining
quality of his nature.

468
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:34,052
Yeah, I think you might
actually be on to something

469
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:36,471
with that one. He's easily
the most carefree person

470
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:38,056
I've meet in my entire life.

471
00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:41,184
It's nice to see that you care
for your friend so deeply.

472
00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:42,769
What are you two talking about?

473
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:45,814
Hey! Watch it gramps!
You must be going senile!

474
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:48,900
Sakaki won't admit it, but he
came to see me this afternoon

475
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,985
with a very concerned
look on his face.

476
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:53,905
Old man! You've gotta do
something about Apachai.

477
00:20:53,905 --> 00:20:57,617
I've never seen him so
greatly distressed before.

478
00:20:57,617 --> 00:20:59,911
I told you to keep
quiet about that!

479
00:21:01,704 --> 00:21:03,122
I didn't ask for your help

480
00:21:03,122 --> 00:21:05,834
because I was worried about
him or anything like that.

481
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,502
It's just that...

482
00:21:07,502 --> 00:21:10,547
Weird as it sounds, my sake
just doesn't taste right

483
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:16,219
unless I can hear his laughter.
That's the only reason I asked.

484
00:21:17,595 --> 00:21:21,516
Come on, Kenichi, you
can do faster than that!

485
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:24,102
Now try to dodge this one!

486
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:25,645
Try to pretend
that you're playing

487
00:21:25,645 --> 00:21:27,313
with the kids in the park.

488
00:21:28,314 --> 00:21:29,440
Apa?

489
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:42,120
Whoa-ho... You scared me
there, that was a fast one!

490
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,413
I thought I was a goner!

491
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:45,748
That punch was so fast
I didn't even see it!

492
00:21:45,748 --> 00:21:47,500
In that case, watch
your opponent's shoulder

493
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,668
and guess the speed.

494
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:49,294
Okay!

495
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:52,839
Oh wow! He learned how to
hold back, that's so great!

496
00:21:55,884 --> 00:21:58,803
I'll look for an opening and
throw in some punches as well.

497
00:21:58,803 --> 00:22:00,179
Mitt practice is pointless

498
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,973
unless you practice
dodging with it.

499
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:03,224
Right!

500
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:04,350
Okay, start punching!

501
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,685
C'mon, faster!

502
00:22:05,685 --> 00:22:06,686
Try harder!

503
00:22:06,686 --> 00:22:08,730
You can do it!

504
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,774
I think you can
relax now, Shigure.

505
00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:17,530
Now it's time you have to dodge!

506
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,156
Okay!

507
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:22,160
Apapapapapapapapa!

508
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,120
Oh no...

509
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,080
Kenichi!

510
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,956
Kenichi!

511
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:28,082
Oh!

512
00:22:28,082 --> 00:22:31,669
Oh, Kenichi, I'm so so sorry!

513
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:33,254
I don't know what happened!

514
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:34,589
I couldn't control my knee--

515
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:35,423
Could be worse...

516
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:37,759
At least his hands
are under control now.

517
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,969
We'll just need to focus on
his knees from here on.

518
00:22:39,969 --> 00:22:42,096
Back to the playground, I guess.

519
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:44,140
Hey, this is no laughing matter.

520
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,476
Calm down, Sakaki,
he's still breathing.

521
00:22:46,476 --> 00:22:48,603
What are you talking
about, look at him!

522
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:49,228
Apa.

523
00:22:49,228 --> 00:22:50,772
I tried to warn him.

524
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:21,863
Well, Kenichi, I'm afraid
you've met your match,

525
00:24:21,863 --> 00:24:24,532
and you're probably gonna
meet your maker as a result.

526
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:26,743
Your next opponent
is Takeda Ikki,

527
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:28,036
a former professional boxer.

528
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:29,370
A single punch from him

529
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,080
and you'll be down for
the count, permanently.

530
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,914
What do I do?

531
00:24:31,914 --> 00:24:32,790
What do I do?!

532
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,460
This guy's a former professional
who does it for fun now?!

533
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,003
There's no way I can beat him!

534
00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:39,005
Calm down, Kenichi, you
don't wanna let stress

535
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:40,673
ruin the last few
days of your life.

536
00:24:40,673 --> 00:24:42,467
In fact if it'll make
you feel better,

537
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,302
I'll deliver your body
to the morgue myself.

538
00:24:44,302 --> 00:24:46,429
If I can use the techniques
Apachai taught me,

539
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:48,514
then I just might have
a shot at beating him!
