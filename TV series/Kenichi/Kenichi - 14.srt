1
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:46,011
Your fighting style hasn't
changed one bit has it?

2
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:47,513
You're still sloppy.

3
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,100
I heard you were going
after the kid.

4
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,726
Doing a little recruiting?

5
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:00,693
Thank goodness, he's awake!

6
00:02:00,693 --> 00:02:03,487
Apa!

7
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:04,738
Where am I?

8
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:07,408
You're in the 3rd
circle of hell!

9
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:09,410
I can't believe you let
that delinquent punk

10
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,245
clean your clock like that.

11
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:13,414
I promise you this, the
training session we're about

12
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:16,208
to put you through is gonna
make you wish you were in hell!

13
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,502
Hey guys, just cut
him a little slack!

14
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:21,630
Kenichi stood up for himself and
did everything he could to win!

15
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,799
But he still lost!

16
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:26,427
It would be nothing short of
a disgrace to the martial arts

17
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:28,595
to allow Kenichi
to carry on this way.

18
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:30,431
I'd like to propose
a new approach

19
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:33,475
that will take his training
to the next level of intensity!

20
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:35,561
I call it:

21
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:39,940
"Phase Two: Transform into a
Real Fighter or Die Trying!"

22
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,570
So, how do we go about
executing this new initiative?

23
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,821
It's simple.

24
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:48,615
First we force the boy
to move into Ryozanpaku.

25
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:53,078
After that we infuse martial
arts in each aspect in his life.

26
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:55,414
He'll live martial arts
and breathe martial arts,

27
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:57,332
until he comes to
a fork in the road

28
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:59,251
where he has only two
options before him!

29
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:01,462
Martial Arts or death!

30
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:06,175
It's genius. We'll force
Kenichi to become a resident

31
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:08,886
of Ryozanpaku and then
bend him to our will!

32
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:10,262
That is correct!

33
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:11,513
Finally!

34
00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:14,975
We can stop playing games
and begin the real training!

35
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:40,000
Really, what do you have to
eat to get a bod like that?

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,710
It's not fair!

37
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,881
Huh?

38
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,301
Get back here, loser!

39
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:52,096
No!

40
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:53,806
Looks like they're
chasing him again.

41
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:57,726
Yeah, uh, I doubt if he thinks
it's something to laugh about.

42
00:03:57,726 --> 00:04:00,562
By the way, Miu, um,
I've noticed that you

43
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,648
and Kenichi meet up
after club activities.

44
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:04,691
Huh? Uh...

45
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,360
What's your relationship?

46
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,821
Huh? Oh, we're
just good friends.

47
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:11,114
Quit running! Stop!

48
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:14,701
I'm not running! This is
a strategic withdrawal!

49
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:21,416
You see each other outside
of school a lot?

50
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,543
Yeah.

51
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:26,880
We've even been talking about
him moving into my house.

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,508
They're huge!
Cover up, why don't you!

53
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:32,594
I wasn't supposed to
tell anyone about that!

54
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:35,430
Wait now, what did she just say?

55
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,308
No matter. Sooner or
later, I'm going to find out

56
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:41,395
what's really going on
between her and Kenichi.

57
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:43,897
I had to fight them after all.

58
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:47,943
Man, that was pointless.

59
00:04:47,943 --> 00:04:50,571
47...

60
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:54,825
48..

61
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:56,618
49...

62
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:00,747
50...

63
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:04,001
That Kenichi is amazing, he can
count all the way up to 50!

64
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:08,297
Oh, uh, Shigure,
what comes after ten?

65
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:09,923
11.

66
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:11,675
12...

67
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:18,891
Right! We'll just knock
off here for today!

68
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:20,559
Don't wanna push too hard!

69
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:24,688
Okay, what's going on
all of a sudden?

70
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:26,023
Normally when I fall,

71
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:29,359
I'd end up dragging you
around the city on a tire.

72
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:33,655
So why are you being
so nice to me now?

73
00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:35,032
What do you mean?

74
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:38,160
You know we always treat you as
gently as possible around here!

75
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,870
Huh?

76
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:53,634
Hey, hey.

77
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:55,469
Ease up there, Miu.

78
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:57,471
You doing okay, Kenichi?

79
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:58,722
Take a break, tiger.

80
00:05:58,722 --> 00:06:01,850
Y-Yeah...

81
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,977
Okay, what's going on here?

82
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:06,188
Why'd you turn into
Mr. Compassion all of a sudden?

83
00:06:06,188 --> 00:06:07,940
Normally you'd be
yelling something like,

84
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,441
"Go on, Miu, kill him!"

85
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:12,653
Who, me? That's silly.

86
00:06:12,653 --> 00:06:16,490
C'mon, this dojo is famous
for its gentle training.

87
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,367
Lemme get you a towel

88
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,912
What the hell is going on?
Something's up.

89
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:23,455
It must be a trick.

90
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:26,875
I bet they're setting me up
for something dangerous!

91
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:30,420
♪ Apachai! Apachai! ♪

92
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,422
Hey, Apachai!

93
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:34,758
Apachai doesn't know
anything about a plan!

94
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:36,843
But I didn't say
anything about a plan!

95
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:38,220
What's going on around here?

96
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,805
What are you guys
hiding from me?

97
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:42,474
Apachai knows nothing,
Apachai knows nothing!

98
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:45,602
That's the only thing I'm
allowed to say to you!

99
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:47,270
Oh, Shigure it's you.

100
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,730
Wait, what?

101
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,439
R...

102
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,232
U...

103
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:51,566
N?

104
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:56,780
Hey! What the hell's going on?

105
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,991
But, that looked
like the elder.

106
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:01,118
Okay, what's the big secret?!

107
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:03,704
You guys have been acting
weird since this morning!

108
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:05,747
Just what are you up to?

109
00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:07,207
Tell me, Kenichi,

110
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:10,669
you do like it here at
Ryozanpaku, don't you?

111
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:11,837
Well, yeah.

112
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:13,672
I mean it has
been pretty tough,

113
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:15,298
but it's important to me.

114
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:17,175
Well, that answers it!

115
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:20,012
This is great, sounds
like Kenichi has agreed!

116
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:23,306
Then it's all settled,
am I right, men?

117
00:07:23,306 --> 00:07:24,725
I told you he'd go for it!

118
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:27,311
Yay! Hooray! We win!

119
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:28,770
Now, let's go eat!

120
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,482
Whoa, what do you
mean by "all settled"?

121
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:36,778
Your status,
as student. Understand?

122
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:39,823
In the old days, a disciple
lived with his master,

123
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:41,408
so that the master
could guide him

124
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:43,702
and pass on all his
martial arts knowledge.

125
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:47,164
In this way it was possible
to train 24 hours a day.

126
00:07:47,164 --> 00:07:50,792
Simply put, the martial arts
cease to be a part of life,

127
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:53,754
and instead become life itself.

128
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:56,423
And now we have all decided
that this glorious destiny

129
00:07:56,423 --> 00:07:59,926
will be yours!
Are you lucky or what?

130
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,136
Good grief.

131
00:08:01,136 --> 00:08:02,512
Come back!!

132
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:04,139
Catch me if you can, old man!!

133
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,517
Fine! Ki-yah!

134
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:09,311
Tatami strike!

135
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,985
Wow!

136
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:21,698
This was an excellent idea,
his moves are improving already.

137
00:08:21,698 --> 00:08:23,241
How's it goin Miu?

138
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:26,453
Would you two please try
not to destroy the house?!

139
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:34,336
Hold on!

140
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:39,091
Please just let me go!
I don't wanna die!

141
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:42,052
It was already hard enough,
but if we do this 24 hours a day

142
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:45,347
seven days a week,
I haven't got a prayer!

143
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:47,015
Think about it, Kenichi,

144
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:49,851
everybody who's born
dies eventually.

145
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:52,729
That's right, a long life
isn't necessarily a good one.

146
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:55,065
You guys are murderers!
Lunatics! Maniacs! Killers!

147
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:57,025
Assassins! Somebody help!

148
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,902
Way to go, gentlemen.
Who'd want to become

149
00:08:58,902 --> 00:09:00,987
a resident disciple
after that demonstration?

150
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:03,824
You've got to emphasize the
positive aspects of the deal.

151
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:06,743
Like what?

152
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:09,287
Listen, Kenichi, I think
you're overlooking

153
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:12,124
some of the fringe benefits you
might get by staying with us.

154
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:13,750
Fringe benefits?

155
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,838
To start, you'll be living
under the same roof as Miu.

156
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:20,382
For the next hour,
Kensei explained to me

157
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,467
in eloquent detail
all the benefits

158
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:25,637
of living and sleeping
at Ryozanpaku.

159
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:32,644
Right! You guys can count me in!
I'll just have to run home

160
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:35,480
real quick and get my
parents' permission!

161
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:41,862
Kensei, you could sell
ice to the Eskimos.

162
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:45,198
He is going to be alright
with this, isn't he?

163
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:48,285
Ha, ha! Don't worry,
he'll be fine! He's young!

164
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:49,494
Woohoo!

165
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:53,039
Yay!

166
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,125
Kenichi won't jump
up and down for joy

167
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,127
when he finds out
his new training.

168
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:59,713
Oh, it's too scary for
Apachai to think about!

169
00:09:59,713 --> 00:10:01,965
Poor little guy!

170
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:04,676
You do know your training
is the scariest, right?

171
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:16,014
What?! You're moving
in with them?!

172
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:18,683
Yeah! Didn't you once tell
me that a man has to give

173
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,977
110% of himself if
he wants to succeed?

174
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:24,940
Well, this is my chance to
push myself to the limit!

175
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,567
Hey! I know
that goofy look!

176
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,236
There's something
fishy going on here!

177
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:31,738
But I thought that
karate was just a hobby.

178
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,949
Surely you don't have
to work that hard?

179
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:36,284
No, but, if I don't
move into the dojo,

180
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:37,828
my secret lovey-dovey
plan will fail.

181
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:39,329
Lovey-dovey?

182
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:41,039
It's not what you
think! Seriously!

183
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,999
Ha! You are up to something!

184
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:46,127
Kenichi, tell me
something, son.

185
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:47,420
What was your reason

186
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,382
for studying karate
in the first place?

187
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:53,051
Well, because...

188
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:54,469
I will protect the weak!

189
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:57,013
That's how your suppose to
use great strength, right?

190
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:01,560
If the only way you
can achieve your goal

191
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,856
is to move into the dojo
to train, then do it.

192
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:10,402
No! He can't! You're not
gonna leave, are you?

193
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:11,862
I've got to.

194
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:13,488
The way things are now,

195
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:17,117
I can't even protect myself,
let alone be a hero!

196
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:18,952
Don't you see?
I have to do this!

197
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:20,954
So I can complete my training!

198
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:23,248
I see.

199
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:26,293
Right! Then go,
my son! Make me proud!

200
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:28,670
Thank you, Dad!

201
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,546
No!

202
00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:33,175
Thank you for reminding
me what's really important!

203
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:35,051
I've gotta go get packed!

204
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:47,480
My son is leaving me!

205
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,816
It's okay, you did
the right thing!

206
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:57,115
I've finally become a true
disciple of Ryozanpaku!

207
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:15,383
From now on I'll be living here
and getting constant training.

208
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:17,135
It's gonna be tough.

209
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:20,055
But, looking on the bright side,

210
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:22,599
I'll be living under
the same roof as Miu!

211
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:27,395
Hey, how would you like me
to wash your back for you?

212
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:28,855
Yeah!

213
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:35,153
That would be wonderful!

214
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:37,822
I don't like that look.

215
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:40,241
Where'd you come from?

216
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:43,370
Something tells me your thoughts
have drifted from training.

217
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,497
Then we'll just have
to get you back on track

218
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:46,998
with an even tougher
training schedule.

219
00:12:46,998 --> 00:12:51,044
Ah! I was kidding!
I'm not ready to die yet!

220
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:53,254
Relax, I was joking!

221
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:55,674
This guy's as funny
as an open grave.

222
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,842
Okay, Kenichi, from
this day forward

223
00:12:57,842 --> 00:12:59,761
you're going to be living
and working with us!

224
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:01,012
Promise you'll do your best!

225
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:03,640
Yeah! You bet I will!

226
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,643
Oh, Kenichi, you're
getting so muscle-y!

227
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:08,228
You think so?

228
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:09,354
Uh, if you don't mind,

229
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:12,983
next time I'll be glad to
help you scrub your back.

230
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:14,234
Scrubby, scrubby,
scrubby scrubby...

231
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:17,612
Uh, earth to Kenichi? Hello?

232
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:20,490
Everyone's waiting for
you inside, ya know.

233
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:49,853
Hey, Kenichi, you okay? Hello?

234
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:52,022
He's completely
lost consciousness.

235
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:53,648
This doesn't look too promising,

236
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:57,944
we haven't even started the
training yet and he passes out.

237
00:13:57,944 --> 00:14:01,031
Are you awake now?
From this day forward,

238
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:04,117
you are officially a
disciple of Ryozanpaku!

239
00:14:04,117 --> 00:14:05,160
Right!

240
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,787
To formalize and honor
this new relationship,

241
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:10,415
from this moment on, you will
address each of us as "master"!

242
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:12,709
They're all acting so
different than usual.

243
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:15,628
This must be serious!

244
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:17,589
Yes! Master Sakaki!

245
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:18,798
I can't hear you!

246
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:20,467
Yes! Master Sakaki!

247
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:21,259
Say what?

248
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,011
Yes! Master Sakaki!

249
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:24,179
Louder!

250
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:26,639
Yes! Master Sakaki!

251
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:32,020
You're makin' me blush, kid.

252
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,522
I should've known that
these guys were setting me up.

253
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:36,941
Well, it's time to get
down to business.

254
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:39,778
Oh! Yes, Sens--
I mean, Master!

255
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,614
Before we do, I have
a single request.

256
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:43,698
Okay?

257
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:45,575
Oh, sure.

258
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:46,826
Don't die on me!

259
00:14:46,826 --> 00:14:48,495
What kind of crazy
training schedule

260
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:50,705
have you guys planned for me?!

261
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:53,124
Try to picture the
toughest, most intense,

262
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:55,835
most terrifying training
you can possibly imagine.

263
00:14:58,546 --> 00:15:01,549
This training's gonna kill me!

264
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:04,260
So did you imagine it?

265
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,554
Now imagine that was heaven.

266
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:09,641
Come back here!

267
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,603
Someone save me!

268
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:20,026
You maniac!

269
00:15:20,026 --> 00:15:22,362
I call this, the Squid Dance.

270
00:15:22,362 --> 00:15:25,949
Giving it a cute name isn't
gonna make it any less deadly!

271
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:28,910
You know, this is attempted
murder! If I don't flip over

272
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,664
to my back in time, my stomach
is gonna get totally fried!

273
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:34,374
Is this supposed to
strengthen my back muscles

274
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:35,959
and my abdominals?

275
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:38,837
When a person's life is in
danger he'll push himself beyond

276
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,505
the limits of his
normal abilities.

277
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:42,799
However someone like
you, who has absolutely

278
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,135
no natural ability whatsoever,
will never advance

279
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:46,845
beyond the novice level
if you aren't pushed

280
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,930
to life-threatening
extremes during training.

281
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,516
It requires a delicate touch
to control the flame.

282
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:54,477
This technique is similar
to that of grilling a fish.

283
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:57,856
But I'm not a squid or
a fish, I'm a disciple!

284
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:02,527
Don't move.

285
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:05,155
Don't even twitch.

286
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:06,614
Maybe I'm just overreacting,

287
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:10,869
but I'm starting to get a
very bad feeling about this.

288
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,706
And what is this training
method supposed to teach me?

289
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:17,292
It's supposed to help
you overcome your fear.

290
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:18,543
That's my guess.

291
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,253
Uh, you guess?

292
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,885
Next up is throwing stars.

293
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,222
There is only one thing
that matters in a fight,

294
00:16:31,222 --> 00:16:33,558
and that's courage!

295
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:36,060
I bet this was your idea!

296
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:42,400
Come on, you need to go a lot
faster than that, slowpoke!

297
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,028
Your legs are three times
stronger than your arms!

298
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:47,864
Why's that? Right!
Because you walk with your legs!

299
00:16:47,864 --> 00:16:49,574
That's how I figure it too!

300
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:51,951
Stop pushing!
I can't take it anymore!

301
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:53,703
Go faster and I'll stop!

302
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,457
This guy's gonna kill me!

303
00:16:57,457 --> 00:17:01,127
What are you writing?!

304
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:03,171
"If you want to quickly
increase the effectiveness

305
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:05,423
of your attacks, then you've
got to make your punches

306
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:07,425
as powerful as your
kicks, and your kicks

307
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,010
as accurate as your punches."

308
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,179
Signed, Akisame.

309
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:17,936
Finally, it's
Apachai's turn now!

310
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:22,941
Hey, it's okay! Akisame said
Kenichi needs a break,

311
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,526
so Apachai should go easy
on the dangerous stuff.

312
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:28,696
Huh? So what exactly
are we gonna do?

313
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:30,865
Just regular free punching!

314
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:33,660
That's the most
dangerous thing of all!

315
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,216
Kenichi!

316
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:50,718
Are you okay? Speak to me!

317
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:53,554
Kenichi!

318
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,525
Those guys're gonna
kill me. I just know it!

319
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:08,736
If I'm dead my lovey-dovey
plan will never succeed!

320
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:11,531
Hey, this is the best
situation you could hope for!

321
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:14,409
You never know what will happen
when you leave two young people

322
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:16,703
alone together and let
the old hormones work!

323
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:21,958
I wish this had happened
to me when I was your age!

324
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,793
Yeah, right! Instead
they're making me stay

325
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:25,920
in a separate dormitory
with all the masters!

326
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,381
Miu's in the main
house. That's it!

327
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:30,883
I'm not going to stay here
and die in this hell hole!

328
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:33,011
I hope I remembered to
bring that book with me!

329
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,722
Found it! The "How to
Break out of Prison Manual!"

330
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:40,351
Looks like they're watching me.

331
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,856
Okay, what am I supposed
to do at a time like this?

332
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:48,067
Maybe dig a hole?
No, I'm on the second floor.

333
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:55,074
Dear son,

334
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:58,578
though I don't know how many
days it's been since you left,

335
00:18:58,578 --> 00:19:02,206
if you're reading this, it means
you're thinking about quitting.

336
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:05,251
Just remember that your
mother and I believe in you.

337
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:08,588
I know you can triumph
over any obstacle.

338
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:10,882
Don't run away, son.

339
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:12,592
Signed, Dad.

340
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,929
Well, he's right,
it is only the first day.

341
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:20,350
Thanks Dad! You've reminded
me that I can't run away!

342
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,769
I will not be defeated!

343
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:23,728
Sounds good.

344
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:26,439
Maybe it's time to give him
a little encouragement.

345
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,014
Okay, what are we
doing up so late?

346
00:19:34,014 --> 00:19:36,058
Is this some kinda
night combat training?

347
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:39,478
Well, I suppose that's one
way you could look at it.

348
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,940
I think I've heard about this
before! In Chinese martial arts,

349
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,860
the master will sometimes
select a special disciple,

350
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,279
and then teach them their
ultimate secret technique

351
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,947
when no one else is around!

352
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:51,574
Follow me.

353
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,043
Wow, this place is huge.

354
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:04,962
This just goes on and on.

355
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:06,547
Amazing!

356
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,927
Get down!

357
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:14,054
Huh? What's that?

358
00:20:14,054 --> 00:20:15,639
It looks like steam
rising over there!

359
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:19,560
Sh! Idiot! It's a
natural hot spring!

360
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,436
You mean like for bathing?!

361
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,605
Sh! Shut up!

362
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:25,149
A couple of years ago,
Apachai started digging

363
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:27,067
in that spot for
no apparent reason.

364
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:30,029
A-pa-chai! A-pa-chai!

365
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,907
He struck the spring
after three days.

366
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:34,492
A-papa!

367
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:36,869
Hold on! Uh, but I
thought this was gonna

368
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,704
be another dangerous
training session.

369
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,539
Mm-hm.

370
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,293
Do you mean that bathing in
that hot spring right now--

371
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:47,421
Took you long enough, kid.

372
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:49,340
Come on, Master, I don't
think this a way

373
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,674
a gentleman like
yourself should behave!

374
00:20:50,674 --> 00:20:52,384
We should probably head
back to the dojo.

375
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,845
Oh, is that so, then why
did you come along?

376
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:57,807
Well, I-I'm just trying
to stop you, is all.

377
00:20:57,807 --> 00:21:00,601
Master, please don't do this.

378
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:04,897
Ah, you're sneakier
than I thought, kid.

379
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,732
Okay, hold it!

380
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:12,780
A little surprise
left by Shigure.

381
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,658
There'll be more of them as we
get closer to the hot spring.

382
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:17,493
No matter what the
danger, I will never

383
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:20,913
desert my master! Let's go!

384
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,206
Be very careful now.

385
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:24,792
You got it, Master!

386
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:27,586
Master! Look out!

387
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,796
Help me!

388
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:30,339
Grab my hand!

389
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:33,551
Whoa!

390
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:36,971
Snap out of it!
Don't give up, man!

391
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:39,348
During this time of
hardship the two men

392
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:42,309
began to form a special
bond, one that surpassed

393
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:44,854
the normal tie of a
master and his disciple.

394
00:21:44,854 --> 00:21:47,606
The two became friends.

395
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,152
Jackpot!

396
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:53,988
Hey, Master! No fair!
You're cutting!

397
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:58,409
The disciple follows the master!
It's a 4,000 year old technique!

398
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:01,287
However, not long after becoming
friends, the two were back

399
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,540
at each other's throats
'cause of some bimbo.

400
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,375
Hah!

401
00:22:07,877 --> 00:22:10,129
What are you two idiots doing?

402
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:14,425
If you're going to
come in, then hurry up!

403
00:22:14,425 --> 00:22:16,677
Uh, sorry about that.

404
00:22:16,677 --> 00:22:20,014
I thought you took your
bath earlier in the night.

405
00:22:20,014 --> 00:22:22,141
Kensei, after all these years

406
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:25,102
do you really think I can't
figure out what you're up to?

407
00:22:25,102 --> 00:22:28,856
Now then, why don't you two
perverts relax with a nice bath?

408
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:29,732
Hah!

409
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:31,901
Master, I'm so sorry.

410
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:36,447
Don't worry, it'll
happen some day.

411
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:38,449
You know, this is training too.

412
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:41,911
And, so you know.
You should never ever surrender

413
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:43,829
just because you've
failed one or two times.

414
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:49,543
Whether it's fighting, or
peeking at a hot spring!

415
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:52,463
I'll do my best at both.

416
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,301
Chocolate, check.

417
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:22,761
Cookies, check.

418
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,388
Box lunch, check.

419
00:24:24,388 --> 00:24:25,264
I'm ready to go!

420
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:28,183
You're just going to visit
Kenichi at the dojo.

421
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:30,227
Don't you think you're
overdoing it a bit?

422
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:32,563
Look mom, that place
can be really scary!

423
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:34,106
There are monsters everywhere!

424
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,983
I have to be prepared
for anything!

425
00:24:35,983 --> 00:24:37,234
Take Sebastian with you!

426
00:24:37,234 --> 00:24:38,610
Honey, stop that!

427
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,737
It's for her safety!

428
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:40,988
It's embarrassing!

429
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:42,614
It's all up to you, Honoka!

430
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,034
The fate of our family
is in your hands!

431
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:45,784
Ow...

432
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,328
I'm on my way! See you later!
