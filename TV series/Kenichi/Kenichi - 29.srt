[Music]

2
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:44,269
Get back here!

3
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:47,981
Come and get me, big boys!

4
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:49,357
Ahh, yes!

5
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:51,276
The great Shinpaku
Alliance...

6
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:53,194
They may seem
impressive...

7
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:55,238
but one only has to
observe them for a while

8
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:56,531
to find their weakness.

9
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,876
Niijima's your
secret admirer...?

10
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:12,005
Well... That explains a lot,
too bad he's not your type!

11
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:14,632
Yeah, yeah, just get
it outta your system...

12
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:17,594
And when you do, I don't ever
want to talk about it again.

13
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:19,888
Yeah, that's right...!
You stupid cow!

14
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:21,389
Quit teasing my brother.

15
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:23,349
Honoka, I don't mean
any harm. Really.

16
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,226
Why are you talking?

17
00:02:25,226 --> 00:02:26,644
The purpose of hand pushes

18
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:29,355
is to develop the ability to
anticipate your opponent.

19
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:30,106
Yes, sir!

20
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:31,774
Even I knew that.

21
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:32,775
Apa?

22
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:39,324
Apa!

23
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:40,408
One...

24
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:41,576
two...

25
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:42,660
three...

26
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,038
Apachai... Don't cry... Please.

27
00:02:45,038 --> 00:02:45,955
Big news, Kenichi!

28
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:48,916
Big news!

29
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,003
My inside source just gave me
the inside scoop on Ragnarok.

30
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:53,755
It's about one of
the Eight Fists.

31
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:56,758
Interested?

32
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:58,051
Comfortable...?

33
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:00,178
You must be getting
used to this by now.

34
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:01,262
I made it tighter...

35
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:02,805
you like it... huh?

36
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:03,890
The Fifth Fist.

37
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,642
Aka Siegfried...

38
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:07,435
Not a very nice guy.

39
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:09,687
Uh... What's a Siegfried...?

40
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:11,022
Apa?

41
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:12,649
I think he's that
scary circus guy

42
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,317
who got mauled by a
tiger a while ago.

43
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:15,693
No that was Roy.

44
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:17,779
And that's not the Siegfried
I'm talking about.

45
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:19,489
Now, I've gathered
together some statements

46
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,032
from people he's
fought in the past.

47
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:23,326
Starting with the leader
of the Dead Society...

48
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:24,911
Sure I remember the Zombie-

49
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:27,956
went down at the first punch
like he was dead on his feet...

50
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:29,791
before I knew what
was happening,

51
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,543
he was risin' from the dead and
I was the one eatin' asphalt.

52
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:34,420
Oh great.

53
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,215
Next up, Toramachi from
Johnny Knife's crew.

54
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:40,176
He's a freakin' night of the
living dead Zombie bastard...

55
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,135
You don't even know, man,

56
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:42,720
I kept punchin'
and he'd go down...

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,180
but he just wouldn't die...!

58
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,390
You hear me...!

59
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,351
He will eat your
brains for dinner!

60
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:49,644
I know I have more
here somewhere.

61
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:51,020
No! That's enough!

62
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,980
Haven't I been telling
you over and over

63
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,065
that I want nothing
to do with your

64
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:56,234
stupid Shinpaku Alliance
now or ever?

65
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:57,443
And yet you keep
bringing me

66
00:03:57,443 --> 00:03:59,570
this half-assed
Ragnarok information!

67
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,239
Did you say half assed...?

68
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,782
You think the intricate
network of spies

69
00:04:02,782 --> 00:04:05,076
and informants I worked
so hard on is half assed?

70
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:06,744
Yeah, that's right...

71
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:08,788
I think all of your spreadsheets
and diagrams and interviews

72
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:10,415
only prove one thing.

73
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:11,541
You don't know what
you're dealing with

74
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,209
and you're in way
over your head!

75
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,585
Admit it.

76
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:16,421
Fine... If you
choose to believe

77
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:17,797
that the information
I've put together

78
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:19,424
for you so lovingly 'til now

79
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:21,175
is nothing more than a foolish
hobby I'm indulging in,

80
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:22,844
so be it...

81
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:24,804
I'll have to
prove you wrong...

82
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:26,931
I'll bring you a report
on Siegfried so juicy

83
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:28,599
you can drink it
with your breakfast!

84
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:32,353
I told you, I don't want
anything to do with this stuff!

85
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:34,480
I'll be back.

86
00:04:35,982 --> 00:04:37,108
What the...

87
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:38,401
He's insane.

88
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,571
Well, your buddy there
is certainly ambitious,

89
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:43,364
isn't he, Kenichi?

90
00:04:43,364 --> 00:04:46,284
My buddy...? Are you
talking about Niijima?

91
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:48,077
At least this opponent
he has lined up for you

92
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:49,245
sounds interesting...

93
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:50,538
An enemy who gets back up

94
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:51,581
no matter how many times

95
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:53,499
you knock him down
to the ground, huh?

96
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:55,084
I've never fought
a zombie before

97
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:56,878
could be just the
challenge I need.

98
00:04:58,046 --> 00:05:00,047
I have.

99
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:03,092
So who is this tiger wrestling
guy he was talking about?

100
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:05,595
The name he used
was Sigfreed.

101
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:07,680
A name to respect...

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,224
In Norse mythology,
Sigfreed was a warrior

103
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:11,642
who was raised by a king...

104
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:13,936
After slaying the
vicious dragon Fafnir,

105
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:15,938
he accidentally tasted
the beast's blood

106
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:18,107
and therefore became
an immortal.

107
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:21,277
I know... But then kids these
days love fanciful names...

108
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,112
There might be
no connection...

109
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:25,156
Oh, and Sakaki,
Roy was mauled.

110
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:26,449
Whatever... I know.

111
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:28,826
Look, I don't care...

112
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:30,912
tiger wrestler or
a dragon slayer...

113
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:33,247
It has nothing whatsoever
to do with my life...

114
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:34,540
I'm refusing to be a puppet

115
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,918
in Niijima's master
plan anymore.

116
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,711
That man is bad news...

117
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:40,046
his path is dark...

118
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:42,381
he will suffer greatly.

119
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:44,592
The smell of death
is around him...

120
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:46,511
it poisons his future...

121
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:47,595
haunts him.

122
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:48,596
What?

123
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,348
How do you know
that, Shigure?

124
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:51,349
Humph.

125
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:53,100
Ignore'er...
She only sounds like

126
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,477
she knows what's
going on...

127
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:56,062
It's because of
that low voice

128
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:57,605
and the flat
delivery she uses.

129
00:05:57,605 --> 00:05:59,857
I don't know.
Sometimes she's kinda right.

130
00:05:59,857 --> 00:06:02,819
She says it so spooky it
almost makes me believe it.

131
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:04,278
Heh... You worried?

132
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:05,822
Uh-uh!

133
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:07,240
You sure, Kenichi...?

134
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,658
It's okay to be
a little worried

135
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:10,576
about your friend's
safety, you know.

136
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,537
He's not my friend!

137
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:15,248
A bad friend is still
a friend, young man.

138
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:16,791
And you should
always be concerned

139
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,043
about the well being of
someone you care about.

140
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:20,545
I don't care.

141
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:22,463
He'll be fine! Niijima
would never do anything

142
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,006
to put his own
life in jeopardy.

143
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:25,591
He's a pansy!

144
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:26,425
Right?

145
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:36,498
May I help you with
something, Loki?

146
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:38,250
Sorry to bother you...

147
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,378
just wondering how your latest
symphony or whatever is coming.

148
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:43,964
My recent battles have
been uninspiring...

149
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:45,382
I don't know when
I'll be able to finish

150
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:47,468
this particular piece,
unfortunately.

151
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,139
I need swinging arms
to give it tempo...

152
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,475
I need cries of pain
to give it a voice...

153
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:56,977
and I need a face
discovering true terror

154
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:59,021
to show me the journey
of my melody...

155
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:01,815
without any of that,
I am lost...

156
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:04,234
Raw combat is
my only muse.

157
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,573
Too bad the Great Saint
Fists forbids it...

158
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:13,452
I would like to have a
rousing battle now, Loki...

159
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:15,913
Would you?

160
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,832
Tell me, how goes
your search

161
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:22,836
for the ever-elusive weakness of
the great Shinpaku Alliance.

162
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:24,129
Though I fail
to see a need

163
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:25,923
for such cautiousness, myself.

164
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:28,008
I like coming up with the
right plan for each enemy

165
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:29,885
and watching it
put into action...

166
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:32,137
That's half the fun,
isn't it?

167
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:33,347
By the way,

168
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:35,682
have you noticed anything
suspicious lately, Maestro?

169
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:37,476
Any prying eyes?

170
00:07:37,476 --> 00:07:40,646
I have been curiously
popular the past few days...

171
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:42,439
I suppose I shouldn't
be flattered?

172
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,607
Your call...

173
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:45,234
His name is Haruo Niijima,

174
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:46,944
and he's with the Shipaku...

175
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:49,405
Actually, he's the one
who holds them together...

176
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:51,532
In other words if
somebody got rid of him...

177
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:53,283
they'd take care of
the whole problem.

178
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:55,702
This peeping tom

179
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:58,205
is the Shinpaku Alliance's
greatest weakness...

180
00:07:58,205 --> 00:07:59,707
Whaddaya think, Sieg?

181
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:01,291
Ready to hear the music?

182
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:06,880
Weird. My neck
feels all tingly.

183
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,966
Ooh, lookey...!
It's a worm!...

184
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,843
I caught myself a big,
juicy one...!

185
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:12,636
Loki's gonna be happy!

186
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:15,222
Is that a woman?

187
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:16,849
Gimmee, gimmee,
gimme, gimmee!

188
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:18,016
A pervert...!

189
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:19,435
The guy's a pervert...!

190
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:20,769
He touched me!

191
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:26,233
So that didn't
go so bad...

192
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,234
Got a little careless,

193
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:28,986
but my special
boob-entrapping maneuver

194
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,154
worked like a charm.

195
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:35,200
He's after me!

196
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,201
Tear gas!

197
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:38,662
The Enforcer!

198
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:43,667
And that was the
Niijima combo.

199
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,043
Don't see why
everyone's all afraid

200
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:46,587
of this Immortal Composer guy!

201
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:47,838
That was a piece of cake!

202
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,304
So the Fifth Fist is nothing but
a musically inclined dupe...

203
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:57,556
Let's see how interested
you are in this, Kenichi.

204
00:08:57,556 --> 00:09:00,350
I find you intriguing.

205
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,312
You have strength of will,
though you are weak.

206
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:04,605
No, that's impossible!

207
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:07,399
I saw you go down!

208
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,984
I like you...

209
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:09,860
Niijima.

210
00:09:11,612 --> 00:09:13,405
I took him down!
I know I did!

211
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:15,199
Oh well, no time to
think about that now.

212
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,742
Just concentrate
on running.

213
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:18,076
There's no way
he'll catch me!

214
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,039
How is he not even hurt?!

215
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,540
I'll chase you forever...!

216
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,917
If you run to France...

217
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,502
We shall battle
at the Bastille!

218
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:27,836
We'll what?!

219
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:31,298
Niijima U-turn!

220
00:09:31,298 --> 00:09:32,466
Such a beautiful rhythm!

221
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:33,467
Ahhh!

222
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:35,177
Niijima trash can toss!

223
00:09:35,177 --> 00:09:36,345
Yes, Niijima!

224
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:38,180
What a perfect melody
you're creating!

225
00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:42,434
This guy has some
serious issues!

226
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:44,937
I'm sorry, my
beautiful instrument...

227
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:46,772
I wanted to wring
so many more notes

228
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,357
from our worthy encounter...

229
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:50,234
but I'm afraid
our time is up...

230
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:51,610
the music is calling...

231
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,903
Can you hear it...?

232
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:55,656
There! The grand finale!

233
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:58,617
What is he talking about?!

234
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:01,119
There!

235
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:03,330
Finally, I can see
my path to victory!

236
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,332
Within that sewer
lies my oasis!

237
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:07,084
Onward, to freedom!

238
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:08,168
Niijima excrement...

239
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:10,420
DEFENSE!

240
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:16,718
The fates want us to take
this plunge together!

241
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:18,262
What?!

242
00:10:18,262 --> 00:10:20,556
No...! Let me go!!

243
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:24,851
Your solo ends here
and we begin our duet!

244
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:27,521
I lost...

245
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:28,939
I never lose...

246
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:30,899
Save me, Kenichi!

247
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,403
Commander, the Captain!
He's gone!

248
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:36,655
How many times have I asked
you not to call me that...?

249
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:39,408
My name's Kenichi and I
am not your commander.

250
00:10:39,408 --> 00:10:42,411
Captain Niijima hasn't been
at headquarters all day, sir!

251
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:45,163
Well, maybe he finally got
tired of playing dictator.

252
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:47,124
But he sent me a text
message yesterday...

253
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:48,959
It said 'Tell Kenichi
to save me.'

254
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,961
And I haven't heard
from him since.

255
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:53,505
It's always possible
he's been kidnapped.

256
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:54,965
Yeah, by NASA...

257
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:56,258
Only they'd want him...

258
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:57,342
Hey, what do you think,

259
00:10:57,342 --> 00:10:59,177
have they got around to
dissecting him yet?

260
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:01,555
Now go find someone else
to play his little game.

261
00:11:01,555 --> 00:11:03,015
I'm done with him.

262
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:04,933
But sir! We can't...!

263
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,435
We already tried asking
the other Generals

264
00:11:06,435 --> 00:11:07,853
if they'd help him.

265
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:09,730
Tell Niijima he's
full of crap.

266
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,898
And they think he's lying!

267
00:11:11,898 --> 00:11:13,400
Well, I can't blame them...

268
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,985
He probably is!

269
00:11:14,985 --> 00:11:16,486
Um, okay, look...

270
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:19,489
This morning underneath
the bridge I- found- this...

271
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:21,742
It's the Captain's PDA!

272
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:23,076
It must've floated
to the surface

273
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:24,828
because of the water
resistance feature.

274
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:25,871
Uh-oh.

275
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:27,164
He never goes anywhere

276
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:28,665
without this stupid
thing attached to him.

277
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:30,417
He must really be in
trouble this time.

278
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:31,752
You're sure?

279
00:11:31,752 --> 00:11:34,129
Yeah, there's no way he would've
just left it somewhere...

280
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:35,589
I don't care if it was at
the bottom of a lake...

281
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:37,007
he would've
dived for it.

282
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:38,842
Then somebody
must've taken him.

283
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:40,427
It was Ragnarok!

284
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:42,346
It's gotta be them,
who else would it be?

285
00:11:42,346 --> 00:11:44,097
Okay, don't panic...

286
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:45,891
I mean Niijima can take
care of himself, right?

287
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,022
Miu! We should
start heading home!

288
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:53,106
But, sir!

289
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:56,026
So you're really not
worried about him?

290
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:57,736
Oh, I'm sure
he'll be fine...

291
00:11:57,736 --> 00:11:59,112
And anyway...

292
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:01,281
I've got my training to
worry about today, right?

293
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:02,783
Y' seem anxious
to get to it...

294
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:03,784
that's a new one.

295
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:05,452
Yeah.

296
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:07,204
I almost forgot.

297
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:08,830
Forgot what?

298
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,415
Today's the release date
for the new issue of

299
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:13,418
Daigakukan's Martial
Arts of Fury!

300
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:15,587
I'm gonna stop by the
bookstore first. Okay...?

301
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:16,880
I'll see you at home!

302
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,006
Kenichi!

303
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:21,802
You're not fooling
anyone, ya big softy.

304
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:26,556
Wouldn't this have
been the time

305
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:29,851
to use your "escape skills",
alien freak?

306
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,937
You know, so you
don't get captured?!

307
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:46,702
Okay, if they found his
PDA under this bridge...

308
00:12:46,702 --> 00:12:49,246
Then there should be a
clue here somewhere...

309
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,622
I'll just have to keep
looking further downstream

310
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:51,790
I guess.

311
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,542
Did you find anything yet?

312
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,252
Not yet, but
Niijima's too sneaky

313
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:56,837
not to have left me
a clue here somewhe...

314
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,840
Miu...!

315
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,299
You followed me? !

316
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:02,843
I saw something
over there.

317
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:03,969
Do you think
that shoe is his?

318
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,515
Yeah... That's his...

319
00:13:08,515 --> 00:13:10,016
He must've dropped
it in a struggle.

320
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:14,354
Look, there's
another over there!

321
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:16,440
He left us a trail.

322
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,066
Niijima!

323
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:19,943
I take it you're
coming with me?

324
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:21,153
Right...

325
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:22,237
Keep your eyes peeled.

326
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:23,363
Got it!

327
00:13:23,363 --> 00:13:26,033
Niijima, hang on...!
You did good.

328
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:28,326
I won't waste the
clues you left me...!

329
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:29,661
I will find you!

330
00:13:29,661 --> 00:13:31,371
Kenichi? He'll be alright...

331
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:32,372
Won't he?

332
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,918
I don't think we're gonna
find any more clues.

333
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:39,963
He tried so
hard to help...

334
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:42,174
but he had nothing left...!

335
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:44,468
At least I hope he didn't leave
us anything else after this,

336
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:46,428
cause: Ew.

337
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:47,929
Well, we know the
general direction

338
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:49,973
they were taking him in,
that's good, right?

339
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:51,141
Yeah...

340
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:52,809
but the area's
still too big.

341
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:56,688
Why is he naked, Sieg?

342
00:13:56,688 --> 00:13:59,816
He lost all sense of modesty
after hearing my beautiful song

343
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:02,444
and gave himself over
to the elements.

344
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:05,781
Uh huh. Or... he left all his
clothes behind in a trail

345
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:08,033
so his friends
could find him.

346
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:09,618
Niijima, I'm sad...

347
00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:12,329
Don't you want to create
transcendent music with me?

348
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:14,748
Look at what we
accomplished last night...

349
00:14:14,748 --> 00:14:17,375
We wrote a wonderful
rondo of despair.

350
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,711
I couldn't have done it without
your screams of terror.

351
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:25,467
So what are you jerks
planning on doing with me?

352
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:28,178
Quit trying to act like
you're all tough, you pervert!.

353
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:30,180
Loki, his bony legs
are freaking me out,

354
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,598
can't we just kill him now?

355
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:33,141
What?!

356
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:34,434
Oh, don't worry...

357
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:36,228
20's just having
a little fun...

358
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:37,938
Ragnarok isn't
a death squad,

359
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:39,648
we are a team of
martial artists...

360
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:42,317
We don't kill the
people who offend us...

361
00:14:42,317 --> 00:14:43,485
we do, however,

362
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:45,695
administer punishment
accordingly, of course.

363
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:47,364
Punishment?

364
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,991
Yeah... For instance, you're
gonna take a one way trip

365
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:52,119
on this cargo ship here......

366
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,036
In a box.

367
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:55,956
It'll be a little vacation.

368
00:14:55,956 --> 00:14:57,415
Only you won't
be seeing much.

369
00:14:57,415 --> 00:14:58,416
Or moving.

370
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,668
We don't know how many
months it'll take,

371
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:00,710
or where you'll end up.

372
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,629
But I'm sure
you'll love it.

373
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:04,548
Who knows? Maybe if
you're really lucky

374
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:06,550
you won't get your head
cut off by pirates.

375
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:09,094
Boys... load him on up!

376
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:10,595
Yessir!

377
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:12,305
No! Let me go!

378
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:13,473
Let go!

379
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:16,268
You guys are making a big
fat mistake, you hear me?

380
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:18,687
When the great Shinpaku
generals hear about this...

381
00:15:18,687 --> 00:15:20,480
They're not going
to be too happy!

382
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,523
You think...?

383
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:23,942
I doubt they'll care.

384
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:26,027
I saw how they
felt about you...

385
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:27,988
when they came to
the restaurant...

386
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:30,282
That day you tricked
them into helping you...

387
00:15:30,282 --> 00:15:32,826
They never wanted to be
part of your Alliance.

388
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:34,494
They don't care
about any of it.

389
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:38,123
And I'm betting they don't
care about you, either.

390
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,876
But... can't be sure
until we test it.

391
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:42,128
So bon voyage.

392
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,680
We looked all around
the neighborhood,

393
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,349
but we didn't find anything.

394
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,100
We're not sure
what else to try.

395
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,728
I see, well that is
a dilemma, isn't it?

396
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:56,481
But, I mean, it's not like
I care about that freak...

397
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:58,900
Not really anyway...

398
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,902
No, no, of course
you don't, my boy.

399
00:16:00,902 --> 00:16:02,195
I can find him...

400
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,738
That won't be a problem.

401
00:16:03,738 --> 00:16:04,781
What?!

402
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:07,575
Me too! Apachai can
find the alien!

403
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,243
Yeah you can, Apachai!

404
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:14,415
I need only one
thing from you...

405
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:15,500
His birthday.

406
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,709
Star charts?!

407
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:20,004
He has long ears like this,
and his eyes are sneaky.

408
00:16:20,004 --> 00:16:21,297
And birds?!

409
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:23,549
I know where they took
your friend, Kenichi!

410
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,843
How could you possibly
know the answer from that?!

411
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:28,179
If my calculations
are correct...

412
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,806
Your friend is being...

413
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:31,015
We tried everything else,

414
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:32,683
we might as well give
them a shot, right?

415
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:33,726
Here!

416
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,603
Ahhh! How'd they do that?

417
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:38,439
Come on, Kenichi, let's go!

418
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,191
You ready to save
Niijima or what?

419
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,943
You bet I'm ready!

420
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:43,903
I think I might
tag along with ya.

421
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:44,946
Oh yes, me too!

422
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:46,614
Can Apachai come with?

423
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:49,283
We do not interfere in
our disciple's battles.

424
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:51,577
-Alright, it's just us.
-Right.

425
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,539
You're no fun, you
know that, Akisame?

426
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:56,332
Wish I could come
with you, big brother!

427
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:57,625
Me too.

428
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,293
We're coming to
save you, Niijima!

429
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,463
It's done sir...

430
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,631
The crate's been loaded

431
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,216
and we didn't have
any problems at all.

432
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:06,717
Now that that's done...

433
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:17,854
Nice. I might actually
like this new song...

434
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,063
Let's help our friend Sieg

435
00:17:19,063 --> 00:17:20,898
come up with a good
ending, huh boys?

436
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:21,941
Found them!

437
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,317
They're over here!

438
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:24,235
It's you!

439
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:25,695
Hello, Loki...

440
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,905
I'm here to take
Niijima back home.

441
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:28,865
That's right!

442
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,575
I don't understand
why you're here...!

443
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:33,035
It doesn't make any sense
for you to be here.

444
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:34,620
I researched you...

445
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,873
I know that Haruo Niijima
bullied you in school

446
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:38,040
and that he teased you...!

447
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,917
Well? Am I wrong?

448
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,752
Am I missing
something here...?

449
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:43,671
Why do you care?!

450
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:45,798
I won't say the
guy's perfect...

451
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,467
He's not...

452
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,052
All that matters is that he
wants to be my friend...!

453
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,471
So he is!

454
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,349
Ugh... This is such a
big disappointment...

455
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:57,101
All my plans,
blown to crap

456
00:17:57,101 --> 00:17:58,686
because of some
ridiculous principal

457
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:01,189
you got stuck in your head,
like a tumor.

458
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:03,232
You screwed things up.

459
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:05,818
And I don't forgive something
like that real easy...

460
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,236
Too bad for you.

461
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:12,825
What's going on...?!

462
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,578
All the shouting out here made
me lose my beautiful melody!

463
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:18,664
And somebody's
going to pay.

464
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,625
Hey...! I won't
ask you again.

465
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,918
Where's Niijima?!

466
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:24,337
Unfortunately I seem
to have misplaced him,

467
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,631
but please, feel free
to try again later...

468
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:28,966
When I'm in a
better mood, maybe?

469
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:30,510
Think you're in a
bad mood now...?

470
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,053
You just wait!

471
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,764
I won't allow you
to fight him yet...

472
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:38,184
Not until you return my
melody with your blood!

473
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,311
I am the Fifth Fist,
Siegfried...

474
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:42,563
And you will
be battling me.

475
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:44,482
So this is Siegfried.

476
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:46,192
Tell me where you've
hidden Niijima...

477
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,152
And I'll give you the
fight you're asking for.

478
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:50,446
Yeah, like any of us

479
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:51,614
would be stupid enough
to answer that, kid...

480
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:52,824
He's on the ship in a box.

481
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:56,244
Okay. Fine, which ship?

482
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:57,328
I think it's that
one over there.

483
00:18:57,328 --> 00:18:59,163
Alright, that's
enough, Sieg.

484
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:01,165
Number 25 and Number 30...

485
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:02,375
-Take him down!
-Sir!

486
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:08,756
I told you, tonight this
one shall fight none but me!

487
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:11,175
Number 20! Number 43...!

488
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:12,260
There's nothing
we can do here

489
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,928
when he's like this...
we're leaving.

490
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:15,304
'Kay!

491
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:16,305
Hold on! You have
to come back here

492
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:17,932
and tell me if he
has the right ship!

493
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:20,184
I need to know if he was
pointing at the right one!

494
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:21,894
Now we will fight!

495
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,312
And I swear to you

496
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:25,481
if the melody we create
together is satisfactory,

497
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,568
I will help you
locate your friend.

498
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,319
I think you should
stay and fight him...

499
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,821
I'll follow Loki
and the rest!

500
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:33,823
'Kay.

501
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:35,366
I'll stay here and
fight you, I swear,

502
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:36,993
but first you have
to tell me...

503
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:38,327
Where is he?!

504
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:40,830
No... The time for
bargaining is through.

505
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,331
Guess I don't
have any choice...

506
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:43,291
FINE!

507
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,042
What's different
about this guy...?

508
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:46,586
It's weird...

509
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,754
He has this energy...

510
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,090
My passion for music
fills my essence

511
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,384
and lends power
to my every move.

512
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:55,928
Oh my god...

513
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,388
I'm a dead man!

514
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:01,392
Or not.

515
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,147
So what do you think of my
custom made air gun, blondie?

516
00:20:06,147 --> 00:20:07,231
It might not kill you,

517
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:08,900
but it'll hurt like
hell if you get hit!

518
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,443
Oh...

519
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,861
Like to play, huh?

520
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:22,246
Oh my gosh, you
could've died!

521
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:24,040
You know, Loki
keeps telling me.

522
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,709
People with principals
are really, really...

523
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:29,253
DUMB!

524
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,297
Darn it! I got careless.

525
00:20:32,423 --> 00:20:34,216
It's... over...?

526
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:36,135
Wow... This guy's
a lot weaker

527
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,303
than I thought he
was gonna be...

528
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,055
Umm, hey...

529
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:41,641
Can you wake up and tell me
where the ship is, please, sir?

530
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,185
And the prelude comes
gracefully to an end...

531
00:20:44,185 --> 00:20:46,729
-Feroce!
-Oh, crap!

532
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:48,064
Accelerando!

533
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:55,946
That's weird.

534
00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:57,198
His energy is back!

535
00:20:58,115 --> 00:20:59,367
You were playing dead!

536
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:00,910
I don't play at death...

537
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,120
I rise from the earth!

538
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,873
No... Pretty sure you
were playing dead...

539
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:08,000
Whatever... I won't
go easy on you now.

540
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,335
Yes, that's right...

541
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,045
Give me your anger,
your fury,

542
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:13,381
and I will turn it
to luminous sound...

543
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,384
Yamazuki!

544
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,970
I didn't pull that punch.

545
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,389
Now give me my answer...

546
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:22,807
I wanna know which
ship Niijima...

547
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:25,726
Fortissimo!

548
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:28,354
Animato!

549
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:31,857
Damn... No matter what

550
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,609
I try my attacks
won't phase him.

551
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:35,444
Your attacks are
slow and obvious,

552
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:37,321
with no emotion
behind them...

553
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:40,324
I had hoped that you would gift
me with your full attention.

554
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:42,326
But I can see that my
expectations for you

555
00:21:42,326 --> 00:21:43,661
were too high...

556
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:45,037
You do not fight
for your life,

557
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,081
and the melody falters.

558
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:48,165
Hah...

559
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:49,834
Perhaps your
lovely companion

560
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:52,378
would have been a
better opponent for me.

561
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,964
I think I'll seek
her out and see...

562
00:21:54,964 --> 00:21:58,801
Women in pain make lovely
muses for any artist.

563
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:00,261
Leave her alone!

564
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,683
Excellent, you begin
to show potential.

565
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:09,854
It's coming!

566
00:22:09,854 --> 00:22:11,272
Listen!

567
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:15,359
You want my attention...?

568
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,445
You got it! Kao Loi!

569
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,659
Annnnd...

570
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:24,952
a throw!

571
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:26,370
Alright...

572
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,789
You through playing
music with me yet?

573
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,124
Verrrry good.

574
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,379
How...? No way!

575
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:37,089
Despair...!

576
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,217
That is the symphony
that fills the body!

577
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:42,845
Now the time for our
tempestoso has arrived.

578
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,348
He isn't even in pain...!

579
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:48,601
It's like he didn't
feel my attacks!

580
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,978
Is he really... immortal?

581
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:58,444
[Music]

582
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,775
How about now?

583
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:21,819
You can't tell me you didn't
feel that attack this time!

584
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,363
Such a shame.

585
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,073
No rhythm at all.

586
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:28,159
If you stop to rest every
time you attack me

587
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,869
this melody will
have no beat.

588
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:33,539
Jeez...! This guy
really is a zombie!

589
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,582
Come now.

590
00:24:34,582 --> 00:24:36,709
Surely you have
more left in you.

591
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,378
Your friend, Niijima's very
life hangs in the balance...

592
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,671
don't you remember?

593
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:41,922
Damn it! Fine!

594
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:42,715
You want a fight?

595
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:44,925
I'll use every trick I've
learned to defeat you!

596
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:46,177
Bring it on, Siegfried!
