1
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:41,871
C'mon you don't have to do this!

2
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:43,247
Please, just let me go!

3
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:47,543
You already know you can beat me
so what's the point of fighting?

4
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:48,752
The point?

5
00:01:48,752 --> 00:01:50,796
I never said I was
making a point.

6
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:53,007
I just wanna fight
you, Shirahama!

7
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:55,217
No.

8
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:57,303
I won't fight you
without a reason.

9
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:03,017
Running away?

10
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:04,727
Everyone was right about you.

11
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:08,105
You really are nothing
but a coward.

12
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:09,982
No...

13
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:10,983
Shut up!

14
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:13,819
Take it back! Who are
you calling a coward!

15
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:17,948
Looks like you're
gonna have to make me,

16
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:19,658
but I don't think you can.

17
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:27,875
So fast!

18
00:02:35,716 --> 00:02:40,054
I worked so hard to train
and it didn't even matter.

19
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:44,183
It didn't help. Tsukuba beat me
without even breaking a sweat.

20
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:51,816
I'm sorry, it's not funny,
I shouldn't have laughed.

21
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:55,528
What do you plan
on doing about it?

22
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:58,239
Would you do the same thing
to him that he's done to you,

23
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,823
if you were given the chance?

24
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:06,038
All I wanted to do was prove to
him that he was wrong about me,

25
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:08,165
but all I could do was tell him.

26
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:10,459
And that wasn't going
to change anything.

27
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,127
I had to show him!

28
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:15,464
But when it came down to
it, I had nothing to show.

29
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:19,468
No matter how hard I tried,
I just couldn't do it.

30
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:21,387
I'm not strong enough!

31
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:23,764
I need strength and
I need courage.

32
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:28,227
Alright!

33
00:03:28,227 --> 00:03:30,980
Tomorrow you will begin
technique training!

34
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:38,571
I'll teach you some techniques
to counter karate moves.

35
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:40,823
These should help you
defeat you opponent.

36
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:42,366
I don't want to learn
these techniques

37
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:44,159
just to get revenge on Tsukuba.

38
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,870
I didn't say you should hit the
streets and hunt the guy down.

39
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,790
But I have a pretty good feeling
that if he's attacked you once,

40
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,709
then he's likely
to attack you again.

41
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,461
Oh... That's a valid point.

42
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,591
Now he's getting it.

43
00:03:58,591 --> 00:03:59,967
Well, let's see...

44
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,302
Sakaki...

45
00:04:01,302 --> 00:04:04,013
Do you have any advice for
our young disciple here?

46
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:06,432
I told you he's not my disciple.

47
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:09,310
Then why do you keep
following us everywhere?

48
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,355
I guess we'll just have
to use this, then.

49
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:15,149
We'll use that, for what?

50
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:17,568
Well, I call it the
Great Throwing Deity,

51
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:19,820
so I think you
can figure it out.

52
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,740
Comprehension of your
opponent's mass is crucial.

53
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,950
Now find the statue's weakness.

54
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,201
Right!

55
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:31,290
How am I supposed to throw
this thing, it's too heavy!

56
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,167
Sure, it's heavy, it's a statue.

57
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:40,466
Try to focus on its
center of gravity.

58
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:41,967
Its what?

59
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:44,762
The point in which the weight
of an object is balanced.

60
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:47,973
On a human body it's a
little bit below the navel.

61
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:50,184
If you simultaneously
attack your opponent's

62
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:54,063
center of gravity, and
throw off their balance...

63
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:57,316
...you'll easily overcome
them, no matter their size.

64
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,068
Amazing!

65
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:01,070
It's just basic physics.

66
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,864
Oh, sure, it's
common sense to you.

67
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:05,366
I will now show you a technique

68
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:07,284
that's both offensive
and defensive.

69
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:08,410
Yes, sir!

70
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:11,747
Hasn't he got something
better to do?

71
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:13,332
Focus, Kenichi.

72
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:17,086
Simply dodging an
attack isn't enough.

73
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:19,004
You must counter your
opponent's attack,

74
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:22,132
using his position to
render him defenseless.

75
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:28,681
Um, Sensei, how is this move
both offensive and defensive?

76
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:32,601
Hm...

77
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:34,979
Miu, come over
here for a second.

78
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:35,729
Sure...

79
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:38,524
Alright, Miu, I want you to
attack me with all you've got.

80
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:39,942
Okay...

81
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:41,235
You asked for it.

82
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:44,363
Whoa!

83
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:46,115
Cool! So you lock
your opponent's leg

84
00:05:46,115 --> 00:05:47,032
while dodging their kick?

85
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:49,451
Exactly! This also puts you
right where you want to be:

86
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:51,328
face level with their chest!

87
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,582
Ahh!

88
00:05:55,582 --> 00:05:57,001
You sicko!

89
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:59,294
Get back here, you
dirty old pervert!

90
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:00,796
I'm gonna beat some
respect into you!

91
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:02,673
Now you practice on your
own! Repeat the technique

92
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:03,924
as many times
as is necessary!

93
00:06:03,924 --> 00:06:05,175
Right.

94
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:06,802
You're old enough
to be my grandfather!

95
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:11,098
No, you don't have
to practice that part!

96
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:14,810
Alright! Is now time
for Apachai's turn!

97
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,019
Apa?

98
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:19,773
Whyyy?!

99
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:22,109
I was so close to getting away!

100
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:24,111
Lemme go! If he
gets ahold of me

101
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:26,405
I'm done for, and it'll
be all your fault!

102
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:28,198
Really? How sad.

103
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:30,534
Why?

104
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:32,369
Why you always run?

105
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:33,746
You don't hold back.

106
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:36,707
You, uh, you don't
seem to know how!

107
00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:38,083
I can, you see.

108
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,711
I will hold mitts today,
no fighting, okay?

109
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:42,796
Then you won't punch me
into the stratosphere again?

110
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:45,674
No, I think that we did start
with sparring too soon.

111
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:48,427
You still terrible so you
start with punching.

112
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:52,306
Guess I don't have a choice.

113
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:56,143
Yes, you do great kid!

114
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:57,561
Now you try harder!

115
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:00,647
Way to go, that is
the way to do it!

116
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:01,940
Very good!

117
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,610
You doing it terrible,
but you doing it great!

118
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,278
Now you learn to dodge!

119
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:08,781
Apa!

120
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:13,035
That filthy creep's gotta be
around here somewhere.

121
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:15,287
Nooooo!

122
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:18,040
Kenichi!

123
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:46,276
Apapa! You supposed to dodge it!

124
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,492
My back!

125
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:55,035
Is something wrong?

126
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:57,704
Don't tell me you're giving up.

127
00:07:57,704 --> 00:07:58,789
No!

128
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:00,749
Not yet!

129
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:03,502
I have to admit, you're
doing alright, kid.

130
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:06,380
A lot better than I thought you
would. To tell you the truth,

131
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,466
I figured you would have run
home crying after three days.

132
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:10,759
Thanks!

133
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,886
Wow, that was kind of nice.

134
00:08:12,886 --> 00:08:15,097
But, I haven't come that far.

135
00:08:15,097 --> 00:08:18,934
I'm still pretty weak so I'm
having trouble with this statue.

136
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:21,395
Not so bright, are you kid?

137
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:24,565
Haven't you noticed that
statue seems a little weird?

138
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:25,524
Weird?

139
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:26,525
Sakaki...

140
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:29,111
Mind your own business.

141
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:31,029
Now that you mention it...

142
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:36,201
Akisame sensei, I don't remember
the statue being quite this big.

143
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:38,328
It must have magically
grown to challenge you.

144
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:39,913
You're just joking, right?

145
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:42,875
No, no!

146
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,294
Don't look in there,
that room's off limits!

147
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:54,136
It's not what you're thinking.

148
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:57,264
You made it bigger and
bigger everyday, didn't you?!

149
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:58,807
Yes, but think how easily

150
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,809
you could throw that
first statue, now?

151
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:03,520
Listen, Kenichi. Your
opponents will vary in size

152
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,024
so it's best that your practice
reflects this inevitability.

153
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:10,611
Alright, but it sounds to me
like you're dodging the point.

154
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:11,945
Guess what, kid?

155
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:14,364
Today's your lucky day.

156
00:09:14,364 --> 00:09:17,075
I'm gonna make an exception
and teach you somethin'.

157
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:19,369
Now why don'tcha tell me
about this Karate Club idiot

158
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:21,246
that mopped the asphalt
with your face.

159
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:22,080
Huh?

160
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,332
I'm shocked...

161
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:25,918
I didn't think you took
on disciples, Sakaki.

162
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:27,544
This is a one time only thing.

163
00:09:27,544 --> 00:09:30,005
Cuz' today happens to
be a special occasion.

164
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:32,549
It's the uh, well,
it's the um...

165
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:33,383
That's it!

166
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:35,552
It's the anniversary of
the day Judo was created!

167
00:09:35,552 --> 00:09:37,888
So in its honor, I'll
teach you. C'mon.

168
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:39,848
Uh, sure.

169
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:41,600
I wasn't expecting this...

170
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,518
Maybe I was wrong about Sakaki.

171
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:45,812
He might not be such
a scary guy after all.

172
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:48,732
That was by far the worst
lie I've ever heard.

173
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:50,525
So, what was the karate style

174
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:52,194
of this jerk who
tried to kill you?

175
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:54,029
Well I'm not sure. Why?

176
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:55,697
Because it's the
most important thing

177
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:58,825
you can know about your
opponent! That's why!

178
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:00,202
I'm sorry, don't kill me!

179
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:02,746
Hey, calm down, I'm
not angry or anything,

180
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:05,832
I just want to know what sort
of fighting stance he took.

181
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:07,417
His hands were like this...

182
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,002
And his body was...

183
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:10,254
...defensive.

184
00:10:10,254 --> 00:10:11,672
And his steps were bouncy.

185
00:10:11,672 --> 00:10:12,756
Bouncy?!

186
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:14,341
What do you mean?!

187
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:16,969
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
that I was ever born!

188
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:20,389
Hey, relax, I'm
not angry at you.

189
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:21,598
And in fact...

190
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:23,600
If that's all true about
his fighting style,

191
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,520
then I know a technique that'll
beat this guy almost every time.

192
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,354
Huh?

193
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:29,106
Go outside. I'll show you.

194
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,315
Right.

195
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:39,408
He's actually teaching someone?

196
00:10:39,408 --> 00:10:42,619
Whoa? What did you guys
do to him? Drug him?

197
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:45,414
No, this is all him. But
I always had a feeling

198
00:10:45,414 --> 00:10:47,541
that he'd be good
at teaching others.

199
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:51,378
A true teacher responds to
his disciple and in turn,

200
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:52,796
the two learn together.

201
00:10:55,243 --> 00:10:56,745
Listen up, kid.

202
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:58,496
From what you're tellin'
me, I'm guessing

203
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:00,749
this guy's a sports
karate fighter.

204
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:02,959
He's probably got a
broad fighting style

205
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,669
and uses a variety
of techniques.

206
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,463
But that means he's
classically trained

207
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:08,506
and there's a few
things he won't know.

208
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:11,426
So those are the things
I'm gonna teach you.

209
00:11:11,426 --> 00:11:12,886
Do you uh...

210
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:15,054
What, kid, spit it out.

211
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:16,681
It's not "kid".

212
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,850
My name is Kenichi, kay?.

213
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,769
Really, you want me to call
you by your name, huh?

214
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:23,521
I kind of forgot
you were human.

215
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:27,192
But even dogs have
names, so sure.

216
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:33,406
Well in that case, you can call
me Sakaki sensei, okay, Kenichi?

217
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:35,783
Sure, Sakaki sensei!

218
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:37,410
Doh, it's nothing.

219
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,453
Well, I...

220
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,246
what I was gonna ask you...

221
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:41,498
Do you...

222
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:44,000
...really believe that
I can become stronger?.

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,710
I'm so worried that
if I lose again

224
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,253
after all of this training...

225
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:48,254
that I...

226
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:49,297
That what?.

227
00:11:49,297 --> 00:11:52,759
That you'll never become strong
enough?

228
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,344
Alright, Sakaki...

229
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:55,929
be gentle with him...

230
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:59,682
He needs your belief in him as
much as he needs your guidance.

231
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:03,102
Tell me. Just how strong
do you wanna be?

232
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:06,815
Um, well I uh...

233
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:08,775
do you promise not
to laugh at me?

234
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:09,859
Of course not!

235
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,945
What kind of man laughs
at another's goals?

236
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,868
Truth is, I want
to be strong enough

237
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:21,120
to protect the people
that I care about.

238
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:28,127
Hey, I thought you said

239
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:30,255
you wouldn't laugh at
another man's goals.

240
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:32,590
I'm not! A man would have said

241
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,844
that he wants to be the
strongest in the world.

242
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:37,178
Listen, Kenichi.

243
00:12:37,178 --> 00:12:39,722
Life isn't about what
can and can not be done.

244
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:41,182
It's about...

245
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:42,892
...doing it, or not doing it!

246
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:44,018
Right!

247
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:46,521
So! Are you finally
ready to do something?

248
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:47,939
Yes!

249
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:51,192
Alright then. Let's teach you
something worth knowing!

250
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:52,318
Right!

251
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,841
So, what's the word, Tsukuba?

252
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:16,634
Was that freshman
worthwhile material

253
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:18,052
or just another write off?

254
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:20,346
I overestimated Shirahama.

255
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:23,099
Hm, slim pickings this year.

256
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:25,768
There's another one for you.

257
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:28,980
Some new kid in the Judo Club,
has his own fighting style.

258
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,440
I hear he's a nasty one.

259
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,109
Is it just rumors or
can he really fight?

260
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:35,695
Every time you pit me against
one of these scrawny punks

261
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:37,238
I end up tearing him to pieces.

262
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:38,281
Who cares?

263
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:41,492
Tear him up. Who says you
can't have fun while you work?

264
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:46,748
Hey, check it out, it's Miu.

265
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:49,083
I've just gotta finish
watering the flowers, okay.

266
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,335
It shouldn't take too long.

267
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:53,212
Alright then, meet me at the
front gate when you're done.

268
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:59,594
Can you believe that they
actually walk home together?

269
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:02,263
Man. Maybe we
should talk to her.

270
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:03,014
What?

271
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:04,724
If she's friends with
ol' "weak-knees",

272
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:06,184
then we've gotta have a chance.

273
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:08,436
Yeah, I hadn't thought
about it like that.

274
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:09,687
If she likes that loser

275
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:12,231
then she's totally gonna
love us, you know?

276
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:14,359
Hey, hey Miu, wait up!

277
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:20,907
Completely worthless...

278
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:23,368
And they said you were
some kind of Judo genius

279
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:26,537
with your own fighting style.
You're just wastin' my time!

280
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:28,498
I'm tired of dickin'
with you losers!

281
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:30,500
Can't find a challenge anywhere!

282
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,710
I'm sorry! Please
just let me go!

283
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,754
You think you're tough, huh?

284
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:39,717
Didn't anyone every tell you to
pick on someone your own size?

285
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,471
Here, let me help.

286
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,682
I don't know what you
think you're doing--

287
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:49,394
I'm only gonna say this once.
Walk away or you're in trouble.

288
00:14:49,394 --> 00:14:51,437
Well, that was an
interesting move, girly.

289
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:54,190
You must be strong to be
able to pull that off.

290
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,067
Looks like I found
what I'm lookin' for.

291
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:58,194
I need a good fight.

292
00:14:58,194 --> 00:14:59,737
I'm sorry Kenichi.

293
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:01,280
I know how hard
you've been training

294
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,617
so you can take on Tsukuba,
but I don't have a choice.

295
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:07,537
There's no way I can
turn my back on this.

296
00:15:07,537 --> 00:15:09,914
Come on, tell ya what.

297
00:15:09,914 --> 00:15:12,333
I'll even let you hit
me a few times.

298
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:17,213
Back off!

299
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:21,175
Who do you think you
are threatening her?

300
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:24,178
I'm not gonna let you touch
her! This is between us!

301
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:25,596
But Kenichi...

302
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:27,932
You've picked a really
bad time to get in my way

303
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:30,226
you little punk, but if
you wanna get beat again,

304
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:31,310
then that's fine with me.

305
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,563
You can't do this.
You can't beat him,

306
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:34,605
you're still in training.

307
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:36,566
I don't care.

308
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:40,820
This is something I have
to do, Miu. To be a man!

309
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,531
Look, I'm warning you I'm not
gonna hold back this time.

310
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:46,492
So you're digging your
own grave, kid. Understand?

311
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:49,412
I'm scared...

312
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:51,372
I can still remember
his punches.

313
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:53,583
My body remembers how
heavy his fists are,

314
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,919
but it doesn't matter.
I'm still gonna fight!

315
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,714
Listen, Kenichi. When guys
that aren't used to fighting

316
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:02,842
wind up in one, their hands
tend to get kind of shaky.

317
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:05,178
Their fists go weak,
and they end up waiting

318
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:07,096
for the other guy to
make the first move.

319
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:09,390
Yeah, that's exactly
what happened to me.

320
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,350
Don't be scared.

321
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,020
It's easier said
than done, I guess.

322
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,189
So there's only one thing
you need to focus on.

323
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:16,898
Right.

324
00:16:16,898 --> 00:16:19,192
You have to land the
first attack! That's it!

325
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:21,068
Clear your mind
of anything else!

326
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:23,780
Don't even think about how
you'll follow that first punch.

327
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,531
And with this technique,

328
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:27,116
you will win the fight!

329
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:30,203
The first move always
wins, Kenichi!

330
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:33,539
Wow, you're slow.

331
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:42,590
No way!

332
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,801
The Yamazuki of Bassai...

333
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:46,260
It's an ancient technique

334
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,096
that's rarely used in
sports karate fighting.

335
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:50,556
How perfect.

336
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,726
I hit him...

337
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:57,188
I can't believe it!
It's just like Sakaki said!

338
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:59,982
Here's the thing, Kenichi,
people are usually most afraid

339
00:16:59,982 --> 00:17:01,359
of getting punched in the face,

340
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:03,945
so they're gonna
block it, like this!

341
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:05,446
Just like I said, right?

342
00:17:05,446 --> 00:17:07,657
Well, unless you've had a
lot of training, you're not

343
00:17:07,657 --> 00:17:10,409
gonna to think of trying to
block a lower punch as well.

344
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,370
But I didn't even see it!

345
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,996
Right, which is why
it's gonna work

346
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:15,832
against this sports
karate chump.

347
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:18,334
You see this guy's training has
been formed around rules

348
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:20,628
and predictability, instead
of the free-for-all style

349
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:22,672
of a real fight.

350
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:24,590
And this technique,
isn't allowed

351
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,676
in tournament
fighting anymore,

352
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:28,719
so I doubt he's seen
it used too many times.

353
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:31,430
And he won't expect it from you.

354
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,266
Was that the Yamazuki?

355
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:34,976
You coward...

356
00:17:34,976 --> 00:17:38,062
Nobody ever uses that
technique in a karate match.

357
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:39,856
But this isn't a match, is it?

358
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:41,190
It's a fight!

359
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,902
That was dirty. I wasn't even
thinking about my stomach.

360
00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:47,155
I can't believe he
landed the first blow.

361
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:48,948
I've gotta pull myself together.

362
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:50,074
Why you!

363
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:54,954
Time to try out
Kensei's technique.

364
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:56,163
It's breaking!

365
00:17:56,831 --> 00:17:59,125
I'll kill you! I mean it!

366
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,210
You're dead!
This is goodbye kid!

367
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:03,713
It's so slow...

368
00:18:03,713 --> 00:18:06,465
He's too angry to
focus. I can stop it.

369
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:09,093
Compared to Apachai's
punches, it's not even moving.

370
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,303
I've got it!

371
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:14,348
His balance is off! His center
of gravity is completely open!

372
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:20,521
This is nothing! After
Akisame sensei's training

373
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:22,857
and all of those statues,
I can hardly feel him!

374
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:24,692
He's as light as a feather!

375
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:30,198
I... I won.

376
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:31,699
Are you okay?

377
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:36,829
His pulse is steady!
I was worried I killed him.

378
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:40,875
What? He's more concerned about
the guy that tried to kill him

379
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:45,087
than he is about himself.
What a funny guy!

380
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:48,299
What? Why are you laughing,
did I say something weird?

381
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:52,219
I don't get it, was it
my fighting style?

382
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:53,512
Did I look stupid?

383
00:18:56,891 --> 00:18:58,559
So you won, ain't that nice.

384
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,977
Yeah, that's great news.

385
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:01,854
Can't you look happier for me

386
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:04,148
or at least tell me
that I did a good job?

387
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:05,816
Sure we could.
But you haven't even

388
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:07,610
gotten to the tough part yet.

389
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,028
What tough part?

390
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:10,821
You'll know soon enough.

391
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:16,994
Kenichi...

392
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:19,079
Really? He beat him?

393
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:19,914
Badly.

394
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:22,166
Interesting. Well, it
looks like Tsukuba

395
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:26,295
was wrong about that
scrawny freshman after all.

396
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:27,880
That's good news.

397
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:33,719
Now bring him to me.

398
00:19:39,141 --> 00:19:41,226
Right there, that's the guy.

399
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:45,898
That's weird.

400
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:47,358
Hey, is something up?

401
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:53,238
What's with that look? Huh?
Come on, you can tell me.

402
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:55,032
I might be able to help out.

403
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:57,493
Well, it's just that uh...

404
00:19:57,493 --> 00:20:00,496
I see, so you're worried that
everybody's afraid of you now?

405
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:02,665
Yeah. I'm starting
to feel like they are.

406
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:04,500
Extra, extra!

407
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,917
Huh?

408
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:07,378
In a wildly unexpected
turn of events,

409
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:09,630
full time freshman failure
'weak-knees' Kenichi

410
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,091
has defeated the dreaded
Tsukuba the terrible!

411
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,134
And he did it in
a single blow!

412
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:16,261
Don't look at it! Don't
read it, it's all lies!

413
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:18,555
What do you think
you're doing, Niijima?!

414
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:25,104
Well, if it isn't
my best friend!

415
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:27,189
I've been trying to
find you everywhere.

416
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:28,816
We are not friends!

417
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,859
And why are you
passing this stuff out?

418
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:32,361
Are you trying to ruin me?

419
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,196
Well I'm in the
Newspaper Club.

420
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:37,324
It's my duty as a journalist
to share this with the public.

421
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:38,575
They have a right to know.

422
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:39,702
No they don't!

423
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:41,203
Just look at your rankings!

424
00:20:41,203 --> 00:20:43,205
They've skyrocketed
straight to the top!

425
00:20:43,205 --> 00:20:44,790
You couldn't ask for better PR.

426
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,333
Yes I could!

427
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,252
I know the truth, Kenichi.

428
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:51,505
I know that you've been secretly
training in some exclusive dojo.

429
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:53,757
What? How could
you possibly know?

430
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:57,428
Never underestimate my
vast network of informants.

431
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:59,680
Actually I'm the one
who told him about it.

432
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,182
I didn't think you'd mind.

433
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:03,600
It only took ice cream.

434
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,145
You really wouldn't believe
how hard he's been training.

435
00:21:06,145 --> 00:21:07,021
Interesting?

436
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:09,982
Ice cream? He bought you off?

437
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:12,317
Niijima's your friend, I
didn't think you'd care!.

438
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:15,446
If I'd known I wouldn't
have said anything!

439
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:18,198
Haven't you already said
enough for one day?

440
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:19,783
Hit the deck, Kenichi.

441
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:27,666
Tsukuba's an embarrassment.

442
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,586
He's tarnished the
image of Ragnarok.

443
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:34,757
You take care of Tsukuba.

444
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:37,426
Tell him to drop out of
school and get out of town.

445
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:39,386
And keep your eyes
peeled for that freshman.

446
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:41,346
Kisara wants us
to bring him to her.

447
00:21:41,346 --> 00:21:42,222
Yeah.

448
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:43,724
Sure thing.

449
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,727
D-did you hear what
he just said?

450
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:49,188
Those guys want to find me
and take me someplace.

451
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:50,689
Maybe they just want
to be friends.

452
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:52,191
You know that's not
what they want!

453
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:54,943
I'm sorry, you don't
have to yell at me.

454
00:21:54,943 --> 00:21:57,529
Bad news for you, those
guys are with Ragnarok.

455
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:59,323
What's Ragnarok?

456
00:21:59,323 --> 00:22:00,824
Oh, Nothing big,

457
00:22:00,824 --> 00:22:03,994
just the most powerful
gang in the entire city.

458
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:06,246
You are in some seriously
hot water, old chum.

459
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:07,915
There's no escaping, Ragnarok.

460
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:10,042
They're probably waiting
on every street for you

461
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:11,960
and I bet they already
know where you live.

462
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,212
But this is what you get

463
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:14,463
for telling everybody
about your fight.

464
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:16,840
I knew you should have
kept quiet on the subject.

465
00:22:21,345 --> 00:22:23,055
You should see your
face right now.

466
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:24,765
Don't worry Kenichi
we can always

467
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:26,725
come up with a secret
escape route or something.

468
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:28,811
Yes, of course there's
something to worry about!

469
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:30,103
Why is he so mean?

470
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:32,105
Quit yelling, I'm
just trying to help.

471
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:33,816
He's a monster, isn't he?

472
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:35,692
He's always been
this temperamental,

473
00:22:35,692 --> 00:22:37,027
even as a youngster.

474
00:22:37,027 --> 00:22:38,821
Kenichi, as your best friend,

475
00:22:38,821 --> 00:22:41,031
I feel as though I should
give you some advice.

476
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:42,866
Yeah? You can help me?

477
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:45,494
I hear that if your medical
bills exceed 100,000 yen

478
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,579
you can deduct them
from your taxes.

479
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:52,876
100,000?

480
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:22,382
I'm being stalked by
gang members non-stop

481
00:24:22,382 --> 00:24:23,216
every single day!

482
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:26,219
What has happened to my life,
I can't even enjoy my youth!

483
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:28,931
Look at Kenichi. "Mr. Popular".

484
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:30,849
You know I'm a little
jealous of you kid.

485
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:33,894
I don't want to be popular with
some gang that wants to kill me!

486
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:36,355
Now, being popular with
Miu on the other hand...

487
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:37,856
Really? Is that how it is?

488
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:39,524
Then I'll give you
some movie tickets.

489
00:24:39,524 --> 00:24:40,859
Take Miu out on a date!

490
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:42,903
You-you will?!
Thank you so much!

491
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:44,988
I'll be your loyal friend
for the rest of my life!

492
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:47,157
Well you sure are
easy to buy off.
