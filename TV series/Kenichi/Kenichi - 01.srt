1
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,885
"Making friends
can be effortless

2
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:45,347
once you understand the power
of the casual approach"

3
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:47,224
C'mon, I've read
this ten times,

4
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:48,559
how come I
still don't get?

5
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:51,145
Maybe I'm taking
it too literally?

6
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,610
Eight minutes til'!
I better get a move on!

7
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,278
I'm gonna be late!

8
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:11,040
The sky?

9
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:17,212
Oh no! Oh my gosh!
I'm so sorry!

10
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:18,922
You came outta nowhere...

11
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:21,342
Ahh man, all my books.

12
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:22,968
Here, let me help you.

13
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:27,181
No, its fine, I'm good.

14
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,184
But thanks anyway.
I appreciate it.

15
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,226
Hold on!

16
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:32,853
You just go around
throwing people?!

17
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,772
You're lucky you didn't kill me!

18
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:36,148
I said "sorry..."

19
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:38,567
But that's what you do when
someone sneaks up on you.

20
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:40,486
It's one of the first
things I learned.

21
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:42,363
And where the heck
did she learn that?

22
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,073
Hit man school?

23
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:46,158
Oh great, look at the time...

24
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:47,743
I'm so gonna be late.

25
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:49,912
What are you talking about?
We've got four minutes.

26
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:50,496
What?

27
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,914
Heh. I know a short cut.

28
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:54,375
W-Wait! Where are you taking me?

29
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,501
Stop!

30
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:58,587
You aren't seriously thinking
of swimming across the river?

31
00:02:58,587 --> 00:02:59,672
Of course not.

32
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:01,423
We're jumping across!

33
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:08,347
Oops, guess he
wasn't ready yet.

34
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:09,306
Kenichi!

35
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:10,808
Go stand in the hall.

36
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:16,230
Wow. First day of high school,
and I'm already a loser.

37
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,108
I'd like to introduce our new
transfer student, Miu Furinji,

38
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:20,734
to the class and I
expect all of you

39
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,236
to make her feel
comfortable here.

40
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,446
This is a bigger school
than Shochikurin was,

41
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:26,699
so it's going to be
a big change for me.

42
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:29,493
But I'm glad to be here and
can't wait to meet everyone.

43
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:31,995
"Miu Furinji", huh?

44
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:34,164
Huh? I don't get it?

45
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,709
Shochikurin ranks better
than any school in town.

46
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,335
Why would she want to come here?

47
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:39,586
Ms. Furinji, where're you going?

48
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,213
Your desk is right here.

49
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:43,465
Well we were both
late, so it's only fair

50
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:45,718
that I go stand in the hall
with him, don't ya think?

51
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:48,470
Uh, right.

52
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:53,851
Listen, it's your first day...

53
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:56,395
You shouldn't be standing out
here just because of me.

54
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:58,897
It's no big deal, besides
that's the first time

55
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:00,774
anyone's ever tried
to rescue me.

56
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,026
This is just my way
of saying thanks.

57
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:03,694
Rescue you? Seriously?

58
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,696
Uh huh. When I jumped
over the river.

59
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:07,573
Oh yeah, I guess I did--

60
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:09,825
But wait a second! All
I did was try to stop you!

61
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:12,035
You ended up pulling
me out of the water!

62
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:14,747
But that dosen't matter,
I mean, at least you tried.

63
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,123
Okay, I get it.

64
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,208
You're just makin'
fun of me now.

65
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,085
This may sound kind of forward,

66
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:23,422
but I'd like it if the
two of us could be friends.

67
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:29,845
Now that I see her up close...

68
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:33,015
She's so cute, it
almost hurts to look.

69
00:04:33,015 --> 00:04:34,975
Wait! Forget it!

70
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,852
This is way too good to be true.

71
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:39,730
Wake up! Snap out of it!

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,527
Uh, are you alright?

73
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:47,905
Ms. Furinji, would you
mind taking this imbecile

74
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:49,615
to the nurse's office?

75
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:54,953
Ah, I'm late for Karate Club!

76
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:57,372
Those guys will eat me alive!

77
00:04:57,372 --> 00:04:58,582
Easy there, killer.

78
00:04:58,582 --> 00:04:59,917
Niijima?

79
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:02,836
I'd always assumed your
clumsy, pathetic nature

80
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,422
was something you'd grow out of
before you got to high school.

81
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:06,507
How silly of me,

82
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,884
I should have known your
defects were permanent.

83
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:12,095
Did weak-knees Kenichi stand
in the hall for being tardy?

84
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:16,183
Sorry to hear about that.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

85
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,559
Just my luck...

86
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,894
Haruo Niijima...

87
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:21,563
He's a spineless bottom-feeder
that kisses up to the meatheads

88
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:23,398
so he can bully other students.

89
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:25,776
That reminds me, I heard
your class was chosen

90
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:28,112
to take the new
transfer student.

91
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:30,823
Tell me about him.
What's he look like?

92
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:33,826
She, wears glasses. Not
that it's any of your busi-

93
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:36,954
Given the current breakdown, the
overall power ratio of the class

94
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:39,331
should be relatively
unaffected by her presence.

95
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:42,042
So, next question, weak-knees.
Is she easy on the eyes?

96
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:45,212
You better stop calling me that,
you alien looking freakjob!

97
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,338
Uh oh?
What's that?

98
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:49,967
You better learn to watch
your mouth you loser!

99
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:52,553
Tell me weak-knees, have you
ever seen one of these before?

100
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,513
It's what's known as a P.D.A.

101
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:56,974
Over the past month I've been
gathering statistical data

102
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:58,809
on all this year's new arrivals.

103
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:01,979
I'll bet you're curious to see
what it has to say about you.

104
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,397
Why don't we have
a quick look-see,

105
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,231
shall we?

106
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,732
Grades--Sub-par...

107
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,442
Athletic ability--Negligible...

108
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:08,527
Looks--Common...

109
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:10,320
Fighting Skills--Negligible...

110
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,656
Courage--Negative, nil, nada.

111
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,783
That's pretty darn pathetic,
don't you think so?

112
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,952
But I guess that it
can't be helped...

113
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:18,704
You truly are a
weak-kneed coward.

114
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:20,873
You can't blame me for
calling a spade a spade.

115
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:22,124
You should just accept it.

116
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:24,126
You're a helpless loser!

117
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:26,044
Your overall score is F minus...

118
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:28,046
which means you're
completely worthless.

119
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:29,298
You're one to talk!

120
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:30,674
My grades are always
better than yours!

121
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:31,592
Huh?

122
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,302
You couldn't fight
to save your life.

123
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:34,219
Whah?

124
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:35,304
And you suck at sports too!

125
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:36,847
Shut your fat mouth!

126
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,682
You don't know what
you're talking about.

127
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:42,394
None of that matters.
Cuz' I've got influence.

128
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:44,688
And therefore my
strength by association

129
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:48,233
gives me the power to
bully whoever I want.

130
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:53,989
Ah, but I don't expect morons
like you to understand.

131
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:56,491
So, a little bird told me
you joined the Karate Club.

132
00:06:56,491 --> 00:06:59,328
You trying to shed the
nickname "Weak-knees?"

133
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:00,996
Listen, if I were
you, I'd quit now,

134
00:07:00,996 --> 00:07:03,832
and save yourself even further
pain and humiliation.

135
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:04,958
Take my word for it.

136
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,836
They're going to bully you just
like they did in junior high.

137
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:11,089
You're weak. That will
never change. Accept it.

138
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,301
You'll be a whole lot
happier that way.

139
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:18,222
Ha, ha, ha, heh, heh, ha!

140
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:20,724
Jerk. You'd better
stop laughing at me...

141
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:23,101
I'm getting stronger
just wait you'll--

142
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:29,191
Yeah! Good one, but what
about the footwork, Daimonji?!

143
00:07:29,191 --> 00:07:30,734
No wait! I give up!

144
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:33,570
Daimonji kick!

145
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,615
Shut up, you can't quit now.
What would the rest of us do?

146
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:38,700
The only reason we even
let you in this club

147
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,410
is 'cause we needed
a new punching bag!

148
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,830
So no more fallin'
down on the job.

149
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,500
You're finished when I say
you're finished! Got it?!

150
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:54,870
I'm starving.

151
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,414
Let's go grab some grub.

152
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:57,915
Hey, don't forget your chores.

153
00:07:57,915 --> 00:07:59,417
Get those floors squeaky clean.

154
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,669
Yeah, and scrub
those toilets too!

155
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:03,379
See ya.

156
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:08,759
They're not gonna
teach me anything here.

157
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,845
I'm just wasting my time.

158
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:13,055
I can't take it.

159
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,224
I'll gonna quit
the club tomorrow.

160
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:17,602
Heh! You're such a loser.

161
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:25,443
I better get cleaning.

162
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:31,907
That should do it...

163
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:34,702
I may be their punching bag
slash cleaning boy today,

164
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:36,245
but not forever.

165
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:41,000
Speaking of punching bags...

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,502
Should I? I've been
here for over a month

167
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:45,963
and they haven't even
let me touch it.

168
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:56,641
Hey Shirahama, what do you
think you're doin', huh?

169
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,934
I thought we told you
not to touch the bags.

170
00:08:58,934 --> 00:08:59,977
Daimonji...

171
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:01,812
Don't you remember
the first day of class?

172
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:04,148
They said freshmen aren't
allowed to touch the equipment

173
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:05,858
without an okay
from the seniors.

174
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:06,942
But you're a freshman too

175
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:09,654
and nobody has a problem
with you using it--

176
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:10,696
Shut up!

177
00:09:10,696 --> 00:09:12,573
Don't ever compare me, to you...

178
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:13,991
I don't have to ask.

179
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:16,786
I worked out every day in
junior-high for these muscles.

180
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:18,829
The seniors were begging
me to join this club

181
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:20,956
when I was still
in eighth grade.

182
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:23,751
You, on the other hand, had
to whine and beg your way in

183
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:25,586
like a freakin' lost puppy.

184
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:31,842
You don't belong
here, Shirahama.

185
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:33,844
I don't care what you think.

186
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:36,347
I go to this school,
just like you,

187
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:39,350
and the Karate Club is open
to anyone who wants to join.

188
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,017
What?!

189
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:42,436
Just seein' a guy like you
here makes me wanna puke.

190
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:46,148
Karate's for the strong and when
scrawny losers like you show up,

191
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:48,109
it really pisses me off!

192
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:52,113
Listen up 'cause this is the
only warning you're gonna get.

193
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:54,073
Quit the Karate Club today.

194
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:58,077
Leave now and don't come back.

195
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:01,831
Or else I'll bash
your tiny skull in.

196
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:05,751
That's my promise man to man,
I'll even let ya think about it.

197
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:10,214
Time's up!

198
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:15,511
Heh, heh, heh, heh.
Okay. On your feet.

199
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:19,974
Hey...

200
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:24,311
Do I need to explain it
to you one more time?

201
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:27,732
If I get strong enough,
I can master Karate.

202
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:30,735
I'm gonna do it, I'm
gonna get stronger!

203
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:35,364
Wake up, will ya?!

204
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:37,742
You're livin' in some
kinda fantasy world!

205
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,997
Here's a dose of reality
for you. You're a weakling.

206
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:46,167
You're never gonna be strong,
no matter how hard you try.

207
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,168
You're a loser!

208
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:48,669
You're always gonna be a loser!

209
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:50,129
And guys like me
are gonna step on you

210
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:52,882
for the rest of
your worthless life!

211
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:55,801
But y'know, I think I just
came up with a solution

212
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:58,095
that'll be perfect
for the both of us.

213
00:10:58,095 --> 00:11:00,890
You and me get together for
a serious match next week,

214
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,516
whaddya say Shirahama?

215
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:05,603
Sounds like a plan to me.

216
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:07,438
Oh yeah...

217
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:11,358
and whoever loses, quits the
club forever without question.

218
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:12,318
Listen up.

219
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:14,403
You better borrow a stretcher
from the nurses' office,

220
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:15,321
'cause when I'm done,

221
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:19,366
you won't be able to
stand, walk, or crawl.

222
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:22,787
I'll keep training
hard every day.

223
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:24,789
You should do the same.

224
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,848
Man, that was close. I
thought I was dead for sure.

225
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:44,600
Wait, what am I saying?

226
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,604
Now I've got to fight that
overgrown jerk next week!

227
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:52,441
I only have one
week left to live!

228
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:08,958
I hate that guy.

229
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,628
I wish he was the
loser, just this once.

230
00:12:12,628 --> 00:12:14,171
I'll train myself.

231
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:17,424
I'd be stronger already if those
idiots would just let me train.

232
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:20,261
I can do it. It's
completely up to me.

233
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:23,222
It's my destiny.
It's mine to master.

234
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:25,683
And then...

235
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:28,144
When I've finally
gotten stronger...

236
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:31,939
I'll be different.

237
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:34,650
I won't be a bully like
Daimonji and the others.

238
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,652
They're all losers.

239
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:38,404
I will protect the weak.

240
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:42,158
That's how your supposed to
use great strength, right?

241
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:43,534
I'll be the hero.

242
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:46,245
That's right,
Kenichi Shirahama, the hero.

243
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:48,455
I'll beat up the thugs
and defend the innocent.

244
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:50,457
What are you looking at?

245
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,174
You need to apologize
to him, right now.

246
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:00,759
Please, I'm just fine.

247
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,178
You'll only make
more trouble for us.

248
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:08,017
Okay I did not just see that.

249
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:09,059
There's nothing
happening over there.

250
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:11,103
I saw nothing.
Not a thing. Nada.

251
00:13:11,103 --> 00:13:12,104
It's too soon.

252
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:13,689
I haven't had a
chance to train yet.

253
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:15,816
So, not only would
I be useless,

254
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:19,528
I'd probably just end up
making things worse.

255
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:21,655
And with thugs like that
it's really better to just

256
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:24,491
give 'em what they want.

257
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:25,659
I know!

258
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:27,244
I think there's a chapter
on this sort of thing

259
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:29,455
in my Urban Survival Handbook!

260
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:30,623
It's at home...

261
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:31,874
You fool!

262
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:33,167
You shouldn't be
searching through a book

263
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,543
at a time like this!

264
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:37,004
How can I be so stupid...!

265
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:39,632
That's my classmate over
there, she needs my help!

266
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:41,508
I saw it. You pushed him.

267
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:44,929
Where do you get off slamming an
old man to the ground like that?

268
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:46,305
Calm down four-eyes.

269
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:48,515
He was wandering down the
street in everybody's way,

270
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:49,683
so we shoved him aside.

271
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:51,518
Well that piece of
junk you call a car

272
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:52,937
is in everybody's way too.

273
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:53,812
Are you gonna do--

274
00:13:53,812 --> 00:13:56,607
Oh no, arguing with them is
only going to make it worse.

275
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,901
We'll park our car
wherever we want.

276
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:02,154
And anybody that's got any
sense will stay out of our way.

277
00:14:02,154 --> 00:14:05,783
Especially pretty little
blonde girls like yourself.

278
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:08,702
Yeah, nobody tells
us what to do.

279
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:10,371
Why don't you have
yourself a look?

280
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,998
Those people understand
what the score is.

281
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:17,711
You see all of them
pretending not to notice us.

282
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:19,213
Well I'm not one of them.

283
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:20,714
Apologize now.

284
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:22,216
You little brat...

285
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:25,135
They're going to bully you just
like they did in junior high.

286
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:26,220
You're weak.

287
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,805
That will never change.

288
00:14:27,805 --> 00:14:29,306
Accept it.

289
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:32,017
You're never gonna be strong,
no matter how hard you try.

290
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:34,478
You're a loser! You're
always be a loser!

291
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:36,105
And guys like me are
gonna step on you

292
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:37,606
for the rest of your
worthless life!

293
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:39,525
I'm about to bloody that
pretty mouth of yours.

294
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:40,442
Aggh!

295
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:44,196
Let go of her now!

296
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:50,786
Aahh! Fists of fury!

297
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:51,996
Who's this dude?

298
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:53,372
Hurry get out of here Miu!

299
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:57,710
I can only hold them
back for so long--

300
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,255
Okay kid, now your dead.

301
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:03,007
You just made the biggest,
and last, mistake

302
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:05,676
of your life kid.
You know who we are?

303
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:07,428
Well, no, I don't
know who you are.

304
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:08,887
Sorry, I wasn't
thinking clearly.

305
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,056
I just acted on instinct.
It was a mistake.

306
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:13,851
Seriously, I didn't mean to...

307
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:15,519
Wait! You can't use that!

308
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,521
I'm unarmed! That's
against the rules!

309
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:19,773
We're playing by
different rule books kid.

310
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:22,317
And mine says you ain't
to live no longer.

311
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:23,027
Hold him down!

312
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:26,280
Nooooooooooo!

313
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,787
--Where'd she go?!
--She used me as a spring board.

314
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:38,667
Okay, now you've made me mad.

315
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,919
Whoa... I barely had
a chance to blink,

316
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,838
and she hit all
three of those guys!

317
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:03,692
Amazing. That was intense.

318
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:09,490
What is she? Some kind of killer
ballerina or something?

319
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,617
That was impressive. Thank you.

320
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:13,786
You've rescued me
twice in one day.

321
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:16,455
Oh.,yeah, sure thing,
it was my pleasure...

322
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:19,041
Wait, but that's
not what happened.

323
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,335
That took a lot of guts
back there, Kenichi.

324
00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:23,962
You know I don't think I could
have found a better person

325
00:16:23,962 --> 00:16:25,589
to be my first new friend.

326
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:27,382
Wait? So we're friends?

327
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:28,467
Of course!

328
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:33,199
The Karate Club huh?

329
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,660
I could tell you were a
martial artist from your collar.

330
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,581
Well, I don't know
if I'd go that far.

331
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,167
Kenichi... I just want you
to know that guy from the club

332
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,544
who told you martial arts
is only for the strong,

333
00:16:44,544 --> 00:16:46,296
he doesn't know what
he's talking about.

334
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,797
What do you mean by that?

335
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:49,883
Um, well I've always
been interested

336
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,635
in martial arts myself, so
I know a little bit about it

337
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:54,929
Wait a minute, what're you
calling "a little bit."

338
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:57,474
My Sensai has always
explained it to me like this:

339
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,684
The Martial arts were
originally created

340
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:01,936
to help the weak fight
against the strong.

341
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:04,522
That means someone's size isn't
really all that important.

342
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:07,817
So the guy from the Karate
Club has it backwards.

343
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:11,237
I could try explaining that, but
I still doubt they'd teach me.

344
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:13,865
Not only that, but I've got
less than a week until--

345
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:15,992
Oh wait! My how-to books.

346
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,372
"Practice is the only answer."

347
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,042
Man, I'm dead.

348
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,920
Listen, If you're really serious
about getting stronger,

349
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,839
then I think I know of a place
where they can help you out,

350
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,508
if you're willing
to give it a try.

351
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,343
You think they teach
me to take out thugs

352
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,969
--like you just did?
--I can't answer that.

353
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,846
I can say is that if you
train in this place,

354
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:39,557
you'll get a lot stronger than
you are right now, guaranteed.

355
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:40,809
Tell me! Tell me!

356
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,684
One thing.

357
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:42,519
What is it?

358
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,104
When I say you'll get stronger,

359
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,482
that's assuming you
manage to stay alive...

360
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:48,691
Huh?

361
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:52,946
I'm pretty sure
this is the place.

362
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,824
I can't believe I
actually found it.

363
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,368
What was Miu thinking
when she made this map?

364
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,371
Sprinting? What does that
have to do with directions?

365
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,498
And what's with the crazy route?

366
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,168
Okay...

367
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:09,838
As long as you're
sure about this.

368
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,381
Of course I'm sure.

369
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,091
I don't have a choice.

370
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,050
One week from now,

371
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,678
I'm gonna be beaten
within inches of my life.

372
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,639
So, I've got nothing to lose.

373
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:21,433
I'm comin' in!

374
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,645
What's with this gate?

375
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:27,147
It feels like it's
made of lead.

376
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,692
Come on...
Open uuuuup!

377
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,114
Hello there.

378
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:39,159
What sort of business do you
have in this place young man?

379
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,411
Business! Uh, I
was just leaving!

380
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,290
Sorry...

381
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:47,917
What the--?!
Did you just...

382
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:49,169
...warp?!

383
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,963
How'd ya do that?

384
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:53,590
Judging by the
look on your face,

385
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,050
I'm not sure you could handle
the answer to that question.

386
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,011
Try to calm down a bit.

387
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,220
You wouldn't happen
to be some kind of

388
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,264
martial arts
master, would you?

389
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:04,476
I wouldn't consider
myself a master.

390
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,768
I'm just fortunate.

391
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:07,937
I have yet to lose
a single battle.

392
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:08,980
This is it!

393
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,274
This is the place
she told me about!

394
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:13,985
Uh, excuse me sir,
I'm Kenichi Shirahama.

395
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:15,737
I was sent here
by Miu Furinji.

396
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,864
It's both an honor and
a pleasure to meet you.

397
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:20,366
That was quite an impressive
introduction young man.

398
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:21,409
Your manners are excellent,

399
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:23,620
but there's no need to
be formal around here.

400
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,538
So then, Miu sent you, huh?

401
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:26,956
Yes.

402
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:27,749
Um, sir?

403
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,417
What exactly do you teach here?

404
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:31,419
I mean, you teach Karate, right?

405
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:34,005
Hm-mm. Among other things, yes.

406
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:35,924
That's awesome!

407
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:42,388
What is that monster and where
on Earth did it come from?

408
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:44,933
That's Apachai Hopachai,
from Thailand.

409
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,893
Only 28 years old,
believe it or not.

410
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:48,269
Wowwwww!

411
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:49,687
Amazing!

412
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,448
Apa! Apa!

413
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,909
Be careful you don't
speak too loud.

414
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:05,078
If he hears you, he
might start showing off.

415
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,579
ApaApaApaApaApaApaApaApa!

416
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:08,623
Alright!
That's enough Apachai!

417
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:11,584
Is he always like this?

418
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,169
We don't get many visitors.

419
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,588
He probably just got
a little over stimulated.

420
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:19,843
No visitors? What kind
of Dojo is this?

421
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,645
Miu's definitely cute,
but this girl is hot!

422
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:33,481
Maybe she'll give me
some private lessons.

423
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,988
Show yourself! What business
do you have with me?

424
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,780
Speak!

425
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,448
Ah, who me?!

426
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:44,701
Kensei! I know exactly
where you're hiding...

427
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,703
...and so does my sword!

428
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:50,873
Relax, I was just
passing through,

429
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:53,376
making sure everything's still
on the up and up, down below.

430
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:54,586
Looking good.

431
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,880
That doesn't explain the
camera you're holding.

432
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,007
What were you taking
pictures of down there?

433
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,135
Uh, what chu mean?!

434
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,853
I wouldn't recommend snooping
around here young man.

435
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:12,729
Now then,

436
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,981
I'm about to introduce you
to the Karate teacher

437
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,400
you've been looking for,
but I have to warn you,

438
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,901
he can be difficult.

439
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:20,236
Um, okay.

440
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:22,655
Hey, Shio! I need a favor!

441
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,286
Uh uh. No way.

442
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:31,664
I don't take disciples.

443
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:33,958
How many times do we
gotta go over this gramps?

444
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:34,834
Told ya.

445
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,211
He dosen't sound like a teacher.

446
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,632
It's a bad idea old man.

447
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,968
Let's suppose I did let
him become my pupil...

448
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,231
He would be dead
in three days time.

449
00:21:57,231 --> 00:22:00,151
You don't say. Well
that's just too bad.

450
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:03,738
The man obviously doesn't want
to take on a disciple, ah well.

451
00:22:03,738 --> 00:22:06,157
Thanks anyway,
I'll be going now.

452
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:14,707
This kid seems
kinda high strung.

453
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:17,460
He's certainly energetic.

454
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,379
W-Where am I?

455
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:23,925
What kind of crazy dojo is this?

456
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:27,178
Kenichi? Kenichi?

457
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:27,804
Miu!

458
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,514
You fainted,
you feeling alright?

459
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,767
We-We should get out of here!
This place is really dangerous!

460
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,852
This is...
my home...

461
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:36,813
You see Hayato is...

462
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:37,855
...her grandfather.

463
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:40,692
Uh?! Grandfather?!

464
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,069
Okay, right about now that
little voice in my head

465
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,570
is telling me to run for it.

466
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,155
Bad idea! Bad idea!

467
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:49,325
What the heck am I getting
myself into here?!

468
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:51,703
I'm dead meat.

469
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:20,917
Who are all of these
scary-looking people

470
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,585
and what are they
gonna do to me?

471
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:25,004
Each of them is a master
of a different martial art.

472
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:28,549
They live and practice
here at Ryozanpaku.

473
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:31,177
Kenichi, I promise if
you'll let them teach you

474
00:24:31,177 --> 00:24:32,762
they'll help
you get stronger

475
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,681
But I'm not sure that I'm cut
out for this sort of thing!

476
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:37,225
You'll be fine, Kenichi.

477
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,811
I have complete faith
in you. Just go for broke.

478
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,729
No way! Are you kidding me?!

479
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:44,941
Getting "broke" is exactly
what I'm afraid of!

480
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,277
This is going to be a little
harder than I thought.
