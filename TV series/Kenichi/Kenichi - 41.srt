[Music]

2
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:40,603
Hey...

3
00:01:40,603 --> 00:01:42,229
It's been a long time...

4
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,105
Kenichi.

5
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,364
Hey...! I recognize the way
you opened that snack!

6
00:01:57,828 --> 00:01:59,246
Don't tell me you're...

7
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:00,915
Ryuto Asamiya?!

8
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:02,082
There's no such thing

9
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:03,792
as a meaningless fight
in martial arts

10
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,544
every fight has meaning!

11
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:07,129
Whenever you beat
a new opponent...

12
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:09,590
you get one step closer
to the ultimate power

13
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,425
that every fighter dreams of!

14
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:12,593
You've dreamt of it-

15
00:02:12,593 --> 00:02:15,221
you made the same
promise I did!

16
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:18,641
Stop your meaningless fights
with the Shinpaku Alliance.

17
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:20,059
You don't get it,
do you Kenichi?

18
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:26,523
I told you there's no such
thing as a meaningless fight.

19
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,280
We'll continue to fight...

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,824
And I will carry out the real
promise we made that day

21
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,284
which you seem to
have forgotten.

22
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:41,538
What's this "real promise"
you're talking about?

23
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:43,540
I don't remember
making it.

24
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,501
Did we promise to fight
or something...?

25
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,086
Why won't you just
tell me, Ryuto...?

26
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:48,921
Or should I call
you the First Fist?

27
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,381
Very good guess...

28
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:52,424
We did promise
to fight again...

29
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:55,010
And if you lose I get
that badge of yours!

30
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,470
No way...! My badge?

31
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,891
Why do you want a badge that I
got out of a toy machine...?

32
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,434
I don't get it.

33
00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:04,228
Must be a badge collector.

34
00:03:04,228 --> 00:03:06,188
Enough with the talking...

35
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:08,816
Time to show me what
you're made of, Kenichi!

36
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:11,276
I don't really understand
what this is about...

37
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:12,695
but I'll fight
you if I have to.

38
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:15,322
What? What's the matter, Miu?

39
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:17,866
It's just that you're so
quick to rush into a fight.

40
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,493
Shouldn't you guys
try to talk this out?

41
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:21,704
You heard him- he doesn't
wanna talk he wants to fight.

42
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:23,080
He may be an old
friend of mine

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,874
but that doesn't matter cause
he's with Ragnarok now...

44
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:27,459
Besides, I would try to
talk him out of this

45
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,003
if I thought it
would do any good.

46
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:30,129
But it won't...

47
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,339
He's the First Fist,
the leader of Ragnarok

48
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:33,632
and he's made it
perfectly clear

49
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:35,467
there's nothing I can
do to change his mind!

50
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:38,679
It's been ten years

51
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:41,432
and yet you seem just as
immature and idealistic as ever.

52
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:48,272
Who do you think is going to
come out on top this time?

53
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,652
I don't think I've ever
seen him this mad before!

54
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:55,029
Ryuto...

55
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:57,072
Growing up you were
always shorter than me...

56
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:58,532
you were weaker than me...

57
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:00,492
and you were
nicer than me...

58
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:02,286
What the hell
happened to you?

59
00:04:02,286 --> 00:04:03,704
Damn it, Ryuto!

60
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,673
That was a little
close for comfort...

61
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:16,091
You're the first person

62
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:18,177
who's been able to penetrate
my Seikuuken that far.

63
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:19,678
I'm impressed

64
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:21,472
you must have been through
some serious training.

65
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:27,936
But I'm afraid that you've lost
your only chance of winning now.

66
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:32,608
When you attacked you should've
had enough power to strike me

67
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,151
but for some
reason you let up.

68
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:36,945
What happened, Kenichi?

69
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,489
I could tell that
your punch lost power

70
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:39,615
as it got closer to me-

71
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:41,200
it's almost as if you
were holding back.

72
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:43,535
What's the matter...?

73
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:46,246
Don't have it in you to
hit an old friend...?

74
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:47,539
How pathetic.

75
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,750
Damn it! This time I'm
going in full force!

76
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:04,348
You okay...?!

77
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:06,016
How'd he do that?!

78
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:07,851
I wish I knew the
answer to that!

79
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:12,564
There must be a
full moon tonight

80
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:14,149
cause this is just crazy...!

81
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,402
I never thought that Scarface
would treat us to dinner!

82
00:05:16,402 --> 00:05:18,695
The world must be
coming to an end.

83
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:20,114
No need to be so
dramatic midget.

84
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:22,866
I can be nice I just don't
wanna make a habit of it.

85
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,119
No worry Honoka-
Apachai can pay the bill

86
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,329
with the money he won
at the track yesterday.

87
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:28,997
If they knew you could
talk to animals

88
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:30,958
they would've kicked you
outta there so fast...

89
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:36,004
A... pa... A... pa.

90
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:41,510
Even so Apachai's
horse barely won race

91
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,345
so it must have
been beggar's luck.

92
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:44,888
Beggars don't
have good luck.

93
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:47,975
-He meant "beginner's".
-That not what I say?

94
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:50,144
So... Guess I should
thank Scarface

95
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:51,728
for taking you to
the track with him.

96
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:52,729
You can thank
me all ya want

97
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:54,273
but would ya quit
callin' me that?

98
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:56,608
What the hell...?!

99
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:58,652
You tryin' to pick a fight
with me, dumbass...?

100
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:00,446
Watch what you're doin'-
you got eyes dontcha?!

101
00:06:01,822 --> 00:06:03,198
Eyes...?

102
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:05,450
What? You mean these
two right here?!

103
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:11,081
Whoa...! You knocked
that jerk out

104
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:12,457
and you didn't even
have to touch him...!

105
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:13,876
Hey how'd you do that?!

106
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:15,127
It's a ki attack.

107
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:16,336
The kind that open doors?

108
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:18,589
Naw, have you ever watched
a cat hunt a mouse?

109
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:20,883
Sometimes you can sense
it's urge to kill .

110
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:22,593
That's called ki.

111
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:24,303
It's usually
dormant in humans

112
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:26,972
but if you work hard enough
you can learn to control it.

113
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:29,516
When two well trained
fighters throw down,

114
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:31,810
the ki attack is
very important.

115
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,688
It can be used as a feint
or to pressure your opponent.

116
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:38,233
If you're a high level
fighter who's trained hard

117
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,943
you can learn to
control your ki

118
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:41,403
and attack your
opponent with it-

119
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:43,530
like I just did.

120
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,240
What's the matter...?

121
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,283
Hit me.

122
00:06:57,669 --> 00:06:59,213
What the hell is
that crazy feeling

123
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:00,672
I get whenever
I'm near him?

124
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:02,549
I can't even get close!

125
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:04,384
The First Fist's
ki is strong.

126
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:06,261
He must really have
the intention to kill.

127
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:07,930
What's wrong, Kenichi...?

128
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,932
You aren't afraid
of me, are you?

129
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:10,724
No.

130
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:11,892
You were always
the nice guy-

131
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:13,644
even when we were younger.

132
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:16,063
And you know what
they say about them...

133
00:07:16,063 --> 00:07:17,481
They finish last...

134
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:19,441
Because they're nothing
more than cowards!

135
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:22,819
Oh no!

136
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:28,992
My finishing move...

137
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:30,869
the shutdown cross.

138
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:32,704
I never go easy
on anyone...

139
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:34,957
be they friend or foe.

140
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:40,837
Kenichi!

141
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:42,464
So that's all you've got...?

142
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:44,258
How disappointing.

143
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,384
Furinji.

144
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:51,139
That weakling isn't on
your level you know...

145
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:52,808
You could do
so much better.

146
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:56,645
I wouldn't speak so soon

147
00:07:56,645 --> 00:07:58,814
you haven't seen his
true ability yet.

148
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:09,992
What was that feeling
all of a sudden?!

149
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:12,286
I felt a subtle
but strong ki...

150
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:13,745
Is it coming from him?!

151
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:15,122
So it must have
been your ki

152
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:18,041
that was affecting
my attacks.

153
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,002
I won't let you beat
me my fighting spirit

154
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:21,461
will prevail, Ryuto!

155
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:23,380
I acted too hastily...

156
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,340
Bad judgment on my part.

157
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,967
Here, I'll help you.

158
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,885
No don't touch me, Miu...

159
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:30,762
I've gotta do
this on my own.

160
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:35,267
Wow...!
You got up so fast!

161
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:39,313
I'm not touching!
I'm not touching!

162
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,398
Guess you took on more
damage than you thought.

163
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:45,527
I'll be fine!

164
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:47,070
I knew you could do it.

165
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,780
This one's gonna be tough.

166
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,033
His palm stopped me
dead in my tracks.

167
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:52,576
It absorbed the
force of my attack

168
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:54,411
and bounced it back at me...

169
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:55,829
And he was able
to stop my punch

170
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,748
just by turning his body-

171
00:08:57,748 --> 00:08:59,624
nobody's done that before.

172
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:01,084
What're you waiting for...?

173
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:03,128
I thought that you said
you weren't hurt...?

174
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:04,046
Let's go.

175
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:13,096
He has amazing ki and he's
using it to pressure Kenichi!

176
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,060
Damn you!

177
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:20,312
Not again...!

178
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:22,064
There's no way
his limitless ki

179
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:24,858
could have been achieved
through regular training.

180
00:09:24,858 --> 00:09:26,443
Kenichi! Turn around!

181
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,354
I'm impressed...

182
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:34,563
He was on his way down

183
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:36,649
but he was still able to
turn at the last minute...

184
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:37,942
I've never seen that .

185
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:40,694
The poor guy's used to
being tossed around a lot...

186
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:44,240
I guess you could say he's like
an Olympic level punching bag.

187
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,658
He's a genius...

188
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:47,201
when it comes to
getting beaten up.

189
00:09:48,118 --> 00:09:50,246
You're not really helping
me out here, Miu...!

190
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:51,789
Bastard!

191
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:53,457
His ki's not
strong enough...

192
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:54,625
Go ahead!

193
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,018
What an awesome fighter!

194
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:16,021
Any attack that penetrates his
ki gets deflected immediately!

195
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,025
What's the matter...?

196
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,652
Haven't you had enough...?

197
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:23,112
I can tell that
you've been trained

198
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:25,781
by some really amazing
martial arts masters...

199
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:27,825
but your ridiculous naivety...

200
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:29,702
makes it basically worthless.

201
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:31,078
What the hell did you say?!

202
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:33,372
You have to find
your urge to kill...

203
00:10:33,372 --> 00:10:36,333
Otherwise you'll never be able
to break through my Seikuuken.

204
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,334
Seikuuken?

205
00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:40,379
I knew it...

206
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,464
You're just a beginning martial
arts student, aren't you?

207
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,968
It's the art of keeping
your range open,

208
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:48,178
yet staying closed
to attacks...

209
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:49,430
Therefore the Seikuuken

210
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,723
is the impenetrable
circumference

211
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:52,600
of defense around your body.

212
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,143
Say what?

213
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:56,562
I'll give you an example
an idiot can understand.

214
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:58,230
Gee thanks!

215
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,316
You keep yourself open...

216
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:02,359
yet protected
at all times.

217
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:04,862
When I move like this

218
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:07,364
you can see that I'm controlling
everything within my arm's

219
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:09,199
reach all the way around.

220
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:12,661
That is the circumference
of my sphere of control.

221
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:15,581
This is the basis
of my martial art.

222
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:16,749
I don't really
understand it

223
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:19,919
but now I see why my
attacks were struck down...

224
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,754
I'll just have to attack
him with my death blow

225
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:23,881
and hope I can get close
enough to make impact.

226
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,343
Yamazuki...!

227
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:28,636
Kao Loi...!

228
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,471
Headbutt...!

229
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:33,349
Falling tree!

230
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:39,355
Let's see how you handle
my strongest combo!

231
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:41,899
Yamazuki!

232
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:42,941
Kao Loi!

233
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,653
No way!

234
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:48,113
How was he able to block
my death blow so easily?!

235
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:49,823
That first move was
pretty dangerous...

236
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,619
I'm sure it would've
worked on any other opponent

237
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,996
but with my Seikuuken
I'm completely guarded

238
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,499
so unfortunately for you
it didn't even phase me.

239
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,753
You should give
it a try sometime.

240
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:06,840
No! Kenichi!

241
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,015
I knew you couldn't
handle it...

242
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:17,142
You're so wrapped up in
visualizing your target

243
00:12:17,142 --> 00:12:18,519
you didn't catch my attack.

244
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:22,231
What happened?!

245
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:25,567
I felt like I was being
pulled into that punch!

246
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,945
We made a deal so
this is mine now.

247
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:32,449
You're good but you've
still got a lot to learn...

248
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:33,701
friend.

249
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:36,203
But why...?

250
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:38,706
Why do you want that
silly badge so badly?

251
00:12:38,706 --> 00:12:42,376
Don't be stupid this has
nothing to do with the badge...

252
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:44,211
Ten years ago Kenichi
did something to me

253
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:46,046
that was unforgivable...

254
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:47,923
I simply wanted to
return the favor.

255
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:51,719
Something unforgivable?

256
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,762
Oh yeah, I almost forgot...

257
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:55,848
It's not really a
fair trade but...

258
00:12:55,848 --> 00:12:57,057
I thought you
might want this.

259
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:02,062
You see, this badge...

260
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:03,856
is the medal of a loser.

261
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:15,576
What was the name of
your little club again?

262
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:18,036
The Shinpaku Alliance, right?

263
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:20,497
It's unfortunate because
I was excited to see

264
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:21,832
what they had to offer...

265
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:23,834
Not much to look
forward to now.

266
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,962
Least I know they'll
be easy to get rid of.

267
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:30,883
Kenichi, just hang
in there, alright?

268
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:48,859
Hey Tanimoto...!

269
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:49,818
The Shinpaku Alliance is...

270
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,406
How many times do
I have to tell you?

271
00:13:54,406 --> 00:13:56,784
I'm not interested in
joining your stupid club.

272
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:00,621
Talk to me about it
again and I'll kill you.

273
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:01,747
Commander!

274
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:02,998
Are you okay?!

275
00:14:04,124 --> 00:14:06,418
Listen sir, I think you
should leave him alone.

276
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:07,920
He's not the kinda guy
you can reason with.

277
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,798
I won't give up
that easily...

278
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:13,258
We've taken out four of
Ragnarok's Deadly Fists

279
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:15,761
so it's only a matter of
time before they strike back.

280
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:17,971
We have to make
sure we're prepared.

281
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:19,807
We're gonna to need
Tanimoto on our side

282
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:21,642
when it all starts
going down...

283
00:14:21,642 --> 00:14:24,436
So I'm gonna keep pestering
him until he breaks.

284
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:26,438
Commander...

285
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:29,149
I'm not gonna give up
our lives depend on it.

286
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:32,111
Besides...

287
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:34,988
My little encounter with
him wasn't totally fruitless.

288
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:37,741
I'm gonna need some help
persuading Tanimoto to join us

289
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:40,327
so I'm bringing
out the big guns!

290
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:41,662
Whoa... no way...

291
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:43,205
Oh wow...

292
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:45,374
You got him to join the
Shinpaku Alliance...?!

293
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:46,625
No wonder you're
our general!

294
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,877
Just you wait, Tanimoto...

295
00:14:48,877 --> 00:14:51,129
Soon you'll be eating out
of the palm of my hand.

296
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:55,801
You got some nerve, kid.

297
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:58,720
Did you really think you'd just
waltz up here and ambush us...?

298
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,222
There's only four of ya-

299
00:15:00,222 --> 00:15:01,890
that's not even a fair fight!

300
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,267
Surely you didn't think

301
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,477
you could pull one over
on Loki himself, did ya?

302
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:07,479
Shut your mouth
you big fake fatty.

303
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:10,524
We've got a secret weapon on our
side that makes us invincible.

304
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:12,776
Feast your eyes on this...!

305
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:13,944
We've got one of
your team mates-

306
00:15:13,944 --> 00:15:15,487
The Sixth Deadly Fist, Hermit,

307
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:17,698
is now a member of
the Shinpaku Alliance!

308
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:23,495
What...?! No way...!

309
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:24,830
You've got Master Hermit...?!

310
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,039
Uh, I mean...

311
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,749
That idiot joined you?!

312
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:29,126
That's right, fatty...!

313
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:31,003
Hermit has had enough
of Ragnarok's crap

314
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:32,629
so he decided to
ditch you guys

315
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:34,840
and become a general of
the Shinpaku Alliance!

316
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:38,886
Impossible...!

317
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:40,971
He would never
leave Ragnarok...!

318
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:42,598
You guys are lying!

319
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:44,182
Even if he left Ragnarok

320
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:46,560
he'd never join you
Shinpaku losers!

321
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,895
Guy's a fake...!

322
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:49,605
He's built completely
different from Hermit-

323
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:50,814
you're not foolin' me...!

324
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:53,025
Whoever he is he's gonna
get his ass kicked...!

325
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:54,860
Get him men!

326
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,451
It's him!

327
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:03,827
He's so strong he's
gotta be the real deal!

328
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:04,912
What's the matter, you guys

329
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:06,580
can't take a little
rough housing...?

330
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,081
Be sure to tell
all your friends

331
00:16:08,081 --> 00:16:11,418
that Hermit's with the
Shinpaku Alliance now!

332
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:12,836
My plan to spread the word

333
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:15,631
that Hermit has joined our
alliance is working perfectly.

334
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:17,007
Good work, pal.

335
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:19,509
Now Tanimoto will have
no choice but to join us.

336
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:20,928
So that's the plan, huh?

337
00:16:20,928 --> 00:16:22,137
Well you can forget it.

338
00:16:28,936 --> 00:16:31,104
Sorry I can't let
you do that, Hermit.

339
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:33,023
You're stronger than
I was expecting...

340
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,359
who the hell are you?!

341
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,736
Go ahead and reveal yourself,
our newest recruit.

342
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:45,786
Siegfried!

343
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:51,708
The most amazing melody
just popped into my head...!

344
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,961
Oh, Hermit...!
It's all because of you...!

345
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:55,837
The excitement of reuniting
with my old friend

346
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:57,756
has inspired me musically!

347
00:16:57,756 --> 00:16:59,508
Give me a second
to write it down.

348
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:01,843
Sieg... Why don't
you just say hello?

349
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:03,804
But how... How did
you get Siegfried

350
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:05,889
to join your
stupid alliance?

351
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:07,975
I'd explain but
it's a long story.

352
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:11,395
It's okay Niijima allow
me to do the explaining...

353
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:13,313
With song!

354
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:18,777
After my defeat
I lost my confidence...

355
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:23,991
I've been sulking by
the sea ever since...

356
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:25,826
Then one day...

357
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:29,288
a brilliant melody
came my way...

358
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:31,206
Though it was off key...

359
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:34,334
I could tell what
Nee-jee-mah wanted it to be.

360
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:39,756
His melody shone with such a
revolutionary brilliance...

361
00:17:39,756 --> 00:17:43,802
That I had no choice but to
join the Shinpaku Alliance...

362
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:46,096
la la la

363
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:52,978
That didn't make
any sense at all.

364
00:17:52,978 --> 00:17:54,980
Say what you want but now
that Sieg's on my team

365
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,481
I know you're
not far behind.

366
00:17:56,481 --> 00:17:58,900
Last time you turned me down
you left your locker key behind

367
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,236
so I had no problem
stealing your Hermit gear...

368
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:02,821
What now, Tanimoto...?

369
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,072
Everyone in Ragnarok
already thinks

370
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:05,907
you're a part of the
Shinpaku Alliance-

371
00:18:05,907 --> 00:18:08,035
so what's stopping
you from joining?

372
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:09,911
I gotta tell ya, if
I were in your shoes

373
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:12,205
I'd want somebody on
my side about now...

374
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:13,999
I mean, now that Ragnarok
thinks you've betrayed them

375
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,792
and joined the
Shinpaku Alliance...

376
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,378
they're sure to come looking
for you, aren't they?

377
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:21,298
In fact, they're probably
planning their attack right now.

378
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:23,550
Do you really think you can
take on all of Ragnarok

379
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,634
all by yourself?

380
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:25,969
Cause I sure
don't think so!

381
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:30,891
Here's the deal,
Tanimoto...

382
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:33,018
Join now or die alone...

383
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:33,852
Well?

384
00:18:39,191 --> 00:18:41,485
I told you that if you
asked me one more time...

385
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:42,736
I was gonna kill ya.

386
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:44,613
Now wait just a
minute, Hermit.

387
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:47,199
It's no secret that I am able to
hear other people's melodies...

388
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:48,575
they're almost like
an audible aura

389
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:49,826
that surrounds you.

390
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:52,454
And your melody is one full
of sadness and despair...

391
00:18:52,454 --> 00:18:54,331
the only way it'll
ever be changed...

392
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:58,001
is if you become one of us and
join the Shinpaku Alliance.

393
00:18:58,001 --> 00:18:59,920
You see, it's your fate
to become a member

394
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,588
of this alliance, my friend.

395
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:03,799
Yeah...

396
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:06,009
Sorry Sieg but I don't
buy a word of it...

397
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:07,052
See ya.

398
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:09,721
I can see what lies in
your future, Hermit...

399
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:12,974
And I know you will be
back to join us very soon!

400
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:18,105
Would you guys give me back
my locker key, damn it?!

401
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:19,064
I told you so...

402
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:35,995
I can't believe I
let him beat me...

403
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:37,413
damn.

404
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:40,083
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay, Kenichi?

405
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,709
Yeah... I'll be fine...

406
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:43,044
Thanks for your concern...

407
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:45,797
I'll get over it.

408
00:19:45,797 --> 00:19:47,298
That's the spirit...

409
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:48,132
Good...

410
00:19:54,097 --> 00:19:55,974
Cause we've got a lot more
shopping to do today.

411
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:00,853
You mean I'm not gonna get even
a little sympathy from you?

412
00:20:00,853 --> 00:20:02,522
No, of course not.

413
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:04,315
There's no reason for
you to be upset...

414
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:05,483
You're still alive.

415
00:20:06,526 --> 00:20:08,111
A true martial
artist knows that

416
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:10,571
you never really lose a
fight until you die...

417
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:12,740
As long as you're still alive
you can always train harder

418
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,117
and come back victorious.

419
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,911
You'll be just fine...

420
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:19,497
I was worried for a while there,
but you held your own.

421
00:20:24,502 --> 00:20:25,503
She's right.

422
00:20:25,503 --> 00:20:26,504
As long as I'm alive

423
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:28,006
I'll have another
chance to defeat him...

424
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:29,590
I gotta keep training.

425
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,925
Let's see,

426
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:32,969
what do you think I should
make for dinner tonight, huh?

427
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:35,096
Grocery shopping
after a fight?

428
00:20:35,096 --> 00:20:36,431
I'm surprised you
haven't asked me

429
00:20:36,431 --> 00:20:38,141
to buy your favorite
fish sticks yet.

430
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:39,892
She's trying to make
me feel better...

431
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:46,316
I lost today and
that's okay...

432
00:20:46,316 --> 00:20:48,109
because I won't
become a loser!

433
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:51,487
So you're a loser... huh?

434
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:55,700
Yeah, I can tell just by
lookin' at you, kid...

435
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,619
Don't go showin'
everyone your loser face.

436
00:20:57,619 --> 00:20:58,995
Quit picking on me!

437
00:20:58,995 --> 00:21:01,581
Kenichi is it true
you lost a fight?!

438
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:03,583
You're killing me!

439
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,084
That look could win
Martial Arts Weekly's

440
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:06,878
"Loser of the Week"
photo contest.

441
00:21:06,878 --> 00:21:09,422
Be more considerate,
would ya?!

442
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:11,049
Stop talking about
what a loser I am!

443
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,717
You win some you
lose some, right?!

444
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:14,177
If the loser's gonna
cry like a baby

445
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:16,929
then I have to get
a recording of it.

446
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:18,431
How do you even
know that I lost?!

447
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:19,724
What if I let him win?!

448
00:21:19,724 --> 00:21:22,101
It's been like 10 years since
I've even seen the bas...

449
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:23,645
Hold on... Your old
friend is a Bass?

450
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:25,021
They can be mean!

451
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:26,731
You're just comin'
up with excuses.

452
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:29,859
And It's pretty obvious
to us that you lost... Yeah.

453
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:31,444
Damn it, First Fist!

454
00:21:31,444 --> 00:21:34,113
I swear next time I see
you I'm takin' you down!

455
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:36,574
There you go!
That's the spirit.

456
00:21:36,574 --> 00:21:37,784
Kenichi...

457
00:21:37,784 --> 00:21:39,202
Elder wants to see you...

458
00:21:39,202 --> 00:21:40,745
There's something
he'd like to ask.

459
00:21:43,247 --> 00:21:45,124
You must try to
remain humble...

460
00:21:45,124 --> 00:21:48,336
you won't reach master
status with an ego.

461
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,296
When it comes to a
martial arts fight-

462
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:52,048
the loser usually walks away

463
00:21:52,048 --> 00:21:53,716
with more knowledge
than the winner.

464
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:55,385
So how was it, Kenichi...?

465
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:57,053
Did you come away
from your loss today

466
00:21:57,053 --> 00:22:00,139
with any new martial
arts knowledge?

467
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:01,766
The Seikuuken.

468
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:03,726
You're so wrapped up in
visualizing your target

469
00:22:03,726 --> 00:22:06,062
you didn't
catch my attack.

470
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:07,939
The most prolific
martial arts masters

471
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:10,066
will thank any opponent
that can beat them

472
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:12,068
for they've learned
something new.

473
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:14,821
You'll get over your
loss in no time...

474
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:17,657
and you'll become a
better fighter for it.

475
00:22:17,657 --> 00:22:18,741
Right!

476
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:22,120
He's right.

477
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,289
Today I was able to
see how far I've come.

00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:28,084
To become a master I have
to thank any opponent

479
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:30,336
who beats me.

480
00:22:30,336 --> 00:22:32,171
Thanks for talking to me...

481
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:33,756
Please teach me
everything you know!

482
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:37,385
Then again... I can't
remember an instance

483
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:39,011
when I've ever lost a fight.

484
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:42,473
You gotta be kidding!

485
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:48,479

486
00:24:17,652 --> 00:24:19,445
I have an idea, Kenichi!

487
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:20,404
How would you feel about

488
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:22,657
my taking on your
training responsibilities

489
00:24:22,657 --> 00:24:23,950
for a little while?

490
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,035
You mean, I'd get personal
training sessions with you?!

491
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:28,663
It's about time we shook
up your training a bit.

492
00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:30,039
I think you're
doing a fine job

493
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,874
but we have to keep
you on your toes.

494
00:24:31,874 --> 00:24:32,792
What do you say?

495
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:35,044
If you can help me beat
Odin then I'm up for anything!

496
00:24:35,044 --> 00:24:36,254
I'll take whatever
you dish out!

497
00:24:36,254 --> 00:24:38,673
Please share your
wisdom with me, elder!

498
00:24:38,673 --> 00:24:40,758
This is going to
get interesting.

499
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:43,261
So you'll take whatever
I dish out, huh?

500
00:24:43,261 --> 00:24:44,971
Don't forget you said that-

501
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:46,973
I may make you
eat those words.
