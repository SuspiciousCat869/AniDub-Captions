1
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:55,003
Not so mouthy anymore, are you?

2
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:56,296
Another gang who
bragged they could

3
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:59,383
take down Ragnarok gets
crushed into little pieces.

4
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:02,135
Sweep up the rest of this trash.

5
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:20,570
Pardon the interruption, but
after giving it much thought,

6
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,489
I think it's time for
Kenichi to start training

7
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:23,782
in the advanced techniques.

8
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:25,325
What about the
rest of you? Well?

9
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:29,121
It's harsh. Some of the most
severe training known to man.

10
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:32,165
But I agree it's time.

11
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:37,337
Dunno. Could be dangerous.
His body's not made of steel,

12
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:40,132
If we rush his training,
he might die.

13
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:42,509
Yes, but if we take our
time when we train him,

14
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,302
Apachai is sure
Kenichi can survive

15
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:45,595
anything life throws at him.

16
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:48,265
Plus, there's a reason why
he almost drops dead.

17
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:51,268
You guys, you push him too hard.

18
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:53,061
Like you're one to talk, pal!

19
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:56,398
Excuse me,
Masters, but,

20
00:02:56,398 --> 00:03:00,110
Could-could you please not
talk about me like I'm not here?

21
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,488
Or at the very least, leave out
the part about me dropping dead?

22
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:06,908
My apologies. I was about
to ask your opinion, too.

23
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:09,119
I must forewarn you that
it's intensive training.

24
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:09,953
You ready for it?

25
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:10,829
It's really hard?

26
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:14,082
Of course.

27
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:15,709
Can it wait just
a little longer?

28
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:21,214
Well how much time do
you need? Till tomorrow?

29
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:23,550
Akisame's really anxious
to start his training.

30
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,178
Hope you survive it, kid.

31
00:03:30,474 --> 00:03:33,185
Advanced techniques, huh?

32
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:35,187
Earth to Kenichi!

33
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:37,022
You looked a little
spaced out there!

34
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:39,524
Just lost in my thoughts
a little, Takeda.

35
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:40,734
Is your arm still
getting better?

36
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,487
Yeah. It's recovering
pretty quickly.

37
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:46,198
So much, in fact, that I joined
the school's Boxing Club.

38
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:49,201
Not to rain on your
parade or anything,

39
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:51,119
but has anyone from
Ragnarok come after you?

40
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:53,038
Not yet. Rumor has
it they've been

41
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:55,415
busy with some
organizational changes.

42
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:57,417
I guess they have other
things to worry about.

43
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,795
Well, that's good!
So I guess you're okay

44
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:02,422
for the time being then?
But if anything happens...

45
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:04,341
I-I've got your...

46
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:05,258
I've got your back, man!

47
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:08,220
Thanks, but I can
take care of myself!

48
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,765
Really. But It means a lot to
me that you offered, though.

49
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:13,350
Say hello to that strong-armed
hottie girlfriend

50
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,145
of yours for me!

51
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:18,772
See ya later!

52
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:19,981
Good luck.

53
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:27,614
That's cold.

54
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:29,658
Hey, quit trying to
scare me like that!

55
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:31,535
What were you doing
in there anyway?!

56
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:34,204
Hmph! Sometimes I have
to hide in strange places

57
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:35,664
if I wanna get
the inside scoop.

58
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:37,916
Go do it someplace else, okay!

59
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,752
Hmph! You're colder
than that water!

60
00:04:40,752 --> 00:04:44,172
By the way, did ya hear?
Kisara Nanjo's getting promoted.

61
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:46,174
She's joining the
Seven Deadly Fists.

62
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:48,176
What? Who's this Kisara
you're talking about?

63
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:48,885
You don't know?!

64
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:52,055
Ah well, I think I've heard
the name a few times before.

65
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:53,765
But I can't recall
meeting her.

66
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:56,059
You're really hopeless,
you know that?

67
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:59,396
Here, let me enlighten you.
Kisara Nanjo. A female executive

68
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:01,314
member of Ragnarok
who's steadily risen

69
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:03,358
through its ranks. She's
also a sophomore here.

70
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:04,359
Hold on!

71
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,027
You mean she's a
student at this school?

72
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:07,320
Hate to break it to you,

73
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,989
but you really are
dumber than you look.

74
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:11,283
Of course that's what I meant.
She's the person who's been

75
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:13,535
sending all those
scary goons after you!

76
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:16,580
Some additional facts:
she's skilled in Tae Kwon Do

77
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,540
and within Ragnarok,
she's known as "Valkyrie."

78
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,377
"Valkyrie?" You mean like the
goddess of Norse mythology?

79
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:24,963
The one who guides the
souls of dead warriors?

80
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:26,882
Oh! So you do know something!

81
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:29,885
Too bad it's useless geek
trivia! But you're right.

82
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:31,970
Just like the myth, this
Valkyrie takes those who

83
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,556
have fallen and uses them
to bolster Rangnarok's ranks.

84
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:37,767
Oh, man! I knew Kisara was
ambitious, but I never thought

85
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,728
she'd make it into
the Seven Deadly Fists

86
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:40,770
as fast as she has!

87
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,064
The Seven Deadly Fists?
What's that?

88
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:44,900
Don't tell me you
haven't heard of them!

89
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,568
What, have you been
living inside a cave

90
00:05:46,568 --> 00:05:47,861
for the past
couple of years?

91
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:49,529
They're an elite group
of fighters made up

92
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,531
of the seven most powerful
members of Ragnarok.

93
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:53,617
You know the only thing
that all the other members

94
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:57,537
of Ragnarok fear? Them!
The Seven Deadly Fists!

95
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,873
But I guess they'll be
the Eight Deadly Fists,

96
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:01,374
once Kisara joins.

97
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,543
Wow, they sound pretty scary--

98
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:06,504
They are! And it's your fault
they're getting scarier!

99
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:08,131
The only reason Kisara's
becoming a Fist

100
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:09,716
is because you haven't
defeated her yet!

101
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:11,343
But I've never even met her!

102
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:12,719
You probably will soon enough!

103
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:15,680
I just hope you haven't
derailed my plan too much.

104
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,057
What do you mean "your plan?"

105
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:19,267
Don't worry about it. You've
got more important things

106
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:22,395
to do, namely your rematch
and eventual defeat of Tsuji.

107
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:23,063
What?

108
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:24,564
Now's the perfect
time to strike!

109
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:27,233
He's been vying to become the
Eighth Deadly Fist for awhile,

110
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,444
but Kisara just snatched
that spot out from under him!

111
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:31,780
He's totally devastated!

112
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,531
Really? If that's the case,

113
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:36,076
then I actually feel
kind of sorry for him.

114
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:38,870
Idiot!

115
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,705
Let me share a little
tidbit with you!

116
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:43,166
Ragnarok's assigned
someone to punish Takeda!

117
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,753
Guess who it is? Tsuji!
Still feel sorry for him?

118
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:50,090
If you don't do this, your pal
Takeda could get banged up

119
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,384
and it's bye-bye
boxing career again.

120
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:54,803
You've gotta stop Tsuji
and I'm willing to help.

121
00:06:54,803 --> 00:06:57,180
I can't let Takeda
get hurt again.

122
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,224
I have to help him
however I can.

123
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:00,600
Just don't lose, okay?

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,102
That would really
screw up my plan.

125
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:04,229
I'm gonna go collect some
more data on the Fists

126
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:06,564
and Tsuji that'll help
you out, buddy.

127
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:09,651
While I'm doing that, you
go work on your skills. Later!

128
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:12,904
Now I have a pretty good idea
what planet you're from,

129
00:07:12,904 --> 00:07:14,197
Dr. Spock.

130
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:17,575
His name's Mister Spock.

131
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:20,787
You seem different.
Confident, tougher even.

132
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:22,497
Yeah, I guess it's
due to all the stuff

133
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:24,541
I went through
on Furinji Island.

134
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:31,464
Leave her alone!

135
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:35,552
Never in a million years did I
ever think I'd fight a shark!

136
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,762
That's a story you'll tell
your grandkids one day!

137
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:38,638
Yep!

138
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:41,141
I should thank that shark for
helping me work up my courage!

139
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,560
Now I feel like I can take
on anybody, even Tsuji!

140
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,229
Oh, then this must
be your lucky day,

141
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:47,564
because he's standing
right over there.

142
00:07:47,564 --> 00:07:49,274
Huh?

143
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:56,364
So what's your plan? Issue a
challenge and then take him on?

144
00:07:56,364 --> 00:07:58,575
No no! Not just yet!

145
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:00,660
The prudent thing to do
would be to watch him

146
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,204
and see what he's up to before
devising my plan of attack!

147
00:08:03,204 --> 00:08:05,248
What a wise strategy!

148
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:07,417
You're becoming the
Eighth Deadly Fist?

149
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:09,502
Yeah, right. Don't
make me laugh.

150
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:11,588
In case you didn't know,
Ragnarok only makes Fists

151
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:13,631
out of its most powerful
members, sweet cheeks!

152
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:16,843
I guess that's why they
chose me instead of you.

153
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:19,012
No way!

154
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:21,973
I got an idea. Why don't
you and I fight it out

155
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:23,808
to see who's more
worthy of the position.

156
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:25,727
But I'm not gonna go easy on ya.

157
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:28,897
Who asked you to? Bring it on.

158
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:41,576
Um, Kenichi?

159
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:43,203
--Damn you!
--Stop it!

160
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:45,205
I'm talking to you, Tsuji!

161
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:52,504
Wow, I've gotta admit, Kenichi
knows how to make an entrance!

162
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:53,588
You're dead, man!

163
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:55,006
Get 'im!

164
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:03,681
Well, not bad. Not bad at all.

165
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:06,476
Nice work! He took out
Tsuji and his two henchmen

166
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:08,478
all at once with
barely any effort.

167
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:11,077
That was pretty impressive,
for a sneak attack.

168
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,079
Um, hey, are you okay, miss?

169
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:18,873
That was pretty good, kid,

170
00:09:18,873 --> 00:09:21,125
Or should I say
Kenichi Shirahama.

171
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,003
I'm sorry, but, uh,
have I met you before?

172
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:26,088
Not personally, but you
have gotten to know

173
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:27,298
a lot of my friends.

174
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:29,091
Yeah? Who are they?

175
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:34,806
Members of Ragnarok.
My name's Kisara Nanjo.

176
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:38,518
Hold up! Y-you mean
you're the Kisara Nanjo?!

177
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:40,019
In the flesh.

178
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,939
And you're the guy who defeated
Takeda's three-man army.

179
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:45,441
I've been looking forward
to fighting you for a while.

180
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:51,405
The way her pants are cut
and those defined quadriceps

181
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:54,534
are dead giveaways. Her
specialty must be kicking.

182
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:57,161
And the way she holds her stance
to her advantage like that...

183
00:09:57,161 --> 00:10:00,289
She's no amateur;
she's a skilled fighter!

184
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:02,834
She's a lot more powerful
than she looks.

185
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,126
Don't let your guard
down, understand?

186
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:07,213
What? Don't worry about it.
Nothing's going to happen.

187
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:08,339
She's a girl.

188
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,258
Yeah, do you have
a problem with that?

189
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:11,300
Well, sorta.

190
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,303
One of my rules in life is that
a guy should never hit a girl.

191
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:16,305
That makes it sound
like I'm not a girl

192
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:18,307
since you try to hit me
in our sparring sessions.

193
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:21,310
But, with you, I know you
won't let me get a punch in.

194
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,105
Oh? So you admit you've at
least been trying to hit me.

195
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:26,440
Um, no, not really, I'm
not trying to hit you,

196
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,191
just touch you!

197
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:28,317
Touch me where?

198
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,403
Um! On your shoulders?!

199
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,702
Refusing to fight
a girl is sexist!

200
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:41,622
It's stupid crap like
that, that pisses me off.

201
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:43,457
Don't think you're something
special because your

202
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:46,085
sneak attack knocked Tsuji out.
He wasn't even looking.

203
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:49,755
Huh? My sneak attack?

204
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:51,549
That was a cowardly move!

205
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:53,467
I didn't realize
he wasn't looking!

206
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,595
You're not to blame. He is.

207
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:57,388
All you were doing was
trying to protect a girl.

208
00:10:57,388 --> 00:10:59,765
Hey c'mon! I'm not
done with you yet!

209
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:00,641
Get back up here!

210
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:04,020
Tsuji, I'm really sorry!
Please wake up!

211
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,230
This is just too weird.

212
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,773
I don't have time
for this today.

213
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:10,610
Hey, kid. Lucky for you there's
somewhere else I need to be.

214
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,528
So I guess you're
off the hook for now.

215
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:13,321
Huh?

216
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:16,949
But not for long. I'll be seeing
you and your buddy Takeda

217
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,327
soon enough and then we'll
settle things once and for all.

218
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:21,495
Why are you and your
gang hassling him?!

219
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:23,205
Why can't you just
leave him alone?!

220
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:27,543
Hm. Maybe I'll consider
it, if you defeat me.

221
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:38,554
What do I do? I don't
wanna fight a girl,

222
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:40,723
but now it seems like
I have no other choice.

223
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:42,808
Even if you agree to fight
her, she'll beat you.

224
00:11:42,808 --> 00:11:44,393
There's no possible
way you can win.

225
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:44,852
What?

226
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:46,854
I mean at least in
your current state.

227
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:50,691
She's much more powerful.
And much more experienced too.

228
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,740
Oh, no, that means...

229
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,786
I'm not strong enough
to protect Takeda.

230
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,871
I'd say you'd need to be
at least strong enough

231
00:12:03,871 --> 00:12:05,289
to score a point against me.

232
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:08,250
Otherwise, you won't be
able to lay a finger on her.

233
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,295
So, there's only one
way to get stronger.

234
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,005
More advanced
technique training.

235
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:46,330
Hey, you! Come outta there!

236
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,466
What the heck?
There's only one of you?

237
00:12:57,466 --> 00:13:00,553
No.

238
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:02,346
There are eight of us.

239
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,269
They have numbered
insignias on their gloves!

240
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:10,980
Only the toughest Ragnarok
members wear those!

241
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,151
Those guys must be
the Eight Deadly Fists!

242
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:17,027
Do ya think this
is some kinda joke?!

243
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:19,155
I thought we were finally
going to settle the score!

244
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:21,615
I brought 50 guys and
you only brought eight?!

245
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:23,284
Mismatched odds
are fine with us!

246
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:24,034
It's your funeral!

247
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:26,996
Well, just to be fair,
we should even the odds,

248
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:28,873
so you'll only fight
three of us for now.

249
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:30,124
Say what?!

250
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:31,792
You'll be fighting
our newest member,

251
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,961
the Eighth Fist, Valkyrie,

252
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:36,380
the Sixth Fist, Hermit,

253
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,717
and the Fourth Fist, Loki.

254
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:42,011
I sincerely hope your
men can handle it.

255
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,638
Once we're done with them,
we'll take care of you!

256
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:46,557
Come on, let's destroy 'em!

257
00:13:52,646 --> 00:13:54,899
Three against 50?!

258
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:18,839
Oh, man!

259
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,801
They took down 50 guys
without even breaking a sweat!

260
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:23,803
And that was only
three of the Eight!

261
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:35,105
Breakfast is ready, everybody!
Come and get it!

262
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:40,194
Apapapapapapa!

263
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:42,404
So? What do you
say about starting

264
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:45,783
the advanced training
this afternoon Kenichi?

265
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:48,118
Thanks for the food, Masters!

266
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:49,912
I don't want to be
late for school!

267
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:51,288
Miu, we've gotta go!

268
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:53,916
What? No, we don't.
We still have time.

269
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,751
Tch! Guess that's "no."

270
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:58,629
I thought Kenichi conquered
his fears on the island.

271
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,548
After all he's been
through, why is he scared

272
00:15:00,548 --> 00:15:01,799
of a new type of training?

273
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,884
You know, we could
just force him to do it.

274
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:06,345
Remember what happened the
last time we tried that?

275
00:15:06,345 --> 00:15:08,430
It would just make him fear
the training even more.

276
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,224
Let's just give him some time.

277
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:13,435
He's proven to be the type that
will come around eventually.

278
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:21,944
Yeah. It's recovering
pretty quickly.

279
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:24,822
So much, in fact, that I joined
the school's Boxing Club.

280
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:27,157
You know what's the only thing
that all the other members

281
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:31,036
of Ragnarok fear? Them!
The Seven Deadly Fists!

282
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:33,289
But I guess they'll be
the Eight Deadly Fists,

283
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,874
once Kisara joins.

284
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:38,294
But not for long. I'll be seeing
you and your buddy Takeda

285
00:15:38,294 --> 00:15:41,046
soon enough and then we'll
settle things once and for all.

286
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:43,340
Even if you agree to fight
her, she'll beat you.

287
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,759
There's no possible
way you can win.

288
00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:57,730
What's the matter?
You can tell me.

289
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,251
Something's bothering
you, isn't it?

290
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,004
Sure is. The training for
the advanced techniques--

291
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,505
I'm really worried about it.

292
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,341
You are? That's strange.
Usually people are happy

293
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,385
when they progress from
one level to the next.

294
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,804
The training's tough, but you
shouldn't be scared of it.

295
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:14,850
Honestly, it's not just
the actual training.

296
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,602
Something else scares
me even more than that.

297
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,103
What?

298
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,230
You know, I'm not
the best student.

299
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,398
Well, I guess.

300
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:25,485
Even though I've been
training like mad for weeks.

301
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,696
If the masters taught me
the advanced techniques

302
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,197
and I still didn't improve...

303
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,949
Well, I'd be letting
them down again

304
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,368
and they'd be incredibly
disappointed in me.

305
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,495
And I just don't think
I could live with myself

306
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,246
if that happened.

307
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,583
I don't think they'd be
disappointed in you at all!

308
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,877
You see, to be disappointed
in someone means

309
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,588
that you gave up on them,
and let me tell you, the phrase

310
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:47,382
"give up" does not exist in
the masters' vocabulary!

311
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,301
Yeah, I guess you're right!

312
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,219
They'll keep trying
even when the training

313
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,429
leaves you battered,
bruised, and bleeding.

314
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,348
What?! If that's the case,

315
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,184
I wish they'd just go ahead
and give up on me now!

316
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,269
Hey there, pal! What's up?

317
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,813
Would you stop jumping
out at me like that?!

318
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,815
I really wouldn't keep
going down this street

319
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,151
if I were you! I'd
turn right instead!

320
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,445
Well, if I were you, I'd
go back to whatever rock

321
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,781
you crawled out from under!
Now get out of our way!

322
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,449
And let my buddy head
in the direction

323
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,368
where Tsuji's waiting
for him? I don't think so.

324
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,535
You should turn back.

325
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,037
Wait, Tsuji's down there?

326
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,790
Yeah, and word on the street is
he's ticked off at a certain

327
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,251
someone for knocking him
out when he wasn't looking.

328
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,171
Hey, it's okay, you only
did it to protect a girl!

329
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,132
Everybody knows about his defeat
now thanks to the cover story

330
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,928
of this morning's paper!
Written by yours truly!

331
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,180
I even made up a couple
of quotes from you.

332
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,266
"What a pushover!" and "Tsuji's
as weak as a little girl!"

333
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,976
I heard that last
one is what really

334
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,478
pushed him over the edge!

335
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,563
How could you do this
to me? You gossip monger!

336
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,316
You yellow journalist! You
mud-slinging, libelous, lying--

337
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,443
You say that as if
that's a bad thing!

338
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,570
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got to go straighten

339
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,489
some things out with
him, no thanks to you!

340
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,658
Your level of stupidity never
ceases to amaze me!

341
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:57,327
If you walk down there,
Tsuji's gonna kill you!

342
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,329
I've gotta go try to
square things with him!

343
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,082
What are you, nuts?! You've
seen him when he gets angry!

344
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,501
You're no match for him!
He's gonna kick your butt!

345
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,878
Don't throw away the win you
earned with that sneak attack!

346
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,338
If you go down
there, you're dead!

347
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,589
I don't care what you say!

348
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,175
I'm going! If I turn around
right now, all I'm doing

349
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,345
is running away from my
problems like a coward would!

350
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,222
At this rate, my plan's
gonna fall apart.

351
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,224
I can't let that happen!

352
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,268
Ha! You want to keep
going down this street?!

353
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:26,314
Fine, but you're gonna have
to go through me first!

354
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,442
You should've
seen that comin'.

355
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,697
Go ahead and get
killed! See if I care!

356
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,949
I'll write your obituary
for the school paper!

357
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,327
He sure is a funny
best friend, isn't he?

358
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,246
Look over there Tsuji!
The kid's back!

359
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:44,291
Huh? So the coward
shows his face!

360
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,752
You're gonna pay for what you
did to me the other day, punk!

361
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,420
I'm gonna get you
back for those lies

362
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,921
you told the school
paper about me!

363
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,340
Thanks to that story, my
whole gang abandoned me!

364
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,884
All of 'em except
these two guys!

365
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,761
You know, this is all
your fault, Shirahama!

366
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,513
Look, about the sneak
attack, I'm really sorry.

367
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,640
But I didn't have anything
to do with that story.

368
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,266
My friend Niij--

369
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,268
Can the lame excuses!
That's the last thing

370
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,478
I wanna hear from you, man!

371
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,937
But you know what
I do want to hear?

372
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,065
The sound of your puny
body hitting the pavement!

373
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,068
Let's settle this! Fight me!
Right here, right now!

374
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,113
If that's what you want.

375
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:20,577
Oh, I want it all right, kid!
Really, really bad!

376
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,204
Huh?

377
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,958
What are you trying to do
with those lame punches?!

378
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,794
Bring it on!

379
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,012
Tsuji!

380
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,556
You okay?!

381
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,768
I knocked him out?!

382
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,645
That explains why
they feel you're ready

383
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:49,523
for the advanced training! Wow!

384
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,024
What do you, mean?

385
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,652
That kung fu move you just did.
That proves you can take

386
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:56,446
what you learned from
training and put it to use.

387
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,698
And you thought you
hadn't improved at all.

388
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,075
But you obviously have.

389
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,702
That's why the masters suggested
you begin advanced training.

390
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,454
They could see you
were ready for it.

391
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,707
I didn't really even think
about that punch, I just did it.

392
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,294
I guess my training
is paying off.

393
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,003
Aw, damn!

394
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,797
Are you alright, man?!

395
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,011
Hey, are you okay, Tsuji?

396
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,639
What-what just happened?

397
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,308
Oh. You beat me.

398
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,645
Fair and square. Well, I
guess that settles it then.

399
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,064
You two get outta here
and join another gang!

400
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,566
You don't wanna ruin
your street cred

401
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,608
by being seen with me!

402
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,110
Nah! We can't leave!

403
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,612
We don't wanna join another
gang! We'll stick with you!

404
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,949
A gang with no members, whose
leader has been defeated twice?

405
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,535
We used to be feared and
respected, but now look at us.

406
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,120
We're nothing but one big joke!

407
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,081
As of this moment,
this gang is no more!

408
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,250
A man's worth is determined
by the number of men

409
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,585
under his command.

410
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,838
I used to have many,
but now I have nothing!

411
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,131
Tsuji wait!

412
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,591
Don't go!

413
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,468
You're wrong, you know.

414
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,428
What?

415
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,389
Tsuji, you have something far
greater than 100 henchmen.

416
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:08,310
It's a rare gift, do you
have any idea what it is?

417
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,980
Friends you can trust! That's
right! Two of 'em, in fact!

418
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,398
Hm?

419
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,944
Kenichi! Old buddy, old pal!

420
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,739
I always knew you'd beat this
loser! I was about to jump in

421
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,033
and help you out, but you
took him down so quickly!

422
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:25,952
Lucky? This is the kind
of friend I've got.

423
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,622
Come on, yo! We go
wherever you go, man!

424
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:31,333
Hell yeah! The three of us
can always start a new gang!

425
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,667
You guys...

426
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:36,463
Alright, we'll do it, but our
new gang's gonna be independent

427
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,048
and break all
ties with Ragnarok!

428
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:38,673
Yeah!

429
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:42,469
Sounds good to me! Let's do it!

430
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:43,678
Hey, Kenichi.

431
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,013
What is it?

432
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,849
That friend of yours,
the boxer guy?

433
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:50,977
I heard that Ragnarok's giving
him a farewell beatdown soon.

434
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,187
But when?!

435
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:55,106
I don't know the exact date,
but Kisara will be there

436
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,609
along with a witness from
the Eight Deadly Fists.

437
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,945
One of the
Eight Deadly Fists? Who?

438
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:04,282
The Sixth Fist. The guy
who's also known as Hermit!

439
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,785
I'd watch out for
him. He's bad news.

440
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,120
See ya around, kid.

441
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,997
Did he say "Hermit?"

442
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,083
Yeah. Do you know anything
about him, Niijima?

443
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,376
Uh-huh.

444
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:17,337
I saw him fight a whole gang;
it was pretty intense.

445
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,130
Only three of the
Eight Fists fought,

446
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,677
but they took down 50 men
in like 30 seconds!

447
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,095
What's the plan?

448
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:35,146
Hi, everybody! We're home!

449
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,607
Welcome back.
Was your day eventful?

450
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,859
Master Koetsuji!

451
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,028
I've decided! Starting
today, I want to begin

452
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,655
training for the
advanced techniques!

453
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,533
Hm. I don't know what happened,
but that look in your eyes

454
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:49,703
is completely different
from the one this morning.

455
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,746
So, shall we get started then?

456
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,331
Yes!

457
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,630
Takeda, I heard the members of
Ragnarok are planning something!

458
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,965
They've really got it out for
you, so please be careful!

459
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,425
Hm, is that so?

460
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,886
I'll keep an eye out.
Thanks for the heads-up.

461
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,971
Here's my cell phone number.
Promise me that you'll call

462
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,431
at the first sign
of trouble, okay?!

463
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,475
Geez! You sound like you
my mother or something!

464
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:38,186
Hey, look, I appreciate the
concern, but don't worry.

465
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,605
I told you before, I can
take care of myself.

466
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:41,272
I'll be fine.

467
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,024
Takeda's a really
good friend of mine.

468
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,235
I can't let him down!
No matter what happens,

469
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,903
I promise I'll be there
to protect him!
