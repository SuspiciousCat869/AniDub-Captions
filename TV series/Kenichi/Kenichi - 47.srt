00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:12,554
[Music]

2
00:01:43,598 --> 00:01:44,525
Uh-oh...

3
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:46,485
Guess I was a little
too hard on you...

4
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:48,237
You've gotta learn
to dodge, my boy...

5
00:01:48,237 --> 00:01:49,906
Oh my god...!

6
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:51,157
It's a miracle...!

7
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:53,451
The good Lord above has
recognized my dying wish

8
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:55,620
and has granted this lost
soul with a single bar!

9
00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:59,498
Looks like I have to stay
like this or I lose it...

10
00:01:59,498 --> 00:02:01,167
I better hurry
and call someone.

11
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:04,128
An email.....?...

12
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:05,713
But who's it from??

13
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:08,049
Niijima!

14
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:09,425
There are the wimps
who are bullied

15
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:11,093
and the bullies
that abuse them.

16
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:12,428
There are the people
who give orders

17
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:14,180
and the people
who follow them.

18
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,016
Each person's role has
been predetermined by God

19
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:19,518
and handed down to them
when they were born.

20
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:20,978
Or so I thought.

21
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:24,523
Your existence has shaken the
very foundation of my beliefs...

22
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:31,781
We'll bust through that wall

23
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:33,407
of dirty thugs and
head to freedom, sir!

24
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:37,536
Molotov cocktails??!

25
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,250
Hey Commander...

26
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,794
I don't think we're gonna
get through these guys.

27
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:46,170
It's a wall of Loki!

28
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,880
Elder...

29
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,799
I have to get back home
immediately, I'm sorry.

30
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:52,885
I guess he's learned enough

31
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:54,970
to face any delinquent
he may encounter.

32
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,765
My name is... Thor!

33
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:02,770
Damn it... Not you.

34
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,938
Now listen up punks-

35
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:05,231
I'm here here to
protect the commander

36
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,358
at the request of my buddy,
Siegfriedfried...

37
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:10,486
As of today I'm a member
of the Shinpaku Alliance.

38
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:19,912
I never thought
he'd actually come!

39
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:22,832
You never said anything
about running 100 miles an hour

40
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:24,166
on electrical wires.

41
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,544
Really I am gonna die
before I ever make it home.

42
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:28,671
Don't worry- as long
as you keep holding on

43
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:29,755
everything'll be fine.

44
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:31,257
This is the fastest
way to get there

45
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:32,925
so just hang tight, okay??

46
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:35,553
This may be the fastest way
but it's dangerous.....!...

47
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:37,096
My hands are slipping!

48
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,099
Save me, Elder!

49
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,309
Those two just had
to get in the way...

50
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,358
Ragnarok is now... dead!

51
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:57,950
Whoa...! Who are they.....?..?

52
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,410
That's a pretty
scary lookin' bunch!

53
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,164
I'd like to introduce you to
the fighters I've trained

54
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:05,207
to pick up where
Ragnarok left off...

55
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:07,626
The new Eight Deadly Fists!

56
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:08,836
And their...

57
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:10,296
new leader is...

58
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,632
Berserker,

59
00:04:13,632 --> 00:04:15,801
you're the one who's
right for the job.

60
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:18,804
I'm perfectly fine with
being second in command.

61
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,434
Everyone... I present to
you a fighting force

62
00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:25,227
to be reckoned with.....!...

63
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:26,896
The reincarnation
of the Fists

64
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,482
and their new and
improved Ragnarok gang!

65
00:04:38,282 --> 00:04:39,533
What?

66
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:52,505
Now...! Go Niijima...!

67
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:53,756
I made a promise
to Siegfried

68
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:55,508
that I would protect
you at all costs!

69
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:04,683
What now??!

70
00:05:04,683 --> 00:05:06,936
Ow! Man, that hurt.....!...

71
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:08,479
Jeez, I wish the Elder
would figure out

72
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,397
how to let me
down more gently.

73
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:19,073
Hey you guys.....?...

74
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:20,157
You okay??

75
00:05:20,157 --> 00:05:22,034
Its... Kenichi!

76
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:23,911
Captain Shirahama's here!

77
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:27,665
Kenichi Shirahama...

78
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:29,333
You haven't changed-

79
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,544
you're just as stubborn
as you were before.

80
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:51,480
They're fighting
in that factory.

81
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,815
It is abandoned, right??

82
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:54,108
Yes, sir.

83
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:56,026
Where's all that
smoke coming from??

84
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:58,153
-Picnic time!
-The meat... the meat.

85
00:05:58,153 --> 00:05:59,864
Let me see...

86
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:02,449
It looks like there's
a lot of people there.

87
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,742
What.....?..?...! Really??!

88
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:04,910
Yep a bunch of people!

89
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,919
Well... I know it's
hard to see...

90
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,380
So... I brought this for you.

91
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,923
Where'd that come from...?
Huh...?

92
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:20,759
You wanna tell me what use
that telescope for, Kensei??

93
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,678
I have a passion
for bird watching!

94
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:25,431
I hope that
everyone's okay.

95
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:27,099
Please be well,
my comrades...

96
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:28,809
and my dear, demon king!

97
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:39,778
It's been a while...

98
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:41,155
So how is everyone.....?...

99
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:42,531
Did you all miss me??

100
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:43,782
Oh... hey...

101
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:45,284
We're glad you're
home, Grandpa.

102
00:06:45,284 --> 00:06:46,368
Apa!

103
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:47,786
Who's this old
man.....?..?...!

104
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:49,830
I've never seen anyone
move so fast before...

105
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,040
How'd he do that??!

106
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,375
I saw you on my way
back to Ryozanpaku

107
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,752
so I dropped in...

108
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:57,338
I wasn't expecting
such a fancy picnic.

109
00:06:57,338 --> 00:06:58,881
Where's Kenichi; is
he coming too.....?...

110
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,007
How'd training go?

111
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:01,717
Do you think he's ready
to face his old friend??

112
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:02,968
Kenichi's back...?..?...!

113
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:05,387
He should be over there
helping the other Shinpaku!

114
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:06,597
Kenichi...

115
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:08,557
I accidentally
dropped the boy...

116
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:10,142
into a deep ravine.

117
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:15,022
I'm just messin' with ya...

118
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:17,316
I dropped him right in the
middle of the battlefield-

119
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:18,817
he should be there now.

120
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:21,070
Old man... Joking around
like that isnot cool...

121
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,821
Are you sure the kid
made it over there??

122
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:24,782
What if you dropped
him in the wrong place?

123
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:26,992
His life is at stake- do
you want him to get hurt??

124
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:29,370
Ah... How I've
missed you tea...

125
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,371
So good.

126
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,959
Why don't you guys take
a look for yourselves...

127
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,461
He's across the river by
the smoking warehouse.

128
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:38,921
How can you
see over there?!

129
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:40,839
All I can see from
this far are shadows.

130
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:47,721
He's all pumped up
from his training

131
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:49,723
and ready for a fight...

132
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:50,766
Hold on a second...

133
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:51,934
This is supposed
to be a battle

134
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:53,769
between the Shinpaku
and Ragnarok...

135
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:55,854
What exactly are you
doing here, Thor.....?...

136
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:58,273
I don't really understand
why you showed up.

137
00:07:58,273 --> 00:08:00,234
Start explaining, Niijima!

138
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:02,444
I told you not to come-
we're in serious trouble.

139
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:03,779
You should've
listened to me.

140
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,155
What's going on.....?...

141
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:06,907
Where are all the other members
of the Shinpaku Alliance?

142
00:08:06,907 --> 00:08:08,033
They should be here.....!...

143
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:09,743
I mean, where the
hell is Takeda??

144
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:11,161
Killed in action!

145
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:12,788
No, he's not really dead.

146
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:13,747
What about Ukita??

147
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:14,832
Killed in action!

148
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:16,166
What about Mizunuma.....?...

149
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,459
And Kamioka.....?...

150
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:18,502
And Siegfried??

151
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:20,462
They were all...
killed in action...!

152
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:22,589
We're the only
survivors, Captain.

153
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:25,301
Just ignore him......
He's being dramatic.

154
00:08:25,301 --> 00:08:26,885
You're the one to
blame for this...

155
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:28,554
Ryuto!

156
00:08:28,554 --> 00:08:30,764
No... I'm not the
one at fault here...

157
00:08:30,764 --> 00:08:33,183
Do you think I'd waste
my time on your lackeys??

158
00:08:33,183 --> 00:08:34,768
What'd you say??!

159
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:36,186
You can blame me...

160
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:38,314
I'm the one who
fought them.

161
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:39,398
It was just too easy...

162
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:41,984
Those guys all
had terrible form.

163
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:43,777
They moved so slowly...

164
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:45,112
I had to crush them.

165
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,162
Keep your cool, Kenichi.

166
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:55,372
Remember to stay calm
and stop the water.

167
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,043
No good...

168
00:08:59,043 --> 00:09:01,128
Almost let my anger
get the best of me.

169
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:03,130
Check it out guys...
It's Kenichi Shirahama!

170
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,339
If we can defeat
him I bet...

171
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,133
Odin'll make us one
of the Deadly Fists!

172
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,343
Let's do it!

173
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:11,597
Seikuuken??!

174
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,519
That's impressive...

175
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,730
How could he have learned how
to fight using the Seikuuken

176
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,357
in such a short
amount of time??!

177
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:38,018
That's enough...

178
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:40,771
This isn't the way that things
are supposed to go down...

179
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:42,982
Hold on a second,
Berserker.

180
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,775
This isn't your
fight, Kenichi...

181
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:46,068
Let me handle it.

182
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:47,194
But I wanna fight him!

183
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:48,821
Shut up!...

184
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,531
You've been training in
the mountains all this time

185
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:52,408
so you could 'd
defeat Odin, right??

186
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:53,993
You need to concentrate
on beating him-

187
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,536
don't waste your energy.

188
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:57,037
I understand what
you're saying...

189
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:58,205
But one thing...

190
00:09:58,205 --> 00:09:59,415
-What is it?
-Uh...

191
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:00,499
What are you doing here??

192
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,004
Well... I came here to
get revenge on Loki...

193
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,590
But then Berserker knocked him
out before I got the chance

194
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,716
so I might as
well hang around

195
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,426
and help you guys,
you know.....?...

196
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:11,927
Damn it.....!...
Why do you care...?..?

197
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,095
You're so annoying...

198
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:14,597
I should kill you.

199
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:16,682
Sorry... just glad
that you're here.

200
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,851
Wait- they're friends??!

201
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,436
Captain Tah-nee-moto has
come to show his support

202
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:22,146
for the Shinpaku Alliance...

203
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:24,106
and Captain Thor came
along with him.....!...

204
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:25,524
I knew those two
would see the light

205
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,401
and join the
Alliance eventually!

206
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:28,652
Tanimoto...

207
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:30,362
I don't wanna hear it.

208
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:32,198
Kenichi... You
haven't had a chance

209
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,991
to recover from
your training...

210
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:36,368
If you go and fight two of
the Three of Cards now...

211
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:38,579
I'm afraid... you'll injure
yourself to the point

212
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:40,414
where you can't study
martial arts anymore.

213
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:43,167
If that happened...

214
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,418
I'd never be able
to have a rematch

215
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:46,003
with you in the future...

216
00:10:46,003 --> 00:10:47,379
Besides...

217
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,381
That noisy brat
you call a sister

218
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:51,258
would never let me
hear the end of it...

219
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:52,676
I can only imagine...

220
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,264
Thanks, Tanimoto...

221
00:10:57,264 --> 00:10:59,391
Aw. This is a tender moment...

222
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:02,061
However... When did I ever
agree to fight you, Kenichi??

223
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,480
What??!

224
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,898
I've already defeated you-

225
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,817
I have no interest
in fighting again...

226
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:10,986
I think Berserker can
handle you both...

227
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,696
He's twice the fighter
you'll ever be.

228
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:19,286
-Whoa!
-Damn... Watch out, Hermit!

229
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:20,829
No... Leave him alone!

230
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,544
Wow... That was so predictable
I didn't even bother dodging!

231
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,174
Well... Must say I'm
impressed, Hermit...

232
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:33,300
You've improved.

233
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:36,553
Blood??

234
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:38,430
Kenichi's not the
only martial artist

235
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,224
who's been in intensive
training lately...

236
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:42,142
Ever Since I left Ragnarok

237
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:45,145
I've been preparing myself for
a fight like just like this one.

238
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:46,730
And Berserker...

239
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,357
I think you're the
perfect opponent for me

240
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:49,400
to test my new skills on.

241
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:56,115
What you just do?

242
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:58,909
It's a target...

243
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:01,203
That way I know exactly
where to aim my punches!

244
00:12:08,752 --> 00:12:10,296
Wow... He's strong.

245
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,339
Yeah well that's probably
why his nickname is

246
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:13,799
the "Invincible Brawler".

247
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,759
-Really??!
-'Fraid so...

248
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,553
Evidently Berserker
hasn't really

249
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:20,097
had any formal
martial arts training.

250
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:22,182
He's defeated a number of
highly skilled martial artists

251
00:12:22,182 --> 00:12:23,642
with his raw talent.

252
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,561
Imagine what he could
be if he trained...

253
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:26,895
I've heard he's
never lost a fight-

254
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:28,439
which doesn't bode
well for Hermit.

255
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,359
Tanimoto!

256
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:34,111
Whoa.....!...
He just beat him!

257
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:35,195
I'm not surprised...

258
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:36,864
Hermit's pretty tough

259
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:39,241
but he's still only the sixth
Fist outta eight, you know...?

260
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:41,619
That guy i's no match for
one of the Three of Cards.

261
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,500
Wow...

262
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,918
He's taken all of
Berserker's hits

263
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:51,920
and he's still
able to stand...

264
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,547
Hey... what happened...

265
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:56,050
I thought the whole point
was to hit the target.

266
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,176
You gotta remember

267
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,594
that I'm different
from the martial artists

268
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:00,220
you've fought in the past...

269
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,847
Sougetsu Ma trained me...

270
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,558
You may know him as
"The Fighting Demon".

271
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:07,394
I'm going show you the fury
of a true martial artist!

272
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:10,230
Too slow.

273
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:19,615
Yeah!

274
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:23,994
My attacks are
gonna hit you

275
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:26,622
whether you can see them
or not, Berserker...

276
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:27,790
You see, I've
mastered a technique

277
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,125
that counters
the human reflex...

278
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,293
Only martial artists

279
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:33,629
who've trained diligently
for years can master it

280
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:36,215
because the technique
is so difficult to learn.

281
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,591
I think I get it...

282
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:39,760
He's completely in tune
with his opponent's instincts.

283
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,345
He performs the
move they expect

284
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:43,680
and then he adds another
move to throw them off...

285
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,015
He can get a hit
because the opponent

286
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:47,184
isn't expecting
the second move.

287
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:50,646
I can't believe Tanimoto's
even stronger than before.

288
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:52,398
And back then he lasted
an entire fight

289
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,857
with a serious injury.

290
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,578
So... What'll you do
now, Hermit.....?...

291
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:08,789
I'm sure your're
master was a passable.

292
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,707
But I'm guessing he never
got around to teaching you

293
00:14:10,707 --> 00:14:13,335
how to dodge an attack
from above, am I right??

294
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:14,294
I'm not worried.

295
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:16,839
No! Watch out!

296
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,675
I bet your master
never taught

297
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:21,969
you how to handle an attack
like this did he.....?...

298
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:23,345
What's the matter Hermit?

299
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:24,847
You afraid of fighting me??

300
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:25,848
Hell... no.

301
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:26,640
Well, you should be.

302
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:29,935
Shut up!

303
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,270
You see...

304
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,147
I'm not afraid of
losing a fight-

305
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:35,274
especially not to
a loser like you...

306
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,859
I just don't want
to be bored...

307
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:39,236
Every time I think someone's
gonna be a good opponent

308
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:41,655
they let me down and I end
up yawning through the fight.

309
00:14:41,655 --> 00:14:43,073
It's such a shame...

310
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:45,576
I thought you were going to
be the one to change that.

311
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:46,618
But it's over.

312
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:53,000
-Captain Tanimoto!
-He got him!

313
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,084
Damn it, he's down!

314
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:00,466
Bulls-eye.

315
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:17,357
-Hermit!
-Captain Tanimoto!

316
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:18,441
He got him!

317
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:19,693
Damn it, he's down!

318
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:22,654
Hermit!

319
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:28,118
I'm disappointed...

320
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:30,662
I expected more but you let
me down like everyone else.

321
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:34,332
Looks like it's up
to you... Kenichi...

322
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:35,500
What do ya say??

323
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,002
You think you'd
actually be able

324
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,878
to handle a couple of
rounds against me.....?...

325
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:41,047
Nobody else seems
up to the challenge.

326
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:42,882
Kenichi... We have
to avenge Hermit

327
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:44,509
and you're the only
one who can do it!

328
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:45,760
No.

329
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,803
What.....?..?
What're you saying-

330
00:15:46,803 --> 00:15:48,179
we can't give up
without a fight!

331
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,770
You see...
I knew he wasn't out...

332
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:56,980
There's no way Tanimoto

333
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,648
would ever give up
a fight that easily.

334
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,151
You underestimated
me, Berserker.

335
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:02,861
I'm not some jerk who
goes around fighting

336
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:03,862
for the hell of it.

337
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,155
I'm a trained
martial artist

338
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:07,407
who refuses to be
beaten by likes of you.

339
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:09,993
I swore I'd never give in!

340
00:16:09,993 --> 00:16:11,828
Remember big brother...

341
00:16:11,828 --> 00:16:13,121
Please...

342
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,415
don't give in... please.

343
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:16,625
I promised!

344
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,256
Not... bad...

345
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,299
He knocked him out.

346
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:26,134
Now you listen to me...

347
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:28,553
Your raw talent is
actually your weakness...

348
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:29,679
You've never learned
what it means

349
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,681
to truly fight for victory.

350
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:33,725
See... My master
always taught me

351
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:35,101
losing a fight's
was the equivalent

352
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:36,394
of a dishonorable death.

353
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:40,023
I never let my guard
down during a fight...

354
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:41,608
not 'til my
opponent is dead.

355
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,993
It's not that easy...

356
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:54,329
Sorry kid...
but your time is up.

357
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:56,247
Damn... What'd you do to me??!

358
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:58,208
I didn't even
see him attack!

359
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,543
It seemed like Tanimoto had
the upper hand until now.

360
00:17:07,676 --> 00:17:09,469
Man... That guy's intense.

361
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:10,929
Sure is...

362
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,098
He's a street fighter that
feeds off of his anger...

363
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,265
This is bad...

364
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:16,851
If he keeps gaining
strength like he has been...

365
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:20,146
I'm afraid our boys won't
be able to defeat him.

366
00:17:20,146 --> 00:17:21,564
I'm impressed...

367
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:24,150
So far this fight 's been more
entertaining than the others.

368
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,402
I wrote you off too soon.

369
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:27,696
You're a worthy opponent.

370
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,698
I wouldn't be surprised if
you were the first person

371
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:31,241
to push me to my limit.

372
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:34,369
Oh, I'm sure I will...

373
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:35,412
and I'll be
the first person

374
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:36,788
to show you what it
losing feels like.

375
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:47,716
So fast...

376
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:49,884
having a hard time keeping
up with his punches...

377
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:52,595
There's no rhythm to them
it's just a flurry of attacks.

378
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:54,139
I can't keep
this up for long.

379
00:17:59,602 --> 00:18:01,312
Whoa... Did you see
that awesome feint

380
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:02,522
Berserker pulled on him??!

381
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:04,774
Yeah... He went in
with the a left jab...

382
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:06,192
but then he got him
with his a right hook.

383
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:10,613
Berserker's untrained attacks
have no rhythm to them...

384
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:12,365
So they can't
be predicted...

385
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:14,367
He can trick his
opponent... see...

386
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:15,994
When they dodge his attack

387
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,830
he instinctively punches in
the direction of their movement.

388
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,832
However...
He has to be aware of

389
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:22,500
how often he
uses this tactic

390
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,044
or he'll throw himself off...

391
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:27,464
He could easily lose track
and leave himself open.

392
00:18:27,464 --> 00:18:28,339
Here you go.

393
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:34,179
Not bad...

394
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,723
You were able to dodge
my attack by turning...

395
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:38,725
Well... Then how about this??!

396
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:40,059
Why'd he turn
his back to me??!

397
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:44,939
I got you now Hermit!

398
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:49,694
Why don't you give up, kid??!

399
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:53,531
He's entered
Berserker mode...

400
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:55,492
I guess it's
over for Hermit.

401
00:18:57,577 --> 00:19:00,079
Dodge them! C'mon...
Captain Tanimoto!

402
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,623
He can't...
The guy's too fast.

403
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:02,749
This is bad.

404
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:04,042
What's the matter, Hermit?!

405
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,794
This fight isn't
exciting anymore...

406
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:08,880
If all you do is block
it's gonna get boring.

407
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,091
None of these bastards
can keep up with me...

408
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:13,468
When am I gonna find
someone who's on my level??!

409
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:14,719
I thought you were the one

410
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,054
but it looks like
you've given up

411
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,430
just like the rest of them!

412
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,392
No way, it can't be...

413
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:22,977
Hermit has been defeated!

414
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:25,480
Hang on... I wouldn't go
and write him off just yet.

415
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,527
You're a dead!

416
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:41,955
Just as I planned.

417
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:43,790
You're predictable,
Berserker...

418
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,750
Whenever it comes time
for your last attack

419
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,418
you always do
something flashy...

420
00:19:47,418 --> 00:19:48,920
That's when you
leave yourself open.

421
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:51,840
You just stood there
and took the hits

422
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,383
until you saw an opening?

423
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:55,426
Most fighters wouldn't
choose to win that way.

424
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:56,761
Didn't I tell you.....?..?

425
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:59,514
You and I have different
ideas of what victory means.

426
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:00,723
It's obvious
that Hermit...

427
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:02,225
Is my brother's
disciple...

428
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:04,853
He has the same
style Sougetsu did.

429
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:06,521
Impressive...
It's a damn good style-

430
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:08,439
that kid's moves
are unbelievable...

431
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:11,442
One good hit and his opponent's
pretty much done for.

432
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:13,987
Well, he certainly won't
be able to stand anymore.

433
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:14,821
Think not??

434
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:31,796
Wow... His adrenaline's all
that's keeping him going...

435
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,381
He probably can't
even feel pain anymore.

436
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:39,220
He got close to him!

437
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,013
I see now...!

438
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:41,180
I bet he's gonna try to use

439
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,182
one of the Eight Deadly
punches on him!

440
00:20:43,182 --> 00:20:44,225
Once he's that close

441
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:45,768
his opponent can't
change their attack.

442
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,815
I suggest that you surrender

443
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,026
before this starts to
get ugly, Berserker...

444
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:55,403
You can't handle a
real martial artist.

445
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:56,863
I'm not giving up now...

446
00:20:56,863 --> 00:20:58,281
I'm having too much fun.

447
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:02,076
Yep... Definitely
a Hermit move...

448
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:04,078
He always wants to gowants
to go straight for the joints.

449
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,373
Dam... You Bastard!

450
00:21:07,373 --> 00:21:09,459
You may not think my
training is equivalent

451
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:10,710
to your natural talent...

452
00:21:12,587 --> 00:21:14,714
He attacked using
his dislocated elbow!

453
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:16,883
But I put everything
into my training.....!...

454
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:18,134
100 percent!

455
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:19,802
Don't you see that's
how this art form

456
00:21:19,802 --> 00:21:22,305
has been passed down
for thousands of years!

457
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:24,140
It's because in the
world of martial arts...

458
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:29,062
Hard work will always
surpass talent!

459
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:44,911
Yes!

460
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:50,083
Then again, I've
trained hard

461
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,835
but I also have
a natural talent.

462
00:21:52,835 --> 00:21:54,170
I'll tell you one thing...

463
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,214
Even if you had fought
against Shirahama

464
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,674
you still would've lost.

465
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,551
Bastard!

466
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:02,720
My body won't move.

467
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,222
I don't understand...

468
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:07,016
What... What is this
strange feeling??

469
00:22:07,016 --> 00:22:08,726
I never felt
anything like this.

470
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,357
That's what it feels
like to lose a fight.

471
00:22:14,357 --> 00:22:15,525
Al- right.....!...

472
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:17,360
He totally kicked ass!

473
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,528
I knew it.....!...

474
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:20,697
Just as I expected- he had
no problem defeating him.

475
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,162
My word... He's so strong...

476
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:29,831
Our boy's got
great friends.

477
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:31,165
Yeah.....!...
They're strong.....!...

478
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:32,583
Yeah.....!...
They're great.....!...

479
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,710
Yay!

480
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:40,466
Guess it's about time
for the main event.

481
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:41,509
Tag me out??

482
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:52,812
Aw man, that hurt!

483
00:22:52,812 --> 00:22:58,568

00:24:18,648 --> 00:24:20,650
I don't know why you're
so warped, Ryuto...

485
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,567
But I'm gonna
straighten you out!

486
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:22,944
Take off those glasses!

487
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:25,571
I can tell you've been
training hard, Kenichi.

488
00:24:25,571 --> 00:24:27,782
That's good- you wouldn't
last 5 seconds against me

489
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:28,699
if you hadn't.

490
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:31,119
Are you sure you want me
to take off my glasses??

491
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:31,869
What?

492
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:32,537
If I take them off

493
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,206
then you'll finally see
why they call me Odin.

494
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:36,666
Are you sure you're ready?

495
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,918
I trained really hard just
to be able to defeat you!

496
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:41,629
Your scare tactics aren't
gonna make me back down!

497
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:43,172
How foolish you are...

498
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:45,758
My fist is known as
the legendary spear...

499
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:47,552
I can't wait to
acquaint you with it.
