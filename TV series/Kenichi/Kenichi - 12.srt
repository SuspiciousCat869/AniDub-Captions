1
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:42,508
It's okay! Just let go!

2
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:55,021
You can't save me, kid!
You can't pull me up!

3
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:57,023
Please! I don't
want you to fall!

4
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:00,568
What are you doing?

5
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,452
What the hell is wrong
with the two of you?

6
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:11,496
You trying to get
yourselves killed?

7
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:20,046
What the hell? My arm...

8
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:21,756
I just moved it, didn't I?

9
00:02:21,756 --> 00:02:23,424
Yeah!

10
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:24,717
Your welcome.

11
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:27,720
So, you mean that
wasn't just a fluke?

12
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,139
You really think you
can heal it for me?

13
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,600
Sure, we can have you back
to normal in no time.

14
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,893
Shouldn't be too much trouble.

15
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:36,103
It's actually a rather
simple procedure.

16
00:02:36,103 --> 00:02:38,439
Is there anything that's
not simple to him?

17
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,067
You mean
"back to normal" as in...

18
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,819
You think I could box again?

19
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:50,034
Boxing? Don't be ridiculous.

20
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:52,370
When I'm done with you,
you'll be able to compete

21
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,372
in the world
arm-wrestling championship!

22
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,087
That joke was stupid
and completely tasteless!

23
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:02,421
Well taste this!

24
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:07,343
Hey I'm home.

25
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,850
Something seems to be
bothering the boy.

26
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,980
As his father it is my duty
to get to the bottom of this.

27
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,898
Honey can you give
me a hand with this,

28
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:23,442
the lid is stuck and I
can't seem to get it open.

29
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:24,652
Well of course my darling.

30
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:27,530
No need for you to trouble
yourself, leave it to me.

31
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,948
It's stuck!

32
00:03:28,948 --> 00:03:32,159
Come on you stupid
jar of tomato sauce!

33
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,911
Sweetheart, it isn't
that big a deal.

34
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:35,162
I said it's no problem!

35
00:03:35,162 --> 00:03:36,873
Maybe I should run
hot water over it.

36
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:37,957
Would you stop interrupting me?!

37
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:40,334
You're breaking
my concentration!

38
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:43,129
Wow. You know, you're
doing a damn good job

39
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,380
for a jar of
tomato sauce.

40
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,506
Right back at ya!

41
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:49,093
I'll just go grab another jar.

42
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:49,719
Here.

43
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,803
What?

44
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:54,891
Are you okay?

45
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:56,601
Yes. I'm fine.

46
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:00,730
Kenichi was always a weak kid,

47
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,732
when did he become stronger
than his own father?

48
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:06,110
I feel sad, happy, proud and
ashamed all at the same time!

49
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,487
I'm so conflicted, tomato sauce.

50
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:10,281
I know what ya' mean.

51
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:15,286
Okay I kinda get this. If a guy
wants to get a girl's attention,

52
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:17,413
then he needs to
be very assertive.

53
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:21,500
The stupid book doesn't say how
you tell her that you like her.

54
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,588
Besides Miu isn't the easiest
person in the world to approach.

55
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:30,176
I'd say something to
her at Ryozanpaku,

56
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:31,510
but we're both too busy working,

57
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,262
there isn't a lotta
time for chit-chat.

58
00:04:33,262 --> 00:04:35,723
if things stay the way they are,
then it's completely pointless

59
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:37,475
for me to keep going
there for training.

60
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,143
Here it comes!

61
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:42,230
That one time we went out it
didn't really go like I planned.

62
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,901
If I just had one more chance,
I know I could win her over!

63
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:48,069
Kenichi...

64
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,737
Whatcha reading,
can I have a look?

65
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:52,698
I'm not reading anything! How in
the world did you get in here?

66
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,575
Didn't anyone ever teach
you that you should knock,

67
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:55,451
you little twerp!

68
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,328
What is it?! Come
on let me see it!

69
00:04:57,328 --> 00:04:58,496
Secrets are no fun!

70
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:01,916
Get out of here you little
brat or I'll tell Mom!

71
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,709
Interesting, who
would've thought

72
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:07,880
that the goodbye is what makes
a successful first date.

73
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,383
Where did you come from?!

74
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:12,468
You're never going to get
anywhere if you keep

75
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:14,679
getting your advice from
these silly books!

76
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:17,014
Kenichi, you can't
learn to woo a woman

77
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:18,432
by reading a how-to book.

78
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:21,936
It's not a science
it's an art form!

79
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:24,188
Dad, you are so the
coolest guy ever!

80
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:25,439
No you don't understand,

81
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,275
without that book I won't
have any confidence!

82
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:29,026
C'mon you're
being ridiculous!

83
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:31,320
When I was a young man,
we were driven by passion

84
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,697
and not some stupid book!

85
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:35,449
I didn't even pursue your
mother, she came after me.

86
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:38,244
She bugged me until I
finally asked her out.

87
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:41,414
She used to write me romantic
letters every single day.

88
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:43,541
You wouldn't believe some
of the things she would say

89
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,960
in those notes--
they'd knock your socks off!

90
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:48,587
That's nice and all,

91
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:50,715
but I don't think
Miu's that type of girl.

92
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:53,426
You're still hung
up on Blondie?!

93
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:56,345
This was a good talk, son. Just
remember, if you're always

94
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:59,807
sincere and honest with your
lady you're on the right track!

95
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:04,895
So I should be
sincere and honest.

96
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:07,440
Yeah but Miu and I aren't even
boyfriend and girlfriend yet.

97
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,275
It's hopeless.

98
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:11,652
Well isn't that odd.
The way I remember it,

99
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:13,321
you were the one
writing the love letters

100
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:14,989
and begging me
to go out with you!

101
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:17,742
If you'd like, I can read them
aloud for the children so they

102
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:20,995
can see what kind of "manly"
guy their father really is!

103
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,581
Honey, cut me some
slack! I'm so sorry!

104
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,085
So the kid took Takeda out, huh?

105
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:29,337
That's right.

106
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:31,255
Did I call it or what?

107
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:33,090
That's what happens
when you send a boxer

108
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,134
to do a real fighters job!

109
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,846
Shut your mouth Tsuji.

110
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:41,974
If I wanted your opinion
I'd ask for it.

111
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:44,560
I'm impressed. The boy's
done well for himself.

112
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,354
He's lasted a lot longer
than I thought!

113
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:50,608
You're trying to expand
the gang, but that kid's

114
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:52,818
beating your people faster
than you can recruit them!

115
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:54,236
Executive member or not,

116
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:58,908
Tsuji has no right to speak to
Kisara with such disrespect!

117
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:01,452
This Kenichi kid, we've
got to do something,

118
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:03,162
we can't leave him
out on his own,

119
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:05,498
if he decides to join with some
other group besides Ragnarok,

120
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:07,124
that'll be a big problem for us!

121
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:09,043
Well, that's putting it mildly.

122
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:15,132
We need a new approach.

123
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:18,344
If he won't join us, then
I'll just have to kill him.

124
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:19,553
Wait just a second!

125
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:20,429
No.

126
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:22,598
I said wait!

127
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:24,642
Do you have a problem
with my plan?

128
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:28,020
No problem, just gimme a shot.

129
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,939
Let me handle this.

130
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:31,482
As I'm sure you are all aware,

131
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:33,234
the fence on the roof
has been damaged.

132
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:35,152
Now, it may be that
after 60 years,

133
00:07:35,152 --> 00:07:37,988
our campus is simply
falling apart, however,

134
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:42,618
just to be safe, from now on,
the rooftop is off-limits.

135
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:47,665
I hope you all try to be
more careful in the future.

136
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:48,249
Hey.

137
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:50,126
Weak-knee, I-I mean, Kenichi.

138
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:52,503
What's happening, can I
help you out with something?

139
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:56,090
Guys, we really need to talk.
It's about the other day.

140
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:00,719
I'm pretty sure it was
all my fault that you two

141
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:03,305
got dragged into what should
have been my fight.

142
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:05,474
So, I just wanted
to tell you both

143
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:06,934
that I'm sorry
for what happened.

144
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:08,936
Uh-huh...

145
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:10,187
What in the world is he up to?

146
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:12,606
I don't trust him. I bet
this is some kinda trap.

147
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:14,150
Normally in this
type of situation,

148
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,277
we would be the ones saying
we're sorry wouldn't we?

149
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:18,237
Because we ran away?

150
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:20,447
Is it possible that...

151
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:23,576
...he's really that stupid?

152
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:26,328
Or is he just a
genuinely good guy?!

153
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:29,623
Hey it's no big deal,
we're classmates aren't we?

154
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:30,916
That is such a relief!

155
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,710
So you guys really
do forgive me, right?

156
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,128
Uh, sure.

157
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:36,881
I can't tell you how much
that means to me, I was sure

158
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:39,216
you guys were gonna hold a
grudge against me forever!

159
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:40,426
Kenichi!

160
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:42,803
Okay, just give me a second,
and I'll be right there.

161
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:44,221
See you guys later!

162
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:54,244
Miu, listen,

163
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:56,330
there's something I really
need to talk to you about!

164
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,831
Talk is cheap!

165
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:03,962
Alright, the fight's
over, you're done.

166
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:10,218
Are you okay? Did I
kick you too hard?

167
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:11,511
No, it's no problem!

168
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:12,721
I'm okay.

169
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:15,057
If she's so worried, maybe
she should take it easy.

170
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:17,142
Now what was that you
were saying a second ago?

171
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:19,269
There's something you
wanted to talk to me about?

172
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:20,854
N-No! It was nothing!

173
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:23,190
Oh, okay then.

174
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,484
Well, I better run to the
kitchen and get dinner started.

175
00:09:25,484 --> 00:09:27,486
See you later.

176
00:09:27,486 --> 00:09:30,113
I couldn't do it,
I chickened out.

177
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:32,574
I really don't have any courage.

178
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:34,701
So you need my advice?

179
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:36,370
You can ask me about
whatever you want,

180
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,330
as long as it doesn't
involve money or women!

181
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,123
Yeah, I shoulda known.

182
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:42,084
Worthless.

183
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:47,005
Wow, that kinda hurt my
feelings a little bit...

184
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:50,509
What's that? You're having
relationship problems?

185
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:52,094
I must warn you,
this could become

186
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:54,221
a rather philosophical
discussion, is that alright?

187
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:55,347
Huh?

188
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:02,312
As you can see from this formula
love is very complicated.

189
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:05,107
Uh, thanks, this has
been very educational.

190
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:08,819
What the heck does
Copernicus have to do

191
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:10,904
with asking a girl out?

192
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:15,325
♪ Apapapapapa! ♪

193
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,786
I think we have a
new record. Wow. Go.

194
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:20,080
I just wish that there was
someone I could talk to

195
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,790
about this type of situation.

196
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,961
Someone with a
little experience.

197
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:28,672
Someone who really
understands women

198
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:29,631
Hold on!

199
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,299
What do you want?

200
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,759
Don't look at me like you think

201
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,886
I'm going to be a complete
waste of your time.

202
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:37,973
I'll have you know that I'm not
only a master of martial arts,

203
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:40,726
but I'm also an expert
in the art of love.

204
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:44,855
Wait! Just wait! Listen to me!
Seriously, women love me!

205
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:47,607
Now I might not look it,
but when I was a younger fella,

206
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:49,067
the ladies found me
completely irresistible

207
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:50,902
and considered to
be quite the hunk!

208
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,988
Back in the old days
people used to call me

209
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:54,364
the Don Juan of China!

210
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:55,490
Right...

211
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,452
Hey, wait just a second!
You scoff now,

212
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:00,078
but you'll be singing
a different tune

213
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:02,539
when you see this picture
of me from way back!

214
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:05,083
Y-You were a "pretty boy"?!

215
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,711
The years have been pretty
tough on you, haven't they?

216
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:11,923
I don't need your
pity young one.

217
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:14,259
But enough of that, if you
really want to take her

218
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:17,387
on a date you should just be
a man about it and ask her out.

219
00:11:17,387 --> 00:11:19,723
That's easy for you to say,
you're not doing the asking.

220
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:22,225
If it was a normal girl the
worst thing that could happen

221
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:24,144
is she might turn me
down, but with Miu,

222
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:26,897
I've got be extra careful
so she doesn't take me down!

223
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:28,148
Relationships are tough,

224
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:31,026
and it sounds like you
don't trust the girl--

225
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:33,862
then how can there be love?

226
00:11:33,862 --> 00:11:36,156
No, it's not that I don't
trust her, the real problem

227
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:38,575
is that I don't know her
as well as I'd like!

228
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:40,118
This special
edition's on sale.

229
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:41,578
Since you and I know each other,

230
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:44,206
I can give you a pretty good
deal. I take only cash.

231
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:46,541
Wait, you've been taking
secret photos of Miu?!

232
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,959
You made 'em into a book?!

233
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,377
How could you?!

234
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,379
What? You're upset?

235
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,465
I swear, people like you...

236
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:54,633
...make me so happy!

237
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:57,135
Thank you so much for doing
this, you really have no idea

238
00:11:57,135 --> 00:11:59,221
what this means to me!
I owe you big time!

239
00:11:59,221 --> 00:12:01,306
Please, don't mention it,
that's what sensei's are for!

240
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:03,600
If you're interested, I've got
one of Shigure on sale too?

241
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,478
Akisame did say that the key
to a successful relationship

242
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:09,564
is understanding as much as you
possibly can about your partner!

243
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:12,526
Hey! What are you
guys doing out here?

244
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:15,445
N-nothing! We started
talking about life!

245
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:16,947
What is it? What do you want?!

246
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:18,615
I don't know what your
plans are tomorrow.

247
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:21,159
I need to run to the grocery
store to pick up some stuff,

248
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:23,995
and I was wondering if you
might like to come with?

249
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:25,205
Huh?

250
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,220
Also, I'd like three pumpkins
and one watermelon please.

251
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,721
I'll take the biggest
one you've got!

252
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:44,224
You sure are a cute young
lady, why don't you go ahead

253
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:47,185
and take another melon with
you, it's on the house!

254
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:51,189
This sucks. She just wanted
me to carry her stuff!

255
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:52,607
I can't thank you enough!

256
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,318
If you weren't here to help,
I don't know what I would do.

257
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:58,530
No prob. Well, I've always
wondered how Atlas felt

258
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,866
and now, thanks to you,
I've got a pretty good idea!

259
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:03,243
Huh? You feel like
a book of maps?

260
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:05,996
In Greek Mythology, Atlas was
the titan who was condemned

261
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:08,540
to use his strength
to hold up the heavens.

262
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,043
But I guess the reference
was a little over her head.

263
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:14,337
I'm worried that I might have
gotten a little carried away

264
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:16,673
and bought more
stuff than we need.

265
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:18,800
What would give
her that impression?

266
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,137
I really appreciate this. Every
time I go grocery shopping,

267
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:24,014
I end up with more
than I can carry.

268
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:26,349
I ask the guys for help,
but Kensei and Akisame

269
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:29,436
are always too busy. Apachai
would eat everything before

270
00:13:29,436 --> 00:13:33,231
we could check out and Sakaki
won't buy anything but sake.

271
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:35,400
I see your problem.

272
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,735
Besides...

273
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:37,944
Huh?

274
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:39,696
Things have been
pretty crazy lately,

275
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:41,573
and we've been working
so hard, I feel like

276
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:43,658
you and I haven't really
had a chance to talk!

277
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:45,327
I feel the same way!

278
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:48,413
You're my first real friend and
I treasure our time together.

279
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:50,582
Our friendship
means a lot to me.

280
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:54,127
"Friendship", huh?
I guess that's a good start!

281
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:56,922
See? What did I say?
Didn't I tell you

282
00:13:56,922 --> 00:13:59,090
this was Blondie's
regular shopping route?

283
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,427
Yeah. You did a
good job. Thanks kid.

284
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:04,930
Hi! How's it hanging, Blondie?

285
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,015
Look man, we don't
want any trouble.

286
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:09,601
I'm impressed by your
dedication there, pal.

287
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:11,561
Never seen a fighter
work his weight training

288
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,188
into a shopping routine.

289
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:15,273
I need a minute of
your time, Shirahama.

290
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:17,859
I've got a little
proposition for ya.

291
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,861
Listen, we're kind
of busy right now,

292
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:21,821
so go find someone
else to pick on!

293
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,698
Don't worry about
your girlfriend,

294
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:25,283
my guys won't touch her.

295
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:26,826
I'm not worried about her.

296
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:29,537
If I don't do something,
Miu's gonna annihilate them!

297
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,790
I wanna talk to you
alone, man-to-man.

298
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,042
No distractions.

299
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,543
Go home little girl.

300
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:38,004
Hey! Wait just a second,
that wasn't the plan.

301
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:39,673
You said we were gonna
deal with Kenichi

302
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:40,715
then I'd get Blondie!

303
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:42,425
Why don't you get lost!

304
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:43,885
I've got what I needed
from you kid

305
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:46,805
so get outta my sight before I
decide to teach you a lesson!

306
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:51,810
But you promised I'd
get a shot at the girl!

307
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,728
Nobody tricks me!

308
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:56,815
Bad move, kid!

309
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:59,234
Time for me to take
out the garbage!

310
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:01,027
Here goes!

311
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:04,990
Did you see that?!

312
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,284
The guy grabbed his kick
and then threw him right off!

313
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:09,411
I just remembered that I
was supposed to take out

314
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:10,954
the garbage yesterday
and I completely forgot!

315
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:15,250
Is that really what you're
concerned about right now?

316
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,669
You're not afraid. You're
a real man, aren't ya?

317
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:18,795
Take a walk with me.

318
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:21,256
I think it's time you show
me what you're made of.

319
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:28,096
Hello! Give Apachai your money,

320
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:29,389
and he teach you
how to fight!

321
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:31,182
Apachai, how many
times have I told you

322
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:32,684
that's no way to
answer the phone?

323
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:34,561
You're gonna give
people the wrong idea.

324
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:35,478
Listen up okay?

325
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:38,523
Kenichi is in serious danger.
Oh no they're getting away!

326
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:39,816
I-I'm gonna leave the groceries

327
00:15:39,816 --> 00:15:41,526
sitting in front of the
corner store, alright?

328
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:43,653
I need you to swing
by and pick them up!

329
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:44,946
I've got to go help Kenichi!

330
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:46,531
Got it! Be right there!

331
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:48,825
Miu says groceries in trouble.

332
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,827
What? My watermelon?

333
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:52,203
No!

334
00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:57,083
Where'd they go?
Which way should I turn?

335
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,668
To the right
or to the left?

336
00:15:58,668 --> 00:15:59,794
To the right!

337
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:02,380
Hey that sounded like
Kensei's voice, how weird.

338
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,340
What are you doing back
there with a camera?!

339
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,634
Admiring the view!

340
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:07,927
Why're you here anyway?!

341
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:10,096
I've been following you
since this morning.

342
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:13,516
I heard this was a date so I
wanted to see what would happen!

343
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:20,065
And to think you just used
him to haul your groceries!

344
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:23,109
I actually feel sorry for
Kenichi, getting his hopes up!

345
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:28,490
Of course he doesn't stand
a chance against that fella

346
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,784
with the crazy hair,
he just isn't strong enough.

347
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:31,951
Oh no!

348
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:33,661
Come on, we have
to go after them!

349
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:35,997
And what will you do when
you catch up to them?

350
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:37,707
Are you going to keep
fighting Kenichi's fights

351
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:40,001
for him or let
him be a man?

352
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:42,420
You're not doing him
any favors, you know.

353
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,089
Too much support can hurt him.

354
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:46,633
If you keep bailing him out
he'll start to rely on it.

355
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:49,260
What happens when he has to
fight and you're not there?

356
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,430
Yeah, but I can't just
stand back and do nothing.

357
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,681
Of course not!

358
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:56,810
Let's follow them and see
how well he does on his own.

359
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:00,271
There they are!

360
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:04,901
What slow pokes! The Kids these
days have the weakest legs!

361
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,403
Let's give him a chance
to win the fight on his own

362
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:09,489
and if things get really
bad, we'll help him out.

363
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:11,408
Are you saying that you
would come with me

364
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:12,534
and help rescue him?

365
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:15,161
I'm worried too 'cause he's
the best disciple we've got.

366
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:17,622
Well, technically speaking
he's the only one we've got,

367
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:19,290
but that's beside the point.

368
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:26,417
I'm not gonna beat
around the bush here.

369
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:29,587
I want you to be
part of my crew!

370
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:31,381
Word on the street is
that Kisara's people

371
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:33,049
have been causing
you problems lately.

372
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:36,719
And from what I hear, they're
planning to take you down.

373
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,930
I'm here 'cause I wanna
offer you protection.

374
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,517
If you join me and my gang those
punks'll never touch you again.

375
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:44,018
So, whadda ya say?

376
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:46,479
I could really use a guy
like you on my team.

377
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,023
I'll take good care
of you, I promise.

378
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:51,442
I don't understand, what
exactly do you want from me?

379
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,152
Isn't it obvious?

380
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:55,571
A man's value is determined
by the number of people

381
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:58,950
he's in command of. I'm gonna
keep expanding my personal army,

382
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,827
so that in the end,
I'll be in charge

383
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:02,996
of the most powerful
group in Ragnarok!

384
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:05,915
And what do you plan on doing
after you've made it to the top,

385
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:07,792
huh? What about once you
graduate from high school?

386
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,919
You can't be a delinquent
forever, you know.

387
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,629
Eventually you and all
of your thug friends

388
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:14,298
are gonna have to grow
up and get real jobs!

389
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:29,522
Come on Boss, take it easy!
Just calm down, okay?

390
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,524
My men and I don't need
your clever logic!

391
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,568
There's no way you
could ever understand

392
00:18:33,568 --> 00:18:35,695
that a man's greatest desire
in his life is freedom.

393
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:39,198
Everything that my men
and I do is about being free.

394
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:41,617
I can understand that, but
if you're harming people

395
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:43,578
to get your way then
that's not right!

396
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:45,288
You and your gang are
running around town

397
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:46,956
enjoying your "freedom" but
all you're really doing

398
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:48,750
is causing other people pain.

399
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,168
That's not freedom!

400
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:52,670
Don't you see?
That's tyranny!

401
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:57,300
Come on, Boss let's
get out of here!

402
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,843
The little punk's not
worth your trouble!

403
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:00,678
I don't care what you say.

404
00:19:00,678 --> 00:19:03,056
I'm not gonna join your gang.

405
00:19:03,056 --> 00:19:05,808
Did I say you could go?

406
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:07,852
You're not leaving
here without a fight!

407
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:11,939
Give it up! I'm not
gonna fight you!

408
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:14,734
Wrong! You insulted
our way of life,

409
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,402
and called me out
in front of my boys.

410
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:17,862
Since I can't beat
you with words,

411
00:19:17,862 --> 00:19:19,906
I'll just have to fight
you with my fists!

412
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:22,408
Ever since back in the day,
men have decided who was right

413
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:23,993
by settling their disagreements
with a fight.

414
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:25,870
You don't have any
problems with that do you?

415
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,705
You know, it's
guys like this tool

416
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:30,124
that give all men a bad name.

417
00:19:30,124 --> 00:19:32,251
Listen, we can settle
this without violence.

418
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:34,128
Say what? I guess
your fists don't work

419
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:35,421
as well as your mouth does.

420
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:37,757
I shoulda figured
you for a coward!

421
00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:40,384
Oh no, crazy hair guy
called him a coward!

422
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:44,347
I may be a lot of things,
but a coward's not one of them!

423
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:45,890
Now that's the
attitude I like.

424
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,518
And it really is a shame, if you
weren't so damn stubborn,

425
00:19:48,518 --> 00:19:50,311
we could have been fighting
on the same side, kid.

426
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:52,939
Save your breath cause
you're wasting your time.

427
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:55,942
You can kill me for all I care,
but I'll never join you losers!

428
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:57,652
I wish he wouldn't say
things like that!

429
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,112
It'll just make 'em madder!

430
00:19:59,112 --> 00:20:01,197
You know I should probably
get this on tape.

431
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:03,032
I'm betting that he'll
wanna see this later!

432
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,992
Let's go, bring it on!

433
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:08,621
You sure like to
talk dontcha, kid?

434
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:09,872
Well, it's gettin' old.

435
00:20:09,872 --> 00:20:12,416
Why dontcha let me show you how
a real man settles an argument?

436
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,668
Ya think you can handle it?

437
00:20:13,668 --> 00:20:15,962
You really are an idiot!
You're picking a fight with me

438
00:20:15,962 --> 00:20:17,213
'cause you can't
win an argument?

439
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:18,714
Maybe you should spend
more time reading

440
00:20:18,714 --> 00:20:19,799
instead of hitting the gym!

441
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,092
Nobody talks to me like that!

442
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:23,761
You-you're the freakin'
idiot, sissy-boy!

443
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,263
I bet you're so scared right now

444
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:27,348
that you're about to piss
your pants, huh, sissy-boy?

445
00:20:27,348 --> 00:20:29,058
Shut up and don't
call me a sissy.

446
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:31,394
Is that the best you can
come up with, ya moron?

447
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:33,312
What did you just
call me? A moron?

448
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:34,814
Yeah, you heard what I said.

449
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:37,358
You can kiss my ass!
Kiss it right here!

450
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:39,068
I can't believe that
he has the guts

451
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:40,778
to talk down to the
boss that way!

452
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:43,489
That kid either has a death wish
or he's dumber than he looks!

453
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:44,949
No way this is gonna end well!

454
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:46,200
He'll be lucky if he lives.

455
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,286
This could really get nasty,
no one has ever survived

456
00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:50,538
after calling the boss
names like that before!

457
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:54,292
What's with this guy?
He's leaving himself wide open.

458
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,464
I'm gonna make you regret the
day you ever messed with me!

459
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,636
You're mine!

460
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:11,767
Who's the moron now, pansy?

461
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:23,195
Way to go, Kenichi!

462
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,822
Boss, are you gonna be okay?

463
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:29,952
Not bad, that one kinda stung.

464
00:21:29,952 --> 00:21:32,246
You like that? Plenty more
where that came from!

465
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:35,583
Now it's my turn!
You're gonna pay for that kid!

466
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:38,920
Keep it up Kenichi!

467
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:43,090
You're gonna bleed!

468
00:21:46,761 --> 00:21:49,055
I'm impressed Shirahama.
That wasn't half bad!

469
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:51,682
Even though Kenichi's not
as trained as crazy hair guy,

470
00:21:51,682 --> 00:21:53,601
he's doing a great job
of staying in it.

471
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:55,603
In my experience,
the outcome of a fight

472
00:21:55,603 --> 00:21:58,606
isn't always determined
by ability alone.

473
00:21:58,606 --> 00:22:01,192
You're doing great, Kenichi,
don't give up on me yet.

474
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:02,693
Come on over
here, little buddy!

475
00:22:02,693 --> 00:22:05,863
I'll give you one more good
shot right in the face!

476
00:22:05,863 --> 00:22:08,699
Aw, what's the matter?

477
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:12,453
What are ya chicken? Come on, go
ahead and take your best shot!

478
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:14,538
What's the deal with this guy?

479
00:22:14,538 --> 00:22:16,791
I knew you couldn't do it!

480
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,876
You're a coward,
that's all you are!

481
00:22:32,473 --> 00:22:33,766
What the hell?!

482
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:36,310
It feels like I broke my hand!

483
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,814
At this point, I think it's safe
to say Kenichi's in big trouble!

484
00:24:19,747 --> 00:24:22,041
Come on, Kenichi!
Get up and fight me!

485
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,584
You are a man, aren't you?

486
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:25,961
I'll admit that was
a pretty good punch!

487
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:28,839
After that beating I gave
you your still talkin' smack?

488
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:31,050
That's exactly why I
wanted you in my gang,

489
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,384
you're an impressive fighter.

490
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:34,762
But even though you're skilled,
you're not quite perfect.

491
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:36,639
You have a fatal weakness
in your fighting style.

492
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:37,515
Weakness?!

493
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:39,141
The way you fight
is too "proper",

494
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:40,684
you stick too close to the book!

495
00:24:40,684 --> 00:24:42,478
Fighting is all about following
your natural instincts!

496
00:24:42,478 --> 00:24:43,521
You don't have a chance!

497
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:45,731
Shut up! This fight
isn't over yet!

498
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:48,192
I'm not giving up! Let's go!
