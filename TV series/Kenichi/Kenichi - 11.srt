1
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,793
Would ya quit
throwin' 'em around?

2
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:43,712
I don't really feel
like burying them.

3
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:46,757
Shut up! Your stupid plan
didn't work did it, Takeda?

4
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:49,301
From now on we're doing
things my way, you got that?

5
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:53,013
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna
do. Just try and stop me!

6
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,640
Please, I'm sorry,
just let me go!

7
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,017
Fine, blow off some
steam if you have to.

8
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,685
Let him go!

9
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,485
I'm the one you want,
now let them go!

10
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:09,571
Hey, there he is.
What did I tell ya?

11
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:13,116
He's definitely an idiot.

12
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:14,785
Aren't you Mr. Nice Guy?

13
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:17,287
Coming up here to save your
pathetic little friends.

14
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:18,956
Maybe you should
have thought twice.

15
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:20,874
'Cause your nice guy act,

16
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,086
just landed you a
whole lot of trouble.

17
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:25,420
That look...

18
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,713
It's so cold.

19
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,383
About a month ago our boss
asked us to find you.

20
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,884
We've been searching
for you since.

21
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,845
We're taking you to Kisara.

22
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:35,514
But considering the
chase you've led us on,

23
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:38,725
we can't ask you to come along
with us peacefully now can we?

24
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,893
You blew it.

25
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,228
Please, just let me go.

26
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,480
There's no reason for us
to resort to violence.

27
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,191
I can think of 100 reasons,
here's a few for ya:

28
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:49,069
you've wasted our time
and I think it'll be fun!

29
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,826
Well? What's the deal, Ukita?

30
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:58,453
C'mon are you gonna
throw the kid or not?

31
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:00,455
Alright then, hold on!

32
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:08,213
You worthless, little brat.

33
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:10,966
You signed your own death
certificate with that stunt.

34
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:11,967
Whoa, hey, man!

35
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,219
Why don't we just try
to talk this out--

36
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,600
As soon as you
get close enough,

37
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,977
you grab them by the
head and finish it!

38
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:32,821
Did I really just do that?
My body moved on its own!

39
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:41,913
You can attack me with
any style you've got.

40
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:43,373
Anything goes, alright?

41
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:46,251
Ten counts for a knockout,
three knockouts and it's over.

42
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:48,670
So basically if you down
three times in one round

43
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,298
then you lose by a K.O., got it?

44
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,092
He's laughing.
He thinks this is a joke.

45
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:57,638
The only way I'll make
it out alive is if I win!

46
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,182
I really hope that
Muay Thai training pays off.

47
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,064
And he's down!

48
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:11,401
So are you gonna get up
or should I start counting?

49
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:12,611
One...

50
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:14,279
What just happened?

51
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,531
How the hell
did he do that?

52
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:20,202
He managed to hit me
three times, but how!

53
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:21,995
I've gotta land
a punch somehow.

54
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,705
Otherwise I'm a dead man!

55
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:33,131
Looks like someone's taken
a couple Karate lessons.

56
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:34,466
Bring it kid.

57
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,550
You got it!

58
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,932
You've got enthusiasm,
but you don't have grace

59
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:43,767
or speed to pull the moves off.

60
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,560
He's not quite as
skilled as Miu.

61
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,813
But I still can't get close
enough to touch him!

62
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:51,900
Not only are his punches fast,
but his defense is flawless!

63
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,443
I've gotta slow him down!

64
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:57,280
There's no way!

65
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:06,164
I can't! There's no
way I can beat him.

66
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:12,587
And that makes number two.
One more and it's over for you.

67
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:17,217
You come to your senses yet?

68
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,303
All this trouble 'cause
of your stupid friends.

69
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:22,055
Tell me.

70
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,016
Was it worth all
this to save them?

71
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:27,602
I feel like I'm
about to pass out.

72
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:29,604
What did Apachai say?

73
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:31,648
I can't remember...

74
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:33,316
Don't worry, you
tried your best.

75
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:34,359
You just weren't quite ready...

76
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,277
What was it?

77
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:37,696
To fight a boxer.

78
00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:38,739
Boxer...

79
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,283
That's it! I remember now!

80
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:43,118
A boxer's greatest weakness!

81
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:46,371
You can still
stand up straight.

82
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:48,999
I'm impressed.

83
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:51,084
This is my only
chance to stop him.

84
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:55,172
Ti-lan!

85
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:01,762
A low kick? What the hell?

86
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,855
He faked me out
and I fell for it.

87
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:13,899
I didn't think he was
gonna attack my knee.

88
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,234
Was he just pretending
to be an amateur?

89
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:24,201
His lower body strength
is incredible!

90
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:26,578
He obviously knows
more than just karate,

91
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:27,996
but how much does he know?

92
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:31,500
And where the hell
did he learn it?

93
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,503
A boxer's weakness
is his lower body!

94
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,426
It worked! Apachai!

95
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:43,553
The ti-lan! It worked!

96
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,894
Not bad.

97
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:58,276
He didn't have time to react!

98
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:02,114
He seems so slow
all of the sudden!

99
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:03,323
This is...

100
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,783
...it!

101
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,959
What's wrong with you?

102
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,086
Why'd you stop like that?

103
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:19,172
The bell rang. That's a
three-minute break, right?

104
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,465
Say what?!

105
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,722
You know, you really
are a dumbass, kid.

106
00:07:27,722 --> 00:07:29,266
What?

107
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:30,517
The break's one minute.

108
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,561
You only wish you
had more time to rest.

109
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:33,937
Yeah, whatever.

110
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:43,154
It's probably a good idea
for you to sit down.

111
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:45,866
You can't recover
while you're standing.

112
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,410
What makes you think I need
to recover from anything?

113
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,245
Try not to flatter
yourself, amateur.

114
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,872
Save your breath for fighting.

115
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,915
Damn. Who am I kidding?

116
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:56,960
If I sat down now, I'd never
be able to get back up again.

117
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,919
What now?

118
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,173
There's no way I can withstand
another one of his low kicks.

119
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:04,551
Kenichi Shirahama...

120
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:10,056
There's a lot more to you
than I thought there was.

121
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:36,541
Hey, Apachai, what are
you doing to that tree?

122
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:45,133
Apachai is putting up
a good luck charm

123
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,510
to protect Kenichi for
a safe return to the dojo.

124
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,305
The happy, smiling straw
doll is a little Kenichi,

125
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:51,973
and the nails are good fortune.

126
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:53,225
That's nice...

127
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:55,936
So tell me, did Shigure
teach you this voodoo--

128
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,103
I mean, good luck charm?

129
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,147
A-hem.

130
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:01,274
So the others are worried
about Kenichi too.

131
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,318
Something just
doesn't feel right.

132
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,669
He's really stuck to his word.

133
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:21,546
He hasn't used his left
arm this entire time.

134
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:24,383
He's a pretty honest
guy, for a thug.

135
00:09:24,383 --> 00:09:25,717
You kidding me?!

136
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:28,720
He obliterated that
chalk with one punch!

137
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,807
You do realize that I was
a professional boxer right?

138
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:33,016
But I'll go easy on you.

139
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:35,686
I'm gonna take you on
using only my right arm.

140
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:38,855
So, um, I don't mean to pry,
but can I ask you a question?

141
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:39,773
I guess.

142
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:43,819
I was wondering, why did you
decide to give up boxing?

143
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:46,905
Not shy about bringing up
touchy subjects, are you?

144
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:50,951
Learn some tact, man. You could
lose your friends that way.

145
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:53,245
I'm sorry. Forget
I mentioned it.

146
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:55,080
It's too late,
you already asked.

147
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,791
Besides, maybe it'd do you
some good to lose a few.

148
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,794
I mean, all they're gonna do is
abandon you to save themselves.

149
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:02,129
Hey wait up!

150
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,259
I'll tell ya what happened.

151
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,886
Everyone could use a cautionary
tale about friendship.

152
00:10:09,886 --> 00:10:13,515
Friends are good for nothing
but heartache and pain.

153
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:15,183
You're better off without them.

154
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,854
I don't wanna brag or
anything but at one time,

155
00:10:18,854 --> 00:10:22,733
I had a pretty promising
future as a boxer ahead of me.

156
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:26,069
Lookin' good, man.
You're wailin' on that bag.

157
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:28,780
Hey thanks. You wanna try it?

158
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,949
Ikeshita was my
closest friend.

159
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:32,826
We started boxing
at the same time

160
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:35,454
and we trained side
by side the whole way.

161
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:37,330
We went through hell together.

162
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,584
Without him, I doubt I could
have made it on my own.

163
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:43,587
I'm headin' to the gym.
You should be too.

164
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:47,883
--Hey?
--What the hell?!

165
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:48,842
What's up Ikeshita?

166
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:51,970
What's goin' on? Are you there?!

167
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,597
Hang on, man!

168
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,978
To be honest with you, I wasn't
sure about going to help him.

169
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:01,813
I had an important
match the next day

170
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:04,316
and I knew I'd be screwed
if I were to get injured.

171
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:07,027
I had to make a choice between
my career and my friend.

172
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:14,117
Time's up. Break's over.

173
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:18,580
Wait! Hold on! I wanna hear
the rest of your story!

174
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:25,212
You really need me
to finish it for ya?

175
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:27,547
I think you can pretty much
guess how it turns out.

176
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:29,382
Yeah, but your story
doesn't involve

177
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:31,092
me getting punched in the face.

178
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:34,846
Remember his weakness,
go for the lower body.

179
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:37,390
If I keep kicking low,
he'll fall eventually.

180
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:48,610
Fine, let him dodge them.

181
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,488
I've just gotta stay focused
on attacking his lower body.

182
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:56,201
Did he really think
I wouldn't anticipate

183
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:58,203
a wide-open high kick?

184
00:11:58,203 --> 00:12:00,163
You'll have to do better
than that, kid.

185
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:07,838
I can't believe
how fast he is.

186
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:09,589
I couldn't see a single punch!

187
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:11,341
Oh, man, what now?

188
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:17,514
Whoa-ho! You scared me
there, that was a fast one!

189
00:12:17,514 --> 00:12:18,765
I thought I was a goner!

190
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:21,226
That was so fast I
didn't even see it!

191
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:23,144
In that case, watch your
opponent's shoulder

192
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:24,437
and guess the speed.

193
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:28,358
I think it's about time
I finish you off.

194
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:31,570
If this keeps up much longer my
legs are gonna give out on me.

195
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,158
How's he predicting my punches?

196
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:38,577
Clever little brat.

197
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:45,917
Now I understand why
everybody was so worried

198
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,836
about me fighting a boxer.

199
00:12:51,214 --> 00:12:52,799
Never thought I would say this,

200
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,926
but thank goodness for
Apachai's training.

201
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:57,804
Without it, this guy would've
killed me the second we started.

202
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:02,893
Alright, enough
with the suspense.

203
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:05,020
You decided to help
your friend, didn't you?

204
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,646
Just drop it.

205
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:16,239
Of course I went to help him
but it was a stupid decision.

206
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:18,283
It cost me my career.

207
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:30,587
Stop! Ikeshita, you alright?

208
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:31,713
Huh?

209
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:34,382
Hey, 'bout time!

210
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:58,698
How you holdin'
up there, Ikeshita?

211
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:02,535
I think I'll live but there
sure were a lot of 'em.

212
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:04,245
They outnumbered us ten to two

213
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:06,039
but we managed
to fight them off.

214
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,624
I'm sure you already
figured this out,

215
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:11,127
but I didn't make it to
the match the next day.

216
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:15,215
And I haven't stepped
inside the ring since then.

217
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:16,967
My boxing career was over.

218
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:19,719
I threw everything away
to help a friend.

219
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:23,014
Ikeshita, on the other hand...

220
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:24,891
He went on to realize
both of our dreams

221
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:26,977
and became a
professional contender.

222
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:36,277
Yo, Ikeshita!

223
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:38,154
I hear you've been doing
alright for yourself.

224
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:40,115
Oh, hey. What's up?

225
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:42,492
Sorry I'm in the middle
of practice right now.

226
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:50,208
And there it is.
Pretty pathetic, isn't it?

227
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,960
You know something, kid.

228
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:55,213
It makes me sick to see
how naĂŻve you are.

229
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:56,798
Don't you realize
it's all a lie?

230
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:58,758
I'm the closest thing
to a friend you've got

231
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:00,677
'cause I'm trying
to show you the truth.

232
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:05,807
Isn't it obvious those
guys you came to save

233
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,309
don't give a damn about you?

234
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,060
They ditched you the
first chance they got.

235
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,770
So tell me, was it worth it?

236
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:24,576
No...

237
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:25,910
You're wrong.

238
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:30,707
I didn't come up here
just to save them.

239
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:31,875
I came here for myself.

240
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,294
And that's all
that really matters.

241
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:36,838
Really?

242
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,757
I wasn't going
to abandon them.

243
00:15:38,757 --> 00:15:40,925
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

244
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:41,926
I don't really care

245
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:44,179
whether those guys
appreciate it or not.

246
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:46,514
I won't let you hurt
them because of me.

247
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:47,557
Oh yeah?!

248
00:15:47,557 --> 00:15:48,933
Don't give up on everyone

249
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:50,727
just 'cause your
friend turned on you!

250
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:51,978
Shut up!

251
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:58,109
A true friend would
help out with no regrets.

252
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:15,293
I've got you! You've
gotta pull yourself up!

253
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:17,587
But, I can't do that!

254
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:41,969
Pansies are developed
from the viola tricolor,

255
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,346
also known as
the Heartsease.

256
00:16:44,346 --> 00:16:46,473
Pretty fascinating, huh?

257
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,891
Okay, this is weird.

258
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:50,811
Class is almost over and
Kenichi's still not back.

259
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,938
Something must've happened.

260
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:57,735
He had a strange look on his
face after he read that note.

261
00:16:57,735 --> 00:17:00,613
Maybe I should read it just
to figure out what's up.

262
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:04,116
No, I better not. I shouldn't
read it without his permission.

263
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,754
Can I please use the
bathroom, like right now?!

264
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:19,590
It's obviously an
emergency. Go ahead.

265
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,467
What'd you kids have for lunch?

266
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:26,680
I hope I can make it in time!

267
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:31,018
I could really use
a little help here!

268
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:32,978
The match is over,
pull yourself up!

269
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:35,481
Now would be a good time
to use your left arm!

270
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:38,734
What? You're not very good at
picking up on context clues.

271
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:41,195
Just grab my arm!
Come on, hurry!

272
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:43,906
I can't! My left
arm is paralyzed.

273
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:45,824
It happened that night
I helped my friend.

274
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,993
A guy hit me and my
arm just went numb.

275
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:49,703
I've lost all feeling in it.

276
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:56,585
I didn't give up boxing
because I wanted to!

277
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:58,462
I physically can't do it now!

278
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:02,257
Just let me go!

279
00:18:02,257 --> 00:18:04,009
You'll fall too if you don't!

280
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:09,014
Don't be stupid! There's no
reason for both of us to die!

281
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:11,266
Let go of me and save yourself!

282
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:21,735
What the--

283
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:24,113
Alright, who was that?!

284
00:18:24,113 --> 00:18:25,656
There must've been someone!

285
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:28,951
I don't have time
for this right now.

286
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:30,452
Hang on, Kenichi!

287
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:34,790
It's okay! Just let go!

288
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:47,261
You can't save me, kid!
You can't pull me up!

289
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:49,346
Please! I don't
want you to fall!

290
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:52,766
What are you doing?

291
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:01,608
What the hell is wrong
with the two of you?

292
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,610
You trying to get
yourselves killed?

293
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:11,577
Kenichi!

294
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,752
Oh that's it. I'm mad now...

295
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:21,378
Why you!

296
00:19:21,378 --> 00:19:24,339
Hey! Hold on girly!

297
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:26,592
Whoa! Why are you
attacking me? I--

298
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:37,061
We need your help!

299
00:19:37,061 --> 00:19:39,229
Oh, Miu! I wondered
where you were.

300
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:43,275
Well, she assumed the worst
and went a little overboard.

301
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:45,903
No she assumed the worst
and kicked the crap out of us.

302
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:47,613
I think I've
fallen in love.

303
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:50,449
Hey, I bet you would've done
the same thing if you were me.

304
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:51,825
So there.

305
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:56,163
Alright, then. Now that I've
finished treating Kenichi,

306
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:59,792
and your buddy over there seems
to be resting peacefully...

307
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:03,086
That just leaves
you, I suppose.

308
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:06,048
I'm assuming you're the boxer
I've heard so much about.

309
00:20:06,048 --> 00:20:08,092
Um, yeah.

310
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:11,136
I'm fine. Don't worry about
me, I can take a few bruises.

311
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:12,930
I'm not worried
about those injuries

312
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,932
but I am interested
in the other one.

313
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:15,891
What?

314
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:18,435
I'm referring to your
paralyzed left arm.

315
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:19,394
How did you know?

316
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:21,605
No one's mentioned it
since we've been here.

317
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:23,524
I'm a professional.

318
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:33,283
You must have had
a lousy doctor.

319
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:36,411
From what I can tell, they only
treated the fractured bone.

320
00:20:38,497 --> 00:20:40,958
However, they were too
incompetent to realize that your

321
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,585
nerves were being compressed by
your disjointed spinal column,

322
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:46,213
which is why you
can't move your arm.

323
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:47,714
That's enough!

324
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:55,639
What then hell? My arm...

325
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:57,307
I just moved it, didn't I?

326
00:20:57,307 --> 00:20:58,934
Yeah!

327
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:00,227
You're welcome.

328
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:03,230
So, you mean that
wasn't just a fluke?

329
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,607
You really think you
can heal it for me?

330
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:08,152
Sure, we can have you back
to normal in no time.

331
00:21:08,152 --> 00:21:09,486
Shouldn't be too much trouble.

332
00:21:09,486 --> 00:21:11,738
It's actually a rather
simple procedure.

333
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,116
Is there anything that's
not simple to him?

334
00:21:14,116 --> 00:21:16,618
You mean,
"back to normal" as in...

335
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:18,370
You think I could box again?

336
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,789
Boxing? Don't be ridiculous.

337
00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:27,921
When I'm done with you,
you'll be able to compete

338
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,965
in the world
arm-wrestling championship!

339
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:34,678
Yeah!

340
00:21:38,223 --> 00:21:39,808
I don't know how he did it,

341
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:42,477
but Kenichi managed to make
it through another day.

342
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:44,229
Apachai so happy!

343
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:47,190
The good lucky doll Shigure
showed me brought him home safe!

344
00:21:54,197 --> 00:21:55,657
Now that everybody's rejoiced,

345
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:57,784
let's continue
with the treatment.

346
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,037
This is going to hurt a little,
but just try to relax.

347
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:01,079
On the count of three.

348
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,289
Right.

349
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:04,166
One, two--

350
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,710
You said on three!

351
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,921
Oh, I did? I must
have lost count.

352
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:11,715
It doesn't hurt as much if
he can catch you off guard.

353
00:22:11,715 --> 00:22:13,717
Let's move on to
the second round.

354
00:22:13,717 --> 00:22:15,719
Wait, wait, hold on sec!

355
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:19,097
So, how many times am I gonna
have to go through with this?

356
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:21,934
I created this method for
the sake of expediency.

357
00:22:21,934 --> 00:22:27,064
So, it shouldn't take much
longer than another 786 times.

358
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:30,943
Just hang in there, man!
The pain is totally worth it!

359
00:22:30,943 --> 00:22:32,319
You're gonna be
able to box again!

360
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,196
You're almost there,
you can do it!

361
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:35,322
Almost there?!

362
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:37,324
He's gonna do this
785 more times!

363
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:38,825
This is insane...

364
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:42,287
Just two hours ago I was ready
to fight this guy to the death!

365
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:46,541
Now here I am cheering him on!
It's amazing what can happen.

366
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,503
I still don't
really get it, but...

367
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:52,923
You can do it Takeda! You'll
be boxing again in no time!

368
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:22,804
That guy with the crazy hair,
what was his name again? Tsuji?

369
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:24,181
Well, he looks pretty tough.

370
00:24:24,181 --> 00:24:26,558
I don't know if Kenichi is
strong enough to handle him yet.

371
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:27,267
You're right!

372
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:28,894
I better find him
before it's too late!

373
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:30,604
And what are you going
to do when you find him?

374
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:33,106
Beat him up so Kenichi doesn't
have anything to worry about?

375
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:34,983
Well, That was the plan.

376
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:37,903
Listen, Miu, you can't fight
Kenichi's battles for him.

377
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:40,238
That'll hurt him more
than any opponent would.

378
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:42,365
It's difficult for a
fighter to become stronger

379
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:44,117
if he isn't able
to defend himself.

380
00:24:44,117 --> 00:24:46,870
Yeah but have you seen
him try to defend himself?

381
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,330
He's so dead.
