1
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:40,737
Man this sucks.

2
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:43,114
How much longer I'm gonna
have to sneak around like this?

3
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:44,949
You just need a
little more training.

4
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:47,118
Once you are able to show
those bullies who's boss,

5
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:48,578
you'll be able to relax.

6
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:50,914
Hold on, so you saying,

7
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:53,208
I can't relax 'til I've fought
every bully in school?

8
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,585
Yup, that about sums it up.

9
00:01:55,585 --> 00:01:57,712
They haven't been able
to find us up here yet,

10
00:01:57,712 --> 00:01:59,339
so you can relax a little.

11
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:04,177
You can run, but you
can't hide, Kenichi.

12
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:07,388
But the worst of your worries
is another senior, Takeda Ikki.

13
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:10,225
Not only is he ruthless, but
he's a former lightweight boxer.

14
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,601
He's a boxer?

15
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:14,395
Yep, he's a professional
fighter. Word is that he was

16
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:16,481
the premiere rookie until he
dropped out of the league.

17
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:18,608
What's a guy like that doing
fighting for Ragnarok?!

18
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:20,902
But I'm still an executive
member, and you're just a grunt.

19
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:23,112
Say hello punk.

20
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:25,949
I said hello to the
one who matters.

21
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:29,285
Oh yeah? You really think you're
pretty slick, don't you?

22
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:35,959
You sure are jumpy, I was
just stretching my arm.

23
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,877
Oh, by the way,
do you need this?

24
00:02:37,877 --> 00:02:39,671
It's the button
from your sleeve.

25
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:43,049
No thanks, I go plenty.

26
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,885
A-pa pa pa pa!

27
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:54,269
Whoa-ho, you scared me
there, that was a fast one!

28
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:55,395
I thought I was a goner!.

29
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:58,106
That was so fast I
didn't even see it!

30
00:02:58,106 --> 00:02:59,941
In that case, watch
your opponent's shoulder

31
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:00,942
and guess the speed.

32
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:01,526
Okay!

33
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:04,571
Oh wow! He learned how to
hold back, that's so great!

34
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,239
Okay, now it time
you have to dodge!

35
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:06,990
Okay!

36
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,493
Apapapapapapapapa!

37
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:19,002
Hey, check out that hawk.

38
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,422
It's so peaceful
and quiet up here.

39
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:24,424
Kind'a nice for a change, huh?

40
00:03:24,424 --> 00:03:26,467
C'mon, will you
take this seriously?

41
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:28,970
This is where the kid's been
hiding during lunch, right?

42
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,514
So why hasn't he shown up?
We've been here an hour!

43
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:33,474
Someone must've tipped him off.

44
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:41,691
Don't fall asleep on me!

45
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,443
Jeez, will you take
it easy, man?

46
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:46,362
No, I won't take it easy!
It's already been a month since

47
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:49,532
Kisara told us to find this punk
and so far we've got squat!

48
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:53,953
It's ridiculous! And our rank
in Ragnarok is on the line here!

49
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:57,123
Why can't we find him?! I mean,
we go to the same school!

50
00:03:57,123 --> 00:04:00,168
Does he even exist?!
It's insane!

51
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,212
Yeah, sure, the
school is huge,

52
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:05,715
but it's not huge enough
to hide in for a month!

53
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:07,383
This kid's gotta be
made of camouflage!

54
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:08,134
Quit freaking out.

55
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:09,886
I've got an idea
that might work.

56
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:11,804
You're acting like
it's no big-- what?

57
00:04:11,804 --> 00:04:14,098
I've got a plan to lure
him out of the shadows.

58
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:16,017
There's one thing we've
been doing wrong.

59
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:19,646
You see, we just haven't
been using the right bait.

60
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:22,106
Well, it's about time
you came up with an idea

61
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:24,192
instead of just
laying around.

62
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:30,490
So what are you waiting for?

63
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,909
Just attack me, you
can't hesitate in a fight.

64
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:34,243
Yeah...

65
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:36,037
I know, it's just that...

66
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:37,872
...it goes against
my principals.

67
00:04:37,872 --> 00:04:39,916
My mother always told
me not to hit girls.

68
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,126
Well, that's chivalrous of you,

69
00:04:42,126 --> 00:04:44,420
but we're supposed to be
sparring so c'mon attack me.

70
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,716
Hey! You still spouting
off that chivalry crap?

71
00:04:48,716 --> 00:04:51,094
Miu can handle it,
you've got gloves.

72
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:51,970
Even if you didn't,

73
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,348
I doubt your punches would
have any effect on her.

74
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:57,725
Oh, come on! You don't
have to insult me!

75
00:04:57,725 --> 00:04:58,726
Just fight!

76
00:04:58,726 --> 00:05:00,603
He's right!
You've got to punch!

77
00:05:00,603 --> 00:05:02,605
You have to have sparring
practice with a person

78
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:05,024
before you can fight the boxer!
Apachai would do it,

79
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:07,527
but I would kill you, and it
would not be a good practice.

80
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:08,861
We're all too advanced,

81
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:10,780
so it's pointless for
you to spar with us.

82
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,908
So, whether you like it or
not, Miu is your only option.

83
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:15,076
Now fight!

84
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:15,910
Alright!

85
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,288
But I can't bring myself to
hit a girl, it's just not right!

86
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:23,501
I've never met anyone
with such a strong sense

87
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,878
of what's right and wrong.
He honestly believes

88
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:28,589
that kindness is more
important than anything else.

89
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:32,593
But fighting can be ruthless and
his enemies won't feel that way.

90
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:35,972
Whoa, you almost hit me!

91
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:37,306
Hit him, Miu!

92
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:41,394
Apa!

93
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:50,361
Listen closely, Kenichi!

94
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:53,740
Your concern is admirable.
But refusing to acknowledge

95
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,659
your sparring partner
isn't a sign of respect.

96
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:59,120
You should never take a
deferential attitude towards

97
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,373
a rival who is attempting to
help you improve your skills.

98
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:06,127
That is not an expression
of kindness, but rudeness.

99
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:14,218
I'm sorry if I was rude.

100
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:18,139
Okay, I'm gonna attack
you from the side.

101
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:19,140
Go for it.

102
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:29,901
I couldn't even get close
enough to touch her.

103
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:33,196
And Miu was moving much more
slowly than she usually does!

104
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:44,165
Thanks for hiding out with me.

105
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:46,751
No problem. So how're you
feeling? You still sore?

106
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:47,794
Nah, I'm fine.

107
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:51,589
I think I'm gradually
building a tolerance to it.

108
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:54,634
This place is nice and quiet,
even if it is a little musty.

109
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:56,552
I thought it was kinda
depressing at first,

110
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:59,555
but now that I'm used to it,
it's actually kinda cozy.

111
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:02,225
It is cozy, the
two of us here...

112
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:05,728
no interruptions,
just us, alone.

113
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:08,022
Why am I just now realizing
how awesome this is

114
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:09,816
and why am I totally frozen?

115
00:07:09,816 --> 00:07:12,360
Hey, you're red, you okay?

116
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,861
Come here.

117
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:16,864
So close!

118
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,868
Oh, good. I was worried
you had a fever.

119
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:23,287
I can't go one on one
with someone who's sickly.

120
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:28,584
Um, I was talking
about training.

121
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:31,045
This is my chance.
Don't blow it, Kenichi!

122
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:32,880
Miu, you look kinda tense,

123
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,632
why don't you sit
down and relax a bit?

124
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:35,716
Thanks...

125
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:37,593
I've been sitting here
for a while, you know.

126
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:40,304
Uh-huh! And dontcha
think it's nice?

127
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,223
Just the two of us, alone.

128
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,310
You're so generous.

129
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:49,730
What is it with you?!
Is there no such thing

130
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,399
as privacy on
your home planet?!

131
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,192
Is this lunch? Thanks.

132
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:54,610
Go ahead, help yourself.

133
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,028
Where did you come from anyway?!

134
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:57,572
He's been standing
in that corner

135
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:58,906
the whole time
we've been here.

136
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:00,950
I'm surprised you
didn't notice him.

137
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,368
Why the long face?

138
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:04,287
I thought you'd be
happy to see me,

139
00:08:04,287 --> 00:08:06,581
especially with the dirt
I've dug up for you.

140
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:08,749
You've got new information
about the boxer?

141
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:09,500
Yep.

142
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,960
His name's Takeda Ikki.

143
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,338
If he hadn't shown up I'd be
making out with Miu by now!

144
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:15,882
He ruins everything!

145
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:17,758
I hate him.

146
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:19,886
Supposedly this Takeda
fellow was making

147
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:22,096
quite the name for
himself as a boxer.

148
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:24,223
He won the pro rookie
tournament using an attack

149
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:26,225
called the Lethal Left.
Heard of it?

150
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:27,101
The Lethal Left?

151
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:29,312
Yeah, evidently his
left arm is the one

152
00:08:29,312 --> 00:08:31,522
you need to watch out for.
From what I've heard,

153
00:08:31,522 --> 00:08:33,941
it's unlikely you'd
even see it coming.

154
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:36,569
People have apparently tried
to replay the video footage

155
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:38,112
of his fight
in slow motion,

156
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:40,156
but they still couldn't
see his left punch.

157
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:43,701
I'm going to die soon, aren't I?

158
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:45,536
Sure are.

159
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:47,038
One thing I couldn't figure out

160
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:49,332
is why he dropped boxing in
exchange for a life of crime.

161
00:08:49,332 --> 00:08:52,585
Lousy trade to me.

162
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:54,295
I can't believe you
still haven't asked Miu

163
00:08:54,295 --> 00:08:55,630
to go to the movie with us.

164
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,423
Give me a break, it's
harder than you think.

165
00:08:57,423 --> 00:08:59,133
You could try to ask
her too, y'know.

166
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,636
I would but I'm tryin' to help
you step up and be a man.

167
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:03,679
You better ask her before
the movie stops showing.

168
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,639
I've got it!

169
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,099
Why don't we try to be friends
with weak-knees Kenichi?

170
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:08,476
That's not a bad idea.

171
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:10,603
We'll pretend to be his
friends to get to Miu.

172
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:11,812
It's like that old saying,

173
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:14,023
"if you wanna shoot the general,
shoot his horse first."

174
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:15,524
Let's make a pact! From now on,

175
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:17,610
no matter how annoying he is,
we're Kenichi's friends!

176
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,030
No matter what.
We're his best friends!

177
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,031
Huh?

178
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:28,955
So you're his best friends? Well
then, come with me for a sec.

179
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:41,175
Good afternoon, class.
We've got a test review today.

180
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:43,511
But let's take
attendance first...

181
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:45,805
I finally get to read my book.

182
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:50,226
Seems like I never get
the chance to read anymore.

183
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:51,269
What?

184
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,479
We're holding your friends
hostage on the roof.

185
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:58,651
If you wanna see 'em alive
again, ya better get here fast.

186
00:09:58,651 --> 00:09:59,986
My friends...?

187
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:03,322
Do I even have any
other friends than Miu?

188
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:06,742
Wait, two?

189
00:10:06,742 --> 00:10:10,705
Oh, It looks like both Shimayama
and Tanaka are absent today.

190
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:12,289
Must've gone home early.

191
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:14,417
Shimayama? Tanaka?

192
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:15,751
Hey, weak-knees!

193
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:18,337
Is it true that everyone called
you weak-knees in junior high

194
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:21,966
because you're
such a coward?

195
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:23,926
They can't be serious.

196
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:27,513
How could anybody think those
two guys were my friends?

197
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:29,849
This has gotta be
some kind of mistake.

198
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,809
It'd be a different story
if they'd kidnapped Miu,

199
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:34,603
but those two jerks?

200
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,188
The friendliest thing
they've ever done

201
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:39,817
is pretend to help me up so
they could push me down again.

202
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:42,403
What'll I do?

203
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:45,156
If I go up there I'm
gonna get slaughtered.

204
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:46,699
Are they even worth it?

205
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:52,963
Takeda, you can't
seriously think

206
00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:54,715
a trick like this
is gonna work.

207
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:57,342
Trust me, if the kid cares
at all about his friends,

208
00:10:57,342 --> 00:10:58,677
he'll show up
to save them.

209
00:10:58,677 --> 00:11:00,387
It's a foolproof
plan, my friend.

210
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:03,932
Dunno. A normal person
would get scared and run.

211
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:05,142
He's gonna show.

212
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:06,768
What the hell is
wrong with him?

213
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:08,937
He can't be serious.
it'll never work.

214
00:11:08,937 --> 00:11:11,565
Nobody would walk
into a trap like this.

215
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:12,941
I know I wouldn't do it.

216
00:11:12,941 --> 00:11:14,901
Any minute now.

217
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:18,488
Excuse me, I'm sorry
to interrupt, but um...

218
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:21,950
See, The thing is, we're not
really Shirahama's friends.

219
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,119
What? Don't you lie to me!

220
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,954
I heard you say that you
were his best friends!

221
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:28,540
We were just using him to
get close to his hot friend.

222
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,459
We always pick on
him because he's weak.

223
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,169
And I'm pretty sure
he hates our guts

224
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,837
for bullying him all the time.

225
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,508
So you're saying that even
though we kidnapped you--

226
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:40,427
He's not gonna
come to rescue us!

227
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:42,679
I bet he's laughing at the
idea of us getting killed!

228
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,766
We did this for nothing?!

229
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:48,101
Would ya quit
throwin' 'em around?

230
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:50,103
I don't really feel
like burying them.

231
00:11:50,103 --> 00:11:53,148
Shut up! Your stupid plan
didn't work did it, Takeda?

232
00:11:53,148 --> 00:11:55,651
From now on we're doing
things my way, you got that?

233
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:59,321
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna
do! Just try and stop me.

234
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:00,822
Please, I'm sorry
just let me go!

235
00:12:00,822 --> 00:12:03,408
Fine, blow off some
steam if you have to.

236
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:04,826
Let him go!

237
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:12,709
I'm the one you want,
now let them go!

238
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:15,921
Hey, there he is,
what did I tell ya?

239
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:19,424
He's definitely an idiot

240
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:20,842
Aren't you Mr. Nice guy?

241
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:23,720
Coming up here to save your
pathetic little friends.

242
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,222
Maybe you should've
thought twice.

243
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:27,099
'Cause your nice-guy act,

244
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:30,519
just landed you in a
whole lot of trouble.

245
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,645
That look...

246
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:33,271
It's so cold.

247
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,586
This artist was particularly
popular during the early...

248
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:59,631
I wonder why Kenichi hasn't come
back from the bathroom yet.

249
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:02,843
What's taking him so long?
I hope he's okay.

250
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:11,601
It's about time
we met, Shirahama.

251
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:14,980
Hey wait up!

252
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:23,405
About a month ago our
boss asked us to find you.

253
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:25,032
We've been searchin'
for you since.

254
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:26,700
We're taking you to Kisara.

255
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,494
But considering the chase
you've led us on,

256
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:32,664
we can't ask you to come along
with us peacefully, now can we?

257
00:13:32,664 --> 00:13:33,957
You blew it.

258
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:35,250
Please, just let me go.

259
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,502
There's no reason for us
to resort to violence.

260
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:40,213
I can think of 100 reasons,
here's a few for ya:

261
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:42,549
you've wasted our time
and I think it'll be fun.

262
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:49,681
Well? What's the deal, Ukita?

263
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:53,268
C'mon, are you gonna
throw the kid or not?

264
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:54,436
Let go, dammit!

265
00:13:54,436 --> 00:13:58,774
What? No way! I don't wanna
get thrown off the roof!

266
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:00,108
Hang on, Shirahama!

267
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:01,735
So what do you
call that technique?

268
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,695
Soon as you let go, you're dead!

269
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:06,323
Thanks for the warning,
I'm never gonna let go now!

270
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:08,158
Alright then, hold on!

271
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:16,166
You worthless, little brat.

272
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,752
You signed your own death
certificate with that stunt.

273
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:19,920
Whoa, hey, man!

274
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,214
Why don't we just
try to talk this out--

275
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:27,636
As soon as you
get close enough,

276
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:29,805
You grab them by the
head and finish it!

277
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,772
Did I really just do that?!

278
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:40,774
My body moved on its own.

279
00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:47,239
Oh, no! Please, please,
please be okay!

280
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:49,199
I'm sorry, I really didn't
want to hurt you!

281
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,992
It's just like I've been
brainwashed or something!

282
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:53,203
Everyday they charge at
me and yell 'finish it'!

283
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:55,831
C'mon, hello? Can you hear me?

284
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:57,207
Looks like he's out.

285
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:59,376
It's just you and
me now, Shirahama.

286
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,878
And I hope you're ready 'cause
I'm gonna have to hurt you

287
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:03,839
for what you did
to my buddy Ukita.

288
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:07,050
Is he pulling a knife?

289
00:15:09,427 --> 00:15:10,679
Is that a watch?

290
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,888
And chalk?

291
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:15,100
Okay...

292
00:15:16,143 --> 00:15:17,936
Alright! You ready?

293
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:24,484
Is that supposed
to be a boxing ring?!

294
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:26,319
He can't be serious...

295
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:32,284
Are you kidding me?!

296
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:35,370
He obliterated that
chalk with one punch!

297
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,164
You do realize I was a
professional boxer, right?

298
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:39,457
But I'll go easy on ya.

299
00:15:39,457 --> 00:15:42,502
I'm gonna take you on
using only my right arm.

300
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:45,005
You ready to take
it to the ring?

301
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:53,054
This jerk took hostages
just to get me up here.

302
00:15:53,054 --> 00:15:55,724
I think it's safe to say I can't
talk my way out of this one.

303
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:58,310
By the way, you know your pals
you were tryin' to protect?

304
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,769
Looks like they've
ditched you.

305
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:02,147
Bet you regret comin'
to save them, huh?

306
00:16:04,274 --> 00:16:06,902
This is some situation
you've got yourself into.

307
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:08,361
You're not too bright, are ya?

308
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:11,281
If I had to describe you
in one word it's be...

309
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:12,699
...dumbass.

310
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:16,995
You think so?

311
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:21,374
Well, I may be a dumbass,
but at least I'm not a thug!

312
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:23,710
Oh really? Aren't
you a tough guy?

313
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,253
Let's see just how dumb you are.

314
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:27,130
I think you might
change your mind.

315
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:41,269
You can attack me with
any style you've got.

316
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:42,604
Anything goes, alright?

317
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:45,398
Ten counts for a knockout,
three knockouts and it's over.

318
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:47,859
So basically if you go
down 3 times in one round,

319
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:50,362
then you lose by K.O., got it?

320
00:16:50,362 --> 00:16:53,239
He's laughing. He thinks
this is a joke.

321
00:16:54,616 --> 00:16:57,118
The only way I'll make
it out alive is if I win.

322
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:59,621
I really hope all that
Muay Thai training pays off!

323
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,169
And he's down!

324
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:10,507
So are you gonna get up
or should I start counting?

325
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:11,424
One...

326
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:13,468
What just happened?

327
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:15,553
How the hell did he do that?

328
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:18,974
He managed to hit
me 3 times, but how?

329
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:20,350
They were so fast!

330
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,893
Three...

331
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:22,435
Four...

332
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,813
And he's only using one hand!

333
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:32,696
Hey...

334
00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:35,448
There ya go, that's the spirit.

335
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:37,117
The tension in the air...

336
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:40,370
the taste of blood
in your mouth...

337
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,955
Don't you just love boxing?

338
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:43,748
His punches are so fast!

339
00:17:43,748 --> 00:17:45,917
Not as fast as
Apachai's but close.

340
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,585
I can't even see them!

341
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:49,546
What am I gonna do?

342
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:51,631
I've gotta land
a punch somehow.

343
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:53,258
Otherwise I'm a dead man!

344
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,600
Heh. Looks like someone's
taken a couple karate lessons.

345
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,019
Bring it, kid.

346
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,145
You got it!

347
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:11,526
You've got enthusiasm but
you don't have the grace

348
00:18:11,526 --> 00:18:13,194
or speed to pull the moves off.

349
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:15,071
He's not quite
as skilled as Miu.

350
00:18:15,071 --> 00:18:17,323
But I still can't get close
enough to touch him!

351
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:21,536
Not only are his punches fast
but his defense is flawless!

352
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:23,038
I've gotta slow him down!

353
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:26,541
There's no way!

354
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:35,592
I can't! There's no
way I can beat him.

355
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,180
And that makes number two.

356
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,140
One more and it's over for you.

357
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:46,811
You come to
your senses yet?

358
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:49,814
All this trouble 'cause
of your stupid friends.

359
00:18:49,814 --> 00:18:51,441
Tell me.

360
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:54,360
Was it worth all
this to save them?

361
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,030
I feel like I'm
about to pass out.

362
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,074
What did Apachai say?

363
00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:01,326
I can't remember...

364
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:02,869
Don't worry, you
tried your best.

365
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:04,162
You just weren't quite ready.

366
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:04,996
What was it?

367
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:07,248
To fight a boxer.

368
00:19:07,248 --> 00:19:08,416
Boxer...

369
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:13,007
You really believe
that Kenichi could win

370
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:15,467
against a boxer with the
shape he's in right now?

371
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:17,136
'Cuz I'm not so sure about it.

372
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,722
You wrong Sakaki. He will win!

373
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:22,850
Apachai. Did you give
him extensive training

374
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,519
in the technique I
asked you to show him?

375
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,687
And what technique is this?

376
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:27,897
I taught him good!

377
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,940
Apachai made him practice
'til he threw up.

378
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,484
Hey, did you not hear me?
What technique is this?

379
00:19:32,484 --> 00:19:34,778
Is it some special
Muay Thai boxer repellant?

380
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:36,572
Something like that...

381
00:19:36,572 --> 00:19:39,116
It's been said that if one
is capable of mastering

382
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:43,329
this technique, then he's
capable of mastering the world.

383
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:46,081
It's known as the "ti lan".

384
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:48,667
That's it! I remember now!

385
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,878
A boxer's greatest weakness!

386
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:54,882
You can still stand up
straight. I'm impressed.

387
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:58,302
This is my only
chance to stop him.

388
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:02,431
Ti lan!

389
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:09,063
A low kick? What the hell?

390
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:18,989
He faked me out
and I fell for it.

391
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:21,200
I didn't think he was
gonna attack my knee.

392
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,243
Was he just pretending
to be an amateur?

393
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:31,543
His lower body
strength is incredible!

394
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:33,712
He obviously knows
more than just karate.

395
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:35,297
But how much does he know?

396
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:38,884
And where the hell
did he learn it?

397
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:41,637
A boxer's weakness
is his lower body!

398
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:48,686
It worked! Apachai!

399
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:50,604
The ti-lan! It worked!

400
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:58,237
Not bad.

401
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:05,619
He didn't have time to react!

402
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:07,830
He seems so slow
all of a sudden!

403
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:10,708
This is...

404
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,292
...it!

405
00:21:19,842 --> 00:21:21,301
What's wrong with you?

406
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:23,303
Why'd you stop like that?

407
00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:26,473
The bell rang. That's a
three-minute break, right?

408
00:21:26,473 --> 00:21:28,225
Say what?

409
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:34,982
You know, you really
are a dumbass, kid.

410
00:21:34,982 --> 00:21:36,567
What?

411
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:37,860
The break's one minute.

412
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,862
You only wish you
had more time to rest.

413
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:41,155
Yeah, whatever.

414
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:59,256
It's probably a good
idea for you to sit down.

415
00:21:59,256 --> 00:22:01,675
You can't recover
while you're standing.

416
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:04,553
What makes you think I need
to recover from anything?

417
00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:06,638
Try not to flatter
yourself, amateur.

418
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:07,973
Save your breath for fighting.

419
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:08,849
Damn...

420
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:10,017
Who am I kidding?

421
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:13,145
If I sat down now, I'd never
be able to get back up again.

422
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:13,979
What now?

423
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:18,275
There's no way I can withstand
another one of his low kicks.

424
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:20,110
Kenichi Shirahama...

425
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:26,033
There's a lot more to you
than I thought there was.

426
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:33,332
Niijima was right about him.
He's an incredible fighter.

427
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,250
But I don't get it...

428
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,630
Why would such a talented guy
give it all up... for nothing?

429
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:23,525
I have to say, I'm surprised--

430
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:24,985
I didn't think you'd
last this long.

431
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:26,820
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

432
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,615
Why'd you give up your boxing
career to become a thug?

433
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:31,074
Why do you care?

434
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:32,409
Every time you open your mouth

435
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:34,036
you prove that you're
just a sucker.

436
00:24:34,036 --> 00:24:36,496
Look Mr. Nice Guy, caring
about other people

437
00:24:36,496 --> 00:24:38,040
is the stupidest
thing you can do.

438
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,168
Trust me, I know, that's
what ruined my career.

439
00:24:41,168 --> 00:24:42,252
There's the bell.

440
00:24:42,252 --> 00:24:44,463
Better watch out 'cause I'm not
holding back this round!

441
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:45,631
Fine with me!

442
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:47,758
I wasn't planning on
holding back either!
