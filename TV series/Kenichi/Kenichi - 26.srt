1
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,205
Take this!

2
00:01:45,543 --> 00:01:47,169
It's over.

3
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:04,979
What the hell?!

4
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,316
I'm not quitting 'til you leave.

5
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:13,487
I understand you
have your pride,

6
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:17,908
but I have my principals!

7
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:20,161
Who is this kid?

8
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,125
So even if I pound
you into the ground,

9
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,502
you won't fight just
'cause I'm a "girl".

10
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:32,214
Right. I won't raise my
hand against a woman!

11
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:34,216
Are you kidding me?
That's stupid!

12
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:36,260
Why don't you just get out of
my way and I'll let you live!

13
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,511
That's not gonna happen!

14
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:39,513
Not until Miu's
performance is over.

15
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:41,042
I won't let you through,
no matter what!

16
00:02:46,645 --> 00:02:50,649
Hold on. Are you in love
with that cow or something?

17
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:53,194
No, no, it's not like I'm
in love with her or want

18
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:55,362
to marry her or date her
or anything like that!

19
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:57,114
But I, I guess you
could say that,

20
00:02:57,114 --> 00:03:00,242
I have a crush on her.

21
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:04,080
Wow. That must've hurt.

22
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,707
Aw, hell! There's
something about this joker

23
00:03:06,707 --> 00:03:08,918
that makes my brain
hurt! Let's go!

24
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:10,795
Huh? But are you sure?

25
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:12,379
Didn't you want to
confront Furinji?

26
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:15,424
This guy's stupidity took
all the fight out of me.

27
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:18,677
I'll do it some other time.

28
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:19,762
Huh?

29
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:21,013
So, that kid.

30
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:23,432
His name's Kenichi Shirahama,
is that right?

31
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:26,811
Yeah. I understand he's
in Class 1-E at school.

32
00:03:26,811 --> 00:03:28,729
Well, I'll be.

33
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:36,195
My secret alien powers allow
me to melt into the wall

34
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:38,781
and remain unseen
and undetected!

35
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:44,370
Hm. What a strange kid.
At least he's not boring.

36
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,122
Well, at least they're leaving.

37
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:48,999
Miu has put her heart
and soul into that show!

38
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:50,751
I couldn't let them ruin it!

39
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:52,920
Of course, this means
that the kissing scene

40
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,756
between Romeo and Juliet
is gonna happen, after all.

41
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,968
Aw, man. What the heck
is the matter with me?

42
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:01,846
I mean, I really can't stop
them if Tanimoto and Miu

43
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:04,140
want to be a couple.

44
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,351
He's a moron! He's
such a complete idiot!

45
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:09,103
It's heartbreaking!

46
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,143
Oh, happy dagger!

47
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:21,323
This is, thy sheath!

48
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:34,336
Wonderful!

49
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:37,673
I'm impressed.
The freshman were great!

50
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:38,924
You want a hanky?

51
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:42,887
No I don't. I was just blinded
by the spotlight, that's all!

52
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:43,679
Hey.

53
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:46,223
Just shut up! I am not cryin'!

54
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:48,475
I'm not talking about that.

55
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:53,272
Apachai's missing.
He's gone, see?

56
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:56,150
What a pain. He's never
been to school, so he probably

57
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,360
got curious and decided
to go exploring.

58
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,529
We shouldn't have
taken our eyes off him.

59
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:02,239
I'll go look for him.

60
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:04,450
Askin' for trouble...

61
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:08,370
Who's that?

62
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,705
A pro wrestler?

63
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:12,625
Man, this school's bigger
than I thought it'd be.

64
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,920
Still, a guy his size oughtta
be pretty conspicuous.

65
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,795
Apapapow!

66
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:20,883
Ah, there he is.

67
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:21,884
Apapapapa!

68
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:22,760
He's fast!

69
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,636
He's huge!

70
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:25,262
Go! Apachai!

71
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:27,139
One more basket and we win!

72
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,266
Are you sure that
overgrown monster

73
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:32,019
is a student at your school?

74
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,562
Yeah, he's one of those
exchange students

75
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:34,521
from some other country.

76
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,732
You've got to hurry,
we're nearly out of time!

77
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:39,318
Awoo!

78
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:43,072
No don't Apachai, hold on!
That's the wrong basket!

79
00:05:45,282 --> 00:05:47,368
Just when it looked like
my pathetic little team

80
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:49,161
was going to win its
very first match!

81
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:50,871
No, we're toast, man!

82
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:52,039
That guy.

83
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:53,999
I swear can make friends
with anyone he meets.

84
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:56,877
Apapapapa!

85
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,218
We did it!

86
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:05,344
Yeah, baby!

87
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:07,179
Our first win!

88
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:14,853
Heh. Hey there,
Apachai! Let's go!

89
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:20,776
Oh, look, it's Sakaki!
I have to get going!

90
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:22,945
Remember guys,
think like the ball!

91
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:24,530
That way you can never lose!

92
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,240
Thank you, sir!

93
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,074
Don't worry!

94
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:29,535
I know you can win
again, even without me!

95
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:31,203
Oh, yeah!

96
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:34,164
After that game the Koryo
High School basketball team

97
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:36,417
became one of the most
successful in the country

98
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,544
and even competed in the
national championship.

99
00:06:38,544 --> 00:06:41,213
And the legend of the
mysterious giant named Apachai

100
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:46,969
would be passed down
for years to come.

101
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:49,013
Great performance, Miu.

102
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:51,015
Thanks for coming
to see me, you guys!

103
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:52,349
I really appreciate it!

104
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:54,351
Wow, nice dress.

105
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:56,979
I've never been
so nervous before.

106
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,230
I couldn't have gotten through

107
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,733
it if it hadn't
been for Tanimoto.

108
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:01,483
What's that?

109
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:03,569
Oh hey, Miu, and are these
some friends of yours?

110
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:05,571
Huh? Oh, right.

111
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:06,655
This is my family.

112
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:09,617
A pleasure to meet
you all. I'm Tanimoto.

113
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:12,286
Congratulations on your
brilliant performance, sir.

114
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:15,331
Though I think it's
a terrible shame.

115
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:18,959
It would've been perfect if you
actually enjoyed performing.

116
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,963
Like I said, it's a shame.

117
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:26,175
Oh, Tanimoto!
Please accept these!

118
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:28,469
Oh, thank you!

119
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:29,803
Aren't these cosmos?

120
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:32,056
My sister just
loves these flowers!

121
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:34,433
Well, then I guess
we'll see you at home.

122
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:35,851
Sure!

123
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:46,945
This sucks. I bet
the play's over by now!

124
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:51,158
She'll hate me! It's over.

125
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:54,578
Why do I always manage to
screw things up like this?

126
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:12,096
Hey! What's the matter?

127
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:14,056
Why did you do that
to the flowers?

128
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:16,141
So you saw me.

129
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:17,768
I hate flowers,

130
00:08:17,768 --> 00:08:20,187
because they fade
and die too quickly.

131
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:21,730
What's going on?

132
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,316
He's acting like a
completely different person!

133
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:26,485
I hate acting almost
as much as flowers.

134
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:29,238
What? Then why'd you
join the Drama Club?

135
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:33,367
Ha! For practice in
the art of deception.

136
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:36,203
I have to be able to play the
role of the model student,

137
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:38,706
the class idol,
the teachers' pet.

138
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:43,168
In order to rule, you need to be
able to win people's sympathy.

139
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:44,753
You're the same way.

140
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:48,173
I bet you get tired playing
the champion of justice.

141
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:50,551
Acting doesn't really suit you.

142
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:52,511
But I...

143
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:53,929
It's very annoying,

144
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:56,807
the way your heroics have
made you so popular.

145
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:59,643
You see, this high school
is my proving ground.

146
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:01,311
Stay out of my way.

147
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:03,439
Your "defender of
the weak" act seems

148
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:06,108
to have taken a little bit
of a hit lately, hasn't it?

149
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:09,194
And it looks as if the lovely
and popular Miu Furinji's heart

150
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:10,571
will soon be all mine,

151
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:13,282
Sorry but I don't understand
what you're talking about!

152
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:15,534
This is just me! I'm not acting!

153
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:16,994
Don't lie to me!

154
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:21,707
Everybody is playing a
role, they're all liars!

155
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:25,252
I don't know what's going on,
but I told you, I'm not acting.

156
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:38,891
I'll teach that self
righteous fool.

157
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:49,620
Oh, hey Miu!

158
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,290
Oh, sure, now you show up,
after missing the performance

159
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,792
I've been slaving over for days!

160
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:59,172
She totally hates me!
Aw man, Tanimoto was right!

161
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:01,758
He's already captured her heart!

162
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:02,925
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:05,303
Just kidding!

164
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:07,305
I know you got into
a fight with Kisara

165
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,265
in order to protect the play.

166
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,768
And I want you to
know I appreciate it.

167
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:14,729
Oh, dear! Look at
your poor face!

168
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:15,980
Does it hurt alot?

169
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,315
Well, no.

170
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,774
Wait, I don't get it.

171
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:20,777
How'd you know I had
a run-in with Ragnarok?

172
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:25,323
Oh, well, Niijima
told me all about it.

173
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:31,078
Ah, well, I guess I can't
be evil all the time.

174
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:33,539
Miu's performance was
pretty darn good, wasn't it?

175
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:34,332
Mm-hm.

176
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:37,502
Apachai thought the play was
kinda hard to understand.

177
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:39,462
Now that we've picked up
Miu's favorite dessert,

178
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:41,770
let's get home, have
some tea, and relax.

179
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,179
Who are those
scary-looking characters?

180
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:51,641
Okay, just stay cool and
don't make eye contact.

181
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,608
Hey! There's Kenichi and Miu!

182
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:01,776
What the crap?

183
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:05,279
It'll take them twice as
long to get home that way!

184
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,324
Nice move, Kenichi! Way to go!

185
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:09,784
Hey! Kenich--

186
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:11,869
Now, now, let's
just head on back

187
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:13,454
and leave those kids alone.

188
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:17,959
There's no way I could do that!

189
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,295
Even if it's just acting, a girl
has to draw a line somewhere.

190
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:23,381
Besides, it would
be too embarrassing!

191
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:26,592
Huh?! What?!
You and Tanimoto didn't--

192
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:31,180
You mean the big kissing
scene in the play...

193
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,390
...it never happened?

194
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,849
Yay!

195
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:36,269
Woo-hoo!

196
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:43,067
Hey, there's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

197
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:45,528
Is that alright?

198
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:48,239
That little badge.
Is it very special to you?

199
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,533
Yin and Yang! Yin and Yang!

200
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:54,078
Uh, what, this thing? I guess.

201
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:56,747
You know that represents
the Yin and the Yang, right?

202
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:59,417
They're part of the ancient
Daoist philosophy in China.

203
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,752
Oh, I always wondered
what it was.

204
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:04,380
I picked it up at a candy
store a long time ago.

205
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,258
I traded a kitty pin for it.
I was just a little kid

206
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:09,427
back then, so I don't
remember much about it.

207
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,721
But I really haven't
taken it off since then.

208
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:13,764
Ah, it's pretty cool.

209
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:16,434
Why? Does it mean
something special?

210
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:19,395
Well, to put it simply,
the ancient Daoist masters

211
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:22,398
believed the universe was
composed of a balance between

212
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:25,234
two basic forces,
the Yin and the Yang.

213
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:28,279
The Yang meant light,
positive force, justice, day,

214
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,490
Yin was darkness, negative
force, evil, night.

215
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,659
Something like that, anyway.

216
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,621
Oh, wait a sec. Why is
there a small white circle

217
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:39,206
in the black, and a
black one in the white?

218
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:41,208
You just noticed something
very important.

219
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,711
It means that the deepest
darkness contains an element

220
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:45,755
of light, and the brightest
light also contains

221
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:48,215
an element of darkness.
Nothing in the universe

222
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:50,134
is without flaw and
everything that exists

223
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:51,844
is a part of everything else.

224
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:54,972
I see. It's kinda like
Niijima, sometimes I'd swear

225
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:58,976
he's pure evil. Then he'll turn
around and do something nice.

226
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:03,481
Yin and yang. Which
one are you Tanimoto?

227
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:09,779
C'mon Kensei,
what are you doin'?

228
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:10,321
Let's go!

229
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:11,113
Yeah.

230
00:13:11,113 --> 00:13:14,325
Hold on, I want to see if
they're going to kiss or not.

231
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:38,641
Who are you?

232
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,771
Get down!

233
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:50,444
Who is this guy?

234
00:13:50,444 --> 00:13:52,154
I'm Hermit.

235
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:53,114
You're Hermit?!

236
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:54,907
The Sixth Deadly
Fist of Ragnarok?

237
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:56,492
You're the one who
attacked Niijima!

238
00:13:56,492 --> 00:14:00,079
He's had some serious
training! Be careful!

239
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,288
Ha!

240
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,223
Kenichi, no!

241
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:30,735
That hurt!

242
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:32,528
You're pretty tough.

243
00:14:32,528 --> 00:14:34,739
You should answer me
while you can still talk.

244
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:36,365
What's the name
of your master?

245
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:37,700
Is it Sogetsu Ma?

246
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,578
No, it's not! One of my
masters is named Ma,

247
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:42,413
but his first name
isn't Sogetsu!

248
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:44,707
My master's name is Kensei Ma!

249
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:46,417
Miu! What's happening?

250
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:49,044
One of the Eight Deadly Fists
attacked Kenichi!

251
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:50,463
It's true! I see them!

252
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:52,131
Look, they're on
top of that bus!

253
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:54,508
He caught me off guard and
I couldn't react in time!

254
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:56,093
What are we gonna do?

255
00:14:56,093 --> 00:15:01,223
Kenichi isn't ready to fight an
opponent of his caliber yet!

256
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:03,142
It's just a kid's
playground squabble!

257
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:05,478
I'm sure that he'll come
home when he's hungry!

258
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:07,980
Well, we should really get
back home and have our tea!

259
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,275
Does two guys fighting on a bus
look like a squabble to you?!

260
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:12,985
Now, take it easy Miu.

261
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:14,570
Everything will turn
out just fine.

262
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,114
I'm sure those two will
keep an eye on him.

263
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:27,249
Well, well, worried about your
little disciple after all!

264
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:29,502
Don't forget that as
masters we can't interfere!

265
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:32,880
You moron, this has nothin' to
do with Kenichi's fight, okay!

266
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,591
I just had a sudden urge
to run a marathon and to do

267
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:37,676
it the fastest speed
I could possibly do it!

268
00:15:37,676 --> 00:15:39,720
You're the worst liar
I've met in my life.

269
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,931
How come you're not chasing
them on your motorcycle?

270
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:44,433
Are you kidding me,
even if I could get that

271
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,769
piece of junk started, it takes
forever to get warmed up,

272
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:48,354
it's older than I am!

273
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:52,942
When I first saw you
fight, I could've sworn

274
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:56,445
I saw the style of my master
Sogetsu Ma in your own!

275
00:15:56,445 --> 00:15:58,405
But it would seem
I made a mistake.

276
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:02,117
Why are you doing this? Is
this an order from Ragnarok?

277
00:16:02,117 --> 00:16:04,787
Why would you risk your life
to do something this crazy?

278
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:07,039
I do it because I
find you annoying.

279
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,416
You, with that pure,
noble look in your eye!

280
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,126
And your naïve faith
that there can ever

281
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:12,628
be justice in this world!

282
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:15,172
On the other hand, I've
always had to play a part,

283
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:17,258
just to survive!

284
00:16:17,258 --> 00:16:20,094
You, with your easy life, want
to tell me that the purpose

285
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:23,639
of fighting is for justice?
You're wrong about that!

286
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,516
How do you know?

287
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:28,686
Shut up! I've been playing
a role my whole life so that

288
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:31,522
I could someday rule over both
the darkness and the light!

289
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:35,693
What?! No way! You're Tanimoto!

290
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:37,570
Here he comes!

291
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:44,869
He did a flip on a moving bus?!

292
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:47,288
I had hoped to put off killing
you until you'd become

293
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:49,498
strong enough to present
a real challenge.

294
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:51,125
But now I've no choice.

295
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,294
Your martial arts
training is incomplete.

296
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:55,254
You may have true
masters instructing you,

297
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:57,965
but you yourself are
still an amateur.

298
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,300
Now you'll see,

299
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,011
the real power of
Chinese kung fu!

300
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:04,346
Prepare yourself!

301
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:05,306
He's good.

302
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:07,391
I've never faced an
opponent like him before.

303
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:11,854
It's like fighting one of
the masters at Ryozanpaku!

304
00:17:11,854 --> 00:17:14,106
I feel like such a failure!

305
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:15,107
He's amazing!

306
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:17,818
I mean, we're on top of a bus
and it hasn't phased him--

307
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:19,153
a moving bus!

308
00:17:19,153 --> 00:17:21,989
Here's a thought. Let's
get off this thing first!

309
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:24,658
Otherwise we'll both fall
off and break our necks!

310
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:40,951
What?! That was Piguaquan!

311
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:42,578
it's an incredibly
advanced technique!

312
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:45,122
Pigua-what?! I don't
know that style!

313
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:48,042
It's one of the deadliest, most
sophisticated fighting styles

314
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:50,211
in Chinese kung fu!

315
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:52,922
The fighter uses both arms
like they were whips,

316
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:55,966
his opponent doesn't even have
a chance to counter attack!

317
00:17:55,966 --> 00:18:01,263
It's nearly unstoppable!

318
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:03,516
He's so powerful!

319
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,601
He bent that steel
cover with his hand!

320
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,520
How the hell did he do that?

321
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,147
He's been taught how to
channel his energy to his arms!

322
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:13,150
He can make his hands and arms
as hard as steel that way!

323
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,444
He's good! No doubt!

324
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:22,201
Sakaki!

325
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,370
I know, I know, a master
must never interfere

326
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,412
in a disciple's battles!

327
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:27,122
I can't keep this up.

328
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:34,380
Die! And take your
stinking nobility with you!

329
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,725
Ow! Hey!

330
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,186
You know its dangerous to go
for the back of the head!

331
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:51,313
What? Are you
trying to kill me?!

332
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:53,440
What's he made of?

333
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,568
You're the first opponent I've
ever fought who could take

334
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,319
that blow and not collapse!

335
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,197
Whatever kind of training you've
undertaken, it's been excellent!

336
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:01,782
You'd better thank your
masters because they're

337
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:04,618
the only reason
you're still alive!

338
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:05,953
Very nicely put.

339
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:07,788
Whose side are you on?!

340
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:12,418
When it comes to beat
downs, I yield to no one!

341
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:17,631
But I can tell that Hermit
is striking to kill.

342
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,425
I'll tell you one more time.

343
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,635
This has nothing
to do with Ragnarok

344
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:24,805
I want to kill you because
I can't stand you!

345
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:27,474
Ragnarok is just a way
for me to pass the time

346
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:28,559
and hone my skills!

347
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,978
Then when I'm ready
the entire underworld

348
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:32,646
will bow down before me!

349
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:36,233
Tell me something! Was all of
it an act or was any of it real?

350
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:38,027
'Cause I believed
you when you told me

351
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,737
that you and I were friends!

352
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:48,120
It was all an act! It was
a lie right from the start!

353
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,540
I had those guys attack
the Drama Club!

354
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,085
And I was the one
who took them down!

355
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:57,504
Then I went after
Miu Furinji to increase

356
00:19:57,504 --> 00:20:02,259
my popularity at school!

357
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:05,220
You thought we were friends?
Don't make me laugh!

358
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,682
A prince must always be alone
as he fights his way to the top!

359
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:09,475
You're wrong!

360
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,726
What?!

361
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,478
That's a lie and you know it!

362
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,272
I don't know why you think
that way, but I do know this.

363
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:16,774
You don't really
want to be alone.

364
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:19,443
You're just saying that
to cover your real feelings.

365
00:20:19,443 --> 00:20:21,779
When you asked me to help
out the Drama Club,

366
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:25,074
and after that, when you asked
me if we could be friends,

367
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:27,785
I could see it deep in your
eyes, a sad lonely light!

368
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:30,496
You had the same look in your
eyes that I used to have!

369
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,414
The eyes of loneliness!

370
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:38,170
You need friends, whether
you admit it or not!

371
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,005
I don't understand you!

372
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,590
Look, let's end this.

373
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,426
For starters ya think
we can get off this bus?

374
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:45,844
Sure.

375
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,347
After you!

376
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:54,228
Careful!

377
00:20:54,228 --> 00:20:55,979
This guy is full
of dirty tricks, kid!

378
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:57,356
You naïve fool!

379
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,316
What's wrong with you?!

380
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,324
You tricked me again!
But your punches will lose

381
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:09,493
half their power if
we fight this closely!

382
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:13,455
Maybe so, but the
same applies to you!

383
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:15,624
But that's just an uppercut.

384
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:17,292
An opponent with
a strong neck would

385
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:19,837
be able to withstand that
blow. It's impossible for you

386
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:21,380
to put much force into the hit

387
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,507
when you're so
close to your enemy.

388
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:25,926
Which is just what your
opponent will be thinking.

389
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:28,345
So, he won't expect
what happens next.

390
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:37,980
Oh, man! How did you manage to
muster so much force, Master?

391
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,190
This form is the
source of your power.

392
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,942
Once your hand is
placed under his chin,

393
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:43,819
use your other hand
to strike your elbow.

394
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,071
The strength of two hands
is now behind the one

395
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,824
in contact with the chin.
And since you're already

396
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:50,033
in contact with your opponent,

397
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:52,077
he won't be able
to dodge the blow.

398
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:55,080
Take this! Master Kensei's
secret move!

399
00:22:10,471 --> 00:22:13,390
Alright! I've had all
I can take of this!

400
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:18,771
Go time!

401
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,147
Master Sakaki, wait!

402
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:20,898
Huh?

403
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:24,485
He's right.
don't be childish.

404
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:25,903
I'm sorry Master,

405
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:29,531
but I have a feeling I have to
be the person who defeats him!

406
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,241
Kenichi...

407
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:40,876
It's amazing.

408
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:44,213
Our little disciple is growing
up right in front of our eyes.

409
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:46,131
Uh-huh.

410
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:23,186
Look, Kenichi, I'll treat
you to a bowl of noodles

411
00:24:23,186 --> 00:24:24,730
and then you head home, okay?

412
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,189
I'm not leaving!

413
00:24:26,189 --> 00:24:28,859
This is a personal matter
I must resolve alone.

414
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:31,069
It has nothing to do
with my disciple!

415
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,530
I told you, I'm not leaving!
Forget about it!

416
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,533
Kenichi, you're too stubborn
for your own good!

417
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:39,036
I can't guarantee your
safety in this matter!

418
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:40,329
I hope you're prepared!

419
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:43,123
As a disciple, I must
follow my master!

420
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:46,418
No matter what happens,
I won't leave your side!
