1
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:45,639
Nice to meet you.
My name is Tanimoto.

2
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,891
So you're the famous
Kenichi Shirahama.

3
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:51,395
I've heard a lot about you.

4
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:54,523
He's totally dreamy!
Like a pop star!

5
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:56,984
Oh, man, I haven't got a
prayer against this guy!

6
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,153
Tanimoto says the Drama
Club is short-handed

7
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:01,113
for their next play,
so he asked me

8
00:02:01,113 --> 00:02:04,366
if I'd like to play Juliet
in "Romeo and Juliet."

9
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:07,327
I'm playing the part of Romeo.

10
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,122
It's true, the two of them
would be perfect together!

11
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:12,082
He's only a freshman,
but he's already the head

12
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:14,668
of the Drama Club and a born
leader. He gets good grades

13
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,795
and naturally the teachers
are wild about him.

14
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:18,755
But he never brags about
it, and what's more,

15
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:20,507
he tutors other students
in his spare time.

16
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,719
I think he's a little too
perfect, he just can't be real!

17
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:26,013
It's like Persian carpets,
no matter how squeaky clean

18
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,098
they seem to be, if you
pound them hard enough,

19
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:29,391
they're bound to show some dust!

20
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:30,225
Do you think so?

21
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:32,728
Hey, bro, when it comes
to dirt, I'm an expert.

22
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:36,523
This guy's suspicious. My sensor
is tingling like crazy.

23
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,150
And it's never wrong.

24
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:45,616
Aw c'mon, Kenichi!
Please cheer up.

25
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:47,618
You know that I believe in you!

26
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:49,912
Yeah. Thanks, Izumi.

27
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:51,121
No problem.

28
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:55,334
People can be so mean,
can't they, Shirahama?

29
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:56,960
Tanimoto!

30
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,505
Oh my gosh it's the
famous Prince Tanimoto!

31
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:02,049
What are you doing here?

32
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,134
Sometimes it just isn't
important how good

33
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:06,970
your intentions really are,
people are always going

34
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,264
to misinterpret your actions,
so it doesn't actually

35
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:11,558
matter what the truth is.

36
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,727
But I want you to
know I believe in you.

37
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,145
When I first heard the rumors

38
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:17,731
about the Martial Arts
Research Club being beaten up,

39
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,317
I was afraid you might've
been the one who did it.

40
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:22,736
But you're someone who
knows where to draw the line.

41
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:28,492
And what happened
yesterday was just sick

42
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:30,827
You know, everybody in
school has this crazy idea

43
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:32,704
that I'm some sort of
Mr. Perfect Student.

44
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:35,040
Consequently I don't
have many friends.

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,875
So I'd be really happy
if you'd consider me

46
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,835
as one from now on, Shirahama.

47
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:42,631
Sure. That sounds great.

48
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:49,930
What was it?
That look in his eyes.

49
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,476
A sort of sadness, shimmering
like a faint light.

50
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:57,104
Oh man he's so totally
hot! What am I doing?

51
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,439
I can't cheat on Kenichi!

52
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:06,572
Oh, Romeo!

53
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:08,824
Deny thy father and
refuse thy name,

54
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:11,577
or if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love.

55
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:14,121
Whoa! She's so awesome!

56
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:17,332
That's wonderful, absolutely
wonderful! Way to go!

57
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:20,043
All the practice you've
put in has really paid off!

58
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:22,337
Congratulations Miu!
It's looking good!

59
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:23,380
Really?

60
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,508
But I think most of the credit
has to go to your coaching!

61
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:28,677
Damn it! She's right!

62
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:29,970
With him as her leading man,

63
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,681
her performance has
definitely improved!

64
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:37,603
There's no way I can deny it!
Those two are perfect together!

65
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:40,480
Don't be an idiot! If you
really can't stand the thought

66
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,316
of them together,
then take action.

67
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,526
Go ahead and kick his
butt from here to China!

68
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:46,653
According to my records
he only has a C minus

69
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,864
in physical ability,
it should be a snap.

70
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:50,365
Would you just shut up!

71
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,492
Oh come on! Don't you
know people are already

72
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,453
referring to them as
the perfect couple?

73
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:57,080
We should strip him naked,
paint him blue, and hang him

74
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,583
upside down from the tower
before things go too far!

75
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,876
I said shut up!

76
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:03,629
Tanimoto and I are friends,
you hear me, friends!

77
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,964
If you don't cut it out
I'm gonna get mad!

78
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:09,176
Ha! Fell for the old
"let's be friends" dodge, huh?

79
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,053
Man, you're such a sucker!

80
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:13,805
Look at him, Natsu Tanimoto...

81
00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:15,724
No matter how you slice
it, there's something

82
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:17,517
wrong with that guy.

83
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:23,148
Man, all Kisara does
these days is train.

84
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:25,734
Meanwhile, I gotta look
for that big-boob girl.

85
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:28,779
Man, this is really
starting to get old.

86
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:29,738
You know what?

87
00:05:29,738 --> 00:05:31,782
You look really pretty
without your glasses on Miu.

88
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:36,411
Huh? Oh no, I don't think so!

89
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:38,330
I've found her!

90
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,374
You really should get rid
of these geeky glasses

91
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:44,461
and switch over
to contact lenses.

92
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:47,047
No Contact lenses...

93
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,139
They just don't seem to
work well with my eyes.

94
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,641
Oh, I see.

95
00:05:57,641 --> 00:05:59,476
That was just amazing!

96
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:01,853
Well, after all, I'm
in the Gymnastics Club.

97
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:02,854
Huh?

98
00:06:02,854 --> 00:06:06,579
Oh man, they almost figured
out she wears fake glasses.

99
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:12,030
Ha, ha! I found her!

100
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,200
Who would have guessed she was
a student at my own school?!

101
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,120
Hey, Kisara! Looks
like you owe me one!

102
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,622
Did you find out where
that stupid cow is hiding?

103
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:23,959
Yeah, she turned out to be
a student at our school!

104
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,087
Damn! She was under
my nose all this time!

105
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,215
I've gotta be more
careful next time we meet.

106
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:35,303
I didn't think another
girl could be that good.

107
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:38,265
Anyway, this time I won't
hold back on that amateur!

108
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,976
All the extra training I've done
has made me way faster than

109
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:43,937
she could ever be with that big
rack of hers slowing her down!

110
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,023
Yeah! We're finally
gonna have some action!

111
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:48,108
Wait, Kisara.

112
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,694
We've received another
communication from Hermit.

113
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:53,780
Huh? Now what?
What's he want this time?

114
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,615
Uh, well, you see...

115
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,201
That "stupid cow",

116
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:00,954
Rather, Miu Furinji
is off limits.

117
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:01,997
You're not to touch her.

118
00:07:01,997 --> 00:07:05,625
Who does that guy think he is?!
I'll do what I want with her!

119
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,669
Hold on, the way
things are right now--

120
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:10,380
You can tell Hermit from me
that if he gets in my way,

121
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,925
he's next, you got that?!

122
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:15,427
Don't you think we
should stop her?

123
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:16,845
After you.

124
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:29,983
What's wrong?
That was such a sad sigh.

125
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,360
What about you?
You sound down too.

126
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,196
Oh, no. It's just
everyone at school

127
00:07:34,196 --> 00:07:36,114
seems to have the
wrong idea about me.

128
00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:37,157
You know what I mean?

129
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,367
Oh, I wouldn't worry too
much, all that nonsense

130
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,536
is bound to blow over
sooner or later.

131
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,079
I sure hope so.

132
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,374
The truth is, I can't seem
to stop thinking about you.

133
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:48,919
So, what about you?
You must be pretty nervous

134
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,463
about tomorrow's
performance going well.

135
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:54,591
That's part of it,
I guess, but also...

136
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:56,635
Everybody else
in Drama Club,

137
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:59,262
well, they've got their families
coming to watch them perform

138
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:01,181
and cheer them on and stuff.

139
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,390
But me...

140
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,519
You know Grandpa's gone south
again on another trip, and I--

141
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,897
I just started thinking...

142
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:11,024
I'm gonna be all alone,

143
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:14,737
just like I was during parents'
day back in grade school.

144
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,659
Wait a minute, you have me!

145
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:21,785
Huh?

146
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:24,120
I'll come to the show tomorrow
and I'll cheer for you

147
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,664
as loud as three families could!

148
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:29,626
Really? That'd be great!
Thank you, Kenichi!

149
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:31,753
But, try not to cheer too loud

150
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:33,588
during the performance,
so people can hear.

151
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:36,633
Huh? Oh, yeah! I'll try!

152
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,474
You're sure? Miu said that?

153
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:46,476
It's really none of my
business, but I thought you'd

154
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:48,895
wanna know. I'm just passing
the information along.

155
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,146
So, there you are.

156
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:53,400
The Elder sure picks bad
times to go out of town.

157
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,527
There'll be cute
high school girls.

158
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:58,613
I-I mean, I should go,
for Miu's sake!

159
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:01,867
Very well. I think we
should all be in attendance.

160
00:09:06,621 --> 00:09:09,541
Welcome to the show!
Come in and have a seat!

161
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:23,013
Really? You're
Ms. Furinji's father?

162
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,431
Huh?

163
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:30,854
Yes, thank you so much for all
your help with my daughter.

164
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:33,356
This is her brother,
and the lady's my wife.

165
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:34,107
You know,

166
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,693
you probably should've left
your sword at home Shigure.

167
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:38,862
Hey, at least it's
in a bag, all right?

168
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:40,864
Hi! My name is Apachai!

169
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:42,657
It's a good thing
we got here early.

170
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:44,409
These are good seats!

171
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:48,038
Everybody came!
They're all here for me!

172
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:49,831
I'm not gonna be alone today!

173
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:52,959
Hey, Miu, you ready?
It's almost time!

174
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,169
Ready!

175
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:55,170
Wait a sec.

176
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,590
Now that I think about it, I
didn't see Kenichi out there.

177
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:08,876
Hey! What are you doing
still moping around here?

178
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,295
Isn't the play supposed
to start any minute now?

179
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:14,382
To tell the truth, I'm not
sure I can bear to watch it.

180
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:16,175
It's just too much.

181
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:19,428
What?! Seriously, man,
you need to grow a pair!

182
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,222
You promised her
you'd be there, right?

183
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:22,098
So get going!

184
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:23,349
You know something?!

185
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:25,935
Turns out there's a big kissing
scene in Romeo and Juliet!

186
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:28,854
Reality check, loser,
it's just a play!

187
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:31,816
But I can't stand it!
I wish they'd just cancel

188
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:35,194
the stupid play and
get it over with!

189
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:36,904
Man, he's pathetic.

190
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:42,952
Stupid play!
Stupid kissing scene!

191
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:47,581
Listen, I'll let you guys

192
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,834
take care of the
Shinpaku Alliance wimps,

193
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:54,672
but the cow is mine, you got it?

194
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:56,924
Oh, man. That's Kisara Nanjo,

195
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:58,884
and it looks like they're
heading for the school.

196
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:01,762
But who's this cow
they're talking about?

197
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,931
Is she talking about Miu?

198
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,600
Moo! Got milk?

199
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,811
Uh, so what are you
gonna do, Kisara?

200
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:11,314
You know that girl is in
the middle of doing a play

201
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:13,024
right now, don'tcha?
How're you gonna get her?

202
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:16,319
So she's on stage, huh?
That kind of appeals to me.

203
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:19,280
I'll ruin her little acting
debut, and humiliate her

204
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,116
right there in front
of an audience!

205
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,743
What? That's terrible!

206
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:25,328
I've gotta try and
stop her somehow!

207
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:26,829
Not so fast!

208
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:29,623
Niijima! Where'd you come from?

209
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:32,835
Hey, sneaking up on people is
a major part of my skill set!

210
00:11:32,835 --> 00:11:35,171
Aren't you worried?
This could spell big trouble

211
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,590
for your beloved
Shinpaku Alliance, you know!

212
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,883
You can relax.

213
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:41,927
I told the members to stand
down until things blow over.

214
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:43,721
I see. That's a relief.

215
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:46,932
This is no time to stand down,
Miu could be in danger!

216
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:49,518
Whoa, hold on. This
could be good for you.

217
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:51,687
if this attack goes forward,
Miu's kissing scene

218
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:54,231
won't come up and your
worries are over.

219
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:56,442
And your monster masters
are sitting in the audience,

220
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:59,362
so they'll be able to protect
her and take of Kisara!

221
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:01,781
First of all, I don't understand
why they cast that cow

222
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:04,283
in the role of Juliet when
there are so many other girls

223
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:06,994
who could play it! I mean,
where does it say in the script

224
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,287
"Juliet has to be a D-cup"?

225
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,789
Why is everyone so
obsessed with that?

226
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:10,664
It's not a talent!

227
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,875
Uh-oh, someone' jealous,

228
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,127
Shut up!

229
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:17,505
Why would I be jealous of her?!

230
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:19,465
I'm sorry!

231
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:20,925
Yeah, you're right.

232
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:24,011
If I just leave well enough
alone, the performance will

233
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,180
be ruined so the kissing
scene won't happen,

234
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,516
and the masters will mop
up Kisara and her thugs

235
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:31,936
so no one will get hurt.
All my problems will be solved!

236
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:35,147
Besides, there's no way I
could stop them all by myself!

237
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:38,067
I've got no choice
but to let them go.

238
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:40,444
Ha! Now you're making sense!

239
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:43,405
I was asked to play
the part of Juliet!

240
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:46,283
I think I'm losing my voice.

241
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:49,703
I can't do it!
Maybe I have no talent!

242
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,163
You're better than Apachai!

243
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:53,707
Wait, is this a real dagger?

244
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,168
Yes. It makes it more dramatic.

245
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:58,129
Don't get too caught up
in your character.

246
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:00,881
Remember technique is
as important as passion!

247
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,259
Right! That'd be great, Kenichi!

248
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:04,718
But try not to cheer too loud

249
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,930
during the performance,
so people can hear.

250
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,099
Let's go. I know a good spot.

251
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:14,103
We can watch the action
in air-conditioned comfort.

252
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:16,272
Not so fast, you guys!

253
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:20,025
If you clowns are planning on
disrupting Miu's performance,

254
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:22,111
you gotta get past me first!

255
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:39,253
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee.

256
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:42,381
Tell me, by whose direction
foundst thou out this place?

257
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:44,049
By love, that first did...

258
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:46,177
prompt me to inquire.

259
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:48,721
He lent me counsel
and I lent him eyes.

260
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:54,226
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as
far as that vast shore wash'd...

261
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:56,478
Hey, this is better
than I expected!

262
00:13:56,478 --> 00:14:01,150
Sh! This is a very
impressive performance!

263
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,278
This young man playing
Romeo is simply amazing!

264
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:07,072
He's not only completely
committed to the emotional core

265
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:09,909
of the role, but he's able to
adjust his performance based

266
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:12,703
on the audience's
subtle reactions.

267
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:13,996
He's young, but he's skilled!

268
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:16,123
Hey! Akisame! Hey!

269
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,791
Would you keep it down, please?

270
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,294
But that damn fool Kenichi
hasn't shown up yet.

271
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:23,422
I even saved a
special seat for him.

272
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:26,592
I understand. I know what
you're going through, Kenichi.

273
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:28,469
It's tough to be young.

274
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,346
By and by I come, Nurse!

275
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,556
Leave me now,
tomorrow I will send.

276
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:35,809
Adieu, my love!

277
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,186
That move...

278
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:41,398
That was the "stepping method"!
That can't be part of the play.

279
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:44,735
That boy's had some form of
intensive martial arts training!

280
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:53,035
Well, well. Looks like
the Shinpaku Alliance's

281
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:55,287
commander has
come out to play.

282
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,129
Get him!

283
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:05,547
Come here!

284
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:13,555
Stop right there! You're
never gonna get past me!

285
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:17,226
What?! Is he stupid?
He missed a perfect opportunity!

286
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:17,935
Damn it.

287
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:19,728
You'll pay for the other day!

288
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,777
Take this!

289
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:32,074
Punk!

290
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:39,540
Damn you!

291
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,709
Uppercut!

292
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:43,335
Yamazuki!

293
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:49,675
Hey!

294
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:51,927
Let them go.

295
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:54,096
Well, I don't know
what kind of training

296
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:55,389
you've been going through,

297
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:59,810
but you've definitely
gotten a lot better.

298
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,270
I've changed my mind.

299
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,941
I'll take him on first, then
I'll deal with that cow later.

300
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:07,901
You'll be perfect as a warm up.

301
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,904
So whadda you say, boy-o,
let's see what you've got.

302
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,282
Don't come any closer!

303
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:15,451
I've told myself I'd
never fight a woman!

304
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:19,121
I'm not gonna change my
principals 'cause of you!

305
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:22,124
What? What did you say?

306
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:24,209
So, you've resolved never
to fight with a woman?

307
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:27,338
Do you think that
makes you cool?

308
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:29,631
Have you forgotten
what I told you before?

309
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:32,968
That kind of macho
crap pisses me off!

310
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:41,727
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

311
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,189
Uh, the strap on my left shoe
snapped off all of a sudden!

312
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:47,232
Oh my goodness! Wait here.

313
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:49,735
I'll go grab another
pair from wardrobe.

314
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:53,614
Oh, okay. Thank you very much.

315
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:56,116
I thought these
shoes fit perfectly.

316
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,160
That's so weird.

317
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,287
These violent delights
have violent ends,

318
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:03,248
and in their triumph die,
like fire and powder,

319
00:17:03,248 --> 00:17:05,376
which as they kiss consume!

320
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:08,712
The sweetest honey is loathsome
in his own deliciousness!

321
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,891
This isn't good.

322
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:23,394
I've never seen Kisara
this angry before.

323
00:17:23,394 --> 00:17:26,271
That kid. He's as good as dead.

324
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:35,197
What's wrong?

325
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:37,991
Are you still too
cool to fight a girl?

326
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,618
Come on!

327
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:47,334
So, are you finally
ready to take me on?

328
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:54,550
I told you, no!

329
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,596
There's no way I'm
gonna fight you!

330
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:02,307
Damn you. Y'punk...

331
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:03,600
I'll kill you!

332
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,730
You won't fight me
'cause I'm a girl?!

333
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,108
How dare you say that!

334
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:20,325
Just look at her go!

335
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:22,411
She never lets up,
not even for a minute!

336
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:23,287
She'd beat me.

337
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:25,581
All right! That's
enough for today!

338
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:27,166
Yes, sir!

339
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,918
Kisara, it almost looks
like you've decided

340
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:31,879
to give the guys a
run for their money!

341
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:33,589
Yes, sir!

342
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:36,717
No matter what, I've resolved
never to be bested by any man!

343
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:38,719
When it comes to competing
at Tae Kwan Do,

344
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:43,265
I'll bet someday I'm even
gonna beat you master!

345
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:46,435
I see, then we'll have to
have a match someday, huh?

346
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:48,020
You bet!

347
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:10,834
You know, you're really amazing,
Kisara, I mean, even though

348
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,629
you're just a girl you not only
keep up with the boys' training

349
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:15,506
program but you manage
to pack in a ton

350
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:16,590
of extra practice as well!

351
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,009
Oh, come on, don't
say it like that!

352
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:21,345
I hate when people say things
like "you're just a girl"

353
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:23,889
or "you're good for a woman."
I wanna be as strong as

354
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,891
the boys, so I follow
their training program,

355
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:28,769
it's simple as that. Besides,
when it comes to Tae Kwan Do,

356
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,480
I try not to think of myself
as a man or a woman.

357
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,565
Oh, come on, get real!

358
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:36,443
You're way too pretty to
think like that, Kisara!

359
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:39,446
Aw, thank you.

360
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:47,790
And begin!

361
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,208
I can't lose!

362
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:53,504
This guy hasn't practiced
half as much as I have!

363
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:57,967
I won't back down just
'cause my opponent's a man!

364
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,510
Oh, no!

365
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:22,116
That's it! The winner
is, Kisara Nanjo!

366
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:42,386
C'mon man, you held back, right?

367
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:44,305
Please tell me you
let that girl beat you

368
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:45,807
and she didn't
really kick your ass.

369
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:50,269
What? You could tell?
Aw man, I tried to hide it.

370
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:52,021
What the hell was
I supposed to do?

371
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:54,398
I mean, she's good
but she's just a girl.

372
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:56,776
You can't take a match
against a chick seriously.

373
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:58,778
That'd just be sad.

374
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:02,156
You bastard!

375
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:05,618
It was a man...

376
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:09,038
A man like you...

377
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,124
...who destroyed all my
self respect and pride!

378
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:24,262
What a kick!

379
00:21:24,262 --> 00:21:27,557
I blocked it but it still
made my head spin!

380
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:31,018
Heh. I have to say, you're a
whole lot tougher than you look.

381
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:34,313
Nobody else has ever
lasted this long before

382
00:21:34,313 --> 00:21:37,108
I can't take much more of this.

383
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:39,902
Don't you just love
street fighting?

384
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:42,071
No protective equipment
like gloves or helmets

385
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:44,365
to get in the way, and
no rules to hide behind,

386
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:48,578
so you can't cop out and
say you lost on purpose!

387
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:54,125
Come on, smart guy, let's see
how long you can stay cool!

388
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,293
Take this!

389
00:21:59,714 --> 00:22:01,382
It's over.

390
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,400
What the hell?!

391
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,738
I'm not quitting 'til you leave.

392
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:27,825
I understand you
have your pride,

393
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:32,371
but I have my principals!

394
00:22:32,371 --> 00:22:34,248
Who is this kid?!

395
00:22:34,248 --> 00:22:36,125
Man, he's dumb!

396
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,961
Why doesn't he just shoot
himself and save time?

397
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:23,232
Come on, kid. Get out
of my way already!

398
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:25,735
I know you're trying to save
the show for that stupid cow

399
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:28,279
of a girlfriend of
yours but get over it!

400
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:30,448
I'm not just doing this for Miu!

401
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:32,158
I'm doing this
for Tanimoto too!

402
00:24:32,158 --> 00:24:34,076
I won't let you ruin
the play for them!

403
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:37,079
They've worked too hard for
you to go and spoil it!

404
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,956
Well, aren't you an old softie!

405
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:42,209
You know, that kind of attitude
might get you killed someday.

406
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:43,252
Oh yeah?

407
00:24:43,252 --> 00:24:46,630
Well you're not getting through,
not over my dead body.
