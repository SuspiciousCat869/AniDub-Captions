[Music]

2
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:45,969
Uh-oh...

3
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:47,118
Guess I was a little
too hard on you...

4
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:48,787
Gotta learn to
dodge, my boy...

5
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:49,788
Take a break...

6
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:52,332
You probably need
the time to recharge.

7
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:59,005
Can you let me down
gently next time??

8
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:00,423
You stay here and rest.

9
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:02,092
I'm going to go
get us some lunch.

10
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:04,970
I'm gonna die out here...

11
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,887
I never should've agreed

12
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:07,639
to do this special
training with him.

13
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:10,350
There's gotta be another
way to defeat Ryuto.

14
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,978
I wanna hear the voices of my
loved ones one more time...

15
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:14,020
Honoka...

16
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,063
Mother...

17
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:16,231
Father...

18
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:17,566
Miu...

19
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:18,775
Man this sucks...

20
00:02:18,775 --> 00:02:20,652
I can't get any kind
of reception out here

21
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:23,446
in the middle of nowhere.

22
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:24,906
Oh my god...!

23
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:26,366
It's a miracle...!

24
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:28,326
The good Lord above has
recognized my dying wish

25
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:32,539
and has granted this lost
soul with a single bar!

26
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:34,499
Looks like I have to stay
like this or I lose it...

27
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:36,293
I better hurry
and call someone.

28
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:40,880
An email...?
But who's it from??

29
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,299
Niijima...?..?...!

30
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:45,051
He's the last person I
wanna hear from before I die.

31
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:47,637
This blows!

32
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:49,014
He's still lively.

33
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:51,683
His endurance must come from
the other master's training.

34
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:55,270
There's something weird
about this email...

35
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,813
I really wish I'd
had the opportunity

36
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:58,148
to tell you this before...

37
00:02:58,148 --> 00:02:59,232
But you kept surprising me

38
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:01,026
so I didn't have
the chance to...

39
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:02,360
You see, I've always believed

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,030
that each person has a role
they play in the game of life...

41
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,281
Kenichi...

42
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:07,324
There are the wimps
who are bullied

43
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:09,117
and the bullies
that abuse them.

44
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:10,535
There are the people
who give orders

45
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:12,329
and the people
who follow them.

46
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:15,040
Each person's role has
been predetermined by God

47
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,709
and handed down to them
when they were born.

48
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,336
Or so I thought.

49
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:22,672
Your existence has shaken the
very foundation of my beliefs...

50
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:24,799
I've done plenty of
research on the human race

51
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,134
and as far as I'm concerned

52
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:29,346
your species is no better
than a mindless amoeba.

53
00:03:29,346 --> 00:03:30,764
However, you rose
above the others

54
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:32,933
and became a
charismatic hero...

55
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:33,933
And it happened simply

56
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:37,228
because of your hard
work and conviction.

57
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:39,105
Watching you transform
into a champion

58
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:41,191
gave me a brilliant idea...

59
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:42,567
I knew that one day

60
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,444
I wanted to form a martial
arts group with you

61
00:03:44,444 --> 00:03:46,154
as their leader, Kenichi...

62
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:48,239
I wanted to see just
how high losers-

63
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,616
like you used to
be- could climb

64
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:51,868
if they were given
the proper training...

65
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:54,663
I have no doubt you'll be
able to defeat Ryuto Asamiya-

66
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:56,373
I wish I could be
there to see it...

67
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:58,458
Your friend... Haruo Niijima.

68
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,085
Niijima...

69
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:01,878
Crap! Where'd you
come from...?..?...!

70
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:04,130
Quit sneaking up on me!

71
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,133
Well, that certainly is
a strange email, huh??

72
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,885
Yeah... it freaks me out...

73
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:10,887
I'm kinda worried
about him...

74
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,263
No matter what
was going down,

75
00:04:12,263 --> 00:04:14,182
he'd never tell
anyone his plans.

76
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:15,725
Is that so...

77
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:17,060
It sounded like...

78
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,521
he's saying... goodbye.

79
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:20,313
Goodbye??

80
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:35,036
We're completely surrounded...!

81
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:38,957
If these goons attack all at
once we're gonna be dead meat.

82
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:39,916
Commander...

83
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,376
Have you gotten a
response from that email

84
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:43,169
you sent Captain Shirahama yet?

85
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:44,796
We could really use his
help at a time like this.

86
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:47,966
He's not coming...

87
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,677
Oh, I get it...

88
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:53,471
You didn't email him
after all, did you sir??

89
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,472
Matsui...

90
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:55,598
I understand...

91
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:57,392
There's no reason to
get him involved-

92
00:04:57,392 --> 00:04:58,685
we can handle
this ourselves!

93
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:02,188
We'll bust through that wall

94
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:03,815
of dirty thugs and
head to freedom, sir!

95
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:05,108
Matsui...

96
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:06,109
uh...

97
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:10,071
Molotov cocktails??!

98
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:12,490
Burn the place down!

99
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:18,455
Damn it, they wanna
burn us to a crisp!

100
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:20,165
We don't have a
choice- open the door!

101
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:22,417
I'll make a grand escape
right under Loki's nose

102
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,419
just like
Yoshihiro Shimazu!

103
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:29,466
So who's this
Yoshihiro Shimazu guy??

104
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:31,176
During the battle
of Sekigahara,

105
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:32,719
General Shimazu was surrounded

106
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:35,346
by thousands of
Ieyasu Tokugawa's men

107
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:36,890
yet he valiantly escaped

108
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,308
by charging straight
through them!

109
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:52,864
Hey Commander...

110
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:54,115
I don't think we're gonna
get through these guys.

111
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:55,617
It's wall of Loki!

112
00:05:56,993 --> 00:05:59,287
That's right and it's a wall
that you and your little buddy

113
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:00,705
are never gonna
break through...

114
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:02,081
Now boys.

115
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:06,711
Elder...

116
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:09,339
I have to get back home
immediately, I'm sorry.

117
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:11,341
What...? But we still
haven't finished

118
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:12,884
all of your
training yet, son.

119
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:14,719
My friend is in a
lot of trouble...!

120
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:16,179
I just know it...

121
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,764
Niijima's... not the kinda guy

122
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:19,307
who'd write an email
like that sincere

123
00:06:19,307 --> 00:06:20,642
unless it was
something serious!

124
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:22,811
We've been in the same
classes since middle school.

125
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:24,896
He's been there next to
me through everything ...

126
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:27,148
Well, even though
he picked on me...

127
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:28,983
I probably know
Haruo Niijima better

128
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:31,194
than I know anyone else!

129
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:32,570
I guess he's learned enough

130
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,949
to face any delinquent
he may encounter.

131
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:38,952
Okay... I'll make an exception
and end your training early.

132
00:06:38,952 --> 00:06:39,953
Thanks!

133
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:41,246
However, it's
going to take us

134
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:44,624
at least nine hours of
travel to get back home.

135
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:46,960
I knew it was too
good to be true!

136
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,795
Well... Now that
I think about it

137
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:51,756
there is a way that'll only
take us five hours instead.

138
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,550
Five? That's like
half the time...!

139
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,968
Cool...! Let's do it!

140
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:56,636
But... while it is much faster

141
00:06:56,636 --> 00:06:58,304
I'm afraid there's a catch...

142
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:01,891
I can't guarantee that...
you'll live through it.

143
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:02,767
Say wha??

144
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:06,187
I'll just have to
take that chance...

145
00:07:06,187 --> 00:07:08,481
I can't waste
another second!

146
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,649
Pack up your stuff.

147
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:11,025
Yes, sir!

148
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:13,152
As soon as he learned his
friend was in trouble

149
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:15,238
he perked up immediately.

150
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:18,324
Ryozanpaku couldn't have
asked for a better disciple.

151
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,830
I can't hold them back
much longer, Commander-

152
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,456
get out of here
while you still can!

153
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:26,374
Matsui!

154
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:29,460
I've never seen a commander

155
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,337
so worried about his
subordinates.

156
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:32,463
Number 20!

157
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,051
Hey let me go!

158
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:43,975
What the hell??!

159
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:45,435
I'm a real sumo...

160
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:48,396
My name is... Thor!

161
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:51,774
Damn it...

162
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:53,359
Not you.

163
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:54,527
Now listen up punks-

164
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:55,778
I'm here here to
protect the commander

165
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:57,906
at the request of my good
buddy, Siegfriedfried...

166
00:07:57,906 --> 00:08:01,451
As of today I'm a member
of the Shinpaku Alliance.

167
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:03,453
And what do you think you're
gonna do on your own.....?...

168
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:04,787
You'll die in vain...

169
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:06,789
Just as ugly and
stupid as ever.

170
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:07,790
You're a dummy!

171
00:08:10,084 --> 00:08:11,920
Okay, I may not be as smart...

172
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,129
as you...

173
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:14,797
But I'm not the only
one "stupid" enough

174
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:16,132
to confront you Loki.

175
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:25,683
I never thought
he'd actually come!

176
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:31,314
You never said anything about
running 100 miles an hour

177
00:08:31,314 --> 00:08:32,690
on electrical wires.

178
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,776
I really am gonna die
before I ever make it home.

179
00:08:34,776 --> 00:08:37,195
Don't worry- as long
as you keep holding on

180
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:38,321
everything'll be fine.

181
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:39,864
This is the fastest
way to get there

182
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:41,574
so just hang tight, okay??

183
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:44,035
This may be the fastest way
but it's dangerous.....!...

184
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:45,495
My hands are slipping!

185
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:48,790
Save me, Elder!

186
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,540
Uh-oh.

187
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:56,965
The former Sixth Fist, Hermit,

188
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:59,050
and the former
Seventh Fist, Thor...

189
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,301
I don't get it...

190
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:01,636
Why are they ditching us

191
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:04,013
to join up with that
alien freak's Alliance??!

192
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:08,184
So what happened to your
allegiance to Ragnarok-

193
00:09:08,184 --> 00:09:10,728
are you just gonna trade it
out for the Shinpaku, Hermit??

194
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:12,689
This has nothing
to do with them...

195
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:15,608
The only reason I'm here
is to exact my revenge...

196
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:17,068
I'm gonna make you pay

197
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:19,696
for using the Great Saint of
Fist's name to try to trick me.

198
00:09:20,905 --> 00:09:22,198
Hey... So Thor...

199
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:24,450
I heard through the grapevine
you swore to Shirahama

200
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,244
that you were never
gonna fight again.

201
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:30,415
That's true...

202
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:31,499
I did...

203
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:33,543
But... Who says
that I'm fighting-

204
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:35,211
can't a guy get in a
little sumo sparring

205
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:36,462
every once in a while.

206
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,465
Better watch out.....!...

207
00:09:39,465 --> 00:09:41,509
Thor can be quite the
brute when he's sparring

208
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,177
so I suggest you
keep a safe distant

209
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:44,595
unless you wanna
get your ass kicked?

210
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,268
Number 3! Number 4!

211
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:03,823
Damn... At this rate

212
00:10:03,823 --> 00:10:05,867
we're never gonna be able to
make it to the main event...

213
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:08,328
Now.....! All of
you surround Hermit!

214
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,080
Don't even try!

215
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:27,013
It'll be a tough fight if
I go head-to-head with him.

216
00:10:27,013 --> 00:10:29,682
I'll have to think up a
way to wear him out first.

217
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:32,185
What are you waiting
for.....?..?...!

218
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:33,728
Go attack him... now!

219
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:37,482
Coming through!

220
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:41,527
Whoa... man this is
really messed up...

221
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:43,446
The only reason
I came out here is

222
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,281
cause I thought we could
totally roast 'em.....!...

223
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:46,699
But those guys
have got us beat...

224
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:47,825
I'm out!

225
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:48,993
Yeah!

226
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:53,373
Hey we were just
joking about leaving.

227
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:55,583
We'll go back to
our positions now.

228
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,293
Those two just had
to get in the way...

229
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:04,926
The First Fist, Odin...

230
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:07,261
And the Second Fist,
Berserker...

231
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,894
Whoa... That Berserker guy
and the number one dude

232
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:30,978
just showed up...

233
00:11:30,978 --> 00:11:33,272
No.....!... I think
this is the end.

234
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:35,900
What the hell do you
think you're doing, Loki?

235
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,318
I thought I told
you to capture

236
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:39,779
the leader of the
Shinpaku Alliance?

237
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,782
Why have you gathered all
of their subordinates??

238
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:45,242
I wanted to make
sure I got the guy.

239
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:47,286
Quit coming up with these
ridiculous plans-

240
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:49,705
would you simply follow my
orders for once.....?...

241
00:11:49,705 --> 00:11:51,666
You're completely
useless...

242
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,125
Now go...

243
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,460
I'm through with you.

244
00:11:56,796 --> 00:11:59,173
It's a bit early but I
guess it can't be helped.

245
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:02,259
I think you're the useless
one around here, Odin.

246
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:03,594
What'd you say??

247
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:04,553
Let me out of here!

248
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:08,349
I'm... leaving!

249
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:10,142
Ow...! Let me go...! Now!

250
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:13,396
I thought that I told
you to lie down??

251
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:15,314
You're not going anywhere
while you're hurt.....!...

252
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:16,315
Kensei... the needle!

253
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,484
O-kay...

254
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:19,235
Go to sleep.

255
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:22,279
This kid's a lively
one, isn't he?

256
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,240
He broke three ribs and
he's still going strong.

257
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,408
That's impressive!

258
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:27,243
He seems to be really
worried about his comrades

259
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:29,328
for some reason.

260
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:31,330
Well, I'll let you
worry about this one...

261
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,456
I've got my hands full

262
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:33,791
trying to help the
girl Miu brought back.

263
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,084
I'm busya...

264
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:36,168
I've already treated her-

265
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:37,712
she doesn't need your help...

266
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:39,296
Leave the rest to Miu.

267
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:41,465
The last thing the girl needs
is someone gawking at her.

268
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:44,176
I hope that somehow this'll
keep you from having a scar.

269
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:45,928
Thanks but I don't care.

270
00:12:45,928 --> 00:12:47,179
Not too bad.

271
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:48,723
Oh, sorry my hand slipped.

272
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:51,642
Very fast Kensei,
but you still didn't get me.

273
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:52,977
I have to go!

274
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:55,271
So where's the needle?

275
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:56,397
Let's try this again.

276
00:12:56,397 --> 00:12:58,399
But... there's
nothing else I can do-

277
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,526
I've already
tried everything!

278
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:03,696
Somehow he's able to fight
the effects of my acupuncture.

279
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:05,364
Talk about conviction...

280
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:06,449
Let me leave.....!...

281
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:07,658
I must go....!

282
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:09,493
I have to help them.....!

283
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:10,953
Are you sure you
can't let him go??

284
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:18,836
She went and
put on a robe...

285
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:20,087
I mean, the Shinpaku Alliance

286
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:22,631
is having their final face-off
with Ragnarok right now.

287
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:24,049
She's right

288
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:26,093
and we should probably try
to get a hold of Kenichi

289
00:13:26,093 --> 00:13:28,012
so he can be there... To help

290
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:29,138
Captain Shirahama...?..?...!

291
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:30,222
I'll call him.....!...

292
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:31,974
I'll ask him to come
home... right now...

293
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:33,267
We need him!

294
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:35,519
The last time we let you
use the phone to call someone

295
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,979
it caused some trouble...

296
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,898
You got so excited
making the call

297
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:40,399
you exhausted
yourself completely.

298
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,693
If I didn't call Thor
they'd be dead.....!...

299
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:44,069
Now give me the phone!

300
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:46,030
The telephone! Telephone!
Telephone! Telephone!

301
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,823
Jeez this is annoying-
knock him out!

302
00:13:47,823 --> 00:13:49,700
Now calm down, Akisame.

303
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,702
He's too weak for
any more acupuncture.

304
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:53,204
Please let him
go, doctor...

305
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:54,455
He just wants to
help his friends.

306
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:59,126
As a fellow fighter I'm
compelled to let him go...

307
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:00,920
But as a doctor I know
that he's in no condition...

308
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:06,467
What're you gonna do when
you get there.....?...

309
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:09,261
Just to sitsitting up I took
almost all of your energy.

310
00:14:09,261 --> 00:14:11,847
I may not be able to fight
with them... even so...

311
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:13,599
I can cheer for them.....!

312
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,850
Shinpa... ku.....!...

313
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,812
Still going...

314
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:20,105
And he should be
in a lot of pain.

315
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:21,899
Yeah.....!... Go-

316
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,275
Apa!

317
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:25,069
Apachai...

318
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:26,946
Opera boy can go
cheer on his buddies

319
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:28,531
as long as he follows
the doctor's orders

320
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:30,241
and stays in bed,
right.....?...

321
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:32,201
This is the perfect way
to make that happen.

322
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:34,662
Apachai will be very careful
not to hurt singing man

323
00:14:34,662 --> 00:14:36,121
and will put him
somewhere safe.

324
00:14:37,122 --> 00:14:38,791
I swear it's like
talking to children-

325
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,501
none of you has
any common sense.

326
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:42,044
Come on, doctor,
don't say that...

327
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:44,046
We all mean well-

328
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:45,923
Akisame... I understand...

329
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:47,383
If you really don't
want us to go...

330
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:49,260
then we'll stay
here, okay??

331
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,678
Nonsense!

332
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:52,763
Personally, I love going
against common sense

333
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:54,223
whenever I get
the opportunity.

334
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:57,518
What a hypocrite.

335
00:14:57,518 --> 00:15:00,145
I said you're the useless
one around here, Odin.

336
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:02,106
After all, you're the one
who's allowed the Fists

337
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:03,315
to fall apart...

338
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:05,609
You're the leader so you
should take responsibility.

339
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:07,403
I'd be careful.

340
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:08,487
Now.....!...

341
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:10,114
Listen up, soldiers
of Ragnarok!

342
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:12,157
I have an announcement!

343
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:13,576
As some of you may know,

344
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:16,120
Freya of the Three of Cards
has been defeated...

345
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,329
How'd it happen?

346
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:19,790
Because of the negligence
of the First Fist.

347
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,126
He has proven he is an
ineffective leader...

348
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:23,586
Which means
this is the end.

349
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:25,963
Ragnarok is now... dead!

350
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:27,006
No way...

351
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,924
He can't call it
like that, can he??

352
00:15:28,924 --> 00:15:30,885
You know, I was always
a little suspicious

353
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:32,469
of that bastard, Loki.

354
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:39,429
I see... we were the
distraction he was using

355
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:41,264
while he was forming
his own team, eh??

356
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:49,522
Whoa.....!...
Who are they.....?..?...!

357
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:50,898
That's a pretty
scary lookin' bunch!

358
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:54,986
I'd like to introduce you
to the fighters I've trained

359
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:57,196
to pick up where
Ragnarok left off...

360
00:15:57,196 --> 00:15:58,489
The new Eight
Deadly Fists!

361
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:01,242
He's not serious, is he??!

362
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:02,910
So... they're the
Fists.....?..?...!

363
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,078
What the hell's going on??!

364
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:06,664
And their... new leader is...

365
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:12,420
Berserker, you're the one
who's right for the job.

366
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,340
I'm perfectly fine with
being second in command.

367
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:29,228
Everyone... I present to you

368
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:31,230
a fighting force to
be reckoned with...!

369
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,191
The reincarnation
of the Fists

370
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:35,651
and their new and
improved Ragnarok gang!

371
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:39,030
What.....?... He's seriously
created a whole new gang??!

372
00:16:40,323 --> 00:16:41,407
Loki...

373
00:16:43,951 --> 00:16:45,161
Listen up, men.

374
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:46,788
You have a
decision to make.

375
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,873
You're either going to side
with the new Ragnarok...

376
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:51,334
or with Odin and
his leftovers.

377
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:53,920
That bastard...

378
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,214
This must have been
his plan all along.

379
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,508
This is really
bad, Commander...

380
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:01,469
Now we've got a whole new set
of bad guys to worry about.

381
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:05,181
Yeah... However this moment of
disorganization and confusion

382
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:07,225
may be our only
chance of survival.

383
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:09,185
So... what should we do??

384
00:17:09,185 --> 00:17:10,228
Why're you asking
me.....?..?...!

385
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:11,354
I don't know!

386
00:17:11,354 --> 00:17:12,480
One more thing,...

387
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,857
If you guys decide
not to follow me...

388
00:17:14,857 --> 00:17:18,778
Then you'll have to answer
to the new Eight Deadly Fists.

389
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:21,572
And don't forget that
Berserker has sided with me...

390
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:24,325
Freya has been defeated by
the Shinpaku Alliance...

391
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:27,078
Which means all that the old
Ragnarok has left is Odin...

392
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:28,830
The Three of
Cards are done.

393
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,541
Now... surround
Odin immediately!

394
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,792
It's not like we really
have a choice-

395
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:35,002
they'll kick our ass
if we don't join 'em.

396
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:36,170
Yeah... guess you're right.

397
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:46,639
Looks like Loki's
won by a landslide.

398
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:48,850
It'd work out better for
us if they'd split into two

399
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,601
and then just
beat each other up.

400
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:53,229
Maybe I can brainwash them
into doing exactly that.

401
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:55,022
Let's check it out.

402
00:17:55,022 --> 00:17:57,108
Niijima eye!

403
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:59,068
I'm simply using
my alien ability

404
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:01,154
to assess each
fighter's power levels.

405
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:02,363
This'll also let me know

406
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:04,031
if their susceptible
to brainwashing.

407
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,412
Whoa, what's up
with Berserker?!

408
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:12,290
I've never seen anything
like this before!

409
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,292
You still refuse to
surrender, Odin.....?...

410
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,335
Hey... Why don't you
try to say something

411
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:18,212
that might convince
your old pal to give up?

412
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:30,933
Oh crap.....!...

413
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,727
What the hell's going on,
Commander.....?..?...!

414
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:34,729
Did the new gang
fall apart already??!

415
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:35,938
That's not it.

416
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:37,356
You bastard!

417
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:46,699
Berserker totally pulled
one over on Loki-

418
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:49,118
he never planned on joining
the new Ragnarok gang.

419
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,580
Damn it, Berserker...

420
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,124
I thought you were ready
to come to our side.

421
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:57,001
I would never... join... you.

422
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:01,380
I was simply positioning
myself closer to you

423
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,174
so that I would have
an opening to attack.

424
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:12,642
You had enough??

425
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:17,313
Damn... You You bbastard.

426
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:21,108
I've known about your plan

427
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:23,528
and I warned Berserker
not to get involved...

428
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:24,904
But... even if I hadn't,

429
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:27,740
there's no way he ever would
ever be controlled by you.

430
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,367
What the hell is wrong
with you....?..?...!

431
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:31,744
I was gonna make you the
new Ragnarok's number one.

432
00:19:31,744 --> 00:19:33,412
I have no interest
in a ranking...

433
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:34,539
You're a loser...

434
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:38,084
I'will only serve someone
I can respect... not you.

435
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,293
What?

436
00:19:49,595 --> 00:19:54,016
Loki... Are you okay??!

437
00:19:54,016 --> 00:19:56,269
Damn it...! I was
supposed to be the one

438
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:57,979
to take him down
not you, Berserker!

439
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,522
I beat you to it...

440
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:02,024
Looks like you'll have
to take me on instead.

441
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:03,442
Fine then.

442
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:05,236
We're done playing games...

443
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:07,238
Surround the Shinpaku!

444
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:09,198
Berserker and Hermit
are going to face off

445
00:20:09,198 --> 00:20:10,783
and I don't want
them interfering.

446
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:13,703
C'mon... We'd better do
whatever Odin says...

447
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:14,453
Let's go!

448
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:18,124
He's not playing
around, is he??

449
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:19,750
Be careful what you
say, Captain Thor.

450
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,002
We don't wanna
piss 'em off.

451
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,837
Odin's got complete
control over them-

452
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:25,798
a second ago they were
totally confused.

453
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:27,300
These guys are
out for blood.

454
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,010
You can see it
in their faces.

455
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,304
This is gonna mean
big trouble for us.

456
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:34,307
Hermit...

457
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:36,392
Do you really think you
can confront the two of us

458
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:39,395
and walk away
completely unscathed??

459
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:42,148
You know, I could say the
same thing to you, Odin.

460
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:43,691
Hermit and Thor
aren't gonna be enough

461
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:45,484
to get us out of this.

462
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:47,236
How about you
leave Hermit to me.

463
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:50,865
That's fine- I know you've
been looking forward to this

464
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:52,408
for some time now...

465
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:53,826
We'll take care
of these guys

466
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:55,536
once you've
finished Hermit off.

467
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,957
Our chances of survival are
getting slimmer by the second!

468
00:20:59,957 --> 00:21:02,168
Niijima...

469
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:03,961
I'll create a path
for you to escape...

470
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:05,379
Just make sure you
stay behind me...

471
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,134
Outta my way!

472
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,438
It's over.

473
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:24,398
The Shintoukei??!

474
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:26,359
The Shintoukei is a
powerful attack

475
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,569
that causes internal
damage to an opponent.

476
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:30,321
This technique is not
easily mastered-

477
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:32,281
it requires a great
deal of training.

478
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,701
The Shintoukei...

479
00:21:35,701 --> 00:21:38,287
I believe that's what it's
called in Kenpo, isn't it??

480
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:41,248
Hey!

481
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,458
Are you gonna
fight me or what??

482
00:21:46,837 --> 00:21:48,756
Thor... No wonder
you were a Fist.

483
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:51,008
Your strength is really
quite impressive.

484
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:53,427
Now...! Go Niijima...!

485
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:54,845
I made a promise
to Siegfried

486
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,472
that I would protect
you at all costs!

487
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:59,016
No... Thor!

488
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:00,226
Are you sure.....?...

489
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:02,061
You've sustained
a lot of damage...

490
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:04,814
This blow just just
might be the end of you.

491
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:06,565
That's not gonna happen...

492
00:22:06,565 --> 00:22:08,401
Not before I
smash you to bits!

493
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:10,152
Sorry, Thor.... Goodbye.

494
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:18,869
What now??!

495
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:21,414
Ow! Man, that hurt.....!...

496
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:22,998
Jeez, I wish the
Elder would figure out

497
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:24,542
how to let me
down more gently.

498
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:33,384
Hey you guys.....?...

499
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:34,844
You okay??

500
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:36,470
Its... Kenichi!

501
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,264
Captain Shirahama's here!

502
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:41,934
Kenichi Shirahama...

503
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:43,769
You haven't changed-

504
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:46,147
You're just as stubborn
as you were before.

505
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:58,451
[Music]

506
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:20,241
How dare you?!

507
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:22,117
How could you do
that to my friends?!

508
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:23,661
I'll never forgive
you for this!

509
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,621
Now I'm gonna take
you on Berserker!

510
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:26,872
Let's go!

511
00:24:26,872 --> 00:24:28,874
No Kenichi!
This isn't your fight.

512
00:24:28,874 --> 00:24:31,043
You've got more important
things to worry about.

513
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:33,128
Tanimoto! What the hell
are you doing here??!

514
00:24:33,128 --> 00:24:34,672
That doesn't
matter right now.

515
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,382
You've been in the
mountains training

516
00:24:36,382 --> 00:24:37,925
so that you could
beat Odin, right?!

517
00:24:37,925 --> 00:24:40,302
Well, this is your chance-
just concentrate on him!

518
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:42,012
But what about Berserker??!

519
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:43,889
Don't worry.
I'll take care of him.

520
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:45,808
I've been dying to get
my hands on that bastard.

521
00:24:45,808 --> 00:24:47,184
For a while now.
