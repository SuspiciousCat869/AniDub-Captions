1
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:48,633
Hm! Well, it's Takeda.

2
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:51,469
Ah! Hey gorgeous,
long time no see.

3
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:54,263
The name's Kisara,
you gutless traitor.

4
00:01:54,263 --> 00:01:58,267
What a loser! C'mon,
guys, let's get him!

5
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:02,229
Hold on. Let me handle it.

6
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,815
Ukita...

7
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:06,442
That's how it is?

8
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:15,534
I know I promised Kenichi,
but I gotta do this on my own.

9
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,838
Ukita! What are you doing?!

10
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:43,104
What's wrong with you?!

11
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:45,189
As of right now, I,
Ukita the Thrower,

12
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:47,274
officially resign from Ragnarok!

13
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:49,902
So, do any of you ladies
got a problem with that?

14
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,507
Ah, the Puncher.

15
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:13,801
And they called you that even
when you were only using

16
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:15,553
your right hand,
didn't they?

17
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:19,557
What a pity...

18
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:22,977
Seems like such a shame to
destroy a fighter like you.

19
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:24,812
You know, I heard about you.

20
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:26,522
I guess you expect me
to congratulations you

21
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:30,317
on your promotion, huh?

22
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:33,904
The Eighth Fist of Ragnarok,
Kisara Nanjo.

23
00:03:33,904 --> 00:03:35,531
She's a formidable opponent,

24
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,825
but I have no intention
of being defeated.

25
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:39,452
No way in hell.

26
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:01,682
He's somewhere along
this rail line.

27
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:05,478
But that's still a lot
of ground to cover.

28
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,729
Where?

29
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:08,272
Where could he be?

30
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:11,400
Takeda!

31
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,943
Kenichi!

32
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:17,239
I found them! They're
right over there!

33
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,240
Miu?!

34
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,618
How did you manage to get
all the way up there?!

35
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:22,078
They're in that alley way!

36
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:23,537
You could easily run right by it

37
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:25,623
if you didn't know
where to look!

38
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,886
You'd think I'd be used
to stuff like this by now,

39
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:41,138
but I still can't get over it!

40
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:43,599
We gotta hurry!

41
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:44,892
She's right.

42
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:47,478
Or else...

43
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:48,938
Hang in there, Takeda!

44
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:50,731
Just a little longer!

45
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:02,284
Eat steel!

46
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:16,215
That was pretty weak.
Are you guys done?

47
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,092
Impressive.

48
00:05:18,092 --> 00:05:20,636
Takeda the Puncher...

49
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:23,639
Ukita the Thrower...

50
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,935
Those cheap punks were no match
for the likes of you, were they?

51
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,981
But I can take both of you on.

52
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:35,317
Hm. Call me old-fashioned,
but it's against my principles

53
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:40,489
to fight a woman. Though I
guess I don't have a choice.

54
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:43,909
Stand back. Let me
handle this broad!

55
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:56,672
Eat this!

56
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:04,597
Ukita!

57
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,227
Okay...

58
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:11,437
Next.

59
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,154
Legs are much
stronger than arms,

60
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:23,491
about three times as strong.

61
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:25,993
She's fast! Real fast!

62
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:31,081
Axe Kick!

63
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:42,510
Also, when it comes to down and
dirty street fighting like this,

64
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,596
never underestimate a
woman wearing boots.

65
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:48,015
They're pretty much
deadly weapons.

66
00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:50,935
Incredible! I can't believe
she changed the direction

67
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:52,811
of her kick
in mid-air!

68
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:55,272
So tell me, how did you
like your first taste

69
00:06:55,272 --> 00:06:58,943
of the power of the
Eighth Deadly Fist of Ragnarok?

70
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:00,361
Oh, man!

71
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:02,613
No wonder they promoted
her to Eighth Fist!

72
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:04,365
She's unstoppable!

73
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:07,034
Don't go into a fight
assuming that you'll lose.

74
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:09,787
Ah! Attack before your opponent!

75
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:11,038
Come on, faster!

76
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,625
Kenichi isn't like you, Takeda,
he has absolutely no natural

77
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,877
aptitude for the
martial arts at all.

78
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:20,422
But, also unlike you, he
doesn't give up or give in.

79
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:26,178
My..

80
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:28,973
Still able to stand after
that kick in the head?

81
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:34,979
I'm kind of impressed. But I
should expect that from you.

82
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:39,233
Actually all I'd like to do now
is lie down and take a long nap.

83
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:41,360
But I can't do that yet.

84
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:45,322
She dodged it!

85
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,220
Aw, that's too bad but try
not to be hard on yourself.

86
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,056
That was a very good effort,

87
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:14,226
Takeda the Puncher.

88
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:18,063
Damn it. If Ukita thinks he
can get away with tossing me

89
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:21,150
around like a sack of rice,
he's got another thing coming.

90
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,067
What the--

91
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,402
Huh?

92
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,529
You're too late as usual, Koga!

93
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:26,739
Yeah, the show's over,

94
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:31,118
Kisara took these guys
apart all by herself.

95
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:32,870
Too bad ya missed it!

96
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:40,127
The show's not over yet,
not by a long shot!

97
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:44,548
Because guess what,
it's payback time!

98
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:47,426
I mean, if it's okay
with you, Kisara.

99
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:52,848
Go ahead, do
whatever you want.

100
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:59,897
Aw, Takeda, you
don't look so good.

101
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:05,152
You always treated me like I
was some snot-nosed little kid.

102
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:06,987
You guys! Don't
just stand there,

103
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:08,864
let's beat the crap
out of these clowns!

104
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:10,866
Yeah!

105
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,451
Let's do it!

106
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,421
Like this?

107
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:26,882
Yeah, yeah, that'll be fine.

108
00:09:26,882 --> 00:09:28,801
I still can't believe
you threw me like that

109
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:32,888
all of a sudden, buddy.
That was really rude, ya know.

110
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:34,306
You were always
pushing me around

111
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:37,851
because you were
such a "big man".

112
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:41,021
It's funny though, you don't
look big at all now, do ya?

113
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:43,482
You know, when you factor
out the height advantage,

114
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:47,027
I bet I'm really a whole
lot stronger than you are.

115
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:48,862
And now I'm gonna prove it

116
00:09:48,862 --> 00:09:53,409
by breaking that arm
of yours like a twig.

117
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:54,827
Hold him nice and steady.

118
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:59,206
Wait, You're not gonna jump
from way up there are ya?

119
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:03,210
Sure, how else am I gonna
be able to get the job done?

120
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,588
If I don't jump from
all the way up here,

121
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:09,633
I might not break
it in one shot.

122
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:12,302
Wouldn't that be lame?

123
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:15,222
Now, "Ukita the Thrower",
you'll see how strong

124
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:17,391
"Koga the Kicker" really is!

125
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:18,892
Here we...

126
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:33,157
That kid again!

127
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:56,138
Wha? Is that Kenichi?

128
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:08,317
You bastards. I promise you...

129
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:14,072
...you are all gonna pay!

130
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:50,423
General! All present
and accounted for, sir!

131
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:52,008
Perfect.

132
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:55,720
This is our chance to clean
up Kisara's entire crew.

133
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,472
Look out, world!

134
00:11:57,472 --> 00:12:00,266
My time has finally arrived!

135
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:14,989
You guys aren't gonna
get away with this!

136
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:16,616
You cowardly bastards!

137
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:21,120
Well, well, I must
say kid, you're good.

138
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,248
Looks like somebody's
gonna have to put you

139
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:26,000
in your place, and it looks like
that somebody's gonna be me.

140
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,089
Not so fast, if you please.

141
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:34,467
Sorry, but Kenichi has a rule
about never fighting with women.

142
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,970
So it looks like you're gonna
have to take me on,

143
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,431
Miss Hot-shot.

144
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:43,852
For Pete's sake.
R'you for real?

145
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:11,838
I don't know who
you are, Blondie.

146
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:15,466
but I already know
that I don't like you.

147
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:19,470
You're gonna learn that bigger
ain't better, you dairy cow!

148
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,389
Dairy Cow?

149
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:27,020
Hey! Rabbit!

150
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,938
Where are you off to?

151
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:32,483
It's a nice day, so I thought
I'd get in a little golf.

152
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:35,945
You sure do play a lot.
Don't you ever get sick of it?

153
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:38,156
It's not like you've
ever broken par.

154
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:40,116
What are you talkin'
about? Look at you!

155
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:43,119
Don't ya get sick of milkin'
those cows everyday?

156
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:45,705
Well, it's not like the cows
are gonna milk themselves.

157
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:46,915
They're stupid.

158
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:50,001
Just like big-breasted
blondes! Know what I mean?

159
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:52,837
That's not true and you know
it, you long-eared freak!

160
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:56,549
Hey, hello, ass
kicking in progress!

161
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:00,136
If you interfere with me,
you're gonna get hurt.

162
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:02,472
Don't expect any mercy, amateur.

163
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:05,433
Did you really just call me a
dairy cow, you did didn't you,

164
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:06,517
don't try to deny it!

165
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:08,019
Oh, let it go, already.

166
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:10,855
I don't think I've ever been
this pissed off in my life.

167
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:13,316
Maybe this'll cool you down!

168
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:15,276
Come and get it!

169
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:28,998
Oh, my!

170
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:33,419
Where's all your big tough talk
now, Miss Martial Arts Queen?

171
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:36,255
She's pretty good.

172
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:38,549
Okay, cow, bring it!

173
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:59,779
So, are you looking for
anything in particular?

174
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,281
Where did he go?

175
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:03,116
Do you mean Kenichi?

176
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:03,783
Is he dead?

177
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:07,161
Don't think so. Last time I
checked, he was alive and well.

178
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:08,621
He went out to fight.

179
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:10,248
That's right!
He went out to protect

180
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:12,208
his friend from that
gang that was after him.

181
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:16,004
Hello, hello? Why you
not talk? Kenichi?

182
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:19,048
Guys, how come Kenichi
not answer his cell phone?

183
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:23,094
Apachai is starting
to get very worried.

184
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:27,223
Come on, what could
possibly go wrong?

185
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:30,476
Relax. Miu is with him,
he'll be just fine.

186
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:31,894
Yeah, you're right.

187
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:35,481
Shigure, would you take your
foot off my face, pretty please?

188
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:36,691
Sure.

189
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:48,244
Ukita...

190
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:50,747
Can you move yet?

191
00:15:50,747 --> 00:15:53,666
You're kidding, right?

192
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:57,378
Believe me, if I could move,
I'd have done it by now.

193
00:15:57,378 --> 00:16:00,840
Kenichi will never
give up the fight.

194
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,968
No matter what
happens to him...

195
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:06,846
he will never
give up the fight.

196
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:09,348
And that's, why I have'ta,

197
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:12,060
try to help him,
whatever the cost.

198
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,811
I've gotta stand by him...

199
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:18,441
to the very end.
No matter what...

200
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:21,569
Hey, enough with the fancy talk.

201
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:25,698
If you want my help, just
ask, stop talking so much.

202
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:28,534
You two losers should just lie
there and keep your mouths shut!

203
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:29,744
Ukita!

204
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:37,001
Bad time to get
distracted, buddy!

205
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:38,878
I see...

206
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:43,049
Ukita tried to help Takeda.

207
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:45,843
Deep down you've never
been a delinquent!

208
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:48,513
You're a boxer!

209
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:52,892
A true sportsman
belongs in the ring!

210
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:56,896
See ya, Takeda the Puncher!

211
00:16:56,896 --> 00:17:02,568
So Ragnarok went
after them both!

212
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:05,154
They're nothing...

213
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:08,908
...but a bunch of cowards!

214
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:12,870
That's it, you low-lifes have
really got me pissed off now!

215
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:24,799
Damn it! How'd I
get my foot stuck?!

216
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,843
Now's our chance! Let's get him!

217
00:17:26,843 --> 00:17:28,261
It's over!

218
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:37,937
It worked!

219
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:40,898
Master Sakaki's move worked!

220
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:44,610
H-he did it with
just one hand?

221
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,113
You just keep away from
me, you filthy freak!

222
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:50,116
You'll be sorry you messed
with Ragnarok this way!

223
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:53,077
We'll make you pay no
matter how long it takes!

224
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:54,495
Kenichi, you okay?!

225
00:17:54,495 --> 00:17:59,041
Don't turn your back
on me, Blondie!

226
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:03,087
I'm sorry, it's been
a lot of fun, but...

227
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:04,881
...it's time we finished this.

228
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:06,340
Right, Miss Sara?

229
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,595
You bimbo! Who are you to
tell me when we're through?

230
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:13,514
We're not done until
I say we're done!

231
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:16,851
And my name is Kisara, not Sara!

232
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:19,479
Don't bother. It's not
worth remembering.

233
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:22,148
That's enough out of you!

234
00:18:23,107 --> 00:18:24,317
Here we go!

235
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:27,987
She vanished?!

236
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,947
When I was looking
right at her?!

237
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:33,618
She can't have gone
left or right...

238
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:35,286
She's above me!

239
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:36,913
Behind you!

240
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,460
Oh, crap!

241
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,301
And that's that. I thought she'd
just be a cheap street punk,

242
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:52,261
but she was so much
better than I expected

243
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:55,431
that I got carried away
and forgot to hold back.

244
00:18:55,431 --> 00:19:00,102
If hadn't've put my foot there,
I could've actually killed her.

245
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:01,520
Kenichi!

246
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:17,231
Yo, yo, my brutha!
How's it going?

247
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:19,692
No freakin' way...

248
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:24,279
Your main man and best buddy
Niijima has come to back you up!

249
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,197
It's another gang!

250
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,657
Run!

251
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:30,327
Kisara, can you hear me?
You've got to get up!

252
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:32,955
Damn it! Everyone, retreat,
let's get out of here!

253
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,212
Should we give chase,
General Niijima?

254
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,381
Oh, no, that's all right,
I don't think we should rub

255
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,425
their faces in it, we can
afford to be generous

256
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:46,552
to those who run away
from us in abject terror

257
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,262
like whipped dogs.

258
00:19:48,262 --> 00:19:52,099
Our side achieved total
victory and none of my guys

259
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:55,728
even has so much as a
scratch to show for it!

260
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,689
Am I an evil genius or what?

261
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:00,357
Are you injured anywhere, sir?

262
00:20:00,357 --> 00:20:01,233
Uh, well I...

263
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,693
Here you go, how's that?

264
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:04,027
Oh, great, thank you.

265
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:08,240
Uh, Nijima? Who are
all these people?

266
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,826
What are you talking about?
These men are your new buddies!

267
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:13,287
They're a part of our team!

268
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:14,121
Say what?

269
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:16,832
They're our new possie,
you know, our homies.

270
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:19,251
Okay, you freakshow, wanna
tell me what you're up to?

271
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,211
Yeah, I'll explain later,
right now we have to get

272
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:23,630
Takeda and his
friend to a hospital.

273
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,967
Akisame should examine
you as soon as possible.

274
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:29,178
Takeda!

275
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:31,847
Have you been badly injured?

276
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:34,391
What about your arm?

277
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:35,768
I'm okay...

278
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,978
You see? It's fine.

279
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:40,481
Well, that's a relief.

280
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:42,858
But if your cell phone hadn't
speed dialed me by accident,

281
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:44,985
I never even would have
known you were in trouble,

282
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:46,195
let alone where you were!

283
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:49,907
What's the matter with you?
Why didn't you call me?

284
00:20:49,907 --> 00:20:54,244
I'm sorry, but I...

285
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:57,790
I didn't want you to
get mixed up in this.

286
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,416
Of course!

287
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,169
There's no way Takeda
would have called me!

288
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:04,922
This is exactly what
happened to him!

289
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:08,467
He went to save his
friend, and as a result,

290
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,469
he lost the use of his arm!

291
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,138
And therefore lost his
dream of a boxing career.

292
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,307
All because of a phone call.

293
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,602
Of course he wouldn't
have called me for help!

294
00:21:18,602 --> 00:21:22,689
I'm such an idiot!
I should've known!

295
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,775
Hey, Kenichi,

296
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:27,194
Ukita and I never gave up.

297
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:31,323
What's more: we've finally
put Ragnarok behind us.

298
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,033
There's no doubt,

299
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:37,913
injuries or no, victory is ours!

300
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:38,872
Yeah!

301
00:21:38,872 --> 00:21:40,999
Well, then, how shall I
summarize today's victory

302
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,168
for the next edition
of the paper?

303
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,295
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot, you
wanna explain this whole

304
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:47,881
'Shinpaku Alliance" thing
to me? And it better be good!

305
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:49,800
Well, I think it's pretty
obvious, if you take

306
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,885
the first characters of my
name and then tack on

307
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:53,971
the first characters of yours
you end up with "Shinpaku".

308
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:54,513
Cool, huh?

309
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,099
I can spell, you idiot, that's
not what I'm talking about!

310
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:58,642
Man, don't be such a whiner.

311
00:21:58,642 --> 00:22:01,144
Okay, okay, I get it,
you want top billing,

312
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:02,437
"Pakushin Alliance".

313
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:04,565
There, are you happy now?

314
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:06,191
I'm not talking
about the billing!

315
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,277
Alrighty, then, it's
the Shinpaku Alliance.

316
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:09,903
How's that sound?!

317
00:22:09,903 --> 00:22:14,116
Forget it! I'm going crazy
just talking to you!

318
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:17,202
Oh! I just remembered!

319
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,872
That friend of yours.
The boxer guy,

320
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:23,041
I heard Ragnarok's giving
him a farewell beatdown soon.

321
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,293
But when?!

322
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:27,045
I don't know the exact date.
Kisara will be there

323
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,756
along with a witness from
the Eight Deadly Fists.

324
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:32,217
One of the
Eight Deadly Fists? Who?

325
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:35,721
The Sixth Fist, the guy
who's also known as Hermit!

326
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:23,245
Reporting in, sir! There's
a suspicious character ahead

327
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:24,871
who appears to be
blocking our path!

328
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:28,041
A suspicious character, you say?
What kind of a fool thinks

329
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:32,087
he can stand against
the Shinpaku Alliance?

330
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:34,756
It's the
Sixth Deadly Fist, Hermit!

331
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:36,091
What should we do now, General?

332
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:38,218
Retreat! Everyone retreat!

333
00:24:38,218 --> 00:24:40,095
Retreat? But it's only one guy!

334
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:42,639
It doesn't matter!
Just shut up and run already!

335
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:45,559
Curses! We just formed
the Shinpaku Alliance,

336
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,644
and we're already
gonna be wiped out?
