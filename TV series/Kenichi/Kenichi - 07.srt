1
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:54,041
They are quite the
trinity of skill.

2
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,418
With Koga's swift kicks...

3
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:58,587
Ukita's throwing strength...

4
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,589
And of course...

5
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:06,678
Takeda's fearsome fists...

6
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:09,181
It's safe to say poor Kenichi

7
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,517
doesn't stand a
chance against them.

8
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:15,229
How sad, things were just
starting to interesting.

9
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:17,731
So this is Ragnarok, huh?

10
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:19,900
Even if they're a gang
of vicious thugs,

11
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,402
it's always best to root
for the winning team.

12
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:38,710
Yup, yup. You're
sprouting just fine.

13
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,087
Izumi?

14
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:42,881
I always thought you were kind
of quiet and glum, but,

15
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,925
you seem so lively
when you're here.

16
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:48,220
Sure, well it's
just so relaxing.

17
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,305
It's the one place I don't
have to worry about

18
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:51,557
some jerk trying to fight me.

19
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:53,767
It's like a total paradise!

20
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:56,353
You don't have to be
that lively about it.

21
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:57,938
If she only knew.

22
00:02:57,938 --> 00:03:00,816
I'm being hunted by that
Ragnarok gang 24/7.

23
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:04,027
And then every other second
of my life goes to training.

24
00:03:04,027 --> 00:03:06,363
I'm really gonna enjoy
making you bleed!

25
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:07,656
Here it comes!

26
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:10,409
He's evil!

27
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:16,373
Apa!

28
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:19,918
Although, there are some
good times here and there.

29
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:24,715
More, more!

30
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:26,884
There you go. You got it!

31
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:30,012
With encouragement like that,
I can't just up and quit.

32
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:33,432
Y'know, Kenichi?

33
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:34,433
Huh?

34
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,852
I've heard rumors that you're
the most ruthless fighter

35
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:38,770
in the whole school,
but I don't believe it.

36
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,648
You put so much thought and care
into nurturing these flowers,

37
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:44,401
and you somehow tolerate
that weird friend of yours.

38
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:48,071
So you've gotta be a
decent person, right?

39
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:50,449
Yeah sure, except I think
I've already told you

40
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:52,159
that I'm not actually
friends with Niijima.

41
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,455
He's more like a demon trying
to possess my friendship.

42
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:57,789
What's the matter?

43
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:00,459
I don't know. I just got
this weird sensation,

44
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,046
like I felt an evil
presence or something.

45
00:04:04,046 --> 00:04:06,632
Oh, how sad, Kenichi,
you must be delusional.

46
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:10,302
Too busy smelling the flowers to
realize your life's in danger.

47
00:04:10,302 --> 00:04:12,804
But if you want to spend
your time pushing daisies,

48
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:14,097
help is on the way.

49
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:19,811
It doesn't seem like your
Snow King orchid has grown much.

50
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:22,689
Nope. I chose it
because I like its name,

51
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:24,399
but it seems
pretty stubborn.

52
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,526
All of the other plants
are growing though.

53
00:04:26,526 --> 00:04:28,820
Maybe we should try
a different bog moss?

54
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,490
I guess some plants just can't
grow as quickly as others,

55
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,325
no matter how hard they try.

56
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:34,493
Huh?

57
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:36,495
It's not like it doesn't
want to grow...

58
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:38,997
It's not slacking
off or anything...

59
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:41,500
Please, just one time,
say that it can grow!

60
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,918
No.

61
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:46,713
No, Apachai, I haven't trained
enough yet to spar with you!

62
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:49,007
Helllooo?

63
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:50,258
Right, sorry!

64
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:54,137
I was just relating to what
this plant must be feeling.

65
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:56,890
Wow, you must have a
lot in common with it.

66
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,435
But, I kind of feel like I
can relate to it as well.

67
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:02,479
I'm a bit slow too, y'know.

68
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,315
It just takes me longer
to improve than most.

69
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:08,151
What, no way! But...

70
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:10,862
Maybe there are some of us that
aren't meant to do great things,

71
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:12,990
no matter how hard we try.

72
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:22,416
Are you ever gonna learn?
Keep your shoulder straight

73
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,710
or you're just asking to
get grabbed and thrown.

74
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,753
And you're gonna be singing
soprano real quick

75
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:28,672
if you don't keep
your thighs closed.

76
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:34,052
You're just not gettin' this.

77
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:39,766
You moron! Didn't you even
listen to what I was saying?!

78
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:42,185
You need to align your striking
fist with your blocking fist.

79
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:43,937
Move 'em together.
Try to imagine

80
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:45,939
they're connected by a
string pulling each other.

81
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:47,274
Like this.

82
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:50,110
See?

83
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,820
I can't do that!

84
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,072
Let's take a minute and compare
our arms, why don't we?

85
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:56,700
Your freakin muscles are
the size of my upper torso!

86
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,617
I mean, c'mon--

87
00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:59,411
For the last time, Sakaki, stop
smashing everything!

88
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:01,455
So what? You don't
need guns like mine

89
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:03,915
to throw a proper punch.
Hey, what's up?

90
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:06,501
You didn't hear
a word I just said.

91
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,588
Happy to help.

92
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:12,174
You've actually got more
muscle mass than Miu does.

93
00:06:12,174 --> 00:06:13,592
But watch.

94
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:21,725
Now, how many punches
did you just count?

95
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:26,855
Wow, awesome, that was three!
Three punches in one second!

96
00:06:26,855 --> 00:06:28,607
Nope, that was six.

97
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,029
Thanks for watching.

98
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:36,031
There are two primary
elements of karate.

99
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,325
The first, Nahate,
relies on strength.

100
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:39,826
But the second, Shurite,

101
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:41,995
emphasizes the speed
of your fists.

102
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:44,122
You've gotta learn
both to master karate.

103
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:46,500
But we'll just stick
with Shurite for now.

104
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,211
You know, if you want those
fists to fly faster, then

105
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:51,963
I've got the perfect Chinese
training method in store.

106
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,173
Back off, Kensei!

107
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:55,300
Can't you see that I'm
training him right now?

108
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,095
No! I see your time
is up and it's my turn.

109
00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:00,764
What? We hardly
accomplished anything.

110
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:03,141
That's not his fault.
Try teaching him something

111
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:05,769
next time instead of just
calling him a moron.

112
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,146
Miu, I need you
for a demonstration.

113
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:08,772
No way!

114
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:11,566
Your hands aren't getting
anywhere near me, creep.

115
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:15,445
Sorry, Kenichi, I've
lost my motivation.

116
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:17,322
Will you please
take this seriously?!

117
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:21,993
Now, hold your arms
up like mine.

118
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,620
Do you mean like this?

119
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,872
Drop your shoulders and
let your arms swing

120
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:28,125
from one side to the other.

121
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,294
Relax them completely as
they make their rotation.

122
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:35,632
Now alternate while you walk.

123
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:36,675
Uh-huh.

124
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:37,634
Okay.

125
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,928
You should be able to feel
your joints stretching,

126
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:41,805
almost like your arms
are about to fly off.

127
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:44,850
So, uh, how exactly am
I supposed to use this

128
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,601
to defeat an enemy?

129
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:49,479
You can't defeat anybody by
swinging your arms at them.

130
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:50,730
What?!

131
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,566
Then why are you
teaching it to me?

132
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:54,025
Hey, no need to get excited.

133
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:56,069
There is a method to the
madness, I promise.

134
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,530
Just keep doing that as
you make a full circuit

135
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,365
and you'll start
to figure it out.

136
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:01,449
Around the garden?

137
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,326
Around the neighborhood.

138
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:04,411
You're joking.

139
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:07,664
Swing your arms in line with
your hips, and no cheating!

140
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:09,708
Best of luck to you!

141
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:17,757
This is more embarrassing
than tough.

142
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:22,304
Hey, Miu?

143
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:24,556
I know you're not too
familiar with the area.

144
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:26,558
So, I figured I'd
come with you.

145
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:28,268
Just to make sure
you don't get lost.

146
00:08:28,268 --> 00:08:30,729
Do you even know
what this is for?

147
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:33,148
Sure, it's to help you
loosen up your muscles.

148
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:34,357
Really, but how?

149
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:37,194
When you swing your arm in one
direction as hard as you can,

150
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:40,322
like when you punch, you can't
help but tense up the other arm

151
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:42,824
as well, and that slows down the
movement of your next swing.

152
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:44,743
It's a basic reaction that
protects your joints

153
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:48,288
from straining. But it's more
psychological than physical.

154
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:50,207
So this is going to
help me loosen my arms

155
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:51,583
so they'll move faster?

156
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,377
Yeah, so it's important that
you visualize your arms

157
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:56,713
swinging further and
further away each time.

158
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:59,591
The idea is that once you make
these large swings smaller,

159
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:01,927
they become compact
striking moves. Make sense?

160
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,720
Whatever you say.

161
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:07,140
Nobody told me there
was a parade today.

162
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,643
Oh, I'm not in your way, am I?

163
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:12,437
Lucky coincidence bumping
into you, Kenichi.

164
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:15,023
We've been looking for
you all over the place.

165
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:16,441
I've seen him...

166
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,610
I think he's from
the Ragnarok gang.

167
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,446
He's one of the three guys
that were looking for me!

168
00:09:25,742 --> 00:09:27,077
In case you don't know,

169
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:29,829
my name's Taichi Koga, and
I need you to come with me.

170
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:32,082
My friend Takeda really
wants to meet you

171
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:34,209
and I don't wanna
disappoint him.

172
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:40,465
Hey, check out Blondie,
her boobs are huge!

173
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:42,425
Huh? Ah!

174
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:45,387
Okay, Kenichi, you gotta
explain this to me.

175
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:48,848
How does a dork like you
get such a cute girlfriend?

176
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:51,685
Nobody said we were dating,
he's my friend! That's it!

177
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:54,020
She certainly was
emphatic about that.

178
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,023
And I don't enjoy being ogled.
So why don't you go away!

179
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:59,109
Takeda said he wanted
me to bring you to him,

180
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:01,361
but I've got a better idea.

181
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:04,030
I'm gonna beat the crap out of
you in front of your girlfriend

182
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,448
and show her what
a loser you are,

183
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:07,117
and then I'm gonna
steal her from you.

184
00:10:07,117 --> 00:10:08,743
What is with this guy?

185
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:10,078
I'm not an object!

186
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:12,372
I guess I'm just gonna have
to deliver you to Takeda

187
00:10:12,372 --> 00:10:13,748
in a body bag, huh?

188
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:17,544
We're surrounded.

189
00:10:17,544 --> 00:10:21,381
Oh, man, this is not good.
Nine against two?

190
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:24,551
Even though Miu's with me,
they're all carrying weapons.

191
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:28,221
There's no way we can
take all of them!

192
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:30,932
Alright. Just try and escape.

193
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:41,174
Hey, it looks like you guys are
having a little party over here.

194
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:45,512
What's up, Kenichi? I didn't
know you had so many friends.

195
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,472
Sensei, you're just in time!

196
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,349
It seems like you guys
are having a lot of fun.

197
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,309
Well, no, not really.

198
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:54,354
That little punk there
was harassing me!

199
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,107
Alright, old man! Beat it!

200
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:10,203
Aw, man! How did he--

201
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,831
He knocked him down
just by glaring at him!

202
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:14,123
Kenichi.

203
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:15,792
Sensei?

204
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:17,502
I'm glad he's on our side...

205
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,796
This guy's not human!

206
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:21,422
Keep your thighs closed!

207
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,843
There you go, kid,
that's a good stance.

208
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:26,261
Good enough.

209
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:28,638
Oh, and Apachai's
been waiting on you,

210
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:31,140
so try not to take too long.

211
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,642
What?

212
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:34,853
Hey, wait!

213
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:36,855
Sensei! Where are you going?

214
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:39,983
We need your help...?

215
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:43,444
Sensei, come back!

216
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:08,511
Kenichi, no!

217
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:10,138
I wouldn't if I were you.

218
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:11,347
Koga's kind of crazy.

219
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:13,850
He'd probably kill you if you
got in the middle of this.

220
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,811
And I'd hate to see a cute
girl like you get killed.

221
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:18,438
Oopsie, my hand slipped.

222
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:23,359
You'll regret you have hands.

223
00:12:24,152 --> 00:12:25,528
So stupid...

224
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,947
I can't even count how many
times Sakaki's told me

225
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,824
how important it is to
land the first blow.

226
00:12:29,824 --> 00:12:32,118
And I get punched
while crying for help!

227
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,079
I've gotta land a hit, or
there's no way I'm gonna win!

228
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,544
Alright, how about
this? Yamazuki!

229
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,256
I guess you haven't
heard of me after all.

230
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:49,344
I'm Koga the kicker. And
you're way too slow for me!

231
00:12:49,344 --> 00:12:51,304
He's dodged every punch!

232
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:55,391
I can't believe you're
so weak! Seriously!

233
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:57,852
Tsukuba must have had the
flu when you beat him!

234
00:12:57,852 --> 00:13:01,731
Ragnarok doesn't need any
more worthless losers like you!

235
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:03,149
Wait a minute!

236
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:16,412
Wh- what are you doing?

237
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,878
That supposed to scare me?

238
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:27,215
Okay. Relax my arms
completely as they move.

239
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:30,009
Visualize them swinging
out of my joints.

240
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:35,556
And when I pull them into
smaller, concentrated moves...

241
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:37,016
Quit wasting my time!

242
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,935
...they become compact punches!

243
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:47,151
No!

244
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:49,195
It barely brushed
against his chin!

245
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,739
Ha! You just missed.

246
00:13:58,788 --> 00:13:59,956
Huh?

247
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,210
I just didn't eat enough today.

248
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:07,213
What the--

249
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,966
Did he rattle my brain somehow?

250
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:13,261
Attack him! Kill him! Now!

251
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:21,769
Oh!

252
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:24,397
Uh... I forgot to leave
some for Kenichi.

253
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,816
I guess I got a little
carried away there, huh.

254
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,029
She's a monster!

255
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:31,904
Huh?

256
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,324
Help me!

257
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:37,744
Did you hear that, he
called me a monster!

258
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,455
Yeah, but I think he meant
it in a good way, you know,

259
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:41,497
like the monsters of rock.

260
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:44,333
He did not! You know
that's not true!

261
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,294
Come on, let's get out of here.

262
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:49,672
Man, for someone with her
skills, she sure is sensitive.

263
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:52,800
You hear that, Kensei?

264
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:56,346
Our golden boy here
defeated their leader,

265
00:14:56,346 --> 00:14:58,139
just like I predicted he would.

266
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,975
I knew that you could do it,
I wasn't worried or anything.

267
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:02,643
Oh, thanks.

268
00:15:02,643 --> 00:15:05,688
Sure, sure. That's why you spent
all afternoon pacing around

269
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:08,524
the garden muttering about
how worried you were.

270
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:11,194
So I guess all those straight
punches and blocking maneuvers

271
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:13,696
I taught you came in pretty
handy after all, did they not?

272
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:17,867
What? Yeah, that's it...

273
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:21,746
Jeez, he seems so proud.
I just can't bring myself

274
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:24,082
to tell him that it was a
combination of sheer luck

275
00:15:24,082 --> 00:15:25,750
and Kensei's technique
that did it.

276
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,878
So, Apachai's bummed that
you missed his lesson today.

277
00:15:28,878 --> 00:15:30,546
He's been moping
around the house.

278
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:33,174
He hasn't even said
his own name in hours.

279
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:36,260
Oh, I'm sorry Apachai!
I got attacked by a gang

280
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,304
while I was out doing
Kensei's exercise.

281
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,515
But you can train me twice
as long next weekend!

282
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:41,641
I don't care.

283
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,519
Apachai's coloring books
are more fun than you.

284
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,062
Oh, man.

285
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,733
What's the deal?

286
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:54,612
Aren't any of you idiots capable
of bringing me this freshman?

287
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:57,740
It's not my fault, Kisara!
We ran into him on the street,

288
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,450
and I was gonna
bring him over here!

289
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,494
But he had this really
hot girlfriend with him,

290
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,996
and I got a little distracted,
but she turned out to be

291
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,249
some kind of monster! For
real! You shoulda' seen it!

292
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,251
She's gotta be a
mutant or something!

293
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:10,586
Do you know what he's
going on about?

294
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:16,342
Alright, this is the last
time any of you fail.

295
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,928
Takeda, take Ukita
and Koga with you

296
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:22,140
and do whatever it takes
to retrieve Kenichi. Understood?

297
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,099
Yeah.

298
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:25,476
I'm telling you, she's
got supernatural powers!

299
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:27,019
She's not human--

300
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,939
Kenichi Shirahama...

301
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,567
You're full of all
sorts of surprises.

302
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:39,323
Too slow! Offense and defense
are not two separate things!

303
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:41,200
You have to use your entire body

304
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,870
to concentrate two
moves into one form!

305
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,791
Ugh! You haven't
improved at all.

306
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,627
What happened? I thought you
used the technique I taught you

307
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:53,087
to defeat the leader
of that gang!

308
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:55,214
I'm gonna have to take
this secret to the grave.

309
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,465
He'd never let it drop.

310
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:59,510
Okay, Miu listen up.
Next time you notice he's let

311
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,846
his guard down like that,
just go ahead and kill him!

312
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:03,264
You got it!

313
00:17:03,264 --> 00:17:04,265
No, it's fine!

314
00:17:04,265 --> 00:17:07,059
Go on and kill me.
I'm too slow to live!

315
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,438
That's right!

316
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:14,901
Now, Kenichi, swivel downward
and take Miu by the arm.

317
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,279
No, your upper hand
is far too weak.

318
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,364
You would normally use
your leverage on her arm

319
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:22,867
to pull her backwards
for the next step.

320
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,161
But if you grasp
her that weakly...

321
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,370
Well, Miu?

322
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:29,832
That's what happens.

323
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,835
You've got plenty
of time to learn.

324
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:35,004
I'm just entirely
hopeless, aren't I?

325
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:37,048
I haven't made any
progress at all!

326
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:39,634
Apachai doesn't believe
that, even if it's true.

327
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:40,384
Stay away!

328
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:43,054
Apaaaaaaa!

329
00:17:43,054 --> 00:17:48,851
Apapapapa!

330
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:50,895
Perfect. He's
destroying my statues.

331
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:52,355
What's going on in here?

332
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:54,315
Kenichi made the mistake
of showing fear.

333
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:57,568
And you know what happens
when Apachai smells fear.

334
00:17:57,568 --> 00:17:59,320
Quite a sight.

335
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,113
Well, it's still
pretty good training.

336
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,865
He can witness
Apachai's techniques

337
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:03,699
without getting killed.

338
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:04,867
You think so?

339
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:08,037
Can observing this do
that much for him?

340
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:10,540
Just go away!

341
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:16,128
This is not good.

342
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,839
Why haven't I been
getting any better?

343
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,259
It was just a fluke
that I won that fight.

344
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:24,220
It wasn't skill,
it was just luck.

345
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,931
Hey, I wish you wouldn't feel so
depressed, you're doing great.

346
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,307
All your hard
work and training

347
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,684
is really starting to pay off.

348
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:31,769
Are you just saying that
to make me feel better?

349
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:32,520
Yeah.

350
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,438
I know that Miu would
never tell a lie,

351
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:36,607
but she could've
lied about that.

352
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:37,900
So there it is.

353
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,529
I won't get any better
no matter how hard I try!

354
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:43,823
I'm going to the Gardening
Club, I'll see you later.

355
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,825
Maybe I should've lied.

356
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:50,315
Bad news, Kenichi.

357
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:52,818
Latest word on the wire
is that those three guys

358
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:55,154
aren't the only ones
hot on your trail.

359
00:18:55,154 --> 00:18:58,824
There's one more wild beast
trying to track you down.

360
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:02,995
No!

361
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:05,706
What happened in here?!

362
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:06,915
Kenichi...

363
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:13,255
Yo, Kenichi! I was startin'
to think you'd never show up.

364
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:14,006
It's you!

365
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:16,425
Hope you've been working
on your muscles, little guy!

366
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:17,968
Daimonji!

367
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:19,136
Oops!

368
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:20,888
Tell me why you did this!

369
00:19:20,888 --> 00:19:23,640
'Cuz you and me aren't
anywhere near finished.

370
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,685
I can't just accept that you
beat me on some fluke.

371
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:36,570
And I heard that you
somehow managed

372
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,655
to beat the
sub-captain, Tsukuba.

373
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,240
And you know what people
would say about me

374
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,284
if I took down the guy
that beat Tsukuba,

375
00:19:42,284 --> 00:19:44,453
the strongest member of
the Karate Club?

376
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:48,957
They-they'd say I'm
number one, that's what!

377
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:51,085
And once word gets
back to Ragnarok,

378
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:52,920
I bet they'll ask
me to join 'em.

379
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,089
Do I look like I care about
your stupid plan, Daimonji?

380
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:58,425
I just want you to let Izumi go.

381
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:01,428
I'll release her if you promise
not to run away when I do.

382
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:02,930
I won't run away.

383
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,431
Whatever, fine.

384
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:05,974
Now I want you to tell me...

385
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:08,769
Why did you destroy all
of the plants like this?

386
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,104
What, these plants?

387
00:20:10,104 --> 00:20:12,022
I'm asking you a
question. Answer me!

388
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:15,317
We just got bored waitin' for
you to show up, that's all.

389
00:20:17,111 --> 00:20:18,654
Please stop!

390
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:20,239
But don't cry yet punk,

391
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:23,283
we decided to let your
favorite plant live for now.

392
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:28,122
Of course you'd grow
a puny plant like this.

393
00:20:28,122 --> 00:20:29,164
Shut up!

394
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:31,500
A plant like this doesn't
even deserve to live,

395
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,460
no matter how much
you want it to.

396
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:42,553
I'm doin' you a favor by putting
this thing out of its misery.

397
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:48,225
Come on!

398
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,146
Wait a minute, where'd he go?

399
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:54,356
You son of a--

400
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,401
Impossible!

401
00:20:57,401 --> 00:21:00,028
He was right there,
then he was gone!

402
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:02,531
I'll, kill, you!

403
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:21,633
Oh wow.

404
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:27,806
I'm sorry. This
is all my fault.

405
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:32,102
Let's clean up.

406
00:21:32,102 --> 00:21:34,771
We need to repot the
plants that can be saved.

407
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:35,856
Right.

408
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:39,276
I don't think this one's
gonna make it.

409
00:21:39,276 --> 00:21:40,235
So sad.

410
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:42,946
I'm so sorry,
Snow King, I'm sorry.

411
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:46,700
But we-- we should
still try to save it.

412
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:50,954
Sure enough, a few days later...

413
00:21:50,954 --> 00:21:52,456
Hey! Kenichi!

414
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:53,540
What's up, Izumi?

415
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,335
Look at this! Your plant's
grown a new leaf!

416
00:21:56,335 --> 00:21:58,045
You did it buddy,
I knew you could!

417
00:21:58,045 --> 00:22:00,672
You're small, but you've got the
persistence of a heavyweight!

418
00:22:00,672 --> 00:22:02,090
I think it's more durable

419
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,509
because it has such a thick
stem from growing slowly.

420
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:08,055
It never would've survived if it
had grown quickly and thin.

421
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:09,139
That's right.

422
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:11,934
Just because it's slow doesn't
mean it's not actually growing.

423
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:14,019
Real progress takes time.

424
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:16,939
I could see all
of Daimonji's moves,

425
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:19,191
as if they were in slow motion.

426
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:21,360
They might only
be small steps,

427
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,238
but I'm still making progress!

428
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:25,864
I'm growing!

429
00:22:28,158 --> 00:22:29,826
Be careful.

430
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:35,874
Wow, you're really
fired up today, Kenichi.

431
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:39,419
You've got it! I'm going to
keep on working until I bloom!

432
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,088
Just like my Snow King!

433
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:42,881
Your... Snow King?

434
00:24:20,187 --> 00:24:23,148
Those Ragnarok guys are getting
more and more dangerous

435
00:24:23,148 --> 00:24:24,399
every time I run into them.

436
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:26,943
They were even cheap enough to
pull weapons on me today

437
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:29,780
and I don't stand a chance
against them with just my fists.

438
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,199
Shigure said she's going
to train me in weaponry,

439
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:34,534
but I think I'm more likely
to die training with her

440
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:36,912
than fighting the
entire Ragnarok gang!

441
00:24:36,912 --> 00:24:39,581
I admit it, I'm scared,
I don't wanna do this!

442
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:41,666
Kenichi, don't be scared.

443
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:44,419
You know the expression
'don't lose your head'?

444
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:46,254
We are dealing with swords here.

445
00:24:46,254 --> 00:24:48,423
I don't wanna die!
