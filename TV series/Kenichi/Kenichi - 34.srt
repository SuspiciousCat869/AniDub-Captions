[Music]

2
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,217
You can't even
handle a feint...

3
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:56,551
High level fighters
can always tell

4
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:58,053
when their opponent's faking.

5
00:01:58,053 --> 00:01:59,638
How can you be so naïve?!

6
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:01,056
I'm wasting my time.

7
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:02,599
You're not on my level!

8
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:05,352
You... You say you stand
for justice and truth

9
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:07,229
but don't you see that's
not gonna get you anywhere

10
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,605
as a fighter?!

11
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:11,108
A martial arts master
has to have the ability

12
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:12,317
to trick his opponent

13
00:02:12,317 --> 00:02:14,319
and use their powers
against them.

14
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:19,533
Someone like you would never
be able to pull that off.

15
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,124
Our little chat is over...

16
00:02:27,124 --> 00:02:29,835
You probably don't even have the
strength to stand right now.

17
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:34,256
Die!

18
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,340
What the...

19
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:39,761
I've heard enough...

20
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:43,140
I won't let you trick
me into pitying you

21
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,476
so you can pummel
me into the ground.

22
00:02:46,476 --> 00:02:47,728
I'm ready to fight!

23
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:48,729
Impossible!

24
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:56,236
You may have
amazing masters

25
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:58,780
but you're naivety is
gonna get the best of you.

26
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:05,078
It seems that the
winner has been decided.

27
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:07,080
Power and deceit...

28
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,833
Those two things are all you
need to get by in this world.

29
00:03:11,293 --> 00:03:12,919
You're...

30
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,588
You're wrong.

31
00:03:14,588 --> 00:03:17,549
If you live a life
full of deceit-

32
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,010
constantly struggling
for power...

33
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,137
you'll end up with
nothing but sadness.

34
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,559
My karate master
once told me...

35
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:34,191
talking with your fists makes
your words hit... harder.

36
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:37,652
No matter how much someone
tries to put on a façade...

37
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,070
you'll have them
completely figured out

38
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,740
once you fight them.

39
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,618
I know you aren't the
one who kidnapped Honoka.

40
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:45,952
After what you've
been through

41
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:48,705
you'd never kidnap
someone's sister...

42
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:50,916
I know that you
didn't do it...

43
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,375
but you know that
as her brother

44
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,877
it's my duty to protect her.

45
00:03:58,215 --> 00:03:59,633
But that's impossible...!

46
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:01,384
He shouldn't even be
able to stand right now-

47
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:03,428
not after I've attacked
him repeatedly!

48
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:05,263
What you truly need to
get by in this world

49
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:06,973
is not power or deceit...

50
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:09,392
You need a heart that is
capable of trusting others

51
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:11,102
and deep down
you know that.

52
00:04:14,064 --> 00:04:15,190
Trust your masters.

53
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,274
Trust your friends...

54
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:18,276
and most importantly
trust yourself...

55
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:20,904
because that
is true power.

56
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:24,241
'A heart that is capable
of trusting others'...

57
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:27,118
I don't think you
get it, Shirahama...

58
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:29,663
That way of thinking is
what killed my sister!

59
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:31,581
Well, my sister is
counting on me to save her

60
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:33,166
and I'm not gonna
let her down!

61
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,417
You're so naïve-

62
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,628
do you really think you'll
be able to protect her?

63
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,517
Double palm!

64
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,151
That's quite impressive...

65
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:01,570
The Double Palm...

66
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,155
I never thought
you would know

67
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:04,906
one of the eight... punches...

68
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,950
But if you don't attack
with all of your might

69
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,869
it's very easy
to block it.

70
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,941
That punch was
so powerful...

71
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:41,651
It's much stronger
than anything

72
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:43,820
I've ever been capable of.

73
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,863
That's right...!

74
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:46,531
You don't have to be
deceitful to gain power

75
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:48,116
all you need
is determination

76
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:49,826
and some good old
fashioned training!

77
00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:54,414
I don't understand- how do you
know all these martial arts?

78
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:56,124
At first I thought
it was just karate

79
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:59,377
but you also use Jujitsu,
Kenpo, even Muay Thai...!

80
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:02,422
Just who the hell do
you think you are, kid?

81
00:06:02,422 --> 00:06:04,841
I'm Kenichi Shirahama...

82
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:07,010
and I'm history's
strongest disciple.

83
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,892
I don't know what
you're talking about

84
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:15,435
but it's about time
we end this...

85
00:06:15,435 --> 00:06:16,519
Let's go!

86
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,441
That's enough you two.

87
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,153
That was awesome...

88
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:27,405
Definitely a great fight.

89
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:29,074
But you've been rained out

90
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:31,159
so I think you should
call it a day.

91
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:49,511
The final victory
always goes to Ragnarok.

92
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:51,179
Don't forget that, kid.

93
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,516
Big brother!

94
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:56,184
Honoka!

95
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:03,817
Why'd you drag my
sister into this...?!

96
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:05,402
That's dirty-
even for Ragnarok!

97
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:08,363
True... True.

98
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:09,531
Kenichi!

99
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:17,122
-So what should we do now?
-Nothing...

100
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:18,415
We will wait here...

101
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:20,333
We've got to let
him handle this...

102
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,501
We'll jump in if
he needs help

103
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,169
but otherwise we stay put.

104
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:24,879
Yeah, you're right...

105
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,881
Ya never know what life
is gonna throw your way

106
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:29,843
so he needs to be able to
handle it on his own...

107
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:31,970
Still wouldn't mind takin'
a swing at him, though.

108
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,430
I feel the same...

109
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,390
but he has to fight
his own battles...

110
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,350
we need to stay
out of this one.

111
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,977
Alright then, Hermit...

112
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:41,563
This is your chance to take
down Shirahama for good...

113
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:43,314
You think you
can handle it?

114
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:45,817
I'm not taking any
orders from you... Loki!

115
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:46,901
From me...?

116
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,153
What did I say...?

117
00:07:48,153 --> 00:07:49,487
These aren't my orders

118
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:52,824
they're direct orders from
the Great Sage Fists himself.

119
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:54,451
If I were you I'd
shut my mouth

120
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:55,994
and do whatever he
asks, Hermit.

121
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,829
After all, you owe
him one- remember?

122
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:03,596
Hey, what do ya mean...?

123
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,598
Does this guy seriously
have some kinda connection

124
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:07,225
to the Great Sage Fists?

125
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:10,478
Yeah, want me to
tell you about it?

126
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:12,105
Bastard...

127
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:13,815
It's a great story...

128
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:15,108
you see, back when
our friend here

129
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,401
was known as Natsu Tanimoto

130
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:19,112
there was an accident
involving his father...

131
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:21,531
Evidently Hermit's stepmother
poisoned the poor man

132
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:22,824
leading to his death.

133
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:30,123
Little Natsu inherited
his father's corporation

134
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:31,874
which left him with
huge responsibilities

135
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:33,626
for one so young....

136
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:36,212
He wasn't able to manage
everything on his own

137
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:38,589
and the company employees
quickly bullied him

138
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:41,342
into signing over the
corporation's assets to them.

139
00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:45,847
They practically
cleaned the place out.

140
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,355
Poor little Natsu didn't
even have time to cry...

141
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:56,357
His sister Kaede
was very ill

142
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:59,026
and he needed money to
pay for her treatment...

143
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:00,820
As a result of
losing the company

144
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,739
and expensive medical costs,

145
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:06,200
the family fortune
was dwindling away.

146
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:17,837
Is something wrong?

147
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:20,882
Don't you worry- everything'll
be fine... Kaede.

148
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:22,467
I'm not gonna
lose to them...

149
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:24,761
I promise I'll do whatever
it takes to protect you.

150
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:31,309
Eventually he was
able to find a lawyer

151
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,686
who was willing to
listen to a child...

152
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:35,897
but only after most of
the company's assets

153
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:37,482
had already been stolen.

154
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,320
You must be exhausted.

155
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,529
I would be too...

156
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,490
I'm surprised you've been
able to handle all this

157
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,991
by yourself thus far.

158
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:48,618
It wasn't easy.

159
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:49,660
I'm sure...

160
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,412
Now I need you to
sign this document...

161
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:52,538
These papers will ensure

162
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:55,166
that no one steals
from you again.

163
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,835
Thanks... You're the
greatest, Kondou!

164
00:09:57,835 --> 00:09:59,003
You're a lifesaver.

165
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:02,340
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

166
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,468
Don't worry about it,
Mr. Tah-nee-moto...

167
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:07,303
I've always got your
best interests at heart.

168
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,394
Hey...! What the...

169
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:19,774
Get out.

170
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:23,945
Sir... I think...

171
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:25,571
We should go ahead
and do what they say.

172
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:31,994
Let... go!
You're hurting me!

173
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:33,788
Quit struggling, kid...

174
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:36,374
There's no sense in making
this any harder than it is.

175
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,381
Do what you're told
and you won't get hurt.

176
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:44,674
Go ahead and kill
me if you want

177
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:46,133
but you're never
gonna get my money!

178
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,885
I've got some bad
news for ya...

179
00:10:47,885 --> 00:10:49,345
We've got your signature-

180
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:51,347
we're entitled to
everything you own.

181
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:52,765
You can see for yourself...

182
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:54,100
The document's right here.

183
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:57,854
No... Kondou how could you?!

184
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:00,940
At some point the powerless
have to take matters

185
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,775
into their own hands...

186
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,235
That time is now.

187
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:08,531
This document
changes everything...

188
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:11,659
Now the employees control
the company and its assets.

189
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:14,495
Not some orphan who hasn't
had to work a day in his life.

190
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:16,414
That means... we don't
take orders from you.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,085
Do it. Throw
him over the side.

192
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:22,837
No one will look
for him down there.

193
00:11:22,837 --> 00:11:25,047
Stop... it...
let... me... go...!

194
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:27,466
Almost as easy as taking
candy from a baby, isn't it?

195
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,346
Who's there...?!
Show yourself!

196
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:41,856
It's such a beautiful night,
don't you agree?

197
00:11:41,856 --> 00:11:43,983
Let's not ruin it
with talk of murder.

198
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:46,444
Look...! He's up there!

199
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:47,653
Whoa... No way.

200
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:56,370
Now... I suggest that
you leave the boy alone.

201
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,622
Hey... Butt out...

202
00:11:57,622 --> 00:11:59,498
What do you think you're
doing here anyway?

203
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:00,750
Taking a walk...

204
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,001
Is that okay?

205
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,093
Who is this guy?

206
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:12,553
Uh... I don't know.

207
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,891
Let the boy go...

208
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:20,436
Just leave him be and
shoot me in his place.

209
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:21,812
This is your chance.

210
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:22,939
Go ahead.

211
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,316
You heard the man...

212
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:27,109
He saw our faces we
have to kill him...

213
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:28,194
Shoot him!

214
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:35,993
I didn't think you'd
actually do it.

215
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:39,163
Where'd his feet go?!

216
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,251
Now I'm angry.

217
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,971
Are you okay, young man?

218
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:02,853
Yeah... I remember it all Loki

219
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:05,523
so there's no need
for you to remind me.

220
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:08,275
The Great Sage Fists
saved my life that night

221
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:10,152
and he shared his
wisdom with me.

222
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:12,154
He said, "If you want
people to follow you

223
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:16,534
then you must first learn to
become a righteous leader."

224
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,203
"You must be physically
and mentally strong...

225
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:20,746
and you must
have the ability

226
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:23,958
to move freely
from head to toe."

227
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,127
That was when...
he told me...

228
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:28,254
I should learn
martial arts.

229
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:30,214
I'm handing down orders
from your savior,

230
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:32,049
The Great Sage
Fists, himself...

231
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:34,593
If you know what's good for
ya you'll kill Shirahama

232
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:39,265
Ha...! I knew it...

233
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:40,933
You can't...

234
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:42,226
Fine- I'll do it.

235
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:47,648
Prepare to die, Shirahama!

236
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:59,160
You can hit me as
much as you want.

237
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,329
Hold on... You shouldn't even
be able to stand right now...

238
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:03,914
Your defenses are
better than I thought.

239
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:09,795
You want to turn it
down a notch...?

240
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:11,172
you're scaring
the crows away.

241
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,178
Go ahead and hit me
as much as you want...

242
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:20,222
as long as you
give Honoka back!

243
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:39,075
Go ahead and hit me
as much as you want...

244
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:40,826
as long as you
give Honoka back!

245
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:42,870
Now that's the spirit...

246
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,455
I'm fine with
letting her go

247
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:46,499
if I get to beat
the crap outta you.

248
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:48,793
Don't worry about me-
kick his butt, Kenichi!

249
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:52,546
Hey... you better shut
it ya little twerp...

250
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:54,340
I'd hate to
have to hurt ya.

251
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,468
Let... me... go...
you... big... bully...

252
00:14:57,468 --> 00:14:59,678
-Shut up!
-mmmm

253
00:14:59,678 --> 00:15:02,807
I love how anytime I mention
the Great Sage Fists

254
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:05,684
you do what
I say, Hermit.

255
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:08,104
Now let me show you
how this is done...

256
00:15:08,104 --> 00:15:10,106
I'll take this kid
out with one attack!

257
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:31,669
Damn it...

258
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,337
What's the, deal...?

259
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,923
Punching you feels like I'm
punching a tree or somethin'...

260
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:38,634
I honestly didn't expect
you to last this long.

261
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:39,802
But I'm not too worried,

262
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:41,595
cause I can keep on
going all night,

263
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:44,557
and besides it's not like
Hermit could do any better.

264
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:46,934
Damn you!

265
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:49,270
That's karate's
three point stance...

266
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,188
He's doing exactly
what I taught him-

267
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:53,107
keeping his legs in
tight and his arms up

268
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:54,733
so his opponent
can't hurt him.

269
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:56,443
Gotta say I'm impressed...

270
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:58,112
he's done... so well...

271
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:00,531
He's keeping his muscles
tight and his joints loose...

272
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:03,450
That's one of the best 3
point stances I've ever seen.

273
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,869
I like a challenge...

274
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:06,996
Makes things interesting.

275
00:16:06,996 --> 00:16:08,914
Then give it
all you got...

276
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,457
I can tell you're
a strong guy...

277
00:16:10,457 --> 00:16:13,085
but you're obviously not
strong enough to knock me out.

278
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:16,589
Bite me again and
I'll bite back!

279
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:19,133
Why'd you have to go and get my
sister involved in this...?

280
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,010
If you wanted to fight all
you had to do was ask

281
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,137
and I would've
gladly accepted.

282
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:24,972
You don't get
it, do you kid?

283
00:16:24,972 --> 00:16:27,183
Bad guys don't
play by the rules.

284
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:33,898
That's what you were gonna
say next, wasn't it...?

285
00:16:33,898 --> 00:16:35,399
I got you figured out.

286
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,442
Sorry we're late...

287
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:37,985
We got here as
fast as we could.

288
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:39,445
Awesome...

289
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:42,281
Looks like I'll finally
get to fight the real Loki.

290
00:16:44,242 --> 00:16:47,287
Damn... I swear those idiots
are good for nothin'...

291
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:48,830
I mean jeez, couldn't they
have at least stalled

292
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,873
for 10 more minutes?

293
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:51,583
Hey... you guys.

294
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,459
If you punks lay
a hand on Loki

295
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,296
I'm gonna slice this
midget's throat, got it?!

296
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:57,922
Don't worry 'bout me-
I'll be alright...!

297
00:16:57,922 --> 00:17:00,091
Save my brother,
okay Big Boobs?!

298
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:02,093
You can count
on me, Honoka...

299
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:03,303
But my boobs
aren't that big.

300
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:07,098
Shut up, ya dumb ass.

301
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:08,808
You ready for this...?

302
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:10,059
Now that we've
got an audience

303
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,854
ya might wanna try not to
embarrass yourself, kid.

304
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:14,063
A palm?!

305
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,441
No.

306
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:30,121
No...! That punch he's
using is dangerous!

307
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:32,415
The instant his hand makes
contact with his opponent

308
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,458
he makes a fist.

309
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,959
This creates a
thrust of energy

310
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:37,212
which makes his punch
twice as powerful...

311
00:17:37,212 --> 00:17:38,838
It's a very complex move.

312
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:40,715
One that relies on the
joints of the wrist.

313
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:43,301
Oh... I get it...

314
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:45,720
It's like flicking
someone's forehead.

315
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,555
If you build up some
energy beforehand

316
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:49,933
it makes the force of the
flick that much stronger.

317
00:17:52,101 --> 00:17:54,229
The good thing is he
didn't anticipate Loki

318
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:56,105
using that punch so
he didn't tense up-

319
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:58,983
he stayed flexible so he
could absorb that energy.

320
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:01,319
The 3 point stance
isn't just for defense.

321
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,321
The energy he's
used is powerful...

322
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:06,074
It can deal a death
blow at close range.

323
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:09,160
I bet Kenichi's waiting for the
perfect chance to retaliate.

324
00:18:12,956 --> 00:18:14,624
Go Kenichi!

325
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:16,042
Let go!

326
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:17,418
Would you cut it out?!

327
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:18,378
Brother!

328
00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:23,091
Let go... now!

329
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:29,347
Now see what you
made me do...!

330
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:31,266
I told ya to stop
squirming around...

331
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:32,892
This is all your
fault, you know.

332
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:37,355
Help me...!

333
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:38,898
Big brother...!

334
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,656
Kaede... Kaede...

335
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:49,033
Hang in there.

336
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:55,123
Please... Everything's
gonna be okay...

337
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:58,876
You'll get better
in no time.

338
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:05,216
Brother... don't... lie...

339
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:07,427
I know better...

340
00:19:07,427 --> 00:19:08,636
Kaede...

341
00:19:11,306 --> 00:19:12,724
I'm sorry...

342
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:15,560
Natsu...

343
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,811
I'm...

344
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:20,773
Sorry...

345
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:22,692
Why are you
apologizing to me...?

346
00:19:22,692 --> 00:19:24,319
Kaede...

347
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,486
Please don't...

348
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:27,405
You didn't do
anything wrong, kay?

349
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,617
Brother I...

350
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:32,118
I can't...

351
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:35,538
I can't hang on...

352
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:37,165
not anymore.

353
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:44,422
I love you big brother...

354
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:46,883
please... don't give in...

355
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:48,092
please.

356
00:19:56,017 --> 00:19:57,060
Kaede...

357
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,729
Hey...?

358
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:04,108
No...! Kaede!

359
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:07,904
Please...

360
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:09,364
Don't leave me...

361
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:13,826
Kaede... Kaede!

362
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,217
This is really
startin' to get old...

363
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:31,177
It's time we ended
this don't you think?

364
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:35,556
Big brother!

365
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:36,974
I told you to stop!

366
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:44,482
Why...

367
00:20:44,482 --> 00:20:46,109
Why'd you do that?

368
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:47,151
You shouldn't be
holding a weapon

369
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:49,112
if you're not gonna
use it properly.

370
00:20:57,912 --> 00:21:00,081
This is it, kid!

371
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:01,499
Kenichi Shirahama!

372
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:07,672
It's okay...! I'm safe
and sound now, guys!

373
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:10,007
Kill Loki!

374
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,509
Damn you...

375
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:12,427
Hermit!

376
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:20,518
Yeah!

377
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:21,519
He did it!

378
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,187
Wow!

379
00:21:23,187 --> 00:21:24,522
Hold up! What'd I miss?!

380
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:31,696
Loki...! I should kill
you for what you did...!

381
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:32,780
You bastard!

382
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,283
Damn it...

383
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:38,202
And everything was
going according to plan.

384
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:39,912
I can't even
think straight...

385
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:41,372
That punch
really got to me.

386
00:21:43,624 --> 00:21:45,460
That's... blood!

387
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,463
I'm not gonna let you
get away with this...

388
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:50,298
How dare you
draw blood...!

389
00:21:50,298 --> 00:21:52,049
And you, Hermit...!

390
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,259
How dare you go
against orders sent

391
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:55,303
from the Great Sage
Fists himself?!

392
00:21:55,303 --> 00:21:58,431
Your days as a member of
Ragnarok are numbered!

393
00:21:58,431 --> 00:22:00,057
I couldn't care less...

394
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:02,560
I don't wanna be a part
of your stupid club, Loki.

395
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,270
Fine... You're
just a traitor...

396
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,314
I'm sure everyone will
be happy to hear that...

397
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:09,484
Come down and fight
me like a man!

398
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:11,194
You too Kenichi
Shirahama...

399
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:12,862
I'll take on
the both of you!

400
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:19,035
That's enough!

401
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:23,664
What's he doing here?

402
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,418
The First Fist!

403
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:48,147
[Music]

404
00:24:19,113 --> 00:24:21,324
I don't understand. You still
wanna fight me, Hermit?!

405
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:23,284
Of course I do! What
better time than now?

406
00:24:23,284 --> 00:24:25,036
All of our
distractions are gone-

407
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:27,538
it's the perfect opportunity
for us to end this!

408
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:30,041
But there's no reason
for us do this anymore!

409
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,167
You need a
reason to fight?

410
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:32,418
Okay, how about this...

411
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:34,378
I don't like you.
Is that enough for ya?

412
00:24:34,378 --> 00:24:35,921
Now let's get
this over with.

413
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:37,298
Are you ready Shirahama?

414
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:38,924
This is your
chance to opt out

415
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:39,967
if you're not man enough.

416
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:41,010
I'm ready.

417
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,137
If you really want a fight
then I'll give you a fight.

418
00:24:43,137 --> 00:24:44,347
I've had enough.

419
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:45,598
Let's do this!
