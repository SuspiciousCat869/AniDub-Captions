1
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:47,497
Okay, DNA is actually an acronym
for Deoxyribonucleic acid.

2
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:49,583
As I'm sure you all know,
it's the genetic structure

3
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,043
which contains your heredity.

4
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:53,503
The DNA molecule works as
a long-term information--

5
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:56,923
Today's the day.
I have to ask him.

6
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:12,147
I can do this. I can't
wait any longer.

7
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:16,735
If I don't do it
now, I never will.

8
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:18,236
Whoa, Izumi!

9
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:23,075
Sorry, I um, yeah, thanks!

10
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:24,159
Yeah, no problem.

11
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,286
I'll see you at the club, okay?

12
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:28,080
Actually, um, Kenichi?

13
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,208
Well, see, I was wondering.
if you don't have plans,

14
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,169
do you maybe wanna walk home
with me after school today?

15
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:39,800
I did it! I actually asked him!

16
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,052
Oh, jeez, y'know, I'm
sorry, I'd like to,

17
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:44,471
but I promised Miu I'd
go shopping with her.

18
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:47,724
Maybe some other time.

19
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:49,559
I-I finally got the
nerve to ask him,

20
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:51,061
and it was all for nothing.

21
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:54,898
Miu's always one
step ahead of me.

22
00:02:54,898 --> 00:02:57,025
Now what's going on here?

23
00:02:57,025 --> 00:03:00,779
Izumi looks like she's about to
melt into a puddle of tears.

24
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:06,660
Could it be that the plant
princess has a crush on Kenichi?

25
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,996
Hey, thanks for waiting.

26
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:13,083
No problem. I'm used to it.

27
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,545
If Izumi and Kenichi were to
become a romantic equation.

28
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:18,588
that would leave poor
Miu as the remainder.

29
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:21,258
And it'll be up to me to swoop
in and heal her broken heart!

30
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:24,136
To say the least, Miu
would be a valuable asset

31
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:25,804
to my grand plans
for things to come.

32
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:28,974
With her strength and skill on
my side, I'd be unstoppable.

33
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:31,768
All I have to do, is apply
my irresistible charms

34
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:34,020
to make her fall
in love with me!

35
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,693
It couldn't be any
easier. How brilliant!

36
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:42,112
Breaks my heart to see
such a pretty face stained

37
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:43,447
with the sour taste of love.

38
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:45,991
Get away from me! You
don't even have a heart!

39
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:47,701
If that wasn't true,
I'd be offended.

40
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:48,827
Still it was uncalled for.

41
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:51,705
Especially since I have the
solution to your dilemma.

42
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:55,041
Yeah right, I
seriously doubt that.

43
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,794
Oh, so you don't want the key
to Kenichi's mysterious heart?

44
00:03:57,794 --> 00:03:59,796
No, I could care less.

45
00:03:59,796 --> 00:04:02,215
I don't know what would
make you think that.

46
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:05,135
Then I guess I'll just
have to tell my plan to Miu.

47
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:06,803
Not that she needs
any help from me.

48
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:08,472
I mean, Kenichi is
already living with her,

49
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:10,640
so it's only inevitable.
Just one cold, lonely night

50
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,811
with the two of them under the
same roof, well you can imagine.

51
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:17,773
Don't you run from this!

52
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:21,526
Oh. It looks like I
hit a nerve after all.

53
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:23,153
There's no point
in running away.

54
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:24,738
You can't run from
your feelings.

55
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:27,949
So, I will bestow upon
you my infinite wisdom

56
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:30,077
and you will clutch Kenichi's
heart by the jugular!

57
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:30,952
Just say the word!

58
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:32,204
Uh, I--

59
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:33,497
Okay, sure.

60
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:36,958
Excellent! First things first,
we need to get you close to him.

61
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,628
You need some time. I mean
real time with Kenichi,

62
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:41,797
so we'll swing by
the dojo Sunday.

63
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:44,466
Uh, I'd feel kind of awkward
showing up uninvited.

64
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,551
For all we know he
could be busy that day

65
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:48,261
and I really don't
want to annoy him.

66
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:50,347
Oh, I promise you he'll
be happy to see us.

67
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:51,431
I'll make sure of that.

68
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,058
Well, that was
a little sinister.

69
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:54,976
Just make you sure you
dress up on Sunday.

70
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:56,686
Try to wear something
extra alluring.

71
00:04:56,686 --> 00:04:59,314
--Um, okay.
--I can't hear you!

72
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:00,941
Okay!

73
00:05:03,777 --> 00:05:07,155
I've got a bad feeling here.

74
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:09,825
I need to calm down. I'm
probably just over thinking

75
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:11,743
this whole thing, but I
can't shake the feeling

76
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:14,412
that I've made a
pact with the devil.

77
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:17,541
But then again, maybe this is
like all the old fairy tales

78
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,292
where the angels would
disguise themselves

79
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:20,377
as toads or monsters.

80
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:22,587
So maybe Niijima's not evil.

81
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:24,965
He could be cupid disguised
as a demonic freak!

82
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:27,217
I'll conquer the
world with love!

83
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:30,095
Or maybe I should stop
reading fairy tales.

84
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:36,059
C'mon! What's
taking her so long?

85
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:38,019
Hey, sorry I'm late.

86
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,521
You're late!

87
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,356
I know! I said I'm sorry!

88
00:05:41,356 --> 00:05:43,984
Geez.

89
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:45,735
Oh, please. You
can't be serious.

90
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,320
Is that your idea
of extra alluring?

91
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,196
I meant something skimpy!

92
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:50,490
Jeez, do I have to
draw you a picture?

93
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,491
Something like this!

94
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:52,492
Or even this one!

95
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:55,996
I don't own anything like that!

96
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:59,499
Well, I'll try to fix it.

97
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:01,042
There.

98
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:02,878
It's no miracle, but it helps.

99
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:07,507
Well, thank you.
That's encouraging.

100
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:09,426
For god's sake,
will you loosen up?!

101
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:11,636
You're walking
like a rusty robot!

102
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:18,518
Wait, is that, Kenichi?!

103
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:21,438
Someone help, I don't wanna die!

104
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:23,648
Please, Shigure,
I'm begging you!

105
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:25,442
Just let me go, this one time!

106
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:27,694
Uhhh, begging is pathetic so.

107
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:28,778
No.

108
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:31,114
C'mon. Quit actin'
like a baby, will ya'?

109
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:32,490
How ya gonna learn
these techniques

110
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,075
if you keep runnin' away?

111
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:39,706
I'm not running away, I'm
making a strategic withdrawal!

112
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:41,353
We have to help him!

113
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:49,007
What'd you want?

114
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,508
Another one?

115
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:53,053
What is there a cup size
requirement here?

116
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:55,180
Hey, what's going on?

117
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,641
You know these people?

118
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,142
Hey.

119
00:06:59,142 --> 00:07:00,352
Oh, Niijima!

120
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:02,604
Don't mind Shigure, she's
suspicious of everyone.

121
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:04,314
Oh, you again. Wonderful.

122
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:05,523
Nice to see you, too.

123
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:08,318
And you brought Izumi with you.
What a pleasant surprise.

124
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:09,945
Thank you.

125
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:16,159
Kenichi!

126
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:20,455
Oh, I recognize you.
Long time no see, huh?

127
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:23,249
I remember you.
You were with Kenichi.

128
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:27,754
Calm down little
girl, we're just gonna

129
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:29,714
ask you some questions.

130
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:31,508
Is that Kenichi?

131
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:37,264
Go home girls. Your
friend will be fine.

132
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:39,641
So, do you live here
with Kenichi and Miu?

133
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:42,477
It's a small world, isn't it?

134
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:44,813
She's still dragging him!

135
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:55,615
A high school girl!

136
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:57,701
Oh, gross! Quit taking
pictures of me, you creep!

137
00:07:57,701 --> 00:07:59,661
Apa.

138
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:04,541
Hi! Do you wanna feed
the pigeons with me?

139
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:09,212
What kind of a freak
show is this place?!

140
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:10,338
I don't get it.

141
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:12,674
What is Kenichi doing
living with these weirdos?

142
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:14,134
Just watch and
you'll figure it out.

143
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:17,012
Okay, Kenichi, it's Apachai's
turn for the teaching of you.

144
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:19,389
Right! I'm ready to go.

145
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:28,690
C'mon, faster, faster,
faster! You can do it!

146
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,400
Is that some kind
of martial arts?

147
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,402
Indeed. He may
have a green thumb,

148
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:34,070
but it's attached
to a blood red fist.

149
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,031
And, here comes the dodge!

150
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:38,575
There goes the kick!

151
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:39,993
Apapa?

152
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:44,539
Aw, not again.

153
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,750
How many times is
this kid gonna die?

154
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,835
Hey! Miu!

155
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:50,628
Yeah! Got it!

156
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:55,133
Rise and shine!

157
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,635
How'd I get over here?

158
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:58,553
What are you doing?!

159
00:08:58,553 --> 00:09:00,764
That's just cruel to wake
a person up like that!

160
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:03,767
Izumi? Are you really here or
do I have another concussion?

161
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:05,185
He could have been
seriously injured

162
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:08,772
and you just throw water
on him?! That's awful!

163
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:11,483
Was that really such a terrible
way for me to wake him up?

164
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:13,485
Well, it was better
than kicking him.

165
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,028
Or, wait a minute, I don't know.

166
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:17,364
Maybe it would be better
to kick him from now on.

167
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:18,490
I think he should
just be thankful

168
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,244
it wasn't boiling water
or something like that.

169
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:25,413
I think that girl's head
is about to explode.

170
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:27,749
I've got an idea.

171
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:29,834
Let's give him a break
since his friends are here.

172
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,836
Yes, yes! Take a break!

173
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:33,838
Would you like some
tea, young lady?

174
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:35,131
Have you ever modeled before?

175
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:37,050
Leave her alone, pervert.

176
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,136
There is something seriously
wrong with these people.

177
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:49,665
Have some tea,
you'll feel better.

178
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:52,167
Alright, what is this? I know
you're plotting something.

179
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,545
Plotting? You make me sound
like some kind of evil genius.

180
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:56,296
Cut it out! Just tell me!

181
00:09:56,296 --> 00:10:00,175
Ha, ha! Your club
manager's pretty cute.

182
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:02,261
You're a rather selfish
gardener, you know that?

183
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:04,221
You've got cute little
Izumi and beautiful Miu!

184
00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:06,974
Just how many flowers
does one guy need?

185
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,517
What are you talking
about, you're crazy!

186
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:11,061
You're playing with their
emotions! It's just not fair!

187
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:13,188
Will you shut up?!
It's not like that!

188
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:15,399
Oh, sure, I bet that's
what you tell them!

189
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,943
But you can't fool me,
Kenichi! I know exactly

190
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,194
--what you're doing!
--You're absolutely nuts!

191
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:23,157
I mean it, you've
lost your mind!

192
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:27,953
What are you doing,
Shigure? Get Down!

193
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:33,125
I'm watching you.

194
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,586
I swear, she just
gets weirder everyday.

195
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:36,587
Hey, wait a minute.

196
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:39,089
I just realized she's not
wearing her glasses.

197
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,257
Is there something wrong?

198
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:41,967
Oh, sorry. Where
are your glasses?

199
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:43,177
Well, I--

200
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:45,846
I wear contact lenses at home
but not at school 'cause...

201
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,681
Uh, I don't wear them
at school because

202
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,183
I'm afraid I'll lose
'em, that's all!

203
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:50,434
That makes sense...

204
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:52,311
I have to say this
is a lovely house.

205
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:53,896
Is this where you
and Kenichi live?

206
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:56,398
Yeah, but Kenichi's just living
here while he's training.

207
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:58,901
His training? You mean
all that fighting.

208
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:02,070
Kenichi's learning an
honorable and ancient craft.

209
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,573
He plans to master
everything, including Karate,

210
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:05,908
Judo, and Muay Thai.

211
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:08,118
Aren't they all pretty
much the same thing?

212
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:11,038
Oh! Sorry, I sometimes forget
that most average girls

213
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,998
are clueless when it
comes to martial arts.

214
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:15,417
Yeah, I'm really not interested
in ways to hurt people.

215
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,002
I prefer to do
things that require

216
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:20,130
a little more intelligence.

217
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,840
Oh, man. what's up?

218
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,300
Do they hate each
other or something?

219
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,259
I'm confused.

220
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:26,011
Ha! And let the show begin!

221
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:28,514
The way you talk about it,
I guess you like fighting too.

222
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:31,099
No, no, I hate fighting,
but I do enjoy

223
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:32,267
practicing various martial arts.

224
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,061
Oh, right, you don't
like fighting.

225
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,939
You punch and kick
people for fun.

226
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:38,857
No, see, martial arts is a way

227
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:40,651
to protect yourself
or your loved ones.

228
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:43,111
Sure, that's sweet. You can save
your loved one with violence,

229
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:45,447
but can you have a discussion
with them about gardening?

230
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:47,783
Maybe not, but we get
to be sparring partners,

231
00:11:47,783 --> 00:11:50,285
while I'm pretty sure planting
flowers is a solo activity.

232
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:51,787
You mean you get to fight them?

233
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:53,497
Yeah, I can see how
that's more appealing.

234
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:55,290
Actually, sparring is about
learning to understand

235
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,626
each other in a very
deep and unspoken way.

236
00:11:57,626 --> 00:12:00,879
As the old saying goes,
"talk is cheap".

237
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,297
You just beat each other up?

238
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:05,467
Is that how you get to know
them, by breaking their nose?

239
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:06,468
I'm scared!

240
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:09,429
I don't even know why,
but I'm really scared!

241
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,099
It's not as bad as you think.
It's actually very relaxing.

242
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,183
Right, Kenichi?

243
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,561
What? Well, I uh...

244
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:17,729
Even if that's true, I'm
sure you like taking care

245
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:19,439
of flowers and trees more
than getting punched.

246
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,275
Um. Well, I...

247
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,068
Time to fess up, Kenichi.

248
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:25,237
You have to pick one or
the other, so which is it?

249
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:27,364
Do you want the dojo,
or the Gardening Club?

250
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:29,700
What, they didn't ask me that!

251
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:36,623
This has been fun, but I
should get back to training!

252
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,126
And there you have it, girls!
He's made a decision!

253
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,877
His heart belongs to the dojo.

254
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:45,966
Will you shut up and quit
putting words in my mouth!

255
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,635
Are you guys spying on us!

256
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,304
I can't believe I live
with these people.

257
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:54,099
Wow, that was kind of scary.
You are absolutely nothing

258
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:57,477
like the good girl you
pretend to be at school.

259
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,897
Kenichi, weren't you saying
something about training?

260
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:01,607
You really shouldn't
keep Apachai waiting.

261
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:02,941
Oh! Right.

262
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:06,445
Izumi, So glad you stopped
by, it's been a pleasure.

263
00:13:06,445 --> 00:13:08,780
You're welcome to stay longer,
but I'm sure all the fighting,

264
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,741
as you call it, will
bore you to tears.

265
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:11,950
Actually, you've
piqued my interest!

266
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,118
I'd love to stay and watch.

267
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:15,245
What?! Like I believe that!

268
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:17,706
She was making fun of
it five minutes ago!

269
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:20,334
I was thinking about what you
said and it sounds fascinating.

270
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,502
In fact, I wanna
try it myself!

271
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,046
Oh, Is that so?

272
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:26,840
There is absolutely no way she'd
be willing to go this far.

273
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,675
Maybe I could
start training here!

274
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:29,635
Forget it, Izumi.

275
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:31,345
You probably wouldn't
even last two seconds.

276
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:34,264
Well, we'll just see about that.

277
00:13:34,264 --> 00:13:36,183
I want to take the trial course!

278
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:40,771
Hey wait a minute, Izumi!
This isn't a regular dojo!

279
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:44,274
If you're sure about this.
Then go right ahead.

280
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:49,404
Just don't act like we
didn't warn you, okay?

281
00:13:49,404 --> 00:13:52,032
Thank you for letting
me try out, Miu.

282
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,200
Uh don't mention it.

283
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,994
Is there any particular
style you wanna try first?

284
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:57,829
What have I gotten myself into?

285
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:00,290
I've practically begged her
to physically assault me.

286
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,543
This afternoon has seriously
spiraled out of control.

287
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:08,674
But it was her idea, not mine.

288
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:10,634
Kenichi's already
itching to intervene.

289
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:11,885
Man, he sure is predictable.

290
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:14,137
His biggest weakness is
his uncontrollable urge

291
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:16,056
to help the weak.
Without a doubt,

292
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,350
he'll jump in to save Izumi
the second things turn ugly.

293
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,269
And that desire to protect her
will quickly turn into love.

294
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,897
And then Miu will be all mine.

295
00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:40,205
Okay then, have you decided
which style of martial arts

296
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:41,331
you'd like to start with?

297
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,875
I'm not sure what you
even mean by style.

298
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,002
I know there's punching
and kicking, but that's it.

299
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:49,756
Oh, well, you can either
choose Jujitsu, Judo,

300
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,258
Kung Fu, Muay Thai...

301
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,593
Why don't you pick the person
you're least afraid of?

302
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,845
Uh, hey, Akisame.

303
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:57,723
You're a gentle artist,
you should teach her.

304
00:14:57,723 --> 00:14:58,974
Guess what, Apachai?

305
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:03,311
You finally get to have
your very own disciple.

306
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:04,438
Oh, look at him.

307
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:06,481
He's so excited
he's digging a hole.

308
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:08,900
Right this way,
Elder. Over here.

309
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,902
Well, everyone's here.

310
00:15:10,902 --> 00:15:12,779
Is there some kind
of special occasion?

311
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,239
Don't make Apachai do it!

312
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,699
You're lucky.
Five more minutes

313
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,242
and you'd have been
swimming in lava.

314
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:20,245
Hey, check it out. We've got
a new applicant for our dojo.

315
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:23,415
Yes Hayato, we have
a new disciple for you.

316
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:26,126
What about you? Do
you also want to learn?

317
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,043
Well?

318
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:28,420
Thanks, but I'll pass.

319
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,213
Fine, but there's
nothing more embarrassing

320
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:33,049
than a high school student
who can't use a chain sickle.

321
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:35,177
You'll regret it someday. Soon.

322
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:39,347
No! I'm fine, really!

323
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:41,224
So, young lady,
you're interested

324
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:42,517
in learning martial arts?

325
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:43,435
Yes, sir.

326
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:46,146
I have to warn you this
is not an easy dojo.

327
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,357
Before I accept you, there is
a rigorous entry test to pass.

328
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:52,527
Oh. Well I guess
that's only fair.

329
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,362
Then you must
complete ten pushups.

330
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:55,322
What?!

331
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,324
C'mon, Grandpa,
quit joking around!

332
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,493
Will you please give
her a real test?

333
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:03,330
I forgot to mention you can
only use your left thumb.

334
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,582
That's not fair!
It's not even possible!

335
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,125
Nobody can do that!

336
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:11,338
Actually, it's very
possible. Just look.

337
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:15,842
One, two, three, four...

338
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,260
You've gotta be kidding me!

339
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,179
If you can't even do
this, then your life

340
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,891
will be in serious
danger here. Ten.

341
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:25,352
I suppose that might
be too difficult

342
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:29,314
for an ordinary person. to be
fair, you can use both hands.

343
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:30,732
Thank you!

344
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:32,484
Does he realize what he's doing?

345
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:35,278
Hey, Grandpa. Don't you
think that's too easy?

346
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:37,405
I know what I'm doing.

347
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:39,658
Okay, I'm sure this
can't be that hard.

348
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,962
I don't think I'm strong
enough to do it!

349
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:53,129
What does she mean?

350
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:54,798
Does she have some kind
of muscle disease?

351
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:56,591
You stop the scaring of Apachai!

352
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:57,968
Man, that's just sad.

353
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:02,806
She's gotta be one hardcore nerd
if she can't do a single pushup.

354
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:04,224
Izumi.

355
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:10,689
Maybe I can't use
a chain sickle,

356
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:12,274
but I am certainly swift.

357
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:14,734
I'd like to see her
try to run so fast.

358
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:31,860
I can't do it! I tried as
hard as I could, but I can't!

359
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:37,507
Hey, it's okay, Izumi.

360
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:39,134
You shouldn't beat
yourself up about it.

361
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:42,095
But I think it's probably a good
idea if you don't join the dojo.

362
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,180
We're not joking,
it's easy to die here.

363
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:53,064
This, is like some
stupid nightmare.

364
00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:56,359
Why does that crazy
chick keep following me?

365
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,736
It's because.

366
00:17:57,736 --> 00:17:59,154
Run.

367
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,784
There we go!

368
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,704
I lost her with my patented
ninety-degree corner maneuver!

369
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:18,173
Did I manage to shake
her for good?

370
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:33,265
C'mon, really?

371
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:35,225
Don't tell me that you're
actually that weak.

372
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:37,311
I only hit you with one finger.

373
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:38,729
I'm. fine.

374
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:43,734
That's what I like to
hear. Now act like it.

375
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:47,946
Oh did you run into
my finger again?

376
00:18:47,946 --> 00:18:49,239
Alright then!

377
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:52,534
I made you some tea.

378
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:53,952
Thanks. That's just
what I needed.

379
00:18:53,952 --> 00:18:56,538
I'm sorry I acted like such
an immature brat earlier.

380
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:59,166
I'm embarrassed. I don't
know what came over me.

381
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,461
Same here. I'm really
sorry I was so rude.

382
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:11,136
I hope this doesn't sound mean,
but I think Kenichi might have

383
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:12,554
a stronger aptitude
for gardening

384
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:14,515
than he does for this
martial arts stuff.

385
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:15,224
Definitely.

386
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:17,059
You know, the masters
here are always saying

387
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:19,478
he doesn't have any natural
talent for Martial Arts.

388
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:21,772
But then, why does he do it?

389
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:24,191
Um, I guess it's because he
just got sick and tired

390
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:27,110
of running away all the time.

391
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,779
Yeah, before he joined the dojo

392
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:30,489
he used to run away
from everything.

393
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:36,411
But I think he realized he was
running from his own fear.

394
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:37,746
Okay, I'm done.

395
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:40,582
And who said you
get to decide that?

396
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:44,586
Get up! You at least have to
stand on your feet to run away!

397
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:46,380
What? What'd you say?

398
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,924
Who's running away?

399
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,474
I don't know if that
made any sense,

400
00:19:57,474 --> 00:19:59,434
but you got the
right spirit kid.

401
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:10,154
Wow, they have a
hot springs back here?

402
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:12,656
I bet people would be willing
to pay an admission for this.

403
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:14,324
Especially if I told
them that it had

404
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:15,826
some type of healing properties.

405
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:25,586
How many times can
I fall for this?

406
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:30,924
Are you ever gonna get bored
with trying to kill me?!

407
00:20:30,924 --> 00:20:33,427
I'm sorry for interrupting
your training, Kenichi.

408
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:34,428
It won't happen again.

409
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:35,637
Don't worry about it, Izumi.

410
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:39,600
You know, young lady, I think
you learned something today.

411
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,894
Was there anything about
watching Kenichi's training

412
00:20:41,894 --> 00:20:44,855
that made you recognize
something about yourself?

413
00:20:44,855 --> 00:20:46,356
There was.

414
00:20:46,356 --> 00:20:48,775
Despite what it looks like,
training isn't just about

415
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:51,111
strengthening your physicality
or defending yourself.

416
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:53,071
In fact, the most
important thing is that

417
00:20:53,071 --> 00:20:57,367
it teaches you to
think with your heart.

418
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:59,077
Make sure you come
back to see us.

419
00:20:59,077 --> 00:21:00,704
You're welcome any time.

420
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:03,165
And if you change your
mind, take my entry test.

421
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:04,499
It's much easier.

422
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:06,835
Thanks so much,
everyone. Bye, Kenichi.

423
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:07,878
I'll see you tomorrow.

424
00:21:07,878 --> 00:21:10,923
Bye, Izumi. See you
at school tomorrow.

425
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:16,887
Oh, man, I don't know what
I would do if Izumi actually

426
00:21:16,887 --> 00:21:19,598
joined the dojo. I think
that would be too weird.

427
00:21:19,598 --> 00:21:20,390
That's funny.

428
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,351
I got the impression
you wanted he to join.

429
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:24,228
I think you were showing off.

430
00:21:24,228 --> 00:21:26,230
You obviously had more
energy than usual

431
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,148
and I don't think that
was a coincidence.

432
00:21:28,148 --> 00:21:30,692
C'mon, that's not true.

433
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:32,486
Really? That's what
it looked like.

434
00:21:32,486 --> 00:21:35,030
By the way, Kenichi,
how many pushups

435
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,658
can you do with your thumb?

436
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:39,660
I'll be shocked
if he can do ten.

437
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,662
I'm sure he can
at least do 20.

438
00:21:41,662 --> 00:21:43,747
Well, for Miu it was
a piece of cake.

439
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:45,540
Apa, Apa!

440
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,626
Don't make me!

441
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:49,544
So? How many?

442
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:58,178
It seemed like such a perfect
plan, but there were just

443
00:21:58,178 --> 00:22:00,055
too many unexpected
elements involved.

444
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:02,766
It's too bad, but I guess
we'll have to call it a day.

445
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:04,851
Just as long as I've got
Kenichi on my side,

446
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:07,396
I don't need to worry about
my grand plans for the future.

447
00:22:07,396 --> 00:22:08,647
And today wasn't a total bust.

448
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:11,942
I did manage to glean some solid
stats on Kenichi's masters.

449
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:14,069
I've never admitted
it to myself before,

450
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:17,489
but I've always run too. But
I'm not gonna do it anymore!

451
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:19,032
I'm gonna stand my
ground and fight

452
00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:20,867
for what I want from now on!

453
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:22,786
Excellent! I was
worried you might not

454
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:25,706
be on board for
Operation Temptation.

455
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:29,167
Just think, frilly, skimpy,
transparent, and sexy!

456
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:30,669
Yoo-hoo.

457
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:33,588
Once Kenichi sees you,
he'll be putty in your hands!

458
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:36,174
I don't have an
outfit like that!

459
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:45,017
So that's the most
important thing, huh?

460
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:47,811
Well, then, if
that's the case,

461
00:22:47,811 --> 00:22:50,522
I'm gonna do everything in my
power to become the kind of girl

462
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:52,232
that's right for Kenichi!

463
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:22,531
O Romeo, Romeo!
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

464
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:23,698
Hello? Miu?

465
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:26,701
Or, if thou wilt not.
be but sworn my love.

466
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:28,620
Hey, Miu! Miu!

467
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,080
Oh, hey. I'm sorry, Kenichi.

468
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,207
I've been cast as Juliet
in the school play

469
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:34,292
and I'm going crazy trying
to remember these lines.

470
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:36,169
That's cool. Sounds
like a lot of hard work.

471
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:38,338
Yeah, it is, but my co-star has
been coaching me

472
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:42,008
and he's really great. He's just
so talented and dependable,

473
00:24:42,008 --> 00:24:43,927
and he has such gentle eyes.

474
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:46,179
Why are you staring off
into space like that?

475
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:48,557
No, Miu! Don't fall
in love with this guy!
