1
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:12,554
[Music]

2
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,307
You're a dead!

3
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,818
Just as I planned...

4
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,903
You're predictable,
Berserker...

5
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,530
Whenever it comes time
for your last attack

6
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,198
you do something flashy...

7
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,950
That's when you
leave yourself open.

8
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,870
You just stood there
and took the hits

9
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,371
until you saw an opening?

10
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,165
Most fighters wouldn't
choose to win that way.

11
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,499
Didn't I tell you...?!

12
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,752
You and I have different
ideas of what victory means.

13
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,630
I suggest that
you surrender

14
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,883
before this starts to
get ugly, Berserker...

15
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,177
You can't handle a
real martial artist.

16
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,762
I'm not giving up now...

17
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,055
I'm having too much fun.

18
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,059
Yup... Definitely
a Hermit move...

19
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,935
He always wants to go
straight for the joints.

20
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,355
Dam... you Bastard!

21
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,316
You may not think my
training is equivalent

22
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,525
to your natural talent...

23
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,404
He attacked using
his dislocated elbow!

24
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,365
But I put everything
into my training.....!...

25
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,824
100 percent!

26
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,742
Don't you see that's

27
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,285
how this art form
has been passed down

28
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,953
for thousands of years!

29
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,997
It's because in the
world of martial arts...

30
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,919
Hard work will always
surpass talent!

31
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,351
Yes!

32
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,190
Then again,
I've trained hard

33
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,484
but I also have
a natural talent.

34
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,985
I'll tell you one thing...

35
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,821
Even if you had fought
against Shirahama

36
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,072
you still would've lost.

37
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,367
Bastard!

38
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,828
My body won't move.

39
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:23,995
I don't understand...

40
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,957
What... What is
this strange feeling??

41
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,375
I never feel
anything like it.

42
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,047
That's what it feels
like to lose a fight.

43
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,173
Al- right...!...

44
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,800
He totally kicked ass!

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,260
I knew it...!...

46
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,345
Just as I expected- he had
no problem defeating him.

47
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,060
Time for the main event.

48
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,271
Kenichi...

49
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,525
Tag me out??

50
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,988
Aw man, that hurt!

51
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,161
Berserker has
been defeated!

52
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,287
You losers
have just witnessed

53
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,289
the power of the
Shinpaku Alliance!

54
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,583
Now that we've got
Hermit we're unstoppable!

55
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,877
Who says I've joined
your stupid alliance??

56
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,425
I'm not done with you yet!

57
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,221
This feeling...

58
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,557
I've never felt
anything like it before.

59
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,601
Slow down... Don't
try to stand up yet.

60
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,360
Look how hard you're having
to work just to stand up.

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,321
There's no way you
can fight like this.

62
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,909
Be careful out there
Captain Shirahama!

63
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,577
Don't be an idiot-
get away from him!

64
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,037
Why do you have to be the
good guy all the time??!

65
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,080
Outta my way!

66
00:04:58,788 --> 00:04:59,693
Now you listen...

67
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:01,987
Berserker...

68
00:05:01,987 --> 00:05:05,323
My entire martial arts career
has been full of losses!

69
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:08,076
If I know anything it's
what it feels like to lose.

70
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:09,327
That's all I was
capable of doing

71
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:11,455
for the longest time.

72
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:13,165
You sure seem
proud of that fact.

73
00:05:13,165 --> 00:05:14,916
I gotta say,
it's kinda weird.

74
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,501
But I learned
from that feeling-

75
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:19,838
I realized I needed to
learn how to overcome it.

76
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:22,132
And that's when I really
began to grow as a fighter.

77
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:25,719
You've gotta be able to
admit your own defeat...

78
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:28,472
You can always come back later
and give it another shot.

79
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:30,015
Admit my defeat??

80
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:30,932
That's right...

81
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:33,560
One or two losses don't
mean anything, Berserker.

82
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,312
I'm telling you- the world
is full of Masters

83
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:36,897
that are so
incredibly powerful

84
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:39,232
that you could never even
dream of defeating them.

85
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:40,692
Is that true?

86
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:41,902
There are other
people out there

87
00:05:41,902 --> 00:05:44,237
-who could easily defeat me??
-Yep.

88
00:05:44,237 --> 00:05:45,197
Are there a lot of them??

89
00:05:45,197 --> 00:05:46,990
Yep, tons of 'em.

90
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,034
My masters included.

91
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:51,119
I guess I'll take
your word for it...

92
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:52,954
I'll go ahead and throw
in the towel for today.

93
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,417
You know... Now that
I think about it

94
00:05:57,417 --> 00:06:00,087
I have felt this
emotion once before...

95
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:02,380
I'm not used to losing
so it's hard to recognize

96
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,341
but I remember it from
a fight a while back.

97
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:07,886
I didn't have enough
experience as a fighter

98
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:11,348
to understand what I was
going through at the time...

99
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:13,642
All I knew was that this
strange feeling erupted

100
00:06:13,642 --> 00:06:16,061
from deep within me in
the middle the fight.

101
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:17,813
It was overwhelming...

102
00:06:17,813 --> 00:06:20,690
I didn't understand it then
but I think I get it now...

103
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,734
I knew I shouldn't
have fought him...

104
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:24,694
I should have followed my
instincts and walked away

105
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:25,946
the moment I saw him.

106
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:31,201
For some reason I don't get
that feeling around you...

107
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:32,953
I'd just give up, kid...

108
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:34,287
It's impossible
to beat Odin.

109
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:44,840
Stay out of this and let him
make his own decisions...

110
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,633
this doesn't concern you.

111
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,635
Berserker!

112
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:51,429
A fight between two men
should be a sacred ritual-

113
00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:53,890
one in which the winner
annihilates the loser.

114
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:00,564
Damn it, Kenichi.
Get it together.

115
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:01,648
I don't know what happened

116
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:03,441
that made you turn
out like this...

117
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,734
But...

118
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:07,445
Now I know I'm gonna
have to use force...

119
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:09,739
To try and straighten
out your attitude.

120
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:14,578
Looks like they're
gonna go at it!

121
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:16,663
The two generals are
finally gonna fight!

122
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:19,708
Uh, but I thought you
were the general sir??

123
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,209
I'm the commander!

124
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:22,335
Be careful Kenichi-

125
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:24,379
don't let Odin
touch you directly.

126
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:27,340
Alright. It's finally
time for the main event!

127
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,675
Hey, you never told us

128
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:31,261
how the kid's mountain
training ended up.

129
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:32,929
Let's just say
he's at a point

130
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:36,600
where I'm confident he can
defeat any delinquent he meets.

131
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,643
But this young man isn't
'any delinquent'...

132
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:40,061
Is he??

133
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:41,229
No matter what you do-

134
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,315
You'll never break
through my Seikuuken.

135
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:50,822
He just flicked my punch
aside like it was nothing!

136
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:51,615
Damn it!

137
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:54,743
Well done!...
You dodged me!

138
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:58,121
Stop the water.

139
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:00,582
Aw man... whew,
that feels better.

140
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:07,005
I can see it...

141
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:08,715
His Seikuuken.

142
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:10,425
But that's impossible.

143
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:11,927
How'd he learn such a
difficult technique

144
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:13,470
in so little time.

145
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,680
He couldn't have learned
that on his own...

146
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,849
Someone must've taught
him how to do it...

147
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:20,352
His master must be
some kinda monster!

148
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:29,653
They're getting
ready to fight!

149
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:31,196
This is going to be the
battle of the century!

150
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:34,491
Those two are going to
attack each other con veloce!

151
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:35,742
Hate to say it
but he's right.

152
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:37,410
I wish I could see
what's going on.

153
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:51,967
They're so close...

154
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,134
And they're getting
closer...!...

155
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,886
This is so exciting-
just one more step

156
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:55,887
and the battle will begin!

157
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:57,597
Hey Sieg... Come on
let me take a look.

158
00:08:57,597 --> 00:08:58,765
No... Wait your turn!

159
00:09:04,437 --> 00:09:06,272
They're not even thinking
about their moves...

160
00:09:06,272 --> 00:09:07,774
They're fighting
on instinct.

161
00:09:07,774 --> 00:09:09,067
Yeah...

162
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,111
They attacked big and then
worried about technique...

163
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:12,445
that's good.

164
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:14,072
It's interesting to
watch two fighters

165
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:16,658
with such similar skills
go at it like that...

166
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:18,952
It's almost as if they're
fighting for territory

167
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:20,412
rather than
dealing blows.

168
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,956
Just like a game
of Shougi or Go.

169
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:24,624
I gotta say, you
did a damn fine job

170
00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:27,752
given the circumstances,
old man.

171
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:29,546
But I noticed
something weird...

172
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:31,589
that kid he's fighting
isn't normal...

173
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:34,426
Kinda makes me wonder who his
martial arts master might be.

174
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:37,762
Yes... I had the same
thought myself...

175
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:40,974
His moves are very similar
to a man I once knew...

176
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:42,392
Oh... look...!...

177
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:44,519
The man I was talking
about is over there.

178
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,104
What...? Are you serious??!

179
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:47,105
Who're you talking about??

180
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:55,321
The crew from Ryozanpaku
is here to watch.

181
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:57,365
Ogata Ishinsai!

182
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:58,950
This is going to
be quite a fight-

183
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,244
my disciple against theirs.

184
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:03,079
I can't wait to
see who wins.

185
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:07,083
Kenichi's fighting
him right now!

186
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:12,422
Miu...?... Do you know
where Opera boy went??

187
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:15,550
Where'd he go??!

188
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,427
Apa? If you're looking
for the singing man

189
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:18,553
he's gone swimming.

190
00:10:19,804 --> 00:10:21,931
I'm... coming...

191
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:23,767
to... help!

192
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:24,642
How can he swim?

193
00:10:24,642 --> 00:10:26,186
That has to hurt!

194
00:10:26,186 --> 00:10:29,397
Yeah... especially
with broken ribs.

195
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:31,066
La!

196
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:33,276
He's... drowning... guys.

197
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:38,865
Just where do you
think you're going...

198
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:40,241
Don't be stupid.

199
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:49,376
Wow... They're so close...

200
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:51,002
I've never seen anyone
fight like that.

201
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:52,212
It's insane.

202
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:53,671
Neither one can
get a hit in.

203
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,472
This is harder
than I thought-

204
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:04,933
Ryuto has more experience
with the Seikuuken than I do.

205
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:05,934
You can't keep dodging.

206
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:08,269
You're going to have
to attack eventually!

207
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,230
You can't run from
your opponent...

208
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,940
you've got to stay
close to them...

209
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,066
I'm tellin' ya...

210
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:15,652
That's the safest
place to be in a fight.

211
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:17,946
I'm so lucky to have had
the Elder's training...

212
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:19,989
Without it Ryuto would've
beaten me already.

213
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:30,917
This is the
best fight ever!

214
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,587
This fight looks like
something out of a movie.

215
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:37,549
Yeah. All of this flashy
moves get all fast, huh?

216
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,594
But I guess it's not too
bad for a kid's fight...

217
00:11:41,594 --> 00:11:43,346
I'm good as long as
I've got a cold one.

218
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:49,936
It's empowering to see you
helpless in front of me-

219
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:52,105
almost makes me feel bad
for what I'm about to do.

220
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:53,940
I don't understand...

221
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,317
When'd you become such
a jerk, Ryuto....?

222
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,403
Tell me.

223
00:11:58,403 --> 00:12:00,155
You were the nice one...

224
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:01,698
You always had a
smile on your face.

225
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:03,283
You were full of optimism.

226
00:12:03,283 --> 00:12:05,743
And you taught me
so many things...

227
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:07,203
When did you change??

228
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,418
I became stronger...

229
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:16,129
That's what happened
to me, Kenichi...

230
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:17,630
While normal kids like
you were playing

231
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,674
I spent my time training...

232
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:22,594
Don't be upset-
you should be proud.

233
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:25,221
I endured severe training
to rise up the ranks;

234
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:27,098
to become the leader
of Ragnarok...

235
00:12:27,098 --> 00:12:28,266
All because of the promise

236
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:31,019
we made to be
stronger someday.

237
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,061
So, in a way,

238
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:33,980
the success of Ragnarok
is all thanks to you!

239
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:38,276
Let me ask you this...

240
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:40,361
What was your
motivation....?

241
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,780
What made you want to
become a martial artist??

242
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:45,491
Well, I...

243
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:49,370
I wanna protect the
people important to me!

244
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:53,583
I started my martial arts
training for that reason...

245
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,210
And to build confidence.

246
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,628
My, my...

247
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:59,047
That Kenichi Shirahama
is pretty impressive.

248
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,256
I see...

249
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:02,133
You haven't changed...

250
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:04,177
Still playing superhero.

251
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:05,428
Where's your
cape, Kenichi??

252
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:09,807
Quit laughing- it wasn't
even that funny...!

253
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:12,352
Our leader is so much cooler
than this purple haired freak!

254
00:13:13,311 --> 00:13:15,855
Well...

255
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:17,857
I think you've got
the wrong idea, Odin.

256
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:18,942
Is that right??

257
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:20,485
I don't think
you understand...

258
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:22,070
He's not playing
anything...

259
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,197
Kenichi's an idiot.

260
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:26,741
What you see is what
you get with him...

261
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:28,660
There are no surprises.

262
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,119
That so...?

263
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,955
Let's test that theory...

264
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:33,998
We'll see how
serious he is.

265
00:13:33,998 --> 00:13:36,167
We've had enough fun
toying with these men...

266
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,502
Get rid of them.

267
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:39,671
Oh crap....! I should've
kept my big mouth shut!

268
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:45,802
Don't be afraid- he's just
doing that for show...

269
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:48,721
Hermit's already wasted all
his power fighting Berserker.

270
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:50,473
Damn... He saw through it.

271
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:54,644
Just try to take down
as many as you can!

272
00:13:54,644 --> 00:13:56,688
Stop it!

273
00:13:56,688 --> 00:13:57,855
What's the matter?

274
00:13:57,855 --> 00:14:01,025
Your moves slowed
down all of a sudden.

275
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:04,195
The martial arts were created
to destroy one's opponent.

276
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:07,699
They were never intended
to protect people.

277
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:10,660
Damn it! My body
feels so heavy.

278
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,037
Die, you traitor!

279
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:14,289
I can't keep
this up anymore-

280
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:16,124
I've sustained to
many injuries...

281
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:17,375
Behind you captain! Look!

282
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:21,462
I told you...

283
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:22,922
Your motivation
is all wrong.

284
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:24,841
Now die!

285
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:28,469
Tanimoto!

286
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:46,776
Tanimoto!

287
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:53,866
I'm not going
to let you...

288
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:59,122
Grandpa, I thought you were
going to bring him back here!

289
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:00,164
What happened??!

290
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:02,208
Well... I got him
to the other side.

291
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:07,088
If the boy wants to fight
so bad then let him.

292
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:08,506
But he's hurt!

293
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:09,841
Siegfried...

294
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:10,842
I've come to help...

295
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:12,051
Are you okay...?

296
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:13,845
I'll fight to the
death if I have to...

297
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:16,431
I'll do anything to protect
the melodies of my comrades.

298
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:17,473
Get outta here, Sieg.

299
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:19,017
I don't need your help.

300
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,310
Don't be afraid...!

301
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,978
He's wounded like
the rest of them...!

302
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:22,895
Go!

303
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:33,573
You guys know the
heroes always show up

304
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:35,408
when they're least expected.

305
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:37,827
The Shinpaku Alliance
is here to save the day!

306
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:38,703
What the--??

307
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:39,912
Hey guys!

308
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:41,122
Leave these punks to us...

309
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:43,416
Kenichi!

310
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,626
Just concentrate
on fighting Odin

311
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:46,210
and we'll take
care of the rest!

312
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,503
Those bastards...

313
00:15:47,503 --> 00:15:49,464
I don't have time to
worry about them now.

314
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:51,132
They're not bastards...

315
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:53,092
Those guys are
my friends, jerk!

316
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,012
Uh-oh...

317
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:58,806
It looks like Kenichi's aura
has changed all of a sudden.

318
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:00,933
When someone fights for
what they believe in...

319
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:04,270
That's when their true
power is finally revealed.

320
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,438
Judging by his aura,

321
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:08,107
Kenichi is fighting for
what he feels is right!

322
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,490
Ryuto Asamiya...

323
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,574
You're going down!

324
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:20,787
You can use martial arts
to protect people...!

325
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:22,246
And to save them...!

326
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:23,539
If it wasn't for Kenichi

327
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:26,125
I never would have been
able to get back into boxing!

328
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,585
Double uppercut!

329
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:31,881
Takeda's right...!

330
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:33,299
If it wasn't for Kenichi

331
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:35,843
I would've completely
given up on Judo!

332
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:38,304
Over the shoulder throw!

333
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:40,264
He helped me realize I
was on the wrong path...

334
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:42,433
Overhand throw!

335
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,060
Yes...

336
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,812
He was able to change
our melodies...

337
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:47,814
Into something beautiful!

338
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:50,316
He brought us together...

339
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:54,278
Now... We are both
friends and team mates!

340
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:55,738
Whatever... not me.

341
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:04,539
Ridiculous.

342
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:08,710
You have a hard time
understanding friendship...

343
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,961
Huh, Ryuto??

344
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:11,379
It's not that I
don't understand-

345
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:12,630
it's just so naive.

346
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:18,720
Kohou!

347
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:21,764
How'd he get
behind me so fast?!

348
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,683
I'll just take
a step back.

349
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:27,603
Haiho!

350
00:17:30,273 --> 00:17:31,482
I can't believe it!

351
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:34,444
That's the first martial
arts move I ever taught him!

352
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:35,862
See that...

353
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:37,989
When the toes come together
it's called "kouho."

354
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:40,867
And when you pivot out
it's called it "haiho."

355
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,952
The key is how you
move your feet.

356
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:44,954
Now that I've stepped
forward with my right foot

357
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:46,122
I can put all
my weight on it

358
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:48,416
and that leaves
my left foot free.

359
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,043
So I can pivot...
Like this...

360
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:54,881
Holy crap he
knocked Odin down!

361
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:56,090
Way to go, Kenichi!

362
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,550
Keep up the good
work, kiddo!

363
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:03,556
Now take off your glasses.

364
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:06,642
I would never hit
a man in glasses...

365
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:10,188
I wanna do this
the right way...

366
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:12,065
So take them
off now, Ryuto!

367
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:18,279
Well, that was
certainly noble of you,

368
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:19,989
Kenichi Shirahama...

369
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:21,407
You're a good fighter

370
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:24,076
but I don't think you're ready
to face off with my disciple.

371
00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:25,495
No...

372
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:28,080
I don't think that
you'll live through it...

373
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,457
What a shame.

374
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:36,798
I have to tell you I'm
really impressed, Kenichi...

375
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:39,383
You're better
than I thought.

376
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:42,011
Are you sure you want me
to take off my glasses??

377
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:46,265
Go ahead.

378
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,730
You're about to find out

379
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,138
why they gave me the
nickname Odin...

380
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:01,308
When I see things like this,
the game changes.

381
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,559
What the hell?!

382
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,019
I thought he was
near-sighted!

383
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,355
How can he fight
without his glasses??!

384
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,398
Is he trying to trick me...?

385
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,942
I'm not gonna give
him the chance!

386
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,122
This feels weird.

387
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,457
It's almost as
if my punches

388
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:28,502
are being sucked
into his palms!

389
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,587
How the hell is he
doing that...?..?...!

390
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,048
He's blocked every single
one of my punches...!...

391
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,676
Can he even see them
without his glasses?!

392
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,552
It's like he's able to
read all of my attacks!

393
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:38,845
But how??!

394
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,935
Odin...

395
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:45,936
Here we go...

396
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:47,062
This is it!

397
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,814
According to Norse
Mythology he was a god

398
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,315
who traveled the world
as an old man.

399
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,608
He wields a javelin

400
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,819
which he can throw with
perfect accuracy...

401
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,613
What the hell- this
is a bunch of crap!

402
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:57,990
Odin sacrificed
one of his eyes

403
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,325
in order to gain the
'Wisdom of the Ages'.

404
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,451
Afterwards, he had the ability

405
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,745
to see through everything...

406
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,455
Whoa...

407
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,665
It can't be...

408
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,253
It may sound strange

409
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,880
but sometimes a person
can see things...

410
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,966
without ever really
having to look at them.

411
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,551
So he has the Inner Eye.

412
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,177
I never would've thought-

413
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,763
he's so young to have mastered
such a difficult technique.

414
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,682
What's the Inner
Eye, Grandpa??

415
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,434
The Inner Eye
allows you to see

416
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:26,768
even when your
eyes are weak...

417
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,562
To avoid attack.

418
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,897
You can see everything
with this technique...

419
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,108
Whether it's your next
attack or theirs...

420
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,985
It's an important
skill to have mastered

421
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,945
whenever you're faced
with a high-level fighter

422
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,238
as your opponent.

423
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,406
When you use it
you're taking in the

424
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,158
overall visual
of your opponent

425
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,701
but you're also aware
of their breathing,

426
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,870
their slight movements
and even their next attack.

427
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,622
Got ya!

428
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,791
See? My Inner Eye told
me that you'd turn around

429
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,751
so I was able to
catch you unawares!

430
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,419
He just wanted to
touch some butt.

431
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,837
How do you keep
blocking me??!

432
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:56,339
It's all thanks
to my Inner Eye...

433
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,550
If I didn't have it you
would've defeated me already.

434
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,718
You're quite powerful.

435
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,761
This is pointless-

436
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,179
you're never
going to be able

437
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,598
to break through my perfect
Seikuuken, Kenichi.

438
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,224
No matter how hard you try,

439
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,352
your attacks will
hit nothing but air.

440
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:09,478
Damn it!

441
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:10,979
Take this, you bastard!

442
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,481
What's the matter-you
getting frustrated??

443
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:14,066
Hold on a second.

444
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:16,401
If Odin's able to read
all of his attacks

445
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,819
then that means...

446
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,321
Watch out Kenichi!

447
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,782
Enough playing around-
I'm ready to attack!

448
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,246
That's impossible!

449
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,372
I dodged it!...

450
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,249
I don't understand...

451
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,418
How'd his punch get
past my defenses??

452
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,426
Now... Gungnir!

453
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,144
The Gungnir...

454
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:54,106
That's the name of Odin's
perfectly accurate javelin...

455
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:56,608
He really can see through
everything just like Odin.

456
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,610
He even saw through
Kenichi's dodge!

457
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,320
So how'd you like
that attack....?

458
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,863
My Gungnir...

459
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,865
Is a punch that never
misses it's target.

460
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:26,763
There's something
about this place

461
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,348
that reminds me of
when we were kids-

462
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,559
didn't we play
superheroes here??

463
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,852
Yeah...

464
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,520
I remember you always
had to be the good guy

465
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,896
whenever we played...

466
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,731
and I ended up being
the villain every time.

467
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,694
This time it'll
be different...

468
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,906
I will gladly play
the villain today!

469
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:58,837
[Music]

470
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,003
It's no use! I can see
through your attacks!

471
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,922
Oh yeah? Then how about
I throw in some attacks

472
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:25,131
that aren't mine??

473
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:25,715
What??

474
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:29,302
Apa! Apa-pa-pa-pa! A-PA!

475
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,387
The rhythm of his attacks

476
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,722
has completely changed
all of a sudden!

477
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:35,267
Bring me a beer!

478
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:36,559
Kousaka-style...

479
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,311
double... slash!

480
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,771
To understand
your opponent

481
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,523
you must understand
yourself.

482
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,441
What the hell are
you up to, Kenichi??!

483
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,484
Take this.
