1
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:07,260
Hey, Kenichi?
You okay? Hello?

2
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,012
Are you awake now?

3
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:10,847
From this day forward,
you're officially

4
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,724
a disciple of Ryozanpaku!

5
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,476
Right!

6
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:16,728
To formalize and honor
this new relationship,

7
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:19,648
from this moment onward you will
address each of us as "master"!

8
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:21,900
They're all acting so
different than usual...

9
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,443
This must be serious!

10
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,822
Yes! Master Sakaki!

11
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:32,160
You maniac!

12
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,746
I call this the Squid Dance.

13
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:38,333
Giviing it a cute name isn't
gonna make it any less deadly!

14
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,168
You know this is
attempted murder?!

15
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:42,003
If I don't flip over
to my back in time,

16
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:44,047
my stomach is gonna
get totally fried!

17
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,716
Is this supposed to
strengthen my back muscles

18
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:48,093
and my abdominals?!

19
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:49,636
Don't move.

20
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,054
Don't even twitch.

21
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:52,764
Maybe I'm overreacting,

22
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:55,600
but I'm starting to get a
very bad feeling about this.

23
00:02:56,518 --> 00:03:00,272
And what is this training
method supposed to teach me?

24
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:02,691
It's supposed to help
you overcome your fear.

25
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:04,151
That's my guess.

26
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,986
Uh, you guess?

27
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:13,076
Come on, you need to go a lot
faster than that, slowpoke!

28
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:17,747
Your legs are three times
stronger than your arms!

29
00:03:17,747 --> 00:03:20,834
Why's that? Right! Because
you walk with your legs!

30
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,419
That's how I figure it too!

31
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:25,172
Stop pushing!
I can't take it anymore!

32
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,176
Finally, it's
Apachai's turn now!

33
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:34,181
Hey, it's okay! Akisame
said Kenichi needs a break,

34
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,600
so Apachai should go easy
on the dangerous stuff.

35
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,145
Huh? So what exactly
are we gonna do?

36
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:41,897
Just regular free punching!

37
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:44,816
That's the most
dangerous thing of all!

38
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:59,164
Kenichi!

39
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:02,375
Are you okay? Speak to me!

40
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,504
Kenichiiiiiii!

41
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:16,306
Those guys are gonna
kill me, I just know it!

42
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:19,935
If I'm dead, my lovey-dovey
plan will never succeed!

43
00:04:19,935 --> 00:04:23,063
Hey, this is the best
situation you could hope for!

44
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,524
You never know what will happen
when you leave two young people

45
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:28,235
alone together and let
the old hormones work!

46
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,987
I wish this had happened
to me when I was your age!

47
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,200
Yeah, right. Instead,
they're making me stay

48
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,244
in a separate dormitory
with all the masters!

49
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,870
Miu's in the main house...

50
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,747
That's it! I'm not
going to stay here

51
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:41,832
and die in this hell hole!

52
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:43,542
I hope I remembered to
bring that book with me!

53
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:47,128
Found it! The "How to Break
out of Prison Manual!"

54
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,967
Looks like they're
watching me...

55
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:56,304
Okay, what am I suppose
do at a time like this?

56
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:57,347
Maybe dig a hole...?

57
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:59,474
No, I'm on the second floor.

58
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,230
Dear Son,

59
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,359
Though I don't know how many
days it's been since you left,

60
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:12,863
if you're reading this, it means
you're thinking about quitting.

61
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:15,866
Just remember that your
mother and I believe in you.

62
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:19,369
I know you can triumph
over any obstacle.

63
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:21,288
Don't run away, Son.

64
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,582
Signed, Dad.

65
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,293
Well...

66
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,420
he's right; it is
only the first day.

67
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,129
Thanks, Dad!

68
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,923
You've reminded me
that I can't run away!

69
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:33,842
I will not be defeated!

70
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:39,472
Chocolate, malted milk
balls, cookies, and...

71
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,351
Big Brother's favorite:
cheesy fish sticks!

72
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:47,355
There. Hey, Mom? Do you think
you could pack me a box lunch

73
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:48,690
to take to Kenichi?

74
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,360
No problem. I thought you were
just going for a quick visit.

75
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,572
It looks like you're packing for
an expedition up Mount Everest!

76
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:58,325
That dojo's more isolated
than a desert island,

77
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,119
I have to make sure I'm
prepared for anything!

78
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,954
I know he told us
not to visit him

79
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:04,873
'cause it would
interrupt his training.

80
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:07,709
But I've got a funny feeling...

81
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:10,462
Here you go, Kenichi!

82
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:14,215
My ginormous boobies
are all yours!

83
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,722
I won't let him fall
into the clutches of that

84
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:23,266
big-boobed hussy no matter what!

85
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:31,900
Okay, Honoka!

86
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,613
Make sure you take my
Sebastian with you for--

87
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:41,326
Huh? I'm sorry,
did you say something?

88
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:43,161
You must have
imagined it, sweetie.

89
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:01,638
Wake uuup!

90
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:07,894
Huh...?

91
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,146
Don't tell me it's time
to get up already...

92
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:22,033
It's been a week since
Kenichi moved in with us...

93
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:25,453
What? What is it? Is it a
fire? Is it an earthquake?!

94
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:27,497
Nope, it's morning, kid.

95
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:29,749
Morning?

96
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,377
It's only four o'clock,
the sun's not up!

97
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:35,547
It's like they say,
the early bird catches the worm!

98
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:39,259
So, you ready to get out
there and carpe some diem?

99
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,677
Well?!

100
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,725
How about we start with three
easy laps around the city

101
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:48,017
before breakfast?

102
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:51,521
It feels like I'm getting up
earlier every morning...

103
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:53,898
...and doing more
laps each time!

104
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,154
Well, see you guys later, then!

105
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:01,906
He seems to be adjusting
pretty well to life here.

106
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:04,159
I think he's even
starting to have fun!

107
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:12,500
You lunatic!
Somebody save meee!

108
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:20,884
All right, it's
my turn today. Heh.

109
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:23,636
I'm not gonna lay a hand on you,
just take your best shot.

110
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,638
Right!

111
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,891
His sparring practice
is going well.

112
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,063
You're too slow!

113
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,651
You didn't say
anything about feet...

114
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,528
What'd you expect?

115
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:43,740
You're small with a short reach.
This'll train you to get inside

116
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,076
your opponent's reach
so you can dodge his kicks.

117
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:49,245
Yeah, that's great.

118
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:52,999
Okay, boys it's
time for breakfast!

119
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,543
I've noticed
during meal times...

120
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:00,590
A-pa-pa!

121
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,258
Why don't you eat
your own food?!

122
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:03,259
What's that?

123
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,719
Stop it!

124
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:07,097
Will you two clowns
let the kid eat?

125
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:09,682
...he's even getting
better at fighting back.

126
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,519
Shopping sure has
gotten a lot easier

127
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,604
since you came
to stay with us.

128
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:16,648
I really appreciate
all your help.

129
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:18,316
Aw, it's nothing,
nothing at all.

130
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,652
Anything I can do to help
you out, you just ask.

131
00:09:20,652 --> 00:09:23,321
But you know, I'd probably
be a lot more helpful to you

132
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:25,573
if they didn't make me drag
these stupid leg irons around

133
00:09:25,573 --> 00:09:27,283
every time we left the dojo.

134
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:28,952
Well, it's like the
masters told you,

135
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:30,995
think of those as
"chains of love".

136
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:33,039
Do you remember when
you used to get winded

137
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,415
just from carrying
the groceries?

138
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:34,958
Yeah...

139
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,043
I must've seemed pretty
hopeless there for a while,

140
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,171
but I guess all this training
is finally starting to pay off.

141
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:41,714
If I can just keep up this pace,

142
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,675
then I should be strong
enough to protect Miu soon.

143
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:45,009
What was that you just said?

144
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:46,427
Huh?!

145
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:50,890
Oh, it was nothing
important, nothing at all!

146
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,559
Before you protect anyone,

147
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,769
you're going to need to
build up your leg strength.

148
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,437
Hey! Where did you--?

149
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:57,272
Oh, man!

150
00:09:57,272 --> 00:09:58,815
I don't need another one!

151
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:08,578
Every time I come
here, this dojo

152
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,288
looks like it
needs cleaning.

153
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:14,459
No fair, the gate's locked!

154
00:10:18,671 --> 00:10:20,840
But if they think something
like a dumb locked gate

155
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,343
is gonna keep me out,
then they don't know Honoka!

156
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:31,101
Apa?

157
00:10:34,813 --> 00:10:37,065
Apapapapapa!

158
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:47,659
He's gone!

159
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,379
It won't fit!

160
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:10,431
Hello! Apachai here!

161
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:11,850
Cookie attack!

162
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:16,146
Now's my chance.

163
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:19,232
What the--! How did you?!

164
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:20,525
Apa!

165
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:23,069
Chocolate and
potato chip attack!

166
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:26,698
Hello there! It's me, Apachai!

167
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:27,615
Oh, no!

168
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,617
What is he,
some kind of monster?!

169
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:33,621
Hard candy, peach jelly, pudding
snack, candy stick attack!

170
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:39,085
Hi! It's Apachai again!

171
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:43,715
He can't be human!

172
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:45,425
I'm running out of
stuff to throw!

173
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:48,011
All that's left are my brother's
favorite cheesy fish sticks

174
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,345
and the lunch Mom made him.

175
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:53,099
I have to protect those even
if this ogre eats me alive!

176
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:55,268
Time for a strategic withdrawal!

177
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:03,192
Ahh!

178
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:13,620
Ahh... paa!

179
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,248
You saved me? I don't get it.

180
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:20,126
So you're not really a big,
scary monster after all,

181
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:20,960
are you?

182
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,046
And here I thought
everyone in this dojo

183
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,547
was some kind of an evil fiend.

184
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:27,091
Sakaki likes to drink,
but he's a good person!

185
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:29,552
Kensei likes bikini pictures,
but he's a good person!

186
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:31,930
Akisame likes some
really confusing things,

187
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,056
but he's a good person!

188
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:34,724
Shigure likes to
play with weapons,

189
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:37,268
but she's a good person.

190
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:39,228
Do you mind taking me
to see my brother?

191
00:12:39,228 --> 00:12:41,189
Oh! He's a good person!

192
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:47,695
Apaaaa...?

193
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:50,323
Not here...

194
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:53,952
Or here...

195
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:55,620
Not here either!

196
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,038
What is this place?!

197
00:12:58,164 --> 00:12:59,040
Awww....

198
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,793
--he's not anywhere!
--Wait, Apachai have idea!

199
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:02,794
Apapa!

200
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:05,004
Apapaaaa!

201
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:09,842
He's not up here either!

202
00:13:09,842 --> 00:13:10,718
He just...

203
00:13:10,718 --> 00:13:12,303
...flew!

204
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:13,638
Maybe he's shopping?

205
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:16,182
Apachai saw Kensei
attach the leg irons.

206
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:17,266
Leg irons?

207
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,935
For shopping?!

208
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:25,233
Huh?

209
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:27,735
Hey! Those are my
brother's fish sticks!

210
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:28,736
Apa?

211
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:31,656
That thing is always stealing
food and blaming it on Apachai!

212
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:33,783
It's Shigure's mouse, Tochumaru!

213
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:38,496
Who's... this?

214
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:11,279
Why'd they have to go and leave
me here all alone like this...?

215
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,864
What're they doing?

216
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:15,158
Apa, apa!

217
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:16,576
Apapa!

218
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,497
Ah-pahh...?

219
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:25,043
Alright, where's the tea?

220
00:14:25,043 --> 00:14:26,294
Beats me.

221
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:29,839
But Apachai saw Miu making
tea just a few days ago.

222
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,174
Hey, everybody,

223
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:34,135
the tea is ready!

224
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:39,265
You're supposed to serve tea
when visitors come over, right?

225
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:42,435
Shigure! I found
some tea cups!

226
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:44,228
This sounds like
it might be tea...

227
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:44,979
doesn't it?

228
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:48,107
Next, we need some hot water.

229
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:50,443
Wow, making tea is easy!

230
00:14:50,443 --> 00:14:52,612
What did you do to the tea?!

231
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,949
--What's wrong?
--What's wrong?

232
00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:01,329
All right, you two,
it's time for a tea lesson!

233
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:01,996
First off,

234
00:15:01,996 --> 00:15:04,540
you gotta do this! See?!

235
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,334
Then, you do this!

236
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:07,585
And then this!

237
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:08,753
And there you go!

238
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:11,881
Tea!

239
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:14,175
Incredible! And so fast!

240
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,469
You're very skilled.

241
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:18,179
You think?

242
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:20,932
You're a genius!
Apachai jealous!

243
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:23,101
Very impressive!

244
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:26,813
Oh, wow, and I got a
"C" in home economics!

245
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:28,856
Well, anyway,
have some tea!

246
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:31,192
Okay! Thank you!

247
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:33,194
Absolutely amazing.

248
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:35,696
Ahhh! Apachai forget
to let the tea cool off!

249
00:15:35,696 --> 00:15:37,156
Hot! Hot!

250
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:51,671
You doing all right?
Legs getting tired?

251
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:53,631
Nah... this is nothing.

252
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,022
This gate weighs a ton no
matter how much I work out.

253
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:12,567
You just have to
know how, that's all.

254
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:19,282
Well, someone's
having a good time.

255
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:22,702
Looks like
you're outta luck.

256
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:23,578
Whoaaaa!

257
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:25,746
Apa?

258
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:27,915
It's Honoka!

259
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:30,042
Kenichi, you're back!

260
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:32,753
I was looking for you!

261
00:16:32,753 --> 00:16:34,839
Come on, knock it off,
you're embarrassing me!

262
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,468
Awwww, she's so adorable!

263
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:40,511
I told you,

264
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:43,890
I'm focusing really seriously
on my martial arts right now,

265
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,184
and you're interrupting
my training!

266
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:47,059
But, I...

267
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,436
Give her a break, Kenichi,

268
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:50,229
you don't have to be
so hard on her, do you?

269
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:51,105
Yeah, I do!

270
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:53,024
Otherwise, she'll be
here all the time!

271
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:56,402
Yeah, but...

272
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:59,947
You know what? You can come by
and visit me anytime you want!

273
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:02,325
Get outta my face, Blondie!

274
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:05,036
"Blondie"?

275
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:07,079
Oh! One sec!

276
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:12,126
Here! I brought this is for you!

277
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:14,253
Cheesy fish sticks, oh yeah!

278
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:15,963
But why is there only one?

279
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:18,299
Well... that's a long story.

280
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:23,429
Oh, so there you are.

281
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:26,140
It's almost time
for afternoon training.

282
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,099
Yes, sir!

283
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:27,892
Hm?

284
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:30,228
Training? That's right!

285
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:32,931
I've got to find out if
this dojo is legit or not!

286
00:17:36,995 --> 00:17:39,831
Okay, for this exercise all
you have to do is touch me

287
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:40,540
and you win the round.

288
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,751
Alright, let's go.

289
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:44,670
So Boobie-Girl's
his opponent, huh?

290
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,673
I sure hope he doesn't let her
feminine charms distract him!

291
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,438
Kenichi!

292
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:07,317
Hey! You better leave my
big brother alone, chesty!

293
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,236
Or I'll take you apart myself!

294
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:11,905
Oh! You're so cute!

295
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:20,080
It's go time! Right, Kenichi?

296
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,541
Ready when you are!

297
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,084
I know Apachai is a big sweetie,

298
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:26,628
so I bet he'll play nicer
than that blonde bimbo!

299
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:28,463
You think so?

300
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:29,756
Aaa...

301
00:18:29,756 --> 00:18:31,216
paaaa!

302
00:18:41,601 --> 00:18:43,186
Apachai went easy on him!

303
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:46,273
Honest I did! You've got
to believe me, Honoka!

304
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:55,407
I b'lieve you...

305
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:56,533
All right...

306
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,242
Huh?

307
00:18:57,242 --> 00:19:00,328
I think it might be best if I
finish this round of sparring.

308
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:13,258
Get on your feet!
Let's move it!

309
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:16,386
Do you think your enemies will
stand around while you recover?

310
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:21,808
Stop it! Stop it already!

311
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:24,144
No more! Stop hurting him!

312
00:19:24,144 --> 00:19:26,480
What kind of training
do you call this?!

313
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,107
You guys are just beating
up on my big brother!

314
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:31,610
You're all a bunch of bullies!

315
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,487
That's not true.

316
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:35,864
We're not beating up
on him, young lady.

317
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:44,331
What's wrong, Kenichi?
Are you ready to quit?

318
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:48,668
N-no. Not even close!

319
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:50,587
His eyes!

320
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:56,301
Leave her alone!

321
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:57,844
--Stop it!
--Big Brother!

322
00:19:57,844 --> 00:20:01,723
Anybody who picks on my little
sister has to answer to me!

323
00:20:01,723 --> 00:20:04,726
Oh, yeah? Guess what happens
to spineless little bookworms

324
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:08,230
who try to play hero?!

325
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,439
Take that, smart guy!

326
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:10,565
What are you gonna
do about it, huh? Huh?

327
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:13,026
--You're just a joke!
--Stop it, stop it!

328
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:16,571
Are you ready to quit?
Oh, are you still here?

329
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:21,159
No!

330
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:23,370
Huh?

331
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,247
I'm not done yet!

332
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:28,250
That... that kid must
be crazy or something!

333
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,709
Run!

334
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:36,842
That was the last time
I saw his eyes like that.

335
00:20:36,842 --> 00:20:39,094
Just one more time!

336
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:41,304
How long ago was it?

337
00:20:46,852 --> 00:20:48,770
I always thought I was
the only one who knew

338
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,022
about my brother's
fighting spirit.

339
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:58,363
But I guess the
people in this dojo

340
00:20:58,363 --> 00:21:00,574
have seen it too.

341
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:08,540
One more time!

342
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,500
Be sure to thank mom
for the boxed lunch

343
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,626
and tell her it was delicious,

344
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:14,212
but please don't come
here to visit me too often.

345
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:16,798
What? Why?

346
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:18,008
To tell you the truth,

347
00:21:18,008 --> 00:21:21,595
I really don't want my little
sister to see how pathetic I am

348
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:23,096
at martial arts.

349
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:25,807
You're not pathetic.

350
00:21:25,807 --> 00:21:28,810
I promise, just
like you say, then.

351
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:33,815
I won't come here to visit you
anymore if that's what you want.

352
00:21:33,815 --> 00:21:36,109
Well, I guess I'll
see you when I see you!

353
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:37,944
And you too, Big Boobs.

354
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:45,368
Be careful and
look out for cars!

355
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:46,745
That kid...

356
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:48,830
Are you really sure that
was the right thing to do?

357
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,459
Telling her not to
come around anymore?

358
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,002
Yeah...

359
00:21:54,002 --> 00:21:56,421
I think it's what's
best for her.

360
00:22:03,595 --> 00:22:05,222
Ahhh, apapa.

361
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:07,182
There! I win!

362
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:08,475
Do you wanna play again?

363
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:11,144
Apa! How did you do that?

364
00:22:11,144 --> 00:22:12,562
Hold on...

365
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:14,773
Did you forget the little
talk we had yesterday?

366
00:22:14,773 --> 00:22:16,775
What? I didn't come
here to visit you,

367
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:19,277
but I'm planning to come here
every day from now on to play

368
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:22,197
with Apachai and Shigure and
you can't stop me, so there!

369
00:22:22,197 --> 00:22:22,948
Honoka!

370
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:25,825
One more time, please.
Let's play another round, okay?

371
00:22:25,825 --> 00:22:26,743
Me too! Please!

372
00:22:26,743 --> 00:22:29,996
Yeah, okay! How 'bout I play
you both at the same time,

373
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:32,666
to make it fair?

374
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,584
Just shoot me.

375
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:36,670
Siblings... huh?

376
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:39,005
Hey! Shigure!

377
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:40,173
That's the wrong move!

378
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:41,257
You can't put that there!

379
00:22:41,257 --> 00:22:43,593
What are you talking about,
we just started!

380
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:48,390
Ryozanpaku is the funnest
place in the whole world!

381
00:24:19,814 --> 00:24:20,940
What am I gonna do?

382
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,941
This is a problem!

383
00:24:21,941 --> 00:24:23,860
Hey, hey, what's the matter?

384
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,987
My teachers are coming
for a home visit!

385
00:24:25,987 --> 00:24:28,740
But Grandpa is on a trip and
Akisame is gone too!

386
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,576
If they show up now, it could
turn into a real mess!

387
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:32,786
This is awful!

388
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:34,788
Re-lax! Don't worry about it!

389
00:24:34,788 --> 00:24:36,873
We'll take care
of it, no problem!

390
00:24:36,873 --> 00:24:37,582
Miu...

391
00:24:37,582 --> 00:24:39,793
you have nothing to
worry about, so calm down.

392
00:24:39,793 --> 00:24:42,837
Gosh, thanks, you guys,
you're the greatest!

393
00:24:42,837 --> 00:24:44,089
Wait a minute!

394
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:46,341
What are you doing with
that sword, Shigure?!

395
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:48,468
Put that awaaaaaay!
