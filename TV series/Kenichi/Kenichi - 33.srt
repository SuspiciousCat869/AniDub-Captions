[Music]

2
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:53,914
It's you...

3
00:01:57,793 --> 00:01:58,960
Where is she, Hermit...?!

4
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,337
Tell me now!

5
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,007
Enough...! Hermit, you bastard,

6
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:06,426
you'd better hand over
Honoka do you understand.

7
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,262
I swear if you so much as
touch one hair on her head...

8
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,889
You're gonna be a dead man.

9
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,788
Well... looks like they're
gettin' ready to rumble...

10
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,623
I'm lookin' to win back
my Pachinko losses

11
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,084
so what do you say we
bet on the winner?

12
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:40,419
My gambling days are over.

13
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,383
C'mon you know you wanna.

14
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:48,260
You hate me, don't you?

15
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,303
Good... That's how
it should be...

16
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,180
Hate your opponent
with all your might.

17
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:55,016
"Your hate...

18
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:57,227
will make you... stronger."

19
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:02,441
That was what Master Sougetsu
always said to me, anyway.

20
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,070
Sougetsu...

21
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,363
Martial arts is
the art of death,

22
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:11,032
so you should fight
with no holds barred...

23
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:12,242
Therefore...

24
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:24,838
Hey! Wait up, Takeda!

25
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:30,135
Ya gotta hurry up, Ukita-
we gotta keep goin'-

26
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,304
we already lost him...!

27
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:34,306
Do ya remember what street
that old church is on?

28
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,182
What...?!

29
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,309
I wasn't really
payin' attention.

30
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:42,522
Damn it! What do you mean you
weren't payin' attention?!

31
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,733
I told ya those directions
were important, didn't I?!

32
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:45,775
I'm sorry, Takeda.

33
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,277
But someone's
gotta know, right?

34
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,281
It's gonna be the third
street up ahead...

35
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,658
Take a left turn and you should
be able to see it from there.

36
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,703
Not you.

37
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,831
Man, these guys
are helpless...

38
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:02,459
I knew you dumb jocks wouldn't
be able to do it without me...

39
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,668
Shinpaku Alliance...

40
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:04,920
let's find 'em!

41
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,717
I hate that guy.

42
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,011
So Niijima told me that
Honoka's been kidnapped

43
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:15,430
by one of the Eight Deadly
Fists, is that true?

44
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,724
Yeah... the fourth
fist, Loki, has her-

45
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,519
he's the only guy despicable
enough to kidnap a little girl.

46
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,441
Despicable is
such a harsh word

47
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:28,276
I prefer to think of
myself as ruthless-

48
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:30,570
a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

49
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,364
Loki!

50
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:33,532
Sorry...

51
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:36,076
But this is as far as you
kids are gonna get today.

52
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:47,087
No... way!

53
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,880
I never go anywhere
without backup-

54
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,215
looks like you're
outnumbered.

55
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,265
What the hell-
he has clones?!

56
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,935
Nuh-uh... They can't be clones.

57
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,645
Take a look at the
big guy on the left.

58
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,983
Yeah... he's kinda round.

59
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:11,236
They're not my clones but
they're just as strong.

60
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:21,329
Hope you're ready
for our stun rods!

61
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:30,630
Wow... Who knew he
had those moves?

62
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,383
What the hell?

63
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:37,137
He's running away!

64
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,263
Here they come!

65
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,867
What's with this chick?!

66
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:38,448
Don't worry, Honoka.

67
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:39,866
Everything's
gonna be alright.

68
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,326
We're coming to save you!

69
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:07,185
Whoa ...

70
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:09,562
Looks like Kenichi might
win this thing after all.

71
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,940
See? If we were betting
I'd be up right now.

72
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,693
I've had a change of
heart- count me in.

73
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:16,027
Alright...

74
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:18,530
but you know we can't both put
money on Kenichi... right?

75
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,864
I know...

76
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:22,117
I'm betting it all
on the caped kid.

77
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:23,702
Winner gets the
other's dessert.

78
00:07:23,702 --> 00:07:24,869
Deal?

79
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,957
Now tell me where my
sister is, Hermit!

80
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:30,542
This fight'll be
tough for Kenichi.

81
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,502
He still has one
major weakness.

82
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:36,339
Right?

83
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,550
The kid's too naive.

84
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,968
You figured it out.

85
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,680
Ok, deal.

86
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,473
I'll take you
up on your bet.

87
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,308
Well...?! Where is she?!

88
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:48,518
Really think a joint lock's

89
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,228
gonna restrain a
fighter like me...?

90
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:51,771
Lemme guess,
you think my attacks

91
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,314
are only good
long range huh.

92
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,197
Not only did Master
Sougetsu teach me

93
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,741
the importance of
long range attacks

94
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:04,033
he taught me eight
different punches

95
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:05,410
to be used at close range.

96
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:16,963
I let you get close enough
to joint lock me on purpose-

97
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,214
that was my plan...

98
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:19,924
You've never seen my
close range attack

99
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:21,384
so you doubted my ability.

100
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:25,889
Not convinced?

101
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,752
He drew back his
attacking arm.

102
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:56,961
Was that some kinda feint?

103
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:58,213
Time's up.

104
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:00,340
I can see through
your defense.

105
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,967
I'm afraid your attacks aren't
strong enough to get past me.

106
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,677
That makes six down...

107
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:21,512
Which means there's
only one more to go.

108
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,560
If this guy's
the last one...

109
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,603
is he the real deal?

110
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,313
Certainly looks that way.

111
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:33,315
Why don't you guys
just leave him to me?

112
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:34,692
Gimme a break would ya...?

113
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:36,694
You think you can fight
one of the Eight Fists

114
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:38,863
just cause you were one of
Key-sar-uh's bodyguards?

115
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:40,406
That was a long time ago

116
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:43,117
and I've been training
hard everyday since then...

117
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:44,952
You have no idea
how strong I am.

118
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:48,247
All the blood, sweat and
tears I shed through training

119
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:49,748
have made me
infinitely stronger

120
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:51,625
than any of you
Eight Deadly Fists.

121
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,461
Yes...! And I'm the genius who's
in charge of this powerhouse-

122
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,839
he doesn't do a thing
till I say the word...

123
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,632
Go...! Vice-commander!

124
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:01,552
Man, I hate you.

125
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,848
Come on...! Now...! Let's go!

126
00:10:12,188 --> 00:10:13,772
Ultimate uppercut!

127
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:27,578
Is it just me or was
that way too easy?

128
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,794
Damn... That's
not the right guy.

129
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:37,046
We have to hurry...!

130
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:38,297
I'm gonna go on ahead!

131
00:10:45,638 --> 00:10:48,057
The real Loki
is right here.

132
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:55,356
I knew it! What the
hell were we thinking?

133
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:56,398
They're all fakes!

134
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:57,816
I can't believe
they got us again.

135
00:10:57,816 --> 00:10:59,526
They're trying
to distract us!

136
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,154
Hey wait a minute- didn't
anyone ever teach you brats

137
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:04,073
not to judge a book
by it's cover?!

138
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:08,869
Oh well... Guess I can't really
blame them- they're right.

139
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,761
You can't even
handle a feint...

140
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:27,179
High level fighters
can always tell

141
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:28,639
when their opponent's faking.

142
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,349
How can you be so naïve?!

143
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:33,143
I'm wasting my time
-you're not on my level!

144
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:35,771
You... You say you stand
for justice and truth

145
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:37,898
but don't you see that's
not gonna get you anywhere

146
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,274
as a fighter?!

147
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:41,318
A martial arts master
has to have the ability

148
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:42,569
to trick his opponent

149
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,405
and use their
powers against them.

150
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:50,160
Someone like you would never
be able to pull that off.

151
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:23,777
You see...

152
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,447
I lived in an orphanage
until I was six years old.

153
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,993
We lived there until the
day he came to adopt us.

154
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,878
He was a cold man
but I didn't care.

155
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:44,006
He was wealthy so I knew he'd be
able to afford a good doctor

156
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:45,507
for my sick little sister.

157
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:51,305
I tried to be
the perfect son-

158
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:52,848
I was almost robotic.

159
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:03,984
I never cried.

160
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,153
I would never
whine or get angry.

161
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,406
I did everything my father
asked of me without question.

162
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:14,912
Even so, I never
once saw him smile.

163
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:16,455
Now listen Natsu,

164
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:20,834
one day you will inherit the
entire Tanimoto Corporation.

165
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,753
I didn't adopt you
to "play house".

166
00:13:22,753 --> 00:13:24,421
I'm protecting
my business.

167
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:25,464
Understand?

168
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:34,515
But... one day
something happened

169
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,308
that changed all of
our lives dramatically.

170
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:41,313
He fell in love.

171
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,037
My father fell in love
with and married a doctor

172
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,081
who worked at one of
the clinics he owned.

173
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,133
The next three
years flew by-

174
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,676
everything was perfect...

175
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:14,972
You love Cosmos flowers,
don't you Kaede?

176
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,014
Yeah, I do!

177
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,766
They're so pretty.

178
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:19,017
Natsu.

179
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:24,356
I'm sorry.
I was wrong...

180
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:26,150
You kids are a blessing.

181
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:29,153
And that's when
he did it...

182
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:30,654
He finally smiled.

183
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:35,868
But our happiness
would be short-lived.

184
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:37,452
It was all based on lies.

185
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:42,249
Not too long
after that day

186
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,418
our father mysteriously
passed away.

187
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:50,966
Brother...

188
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:52,342
Brother...

189
00:14:56,847 --> 00:15:00,309
Then my sister became
gravely ill and died.

190
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:03,228
That's when I realized that the
doctor my father had married

191
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:04,938
hadn't done anything
to help cure her.

192
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,774
Kaede...! Kaede!

193
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,486
Kaede...! Kaede!

194
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,364
All she wanted was
my father's money-

195
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:16,283
she only pretended to care.

196
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,284
Everything was a lie.

197
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,827
I didn't poison your father.

198
00:15:18,827 --> 00:15:20,120
I swear!

199
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,872
I'm your mother!

200
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:23,290
Not-sue!

201
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,127
That how I lost my
father and my sister...

202
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:33,592
In a web of deceit...

203
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:35,135
She was quite an actress.

204
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:46,313
It's so wrong
that it's funny...

205
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,397
Don't you think...?

206
00:15:47,397 --> 00:15:48,941
It's okay, you can laugh...

207
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:02,913
If I saw her today
I would thank her...

208
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:04,206
Because now I've realized

209
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:05,958
what an important
lesson she's taught me.

210
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:09,336
Lies make you stronger.

211
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:16,635
Our little chat is over...

212
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:19,179
You probably don't even have
the strength to stand right now.

213
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:23,809
Die!

214
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:24,935
What the...

215
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:29,398
I've heard enough...

216
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:32,276
I won't let you trick
me into pitying you

217
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:34,695
so you can pummel
me into the ground.

218
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,030
I'm ready to fight!

219
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,198
Impossible!

220
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:45,622
You may have amazing masters

221
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:48,208
but you're naivety is
gonna get the best of you.

222
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:54,131
Wow... Didya hear that...?

223
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:56,758
caped kid just called him out.

224
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:57,759
Now the question is

225
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,137
can Kenichi defend
himself against his enemy

226
00:17:00,137 --> 00:17:02,431
because a feint may be the
only way he'll be able to.

227
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:12,816
What now...?!

228
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:14,192
You're not gonna
be able to get up

229
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:16,236
so you might as well
surrender, Shirahama.

230
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:29,583
This is the place, right?!

231
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,627
Be careful... He's dangerous.

232
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:32,753
I know...

233
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:35,756
But... we gotta do what
we can to help Kenichi.

234
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:38,759
We made it...!

235
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,927
Hey... Niijima...

236
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,137
try to keep up, man.

237
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,311
Hey, I'm not so sure
about this you guys...

238
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,104
I'm not very good with
shrines or churches...

239
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,564
they make me
uncomfortable...

240
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:54,524
know what I mean?

241
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:56,318
I knew you were a demon.

242
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:03,158
Sorry about this, Uki.

243
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:05,243
It's no big deal- just
don't call me that.

244
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:07,037
You don't like
you're new nickname?

245
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:08,830
I'm too old for that, man.

246
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,500
Well, I'm your boss and
I wanna call you Uki.

247
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,085
One more time and
I'll kill you.

248
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,846
It seems that the
winner has been decided.

249
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:30,973
Power and deceit...

250
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:33,475
Those two things are all you
need to get by in this world.

251
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:38,939
Your're...

252
00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:40,149
You're wrong.

253
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:45,988
If you live a life
full of deceit-

254
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:48,407
constantly struggling
for power...

255
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:50,659
you'll end up with
nothing but sadness.

256
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:55,706
My karate master
once told me...

257
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:02,504
talking with your fists makes
your words hit... harder.

258
00:19:02,504 --> 00:19:05,841
No matter how much someone
tries to put on a façade...

259
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:07,384
you'll have them
completely figured out

260
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:09,178
once you fight them.

261
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:11,597
I don't remember ever
saying that to him.

262
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:16,935
Well, you were probably
drunk at the time.

263
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:21,899
I know you aren't the
one who kidnapped Honoka.

264
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,025
After what you've
been through

265
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:25,819
you'd never kidnap
someone's sister...

266
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:28,155
I know that you
didn't do it...

267
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:29,490
but you know that
as her brother

268
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,033
it's my duty to protect her.

269
00:19:35,245 --> 00:19:36,663
But that's impossible...!

270
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:38,415
He shouldn't even be
able to stand right now-

271
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:40,501
not after I've attacked
him repeatedly!

272
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:42,377
What you truly need to
get by in this world

273
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:44,046
is not power or deceit...

274
00:19:44,046 --> 00:19:46,340
You need a heart that is
capable of trusting others

275
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,133
and deep down
you know that.

276
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:52,387
Trust your masters.

277
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:55,349
Trust your friends and most
importantly trust yourself...

278
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:58,101
because that is true power.

279
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:00,229
'A heart that is capable
of trusting others'...

280
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:02,481
I don't think you get it...

281
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:04,233
Shirahama...

282
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:06,735
That way of thinking is
what killed my sister!

283
00:20:06,735 --> 00:20:08,445
Well, My sister is
counting on me to save her

284
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:10,280
and I'm not gonna
let her down!

285
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,448
You're so naïve-

286
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,534
do you really think you'll
be able to protect her?

287
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:27,548
Double palm!

288
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:37,182
That's quite impressive...

289
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:38,642
The Double Palm...

290
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:40,269
I never thought
you would know

291
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:42,062
one of the eight... punches...

292
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:44,022
But if you don't attack
with all of your might

293
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:45,607
it's very easy
to block it.

294
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:22,519
That punch was so powerful.

295
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,021
It's so much stronger
than anything

296
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:26,023
I've ever been capable of.

297
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:27,399
That's right...!

298
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,151
You don't have to be
deceitful to gain power

299
00:21:29,151 --> 00:21:30,485
all you need is determination

300
00:21:30,485 --> 00:21:32,279
and some good old
fashioned training!

301
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:35,699
Hey! why are you smilin'...?

302
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:37,159
You bet it all
on the caped kid

303
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:39,077
which means I get
your dessert tonight.

304
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:44,708
I don't understand- how do you
know all these martial arts?

305
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,293
At first I thought
it was just karate

306
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:49,671
but you also use Jujitsu,
Kenpo, even Moy Thai...!

307
00:21:49,671 --> 00:21:52,674
Just who in the hell do
you think you are, huh?

308
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:55,010
I'm Kenichi Shirahama...

309
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,970
and I'm history's
strongest disciple.

310
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:03,977
I don't know what
you're talking about

311
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:05,604
but it's about
time we end this...

312
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:06,605
Let's go!

313
00:22:12,152 --> 00:22:13,737
That's enough you two.

314
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:17,616
That was awesome...

315
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:20,035
Definitely a great fight.

316
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:21,536
But you've been rained out

317
00:22:21,536 --> 00:22:23,497
so I think you
should call it a day.

318
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:42,182
The final victory
always goes to Ragnarok.

319
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:43,517
Don't forget that, kid.

320
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:46,937
Big brother!

321
00:22:46,937 --> 00:22:48,438
Honoka!

322
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:54,444
[Music]

323
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,947
Don't make a move, Shirahama.

324
00:24:20,947 --> 00:24:23,784
You wouldn't want me to hurt
your little sis now would ya?

325
00:24:23,784 --> 00:24:26,078
Please help me!
This guy is creeping me out!

326
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:27,079
Let her go!

327
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,372
I'm warning you!

328
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:29,748
Don't worry about
me, big brother.

329
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:30,832
I want you to go out there

330
00:24:30,832 --> 00:24:32,751
and kick all the
bad guy's butts!

331
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:34,753
Watch what you
say little girl.

332
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:37,547
You're not my sister so I
don't care if you end up dead.

333
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:41,885
Loki...! You'd better
not lay a hand on her!

334
00:24:41,885 --> 00:24:43,678
I'm going to
save you, Honoka!

335
00:24:43,678 --> 00:24:45,097
I swear it!
