[Music]

2
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:46,743
Nice. I think I might actually
like this new song...

3
00:01:46,743 --> 00:01:48,161
Let's help our
friend Sieg come up

4
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:49,746
with a good
ending, huh boys?

5
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:52,416
Found them!
They're over here!

6
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,333
It's you!

7
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,751
Hello, Loki...

8
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,670
I'm here to take
Niijima back home.

9
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,046
That's right!

10
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:00,424
What's going on...?!

11
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:01,758
All the shouting out
here made me lose

12
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:04,052
my beautiful melody!

13
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:06,013
And somebody's
going to pay.

14
00:02:06,013 --> 00:02:07,931
Hey...! I won't
ask you again.

15
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:09,516
Where's Niijima? !

16
00:02:09,516 --> 00:02:11,852
Unfortunately I seem
to have misplaced him,

17
00:02:11,852 --> 00:02:14,271
but please, feel free
to try again later...

18
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:16,565
When I'm in a
better mood, maybe.

19
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:18,025
Think you're in
a bad mood now...

20
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:19,526
you just wait!

21
00:02:19,526 --> 00:02:21,820
I won't allow you
to fight him yet...

22
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,157
Not until you return my
melody with your blood!

23
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:27,826
I am the Fifth
Fist, Siegfried...

24
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:29,995
And you will
be battling me.

25
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:32,581
It's... over...? Wow...

26
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:33,749
This guy's a lot
weaker than I thought

27
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:35,083
he was gonna be...

28
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,335
Umm, hey...

29
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:38,003
Can you wake up and tell
me where the ship is,

30
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:39,171
please, sir?

31
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:41,882
And the prelude comes
gracefully to an end...

32
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:43,508
-Feroce!
-Oh, crap!

33
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:46,178
Accelerando!

34
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:55,937
That's weird.
His energy is back!

35
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:57,022
You were playing dead!

36
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:58,565
I don't play at death...

37
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:00,859
I rise from the earth!

38
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:03,695
No... Pretty sure you
were playing dead...

39
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,864
Whatever... I won't
go easy on you now.

40
00:03:05,864 --> 00:03:07,115
Yes, that's right...

41
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:08,950
Give me your
anger, your fury,

42
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,619
and I will turn it
to luminous sound...

43
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:14,247
Yamazuki!

44
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,459
I didn't pull that punch.

45
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,002
Now give me my answer...

46
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:20,212
I wanna know which
ship Niijima--

47
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:24,508
Fortissimo!

48
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:26,093
Animato!

49
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:31,223
Damn... No matter what I try my
attacks won't phasing him.

50
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:33,392
Your attacks are
slow and obvious,

51
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:35,185
with no emotion behind them...

52
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:36,395
I had hoped that
you would gift me

53
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:37,979
with your full attention.

54
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:44,152
Much like a raging
thunderstorm...

55
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:47,489
I will attack with
uncanzone tempestoso...!

56
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,783
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-LA -La.

57
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:54,621
Be afraid...! I want to feel
your fear and anger...!

58
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:58,166
Your emotions will become
the body of my symphony!

59
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,376
It seems like my
attacks aren't having

60
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:01,920
any kind of affect on
this guy at all...

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,880
So that's the power of
Ragnarok's fifth fist,

62
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,465
Siegfried ...

63
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:07,551
Is it possible
that he's immortal?

64
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:19,187
Let me outta here...!

65
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:23,525
Somebody please
let me out...

66
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:25,986
This isn't funny
anymore...!

67
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:27,863
If you know what's good for ya
you'll let me out of here

68
00:04:27,863 --> 00:04:30,240
before I start to get
REALLY angry!

69
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,708
Got him.

70
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:42,878
Fortissimo!

71
00:04:47,549 --> 00:04:49,176
That's crazy!

72
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:50,635
My hit made
contact with him...

73
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:52,387
how'd he hit me
back so quickly?

74
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:54,306
I'll have to write
that one down.

75
00:04:56,183 --> 00:04:58,101
I gotta figure out
how he's doing that.

76
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:10,822
So, whatcha think about my
custom stun rod, Blondie?

77
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,786
Well I think it's
pretty cool-

78
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:16,995
I wouldn't try to
get up or anything

79
00:05:16,995 --> 00:05:18,413
cause it takes even
the biggest guys

80
00:05:18,413 --> 00:05:20,832
at least an hour to
get over my attacks.

81
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:22,000
This rod comes in handy

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,835
when chicks try to get
too close to Loki...

83
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:25,170
Forget it ladies!

84
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:33,094
Whoa how'd you do that?
! It's impossible...!

85
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:34,805
No way...

86
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:36,515
You shouldn't
be able to move!

87
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:45,482
It'll take a lot more
than that to keep me down.

88
00:05:45,482 --> 00:05:47,025
That brat got
me pretty good-

89
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:48,735
I shouldn't have
been so careless...

90
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:50,695
My outfit is
totally ruined.

91
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:53,698
If Grandpa finds out about
this he'll kill me...

92
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:56,034
I'll just have to
keep it a secret.

93
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:57,827
Now I've gotta find that
four-eyed turtle lookin' guy-

94
00:05:57,827 --> 00:06:00,330
he's the only one who
knows where Niijima is.

95
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,831
And I've gotta
make dinner...

96
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:03,416
before anyone at home
notices I'm gone.

97
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:10,674
What the hell's going on? !

98
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:25,689
Hey, where's the
four-eyed turtle man...?

99
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:26,856
I mean, uh...

100
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:29,317
I know Loki was in there
with you- where'd he go? !

101
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:32,028
What...? Dumbass...!
Dontcha get it girl?

102
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:33,613
We were just the bait...

103
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:36,157
I'm sure Loki's safe and sound
back at headquarters by now.

104
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:38,994
You wanna tell
me which ship

105
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:41,663
I can find my
friend Niijima on?

106
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,290
I have no idea.

107
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,625
Tell meeeeeee...

108
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,460
I'm serious! I don't
know anything about your friend!

109
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,461
I'm tellin' ya the truth!

110
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:50,255
I swear!

111
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:52,382
You dummy! You're good
for nothing! I hate you!

112
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:56,595
Looks like the four eyed
turtle man is the only one

113
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:58,013
who knows where
Niijima is.

114
00:07:01,683 --> 00:07:03,393
Now that Kenichi's
up against Sig

115
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:06,146
the Shinpaku Alliance
doesn't stand a chance.

116
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,778
Why aren't my attacks
doing anything?

117
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:14,696
I'll try again.

118
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:16,781
You bastard!

119
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:18,116
I feel your passion!

120
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,453
What the hell?

121
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:25,874
Damn it. He did it again...

122
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:27,792
I had him but he
turned it on me.

123
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,586
Let loose your anger.

124
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:31,671
La-la-

125
00:07:35,258 --> 00:07:36,885
How unfortunate...

126
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:38,178
It would appear
that Niijima's ship

127
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:40,055
is about to leave port.

128
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:41,348
It's leaving?

129
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:42,849
I gotta hurry
and go save him!

130
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:44,184
Well, well...

131
00:07:44,184 --> 00:07:45,644
You've got quite
a dilemma-

132
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:46,770
you'd better defeat me soon

133
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,022
or it'll be too late
for your friend.

134
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:51,900
Now get in touch with your
anger, your frustration.

135
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,735
And attack me
with all of it!

136
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:56,363
Don't get angry.

137
00:07:57,989 --> 00:07:59,366
Listen up...

138
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:00,784
the person who's feelin'
the most pressure

139
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:03,036
is always the one that's
gonna lose the fight.

140
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:07,999
If you start gettin'
too wound up

141
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:09,918
then your opponent can see
every move you've got.

142
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:13,380
I know what you're
saying but I don't think

143
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,174
I could help but get wound up
in the excitement of a fight.

144
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:18,426
Well then if ya
can't calm down...

145
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:20,762
try changin' your pace.

146
00:08:20,762 --> 00:08:21,596
In the middle of a fight?

147
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:24,099
One sake please!

148
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:25,558
Hellooo...?

149
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:30,689
So... as I was sayin'...

150
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,399
you just gotta
stay calm...

151
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,275
you can always throw in
some training exercises

152
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,820
or whatever'll help
keep you grounded.

153
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:40,156
You wanna change the
flow of the fight

154
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:41,908
so you can catch your
opponent off guard.

155
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:45,120
Then you can swallow him
whole, in one giant gulp!

156
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,622
Guess it's worth a shot.

157
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:53,503
Couldn't have asked for
better weather today!

158
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,966
One, two, three, four...

159
00:08:57,966 --> 00:09:00,343
What should I have for
breakfast this morning?

160
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:01,761
Morning?

161
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:03,888
Alright, I'm
spoilin' for a fight!

162
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:06,057
I hope you're ready
for me, Siegfried!

163
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:11,855
Yes! So, what kind of attack
should I start out with?

164
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:14,107
Got him.

165
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:19,154
Hold on- I totally forgot
to finish warming up first!

166
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:32,125
Hey...! I didn't even
touch you that time

167
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,543
and you went flying...!

168
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:35,378
I knew there was
something up with you!

169
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:40,800
As a musician I can pick
up my opponent's rhythm.

170
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,719
I can see through their
attacks and dodge them-

171
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,429
pretending to be hit.

172
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:46,306
I combine the propulsion
of their attack

173
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:48,975
with my own to make
it more powerful.

174
00:09:48,975 --> 00:09:52,312
I call it the
Round Attack!

175
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:54,230
The Round Attack...?

176
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,899
Don't you think that name's
a little unoriginal

177
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,818
and... weird?

178
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:01,154
Even though you know the
secret of the Round Attack

179
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:04,282
I'm afraid your moves will
still be useless against me.

180
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:06,201
So go ahead, come at me...

181
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:07,827
just remember...

182
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:10,121
the harder you hit me
the harder you'll fall.

183
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:13,124
I'm screwed.

184
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:15,668
He's gonna use my
power against me!

185
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:17,670
What'll I do now?

186
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:29,858
Dontcha think those two
shoulda been home by now...?

187
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:30,984
It's gettin'
kinda late...

188
00:10:30,984 --> 00:10:34,238
What should we
do, Akisame?

189
00:10:34,238 --> 00:10:36,198
You want Apachai to
go find the baddies

190
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:39,159
and kill them so that we
can have dinner now?

191
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,120
How bout no... thank you.

192
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,454
Patience...

193
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:44,665
We'll wait for
our disciple...

194
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:48,168
That's our responsibility
as masters.

195
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:50,546
What do you all think
of Kenichi's progress?

196
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:52,631
He's been training with
us for a while now

197
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:54,675
but he still seems
pretty slow.

198
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,468
Well, it's not as though
he had any real talent

199
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:58,262
to begin with.

200
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:00,931
There's nothing more we
can do at this point.

201
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:03,267
We've taught him
everything we can.

202
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:07,604
Now it's all up
to Kenichi...

203
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:12,150
He will progress if
he can learn to use

204
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,111
what we've taught
him in battle.

205
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:20,325
If I attack recklessly he'll
just counter me again...

206
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:23,537
He'll use the power of
my moves against me.

207
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:26,123
I've gotta try to keep him from
seeing through my attacks.

208
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,169
Here goes nothin'...

209
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:33,213
At attention!

210
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:38,468
What are you up to now?

211
00:11:38,468 --> 00:11:40,596
Kenichi Shirahama,
permission to step forward...

212
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:41,805
Granted...!

213
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:45,893
One, two... One, two...

214
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:47,394
What's he doing?

215
00:11:47,394 --> 00:11:48,896
One, two...

216
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:51,523
Now all men at attention!

217
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:52,816
Okay men, face forward...!

218
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:55,235
Prepare to attack!

219
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:58,530
First warm-up exercises
and now a military drill...?

220
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,990
I don't know what
you've got planned

221
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,660
but I can assure you that your
silly tricks won't work on me.

222
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,080
I know that he's gonna
dodge the brunt of my attack...

223
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,041
so if I'm gonna take
this guy down...

224
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,169
I'm gonna have to
try that punch!

225
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:32,314
I'm gonna have to use my
most powerful punch

226
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:34,232
even though I can't
always pull it off.

227
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,903
Good work.

228
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:40,030
Give me ten more reps and
I'll let you move on

229
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,366
to kenpo training
with Kensei.

230
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:44,034
I've got a
question, Akisame...

231
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:46,036
It's been bugging
me for a while .

232
00:12:46,036 --> 00:12:47,955
What's on your mind?

233
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:50,874
I'm learning karate, Muay
Thai, kenpo, jujitsu...

234
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:53,293
That's a lot of different
martial arts at once-

235
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:56,046
wouldn't it be easier if I
concentrated on one at a time?

236
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:59,216
-You can handle it.
-Wha...?!

237
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:01,593
Is that all you're
gonna say...?!

238
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:03,387
If I could train in each
martial art separately

239
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:05,264
it'd be a lot easier.

240
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:06,848
When you came to
Ryozanpaku you said

241
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:09,142
you wanted to become a
master of martial arts...

242
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:11,561
You know that's not
going to be easy.

243
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:13,021
You must fall off the
cliff of training

244
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:14,690
into the world of masters.

245
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,149
GO!

246
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:26,952
No...! I don't wanna!

247
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,332
Fall...? But that's
so negative...

248
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:34,293
shouldn't I be climbing?

249
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,253
No because when you're
climbing you have the option

250
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:38,547
of giving up when
things get difficult...

251
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:42,050
You, on the other hand,
don't have that option.

252
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,927
We take this
very seriously...

253
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:46,555
we refuse to let
you just give up.

254
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:48,557
We'll do whatever it
takes to mold you

255
00:13:48,557 --> 00:13:51,226
into a martial arts master-
even if it kills you!

256
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:54,896
Now listen
closely Kenichi.

257
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:56,440
We Chinese like
to mix things up.

258
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,108
That's how we're able
to come up with

259
00:13:58,108 --> 00:14:00,652
new fighting styles
and techniques.

260
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:03,155
We then add those new
techniques to our repertoire-

261
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:05,240
to keep our enemies
on their toes.

262
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,908
That reminds me of
the wounded master

263
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:08,952
who set out to find
a healing salve

264
00:14:08,952 --> 00:14:10,620
using seven different leaves

265
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,914
he would press
onto the injury.

266
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:15,083
Individually the leaves
had different benefits

267
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,335
but nothing quite
healed him completely.

268
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,379
Not until he combined
the seven leaves

269
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:22,340
and he created a healing
salve unlike any other!

270
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,010
At least that's
how the story goes.

271
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:27,846
I see...

272
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:29,389
We're not finished
training yet!

273
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:31,933
Hold on...! If I combine
all of the training

274
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,936
that I've received so
far what will I create?

275
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:37,481
A more powerful
punch? I wonder...

276
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:39,066
I'm not finished!

277
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:45,238
I'm gonna try it.

278
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:46,656
What's the matter?

279
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:48,366
Go ahead. Do your worst.

280
00:14:51,161 --> 00:14:52,537
Let me guess,
you don't think

281
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:55,290
I can dodge your
punch at close range.

282
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,085
That may be true of another
fighter but not with me...

283
00:14:58,085 --> 00:14:59,920
I'll use con Bravura.

284
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,631
In other words, I'll use my
brilliant technique and

285
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:05,801
pure, natural skill to evade
your gauche attacks with grace.

286
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:08,804
Kenichi!

287
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:11,890
I have to try it...!

288
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,517
Here we go!

289
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:18,480
Pay attention to what
happens with your other arm!

290
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,357
When you use a karate
punch it should feel like

291
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:22,776
your arms are connected
to a pulley behind you.

292
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:25,070
You got it, kid?

293
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,030
In kenpo you wanna
draw out your strength

294
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,242
but you also want your arms to
be more extended and relaxed.

295
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:32,077
Don't hold yourself
back- let your arms fly!

296
00:15:34,746 --> 00:15:36,748
A Judo chop uses
the same physics

297
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:38,959
as a downward sword slash.

298
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,418
You're basically
challenging the balance

299
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:42,504
of a four sided object.

300
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:44,756
You use your body weight
to chop your opponent.

301
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:47,342
Kenichi...!

302
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:49,261
Muay Thai is not
only a fun sport...

303
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:50,846
There are many
soldiers back home

304
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:52,180
who have used it
on the battlefield

305
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,849
fighting for their lives...

306
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,851
Apachai's master told
him you must do punch

307
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:57,394
with all of your strength...!

308
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,438
Make your punch go
through your opponent!

309
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:04,651
I couldn't dodge it...!

310
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:06,194
He keeps punching!

311
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:08,780
How many beats are
in this one punch? !

312
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,532
I can't count the beats.

313
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:12,159
I can't find the rhythm...

314
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,326
No...

315
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,454
There is no rhythm!

316
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:20,792
That punch...

317
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,711
So you think he'll make
headway if he can use

318
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:25,005
what we've taught him
in battle, huh?

319
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,298
I guess that
does make sense-

320
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:28,925
he did have a great
punch that one time...

321
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:34,639
Look what I did...!
I broke the post...!

322
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,349
Did you see that master? !

323
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:38,393
That post is old and I
wouldn't be surprised

324
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:40,645
if it had a bad
case of dry rot.

325
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:42,439
Is that true, Sakaki?

326
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:44,107
It's time for his
kenpo training!

327
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:45,901
The poor kid thought
he was in trouble

328
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:48,069
for breaking
the equipment.

329
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:49,779
It sounds like he was
excited because

330
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:52,866
he was able to break
the post, Sakaki.

331
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:54,159
I didn't think
about it that way-

332
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,952
I shoulda
congratulated him.

333
00:16:57,329 --> 00:16:59,706
Don't worry- it's not
like Kenichi's dead-

334
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:01,249
I'm sure he'll make it
through this fight-

335
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:03,752
so you can congratulate
him when he gets back.

336
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:05,128
That's enough...

337
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:07,047
Let's just wait a
little while longer...

338
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:08,590
How unprofessional.

339
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,301
Oh no Akisame- That last
bit of kanji is wrong!

340
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:13,303
What? ! It's wrong? !
What do you mean? !

341
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:15,305
-Where? !
-Just kidding.

342
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:16,932
You got me, Kensei.

343
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:27,484
Impossible.

344
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,488
No way!

345
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:34,366
That was quite an
excellent punch.

346
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:36,326
The way that you used
your center of gravity

347
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:38,537
to strengthen it like that...

348
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:39,704
I lost.

349
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,213
I can hear the music...

350
00:17:49,756 --> 00:17:51,049
A beautiful melody!

351
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:54,844
Kenichi, that punch
was too powerful!

352
00:17:54,844 --> 00:17:56,179
Why'd you do that? !

353
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:57,931
B-But you saw him, right?

354
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:01,851
That guy was totally
unphasaeble five seconds ago!

355
00:18:01,851 --> 00:18:04,145
Thank goodness he's still
alive but that was close...

356
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:05,939
You could have
killed him, you know.

357
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:07,649
Seriously?

358
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,150
Never mind that-
leave him to me-

359
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,360
you've gotta get out here

360
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,404
and find Niijima
before the ship leaves!

361
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:13,989
You forgot to ask this
guy which one he's on

362
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:15,365
before you knocked him out

363
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:17,993
so I guess you'll just
have to search them all.

364
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:20,161
I totally forgot...!
And that's the reason

365
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:21,580
I fought Siegfried
in the first place!

366
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,456
I'm sorry! I'll go
look for him now!

367
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:25,166
Let the crew know
about the situation

368
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,710
so they can delay
their departure!

369
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:29,379
Niijima...

370
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:31,923
even though I think you're
a jerk and a bad friend...

371
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:33,633
hang in there...

372
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:34,634
I'm coming!

373
00:18:38,471 --> 00:18:41,349
No... not a single ship...

374
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:44,185
Ha!

375
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:46,187
Nothing I can do now.

376
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:49,941
Goodbye Haruo Niijima!

377
00:18:57,866 --> 00:19:00,327
Well, there's no way to
stop it once it's left port...

378
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:02,620
It's not like I have
anything to worry about-

379
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,956
I mean, the ship has plenty
to eat, plenty to drink-

380
00:19:04,956 --> 00:19:06,916
I even found a
change of clothes!

381
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,877
Guess I got no choice
but to sit back

382
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:11,087
and enjoy the good life until
we make it back to shore again.

383
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,215
What's up, furry friend...?

384
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:16,593
Thanks for chewing through those
ropes and setting me free.

385
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:18,845
Go on, eat up!

386
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:21,806
Alrighty then...

387
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:24,059
Let's see what's
inside this box.

388
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,268
Ooh!

389
00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:26,644
I found something I like!

390
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:28,313
This is awesome!

391
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:30,857
What's the matter, Johnny?

392
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:32,400
Quiet...!

393
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,194
I can hear something weird
movin' around in there-

394
00:19:34,194 --> 00:19:36,237
come take a listen Andy.

395
00:19:36,237 --> 00:19:38,406
What...? Shut up...

396
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:40,116
Man, that's the dumbest
thing I've heard...

397
00:19:40,116 --> 00:19:41,368
There's nobody in there-

398
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:42,786
I think you're just
hearin' things.

399
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:44,996
Yeah...? Then why don't you
go in there and check it out?

400
00:19:44,996 --> 00:19:47,415
Okay... I'll do it...

401
00:19:47,415 --> 00:19:49,084
I can't believe you, man.

402
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:01,763
Holy crap!

403
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:06,476
Damn it! It's an alien!

404
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:08,728
I bet he's here to
kidnap the entire crew!

405
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:19,160
Loki...!

406
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,246
Terrible news!

407
00:20:21,246 --> 00:20:22,831
Impossible!

408
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:24,749
How could he have
defeated Siegfried?

409
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:26,584
And that's not all...

410
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:28,628
Big boobed girl
kicked my butt.

411
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:32,048
Damn...! I can't wait to
get my hands on that punk.

412
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:33,800
He ruined the
perfect plan.

413
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,053
Oh...? I'm sorry, Loki...

414
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:38,930
Things not going your way?

415
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,516
Did you underestimate
your enemy...?

416
00:20:41,516 --> 00:20:44,727
So who is this formidable
opponent of yours?

417
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:46,646
Kenichi Shirahama.

418
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,231
Huh? !

419
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:00,952
Kenichi Shirahama...?

420
00:21:00,952 --> 00:21:02,871
Kenichi...

421
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:04,789
Don't tell me
it's him...

422
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,717
Oh, Apachai is sweepening...

423
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:17,719
Apa?

424
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,679
Ah-pa-pa!

425
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,767
I don't see anything
about a kidnapping.

426
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,519
Damn it... See...?

427
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,604
If we had gone with
them in the first place

428
00:21:27,604 --> 00:21:28,730
this wouldn't
have happened!

429
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,023
Look at this...

430
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,941
It says an alien
hijacked a cargo ship

431
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:33,568
and terrorized it's crew...

432
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,653
It turned around
3 hours later...

433
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:38,531
I just love reading
about alien sightings!

434
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,408
I'm glad that you were able
to defeat your opponent

435
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:42,118
but it's unfortunate
that you were unable

436
00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:43,411
to save your friend.

437
00:21:43,411 --> 00:21:44,871
Hey...

438
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:45,997
I think we should
probably go ahead

439
00:21:45,997 --> 00:21:47,248
and contact the police.

440
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,002
Jonathan told Apachai he
seed someone that looks like

441
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:53,546
Niijima on the
horizon this morning!

442
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,381
What?

443
00:21:57,217 --> 00:21:59,010
Okay go ahead, Apachai...

444
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,054
ask your friend to show
us where Niijima is.

445
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:02,597
Okay Jonathan,
where is he?

446
00:22:07,101 --> 00:22:09,521
The place you saw him
isn't anywhere on that map? !

447
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:11,898
Aa-pa!

448
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,817
But then that means...

449
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:19,113
Oh no...

450
00:22:19,113 --> 00:22:21,074
I couldn't possibly
eat anymore...

451
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:23,034
thank you princess...

452
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:29,749
My head really hurts...!

453
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:32,418
I had a dream that I was
taking over a castle.

454
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,756
Wait...

455
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,383
Hold on...

456
00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:40,093
Where am I?

457
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:50,019
Kenichi!

458
00:22:50,019 --> 00:23:14,711
[Music]

459
00:24:18,316 --> 00:24:20,234
Wait a second, pretty boy!

460
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:21,694
What do you want?

461
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:23,571
I hurt my leg so you have
to take me to the hospital.

462
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:24,822
Like, now! Got it?

463
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:26,032
I don't even know you.

464
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:27,533
Why would I do that?

465
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:28,868
You're just gonna leave
a pretty girl like me

466
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,411
out here on the street? !

467
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:31,496
That's so mean!

468
00:24:31,496 --> 00:24:33,373
Don't you have a heart?!
I'm injured!

469
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:35,333
I could die out here!

470
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,377
Alright then, come on.

471
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:38,878
I knew you'd
change your mind.

472
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,838
Hey, wait a minute-
this isn't the hospital!

473
00:24:40,838 --> 00:24:41,923
Where are you taking me?!

474
00:24:41,923 --> 00:24:43,508
Put me down, ya big jerk!

475
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:45,885
Somebody help me!
