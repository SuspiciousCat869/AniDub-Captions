1
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:45,264
Hey, you! Come outta there!

2
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:56,526
What the heck?
There's only one of you?

3
00:01:56,526 --> 00:01:57,860
No.

4
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,570
There are eight of us.

5
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,155
You'll be fighting
our newest member,

6
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,824
the Eighth Fist, Valkyrie,

7
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:05,284
the Sixth Fist, Hermit,

8
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:07,912
and the Fourth Fist, Loki.

9
00:02:07,912 --> 00:02:10,456
I sincerely hope your
men can handle it.

10
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,606
Your level of stupidity
never ceases to amaze me!

11
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:38,317
If you walk down there,
Tsuji's gonna kill you!

12
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:40,319
I've gotta go try to
square things with him!

13
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,155
What are you, nuts?! You've
seen him when he gets angry!

14
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:45,324
You're no match for him!
He's gonna kick your butt!

15
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:47,868
Don't throw away the win you
earned with that sneak attack!

16
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,370
If you go down
there, you're dead!

17
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,581
I don't care what
you say! I'm going!

18
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:53,457
If I turn around
right now, all I'm doing

19
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:55,543
is running away from my
problems like a coward would!

20
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:59,797
Oh, I want it all right,
kid! Really, really bad!

21
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:05,094
What are you trying to do
with those lame punches?

22
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:06,345
Bring it on!

23
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,855
Tsuji, you have something far
greater than 100 henchmen.

24
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:19,692
It's a rare gift. Do you have
any idea what that is?

25
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:23,863
Friends you can trust! That's
right! Two of 'em, in fact!

26
00:03:23,863 --> 00:03:25,489
Hey, Kenichi.

27
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,074
What is it?

28
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,785
That friend of
yours, the boxer guy?

29
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:33,039
I heard that Ragnarok's giving
him a farewell beatdown soon.

30
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,248
But when?!

31
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:37,209
I don't know the exact
date, but Kisara will be there

32
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,587
along with a witness from
the Eight Deadly Fists.

33
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,881
One of the
Eight Deadly Fists? Who?

34
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:46,344
The Sixth Fist, the guy
who's also known as Hermit!

35
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:48,638
I'd watch out for him.
He's bad news.

36
00:03:48,638 --> 00:03:51,182
See ya 'round kid.

37
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:53,184
Did he say "Hermit?"

38
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:54,810
Yeah. Do you know him, Niijima?

39
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,228
Uh-Huh.

40
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:59,357
I saw him fight a whole gang;
it was pretty intense.

41
00:03:59,357 --> 00:04:01,108
Only three of the
Eight Fists fought,

42
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:05,488
but they took down 50
men in like 30 seconds!

43
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:07,406
Master Koetsuji!

44
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:09,575
I've decided! Starting
today, I want to begin

45
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:11,202
training for the
advanced techniques!

46
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,996
I don't know what happened,
but that look in your eyes

47
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:17,458
is completely different
from the one this morning.

48
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,293
So, shall we get started then?

49
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,378
Yes!

50
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,390
In any case, you
need to be careful!

51
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,600
Listen, a reliable source told
me that Ragnarok's planning

52
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,268
to punish you for
walking out on them,

53
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:39,230
and they're not gonna
go easy on you!

54
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,856
Yeah? So what?

55
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:43,317
Come on, man, you've
gotta take this seriously!

56
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:47,029
This isn't some joke
you can just laugh off!

57
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:51,325
It doesn't matter how careful I
am, there's no way to avoid it.

58
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:52,702
Kenichi, look!

59
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:54,370
What's that?

60
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,164
Niijima's been passing
these around the school!

61
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:02,837
Nice shot.

62
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,797
This is totally photoshopped!

63
00:05:04,797 --> 00:05:07,091
How many of these has he
managed to hand out so far?!

64
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:09,135
Unfortunately, they're
all over the place.

65
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:10,678
What does that idiot
think he's doing

66
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,179
spreading stupid
rumors like this?

67
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:16,517
Extra! Extra! Get ya newspapers!

68
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,935
You!

69
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,523
He ran away!

70
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,608
Come back here, you freak!

71
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:29,905
Man! How the hell does that
guy always get away?!

72
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:31,907
Woo! Nice footwork!

73
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:35,244
Anyway, try to keep a low
profile for a while, okay?

74
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:36,996
And here. Take this.

75
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:38,456
This is my cell phone number.

76
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:40,374
If they corner you
somewhere, give me a call

77
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,835
and I'll be right over!
Promise me, okay?

78
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:45,880
Aw, it's like we're
dating or something!

79
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,923
Am I blushing?

80
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:50,718
You know, to tell
ya the truth, babe,

81
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:53,471
I would rather have your
number on my speed dial.

82
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:55,306
Will you focus?!

83
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:08,110
It's time.

84
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,779
All right, now we
shall undertake

85
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,489
some real technique training!

86
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:13,908
Yes, master!!

87
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,868
How 'bout we start
with some karate.

88
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:16,911
Take a shot!

89
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,329
Right!

90
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,630
First off, you must deflect your
opponent's attack downward,

91
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,091
then using the same hand,
you're gonna strike upwards

92
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:31,842
at his chin with your wrist.

93
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:35,596
This allows you stop an
opponent with only one hand.

94
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,223
From here on, the
odds are pretty good

95
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:38,599
you're gonna find
yourself fighting alone

96
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,060
against more than one
opponent at a time.

97
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,354
If you have to use both hands
to handle each of 'em,

98
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:48,651
you'll never be able to deal
with them all. Got that?

99
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:50,528
And now it's Apachai's turn!

100
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:52,446
I'm ready, master!

101
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,625
Sorry if I kill you.

102
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,170
I try and try, but you always
end up dead after the lesson.

103
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,047
Apapa.

104
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:12,258
Someone save me! Help! Help!

105
00:07:12,258 --> 00:07:14,677
This really is a dangerous
move, so I'll take your place

106
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:17,263
as his sparring partner.

107
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:20,391
Now pay close attention!

108
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:23,561
Let's go, Apachai!

109
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:26,021
Apapapapapapa!

110
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:35,030
Reverse elbow.

111
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,783
Whoa, close one. If that
had been Kenichi,

112
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:41,495
that would have snapped his neck
in two like a chicken bone.

113
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,330
Uh, reverse elbow?

114
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,999
Yep, that's what
it's called kid.

115
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:47,710
Yes. It's an extremely
advanced technique.

116
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:53,173
All right, now let me show
you something as well.

117
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,342
Okay, first,

118
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:58,762
attack your opponent
with a chop.

119
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:01,640
When your opponent's open,
you attack his side.

120
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,809
Twist the opponent's
hand around,

121
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:05,644
then strike his back
and neck area,

122
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:07,021
while attacking with your knee!

123
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:08,230
Then throw him,

124
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,732
like so!

125
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:12,443
Then if you can manage to
pin him down using your leg,

126
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:13,694
like so.

127
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:17,656
Now, use your hand

128
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:20,242
to finish him off.

129
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:22,578
It's a very useful combination
attack that gives you

130
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,747
four opportunities to
deliver a finishing blow

131
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:26,582
to your enemy, if
it's executed properly.

132
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:28,250
Eeeeeeeeeeee!

133
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,587
I pity the guy who's
on the receiving end!

134
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:34,924
Ah, I've never seen
Akisame so worked up.

135
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:36,383
Now it's my turn.

136
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,428
Oh, please, master, I just don't
think I can handle anymore!

137
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:42,014
Please have mercy!

138
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:44,141
Well, it's true that these
techniques are usually

139
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:47,019
considered rather advanced for
a disciple of your skill level.

140
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,396
Why don't Shigure and I
hold off on our training

141
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:53,025
til you've practiced
what you've learned?

142
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:58,280
As usual. Left out again.

143
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,240
The techniques that
Master Sakaki and the others

144
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,993
have shown me are too hard!
I don't know if I can remember

145
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:06,622
all the moves! I don't
have the skill!

146
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:13,045
You needn't worry.
Skill doesn't matter.

147
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:17,508
You just need to analyze
each technique step by step.

148
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:20,886
How does he do that
mind reading thing?!

149
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:22,888
And we'll get things started
by having you practice

150
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:24,974
each of these moves
1,000 times.

151
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:28,894
No way! 1,000 times?!

152
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:32,690
Oh, Akisame, you have a patient
waiting for you at the clinic.

153
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,234
Oh, yes, I forgot. Your
friend Takeda is scheduled

154
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:37,903
for another check up
with me this afternoon.

155
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:40,322
I might be a little while,
so I'll just leave Kenichi

156
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:42,408
in your capable hands, is
that okay with you, fellas?

157
00:09:42,408 --> 00:09:42,865
Yup.

158
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:45,368
You got it.

159
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:49,331
Darn it! I told Takeda
to keep a low profile!

160
00:09:58,467 --> 00:09:59,592
Everything looks okay.

161
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:03,346
Yeah. It feels fine.

162
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:04,305
So, doc...

163
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:07,433
Something's bothering
you, isn't it?

164
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:09,477
I haven't even said anything.

165
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:12,730
There's no getting
past this guy.

166
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,066
Yeah. I've been thinking,
I've worked so hard to heal

167
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:18,736
and train my body, and in
the end it's all for nothing.

168
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:22,198
Makes you wonder what the
point of martial arts really is.

169
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:26,578
There's a saying: "Humans
are born, then they die,

170
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:29,664
thus, is it better not
to have been born at all?"

171
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:33,001
I used to wonder
the same thing.

172
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:35,628
But you have to ask yourself:
What can I accomplish

173
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:37,630
during that short
period of life?

174
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,799
I don't care if I
ruin my body boxing!

175
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,176
I have no regrets about that!

176
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:43,761
But if Ragnarok cripples me...

177
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:46,097
Don't go into a fight
assuming that you'll lose.

178
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:47,765
No one has ever
escaped Rangnarok.

179
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:50,268
Those guys are out to kill me.
If you knew how dangerous

180
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:53,605
they were, you wouldn't be
acting so casual about it!

181
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:55,732
Really?

182
00:10:55,732 --> 00:10:56,691
Come with me.

183
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:59,235
There's something I
think you should see.

184
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:07,368
What's this place?

185
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:08,453
Too slow!

186
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:12,957
Is he gonna be alright?!

187
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:14,792
How many times do
I gotta tell ya'?!

188
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:17,295
You have to direct the oncoming
blow downward and then use

189
00:11:17,295 --> 00:11:19,714
the same move to strike
at the opponent's chin!

190
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:21,132
This is just the
first technique!

191
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:23,843
If you don't wanna learn,
we can just forget about it!

192
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:26,220
Please continue, Master Sakaki!

193
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,640
I have to master this technique
as quickly as possible!

194
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,393
Hm. All right, now you're
talkin' like a true disciple.

195
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:33,061
Get up!

196
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:34,812
Right!

197
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:37,148
You see, he's chosen
to undertake this severe

198
00:11:37,148 --> 00:11:40,693
training regimen to learn how
to be able to protect you.

199
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:43,655
Ah! Attack before your opponent!

200
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:44,781
Come on, faster!

201
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:46,616
Kenichi isn't
like you, Takeda.

202
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:48,868
He has absolutely
no natural aptitude

203
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:50,495
for the martial arts at all.

204
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:56,209
But, also unlike you, he
doesn't give up or give in.

205
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:56,960
Please continue!

206
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,794
Alright

207
00:11:57,794 --> 00:11:59,879
You see what I'm talking about?

208
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,006
You're not as alone
as you might think.

209
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:04,592
And as long as Kenichi is
willing to go the distance,

210
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:10,139
don't you think you owe it to
him to hang in there yourself?

211
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,100
You know, he's
an interesting guy,

212
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,768
our young Kenichi.

213
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:16,104
He comes off as cowardly,
but then he'll surprise you

214
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:20,775
by turning around and doing
something amazingly brave.

215
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:23,903
Honoka!

216
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:26,614
He seems as timid as a mouse,
but then he'll suddenly

217
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:28,157
turn around and take a stand.

218
00:12:28,157 --> 00:12:30,159
I've decided! Starting
today, I want to begin

219
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,995
training for the
advanced techniques!

220
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:34,914
At first I didn't know what
to make of him, but now I think

221
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:37,834
I've finally figured out
what makes him tick.

222
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:40,461
And? Just what would that be?

223
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:44,841
Well, simply put,
Kenichi Shirahama...

224
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:46,134
Too slow!

225
00:12:46,134 --> 00:12:49,178
...will do anything, dare
anything, even risk his life,

226
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:52,140
to protect the lives of
the people he cares about.

227
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:16,497
Now I think you got it.

228
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:25,590
Apapapapapapapa!

229
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:30,303
Apa!

230
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:35,767
You mean, I'm not dead?
How'd I make it out alive?!

231
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:38,603
Yeah, I thought so,
he's completely delirious.

232
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:42,190
Apaaaa!

233
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,360
Hey! Why did you fold over
a page in my favorite book?

234
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,153
Use a bookmark!

235
00:13:47,153 --> 00:13:50,114
One more.

236
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:53,576
A hot spring?! Miu, Shigure,
how would you like me

237
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:54,994
to wash your backs for you?

238
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:58,039
Isn't that part of a
loyal disciple's duty?

239
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:05,838
Okay.

240
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:09,342
Enough's enough.

241
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:11,844
So you're back in the real
world now, little man?

242
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:15,807
Hey, Kenichi!

243
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,974
Kenichi...

244
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:19,352
Takeda's leaving, he asked
me to tell you good-bye.

245
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:23,231
What? I didn't even
know he was here.

246
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,398
Takeda, wait!

247
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:27,860
Oh, hey, Kenichi! They
finally giving you a break?

248
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,113
What? You mean you
were watching me?

249
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:31,864
Hey, next time you're
planning to stop by

250
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:33,407
let me know or something.

251
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:35,409
Actually it was my
idea to bring him here.

252
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:39,372
Ah, I thought I told you to
lay low for a little while--

253
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:41,749
what are you doing here?
You've gotta be more careful!

254
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:43,960
It couldn't be helped.
He had an appointment

255
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,754
for a physical at the
bone clinic today.

256
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:49,048
Yeah, I get it, but still...

257
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:51,467
Wait a sec! What about my cell
phone number, have you

258
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,970
programmed it into your
speed dial like I asked you to?

259
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,596
Uh, well...

260
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:59,851
Come on! Okay, wise guy,
hand it over, now!

261
00:14:59,851 --> 00:15:02,103
Seriously. What the
hell do I have to do

262
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:03,813
to get you to start
listening to me?

263
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:05,815
Gimme a break!

264
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:09,152
Here! It's programmed
and ready to go!

265
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:12,238
Sweet! I'm finally on
somebody's speed dial!

266
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:15,116
Is this cool or what?

267
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:16,826
Right! So if anything happens,

268
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:19,120
remember to call me
right away, got it?

269
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,746
Promise me, will ya?

270
00:15:20,746 --> 00:15:23,040
Yeah, alright.

271
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,878
Hey, thanks for
everything Kenichi, bye.

272
00:15:26,878 --> 00:15:30,089
Watch your back and
avoid any dark alleys!

273
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:32,091
You're not as
alone as you think.

274
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:34,677
And as long as Kenichi is
willing to go the distance,

275
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:37,638
don't you think you owe it to
him to hang in there yourself?

276
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:46,147
Way to go, kid! I didn't
know you had a cell!

277
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:48,608
Check mine out, it's
the latest model!

278
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:49,775
Man, that is cool!

279
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:52,653
Apachai want to have a
cell phone too! Buy me one!

280
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:53,946
Please?

281
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:56,490
We don't have that kind
of extra money right now.

282
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,117
Now, now.

283
00:15:58,117 --> 00:15:59,118
Here.

284
00:15:59,118 --> 00:16:01,245
Knock yourself out
with this mobile phone.

285
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:02,330
Apa!

286
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,208
You can't just tear the
telephone cord out of the wall!

287
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,209
Wanna trade?

288
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:07,418
No way!

289
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:41,202
You can come out.
I know someone's there!

290
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:02,765
Hm! Well, it's Takeda.

291
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:05,643
Ah! Hey gorgeous,
long time no see.

292
00:17:05,643 --> 00:17:08,104
The name is Kisara,
you gutless traitor.

293
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:12,441
What a loser! C'mon,
guys, let's get him!

294
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:16,320
Hold on. Let me handle it.

295
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,948
Ukita...

296
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:20,908
That's how it is?

297
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:25,997
What's wrong?

298
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:28,958
Are you gonna call your
mommy to come and save you?

299
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:32,822
I know I promised, Kenichi,
but I gotta do this on my own.

300
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:40,944
Y' know what?

301
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:43,655
You've been a weirdo for
as long as I've known you.

302
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:45,156
After a fight, I've seen you

303
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:47,659
praise your opponent
to comfort him.

304
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:50,829
Hey, it was a good
effort, cheer up!

305
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:53,998
And you'd chew me out
if I fought unfairly.

306
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:55,542
You had that guy beat
from the start,

307
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,961
there was no need
to fight dirty.

308
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:01,381
Oh, sure. They liked to call
us the "Take-Down Trio."

309
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,008
But, deep down you
were a sportsman.

310
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:06,052
'N we were a couple a thugs.

311
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:08,596
We had no code of honor.

312
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:12,058
Man! How I hated your guts!

313
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,477
Heh. That's a shame,

314
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:17,647
'cause y'know, I never hated
you for a single moment.

315
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,949
Ukita! What are you doing?!

316
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:42,922
What's wrong with you?!

317
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,966
As of right now, I,
Ukita the Thrower,

318
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:47,010
officially resign from Ragnarok!

319
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,764
So, do any of you ladies
got a problem with that?

320
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,308
Ukita, thank you.

321
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:57,020
Wha-- idiot! I'm not
doing this for you!

322
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,439
I wanna go back and
do real judo again,

323
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:02,025
like I did before I was
a useless delinquent!

324
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,735
'Course, I'm sure
you know that no one

325
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:04,861
has ever left the gang.

326
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:07,405
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know,
no one has ever successfully

327
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:09,741
left Ragnarok and managed
to walk away whole.

328
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:11,951
That was what you were
gonna say, wasn't it?

329
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,245
I know we'll take a pounding,
but at least we can

330
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:15,538
show them what we're made of!

331
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:18,041
If I gotta go, I'm
takin' them with me!

332
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,585
I'm afraid that I can't go
along with your little plan.

333
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:22,629
Say what?

334
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:25,173
You shouldn't go into a
fight assuming you'll lose.

335
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:27,926
By Akisame.

336
00:19:27,926 --> 00:19:30,178
Man. What is it
with guys like you,

337
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:33,306
do you just live to
piss other people off?

338
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,766
Aw, male bonding.

339
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:39,020
That is so touching.

340
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,940
Ukita, since you asked for
it, I'm going to dish out

341
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,525
your punishment for
betraying us right now.

342
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:46,319
Boys, get 'em!

343
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:16,516
It's Takeda! Sweet,
he actually called me!

344
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:19,352
Hello! Give Apachai money
and he teach you how to kill!

345
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,062
Apachai, give it!

346
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:23,231
Funny, no one is answering.

347
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:24,816
Hand it over already!

348
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:26,985
Hey, Takeda, is there
something wrong?

349
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:31,531
Is everything okay, man?

350
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:34,701
What's going on? I can't
make anything out!

351
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,119
Here.

352
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,291
Ah, I see, it would seem that
your friend accidentally

353
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,167
hit the speed dial function.

354
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:46,170
It sounds like he's right in
the middle of big mob of people.

355
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,089
It sounds to me like he's
in the middle of a fight!

356
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:49,841
Hello! Apachai here!

357
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:50,383
Sh!

358
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,552
Apa.

359
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:56,222
Takeda... we'll kill you...

360
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,765
Ukita...

361
00:20:57,765 --> 00:20:59,851
you are done for... yes.

362
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,227
Uh! I knew it!

363
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:04,856
Hey! Apachai says hello!
Do you think he heard me?

364
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:06,065
What the hell's your problem?!

365
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,692
Don't you see
they're in trouble?!

366
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:09,027
Apaaa.

367
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:11,571
Wait, we may be
able to help him.

368
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:12,822
--Huh?
--Apa?

369
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:14,032
Everyone hold still.

370
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:16,701
Apapapapapa...

371
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:23,625
I hear what sounds
like a train passing by

372
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,209
on an overpass
in the background.

373
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:28,171
Miu! Bring me your student
directory and a city map now!

374
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:30,173
What are you gonna do with that?

375
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:32,508
I'm going to check possible
routes he might have taken home

376
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:35,261
from Ryozanpaku and see if they
intersect any train overpasses.

377
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,097
Ah! That's brilliant, Kensei,
I'll get 'em right away!

378
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,682
Oh, I get it now!

379
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:42,352
Awesome! I didn't
know you had it in ya!

380
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:44,562
He didn't know I had it in me?

381
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:46,773
What kind of idiot
does he think I am?

382
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,608
That hurts!

383
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:56,407
One, two, three, four...

384
00:21:56,407 --> 00:21:58,117
And the ol' "lethal left"!

385
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:03,831
Ah, the Puncher...

386
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:06,167
And they called you that even
when you were only using

387
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:08,127
your right hand didn't they?

388
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:12,090
What a pity.

389
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,426
Seems like such a shame
to destroy a fighter like you.

390
00:22:15,426 --> 00:22:17,178
You know, I heard about you.

391
00:22:17,178 --> 00:22:18,930
I guess you expect me
to congratulate you

392
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,767
on your promotion, huh?

393
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:26,312
The Eighth Fist of Ragnarok,
Kisara Nanjo.

394
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,189
She's a formidable opponent,

395
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:30,358
but I have no intention
of being defeated.

396
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:34,904
No way in hell.

397
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:36,948
I know who he's up against.

398
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:41,202
But not for long.

399
00:22:41,202 --> 00:22:43,496
I'll be seeing you and your
buddy Takeda soon enough

400
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,665
and we'll settle things
once and for all.

401
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:51,045
Why?! Why didn't he call
me?! Hang on, Takeda!

402
00:24:19,717 --> 00:24:22,011
You there!
Forget about Kenichi.

403
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:23,513
I'll be your opponent!

404
00:24:23,513 --> 00:24:25,598
Who's this top-heavy bimbo?

405
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,308
Get lost, you dairy cow.

406
00:24:27,308 --> 00:24:28,810
Who do you think
you're talking to?

407
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,936
Dairy Cow?

408
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,479
You asked for it.

409
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:34,482
I won't cut you any slack
if I see you get in my way.

410
00:24:34,482 --> 00:24:36,067
Get ready to fight!

411
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:37,527
Dairy cow?

412
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:40,071
Did you just call
me a dairy cow?

413
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:42,615
Ohhhh! Now I'm really mad!

414
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,325
You're gonna pay for that!
