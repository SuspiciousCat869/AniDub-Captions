[Music]

2
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:40,460
I ask you again...

3
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,420
Say you will become
my disciple...

4
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,922
Kenichi Shirihama.

5
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:52,680
Sorry, I can't do that.

6
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,766
But... But why...?

7
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,851
Don't you want
to be a martial artist?

8
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,021
I do...! But I want to be
one to protect people...

9
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:00,980
My friends...

10
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,273
And anyone else
who needs someone

11
00:02:02,273 --> 00:02:04,108
to fight for a good cause.

12
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:06,986
So... I don't really need to
learn how to kill people.

13
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:08,529
You know?

14
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,281
That's it, laugh...!

15
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:11,532
I almost starved to
death in that forest

16
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,284
and I was attacked
by a bear...!

17
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:14,786
And where were you? !

18
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,289
I don't know what I
would've done if Ogata

19
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,707
hadn't saved me...

20
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:20,917
I told him about
the walnuts

21
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,585
and he told me where
the trees grew...

22
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:24,253
so I went looking for them,

23
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:25,963
but I wasn't paying
attention...

24
00:02:25,963 --> 00:02:29,217
and the ledge broke off
and I fell in the river...

25
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:31,594
and I floated away...

26
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:33,930
Why didn't you
come for me...?

27
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,265
I thought I was
dead for sure!!

28
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:39,769
You might've
been scared...

29
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:42,188
But you still managed to keep
control of your inner rage.

30
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:47,485
Oh...! I'm angry, don't
kid yourself, old man!

31
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:51,948
As I thought, he
has a strong will...

32
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:54,242
and he has chosen the path of
the true martial artist.

33
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:57,537
Glad you're
back, Kenichi...

34
00:02:57,537 --> 00:02:59,247
good to see you
haven't changed.

35
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:01,290
Oo-kay... thanks.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,003
I should concentrate on
the radius of my reach.

37
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:10,216
I see! The reason I
couldn't grab them before

38
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:14,178
was because they always
swam ahead of my reach!

39
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:16,764
Then the place I
should be reaching...

40
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,599
Isn't where they are...

41
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,143
It's where they're going!

42
00:03:24,397 --> 00:03:25,857
I got one!

43
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,153
Ryouzanpaku...

44
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:32,613
And that damn old man.

45
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:36,033
He used me to
train his disciple.

46
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,035
Makes me itch to leave the
mountains for a while

47
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:39,745
and pay the city a visit.

48
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,171
I'm gonna die!

49
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:49,338
Keep calm.

50
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:50,673
Don't let your heart race.

51
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:51,757
Remember what
you've learned.

52
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,385
Ow!

53
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:55,595
That's enough
for tonight!

54
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,515
It's finally over.

55
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:01,767
Nope... There's
more to go.

56
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:16,913
Give up... How many times
do I have to tell you, no...?

57
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:19,666
You're lucky I haven't killed
you yet, you alien bastard.

58
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,710
There's no reason to
be so rude, Hermit...

59
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,087
I just wanted to
invite you to a party.

60
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:25,588
As Commander of the
Shinpaku Alliance

61
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:27,507
I'm aware that we've
become the main target

62
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:28,883
of Ragnarok...

63
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:30,135
So I thought it would
be nice to have a little

64
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:31,761
shin-dig to get to
know each other

65
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:33,096
before we go to war.

66
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:34,931
There's gonna
be a bingo game.

67
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,558
With prizes!

68
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:37,559
Die.

69
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:58,538
You are never gonna
hear the end of it-

70
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:00,832
at least, not until you join.

71
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:03,626
I told you I'd kill you if
you asked one more time!

72
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,381
Hey...! Sorry but I'm not the
alien you're lookin' to kill...

73
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:10,049
Good to see ya...!

74
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:11,801
But you should really
be more careful

75
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,970
about attacking
outta the blue like that-

76
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,847
could've been anyone...
you know?

77
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:17,640
Yeah, the last thing we
wanna do is put each other

78
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,477
outta commission before
we have to face Ragnarok.

79
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:22,187
How dare you even classify
me in the same group

80
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:23,438
as you worthless trash.

81
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:24,898
What the hell did you say? !

82
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,316
Now wait a minute...

83
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:28,359
Let's not start fighting
amongst ourselves.

84
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:30,820
Why don't you get it? !
I'm not one of you!

85
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,572
That doesn't matter- I
just think the party'll be

86
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:34,282
more fun the more
people come...

87
00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:35,408
You should join us.

88
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:37,035
There's no way
that I'm going...

89
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:38,828
That's the last
thing I wanna do.

90
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:40,413
So you're going? ! Great!

91
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:42,165
I'm glad we
cleared that up.

92
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:43,625
Guess we'll see
you later then!

93
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,294
The party starts at four
so ya better be on time...

94
00:05:46,294 --> 00:05:48,254
Otherwise, you're
first up at karaoke.

95
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:50,089
Did you dumb asses even
hear a word I said? !

96
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:02,060
Shin... paku!

97
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:06,356
How lame.

98
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:08,608
Kenichi's in secret training
and Hermit's an ass...

99
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,860
so unfortunately neither of
them can be with us today...

100
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,153
Too bad for them...

101
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:13,238
It's their loss...

102
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:14,489
Now let's get this
party started

103
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:16,741
and get to know Kisara
and her people.

104
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,085
Hey... I thought
Shiratori and the others

105
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,503
were supposed to
be here too!

106
00:06:28,503 --> 00:06:29,629
Don't worry about them...

107
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,130
They have their own
party to attend-

108
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,799
this one's just
for the generals.

109
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:42,350
And who are you...? I'll
have to see your invitation.

110
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,311
My what...?! I was
told to come here.

111
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:48,106
Oh, you're the guys
with the girly leader.

112
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,191
They called you out, huh?

113
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:52,026
Would you shut
up, dumb ass? !

114
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,781
Kisara asked me to try
to get along with you

115
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:58,449
Shinpaku guys...

116
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,368
So... You want some juice?

117
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:02,662
Hell yeah... Thank
you very much.

118
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:04,914
Here... Would you like to have
some water- it's filtered.

119
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:06,207
Sure...

120
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:07,792
Hey how come everybody
seems so high strung

121
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,294
at this party?

122
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:10,712
I don't wanna get
to know these guys.

123
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:12,171
They're weird.

124
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:14,382
So how about you pour
me a glass flag boy.

125
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:15,758
Sure - whatever you say...

126
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:17,343
princess.

127
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:19,596
Do you carry that flag
with you everywhere?

128
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:22,056
Our flag is the soul of
the Shinpaku Alliance.

129
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:24,100
Oh great, we
got a weird one.

130
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,561
Your general can
kick some major ass.

131
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:29,105
Yeah, well yours
isn't too bad either.

132
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:31,816
So they're having
some kinda party, huh?

133
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:36,696
Just so you know... you're
the best of the best...

134
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:38,198
You're the chosen
few my lads...!

135
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:39,657
We weren't very
close at first...

136
00:07:39,657 --> 00:07:41,200
because... we saw
things differently.

137
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,785
But now that we can
all see eye-to-eye

138
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:45,538
I know the Shinpaku Alliance
is destined for greatness!

139
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:48,625
Wouldn't you agree,
Siegfried? Well? !

140
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,710
In other words, all of my songs
are written from the heart

141
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,171
yet I also want them to
convey my technique.

142
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,673
Come on, Takeda! You'll
back me up, won't ya? !

143
00:07:55,673 --> 00:07:56,925
Okay, yeah...

144
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:58,343
so your music
is your attack!

145
00:07:58,343 --> 00:07:59,928
And my other cat's
named Gorozen.

146
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:01,512
He's the lighter one.

147
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:03,848
Oh wow! I can't believe you
have two of them!

148
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:06,893
As soon as I saw 'em I
knew I had to take 'em home.

149
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:09,103
I never would've pegged
you for a cat lover.

150
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:11,314
Ukita quit showing her
your cat pictures

151
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:12,982
and Sig quit talking
about music!

152
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:14,651
Start paying attention-
this is important!

153
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:17,445
We have to discuss the future
of the Shinpaku Alliance!

154
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:20,198
Listen...! I'm ordering
all of you...!

155
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,742
Please don't make
me keep screaming!

156
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:24,160
Ta-da!

157
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,166
Do not fear my underlings!

158
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,876
Your commander has come to
grace you with his presence

159
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:34,420
and I even brought food!

160
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,255
Are you kids
having fun yet?

161
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:45,723
Hey girly man...! I got
the booze...! I--...!

162
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:47,600
Oh my god, what happened? !

163
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,352
Matsui...

164
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:52,146
Hey... Commander...!
What's going on, sir? !

165
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:54,565
Commander Niijima...

166
00:08:57,443 --> 00:08:59,904
Kamioka...! Can you tell
us what happened? !

167
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:02,031
Uh... Berserker.

168
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:03,658
What? !

169
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:06,536
He busted in here and
asked me where you were...

170
00:09:06,536 --> 00:09:08,496
but... I didn't say a word.

171
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:12,917
Because... I will
always remember...

172
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:15,712
that you saved my life.

173
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:17,380
Thank you... sir...

174
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,756
Without you I'd be dead...

175
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:21,926
lying... in a sewer.

176
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:24,220
No...! No...!
Don't diiiiiiiie!

177
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,473
Calm down... He just
fell unconscious.

178
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:29,434
How can you be
so calm...?!

179
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,644
Your subordinates have all been
attacked, Commander...!

180
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:34,522
It's only a matter of time
before they find you too!

181
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:36,190
You may be right...

182
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:39,944
But I'll be prepared
with a counterattack.

183
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,407
That was a lot of fun! We
should do it again some time!

184
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:46,284
Hold on. Where's
Commander Niijima?

185
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:48,494
He probably went to
check on the other guys.

186
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,043
I had a great time
chatting with all of you-

187
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:56,669
hope to see
you again soon.

188
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,254
Bye... Sieg!

189
00:09:58,254 --> 00:09:59,922
So thanks for showing
me those pictures

190
00:09:59,922 --> 00:10:01,382
of your kittens, Ukita.

191
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:03,384
It's no big deal- I
mean, I had 'em on me...

192
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:04,844
I'm just glad you
thought they were cute.

193
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,141
So what's going on?

194
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,976
You gotta little
crush on Kisara?

195
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:13,770
What...?! What the hell
are you talkin' about? !

196
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,813
She and I were just
talking about cats!

197
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,940
More members of the
Shinpaku Alliance...

198
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,150
I got good luck tonight.

199
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:23,279
Ukita!

200
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:28,785
Nice glasses, pal.

201
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:30,661
-Hey!
-Wait... aren't you...

202
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:32,663
Berserker? !

203
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:34,874
That's right- the
one and only...

204
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:36,125
and just so you know...

205
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,919
I meant to miss.

206
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:46,302
I hate not havin'
Kenichi around-

207
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:49,013
this shopping stuff
gets exhausting!

208
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:50,681
Well... I see you recognize

209
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:52,683
the value of your
disciple when he's gone.

210
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:55,103
Apachai was also very
sad about Kenichi until

211
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,355
Akisame bought him
an ice cream cone!

212
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:58,606
That was too easy.

213
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:02,068
Hey, wait a second...
Where's Miu?

214
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:05,321
You're the cutest thing
ever! Yes, you are!

215
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:08,199
You're the sweetest little
ball of fluff I've ever seen!

216
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:11,244
I wish I could take you
home with me, kitty!

217
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:14,122
I'd hate to see her do jail
time for stealing a cat.

218
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:15,665
Peel your face off
the glass, Miu-

219
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:16,999
it's time to head home.

220
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,127
It's useless Sakaki- she
will stay there with face

221
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:20,419
to glass for at
least an hour.

222
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:22,338
Apachai has seen
it happen before.

223
00:11:22,338 --> 00:11:24,465
Well I'm not
waitin' for her.

224
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:30,888
Meow...

225
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:32,348
What're you doing here? !

226
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:34,183
I could ask you
that question!

227
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:36,519
All of a sudden we keep
running into each other.

228
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,187
Like that time I saw
you at the bookstore

229
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:39,605
while I was looking
at kitty calendars!

230
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:42,108
They have some great ones
at that place, don't they?

231
00:11:42,108 --> 00:11:43,234
Yeah, and then I
saw you at the park.

232
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:45,278
Because that's where all
the stray cats go

233
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:47,321
and I like to feed
them sometimes.

234
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:48,906
I just feel like you've
been popping up everywhere

235
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:49,991
I've been this
week- are you sure

236
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:51,576
that you're not following me?

237
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:52,910
It's just a coincidence.

238
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,328
We have a common interest
so it makes sense

239
00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:56,914
we'd bump into each
other sooner or later.

240
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:59,250
We're cat lovers so we
end up in the same places!

241
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,294
Whenever I start
feeling kinda lonely

242
00:12:01,294 --> 00:12:03,921
my cat obsession can get
a little out of control.

243
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:06,632
You're feeling lonely?

244
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:09,552
I get it- it's because Kenichi
isn't around right now...

245
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:11,470
So tell me, do you have
a crush him or what?

246
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,638
What are you
talking about? !

247
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:13,973
What on Earth would
give you that idea? !

248
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:15,349
Kenichi is just another
disciple training

249
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:17,143
at my grandfather's dojo.
No big deal!

250
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:18,060
I don't have any
feelings for him.

251
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,479
At least not in that way.

252
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,938
I think of him more like a
silly younger brother, you know?

253
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:22,315
Or maybe more like
the family dog?

254
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:23,399
But it would be better
if he were a cat.

255
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,901
Hold on- give
the guy a break-

256
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,652
dontcha think you're being
a little hard on him?

257
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:29,530
I was hoping Kenichi
Shirahama would be with you.

258
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,533
Guess I'll just have to
concentrate on my other targets.

259
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,537
I'm impressed...

260
00:12:36,537 --> 00:12:38,039
You're the first person
who's ever been able

261
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,249
to dodge one of
my attacks...

262
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:42,251
You're more skilled than
I thought you'd be...

263
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,086
Miu Furinji.

264
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:46,797
What did she
just throw at me? !

265
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:50,301
And you... If you knew
what's good for you-

266
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:52,345
you would've stayed with the
Wall-keer-ee...

267
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:54,430
Instead of joining
with the Shinpaku.

268
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,391
Stay outta this dairy cow-
this is my fight, you got it?

269
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:01,604
But cat lovers have to
have each other's backs!

270
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:04,065
Alright fine, if you wanna
help I guess I can't stop ya.

271
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:05,608
Then we'll fight
both of you...

272
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,026
Get them!

273
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:14,742
Pick up...!
Damn it Kisara,

274
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:16,702
why the hell won't you
answer your phone...?!

275
00:13:16,702 --> 00:13:18,579
Have you gotten through
to anyone, Matsui? !

276
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:21,040
No sir! Takeda's not
answering his phone either!

277
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,833
Damn it! Then try
calling Ukita!

278
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,168
Yes, sir!

279
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:25,336
I'll call Sig and we'll
come up with a place

280
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:27,296
where we can all
meet up, okay? !

281
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:30,258
Ukita! I'm so glad that
I got through to you!

282
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:31,676
Where are you right now?

283
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:34,053
What's the matter...!
What's going on? !

284
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:37,890
What's up, Ukita? !

285
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,059
Who the hell is Ukita...?

286
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:42,019
Oh, I think I know
who that is...

287
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:43,688
I'm steppin' on
his face right now.

288
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:03,761
Who the hell is Ukita...?

289
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,513
Oh, I think I know
who that is...

290
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:07,599
I'm steppin' on
his face right now.

291
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:11,352
Um... May I ask who
I'm speaking with?

292
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:12,812
Berserker.

293
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:16,065
What...?! What happened to him?

294
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:18,026
Is everything okay? !

295
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,861
Calm down- we gotta keep
our cool Matsui-

296
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:21,404
otherwise we've lost...

297
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:22,864
This has come as
a surprise-

298
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:25,325
I didn't expect to get
ambushed by Berserker.

299
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:27,535
It looks as if the final
battle is upon us...

300
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,620
That means we
need to commence

301
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,622
Operation Triple
O immediately!

302
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:35,335
So Kenichi Shirahama
isn't here...?

303
00:14:35,335 --> 00:14:37,712
No sense in me wasting my
time with you guys, then.

304
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:40,006
Get your foot
off my friend.

305
00:14:40,006 --> 00:14:41,841
Takeda the Puncher,
right...?

306
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:43,676
I've heard stories about
your powerful punches

307
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:45,511
but I can't say I'm worried.

308
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,513
I said get your foot
off my friend, you punk!

309
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,267
How the hell does
he keep dodging me? !

310
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:55,021
Ultimate uppercut!

311
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:56,230
To the left?

312
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,107
No! The right.

313
00:14:58,107 --> 00:15:00,610
He dodged me again!

314
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,737
Thanks. Right side's
better for me anyway.

315
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:10,203
There's something
weird about this guy...

316
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:13,831
I've got a
question for ya...

317
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:16,668
tell me... which martial
arts have you studied?

318
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:17,919
None of 'em.

319
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,337
I knew it!

320
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:21,422
He didn't get that strength
through martial arts training.

321
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:23,341
He's just a
street fighter.

322
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:25,134
I'm surprised you
can still stand...

323
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:26,594
I can tell
you're a boxer...

324
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,096
you're tough.

325
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:29,847
This is bad news for me.

326
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,350
Somehow he's able to
see through my punches.

327
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,352
Most fighters have to go
through years of training

328
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:37,188
before they can even
dodge a punch like mine...

329
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,940
but not this guy.

330
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,566
He's got some kind
of raw talent

331
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:41,984
that puts him
ahead of the game.

332
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:45,238
He's like a street
fighting genius.

333
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:47,365
I really don't
wanna admit this...

334
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:49,575
but I don't think I'll
be able to beat him.

335
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:52,245
I'm getting' tired of waiting-
are we gonna fight or what?

336
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:54,789
I thought I told you to get your
foot off my friend's face!

337
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,457
All you're doing is
wasting your energy-

338
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:57,917
you haven't been able
to hit me once.

339
00:15:57,917 --> 00:15:59,752
Didn't your boxing coach
tell you not to do that?

340
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:04,841
What's the deal, Takeda?

341
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:07,176
Wanna tell me why
you're so angry?

342
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,846
And don't tell me it's cause
I'm bullying your friend here-

343
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,139
there's gotta be more to it-

344
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,390
I've heard that one before.

345
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,683
That's too bad...

346
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:15,518
Cause you're about to
hear it one more time...

347
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:16,686
Now get your foot
off my friend

348
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:18,563
before I kill your dumb ass.

349
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:20,189
Well, that's
disappointing...

350
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,566
For some reason
I was hoping

351
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:24,152
there was a more interesting
reason this time.

352
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:25,987
Now Takeda!

353
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:26,988
Now's your chance
to hit him!

354
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:28,322
Ukita!

355
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:37,373
He caught my jab!

356
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:39,125
Only one thing
left to do...

357
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,585
My Illusionary Left!

358
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,422
That kinda stung a little.

359
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:45,673
What the-...?!

360
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:46,966
Hw did you catch my punch? !

361
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:50,470
Now die.

362
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,268
Ah well...

363
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:58,853
you gave it your
best shot...

364
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:00,229
I was hopin' for
a good fight

365
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,023
but that was easier
than I thought it'd be.

366
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,735
I suggest you get your
dirty feet off of my

367
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:08,362
subordinates before I have
to teach you a lesson.

368
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,864
Yeah, right...

369
00:17:09,864 --> 00:17:11,991
And what if I told you
that wasn't gonna happen?

370
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,703
Watch it. I don't
think you know

371
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:17,246
who you're messin'
with, buddy.

372
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,459
One round and you'll be
cryin' like a baby...

373
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:22,668
You see...

374
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,128
I'm the secret weapon
they've been hiding.

375
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,671
I don't know...

376
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,466
You do look like the leader
of the Shinpaku Alliance...

377
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:30,468
I could never forget
a face like that.

378
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:32,220
That's right... The
name's Haruo Niijima-

379
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,137
leader of the Shinpaku

380
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,597
and an overall bad ass.

381
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:39,310
What do you say, big guy...?
Ready to take me on?

382
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,229
You may think you're tough
but I got this one-

383
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,397
I bet you won't even be
able to lay a hand on me!

384
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,734
Time for Operation
Triple O...!

385
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,319
Go!

386
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,489
He's running away? !

387
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:52,615
What's the
matter, Berserker?!

388
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:54,700
You weren't expecting
that one, were ya? !

389
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,327
I'd like to see you
catch up with me now!

390
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:01,958
Through the legs!

391
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,254
What the hell? !

392
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,009
Okay... this one's...

393
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,469
interesting.

394
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,725
You have now
completed level two.

395
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:22,520
Great...! Does that mean
I can control my Seikuuken now?

396
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,771
Not yet!

397
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,527
Level three...
Beehive of hell.

398
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:36,659
You must dodge the
bees attacking you

399
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:38,161
while staying
balanced on the rock!

400
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,039
But... This is impossible!

401
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,833
You have to stay calm or
you'll lose your balance

402
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,792
and fall into the water!

403
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:47,587
Uh, oh...

404
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:58,366
Damn...

405
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:00,868
These girls are a lot
stronger than I remember.

406
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:02,370
We've been in special
training ever since

407
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,955
we fought the
crazy ninja woman

408
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:06,123
who attacked us
with a rice spoon.

409
00:19:08,376 --> 00:19:10,503
If you're wielding a
weapon to gain power...

410
00:19:10,503 --> 00:19:12,755
you can never become
it's master...

411
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:16,217
You need to become the master
of your own body... first.

412
00:19:16,217 --> 00:19:17,468
I've had enough
of you two!

413
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:25,685
Hey don't use me
as a spring board!

414
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:27,562
Sorry!

415
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:28,604
Damn you!

416
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,317
She's using some
kinda stick...

417
00:19:38,072 --> 00:19:40,283
Now I've got you!

418
00:19:40,283 --> 00:19:42,493
You're pretty darn
good with a staff...

419
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:43,869
Couldn't even
see it at first.

420
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:51,669
I see what she's doing.

421
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,171
She hides the staff
behind herself

422
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:56,132
so it looks like
she's only punching.

423
00:19:56,132 --> 00:19:57,883
That's kinda clever.

424
00:19:57,883 --> 00:19:59,427
I have a staff...

425
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:00,803
a longsword, a katana...

426
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:03,222
and even a knife...

427
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:05,683
Yeah. I can tell that you're
a master of weapons...

428
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:08,769
But it looks like the staff
is your preferred method.

429
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:11,063
Let's finish them off, Miu!
This is our chance!

430
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,654
Do it! I'll leave
the others to you!

431
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:19,989
You got it!

432
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:21,198
You're going down, girly!

433
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:23,284
You're pretty confident...

434
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:25,578
Too bad this fight is
gonna break both of you.

435
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:29,707
Hell yeah...! Four
steps at a time!

436
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:31,125
You can't stop me!

437
00:20:33,753 --> 00:20:34,962
Now I've got ya.

438
00:20:36,797 --> 00:20:37,798
Come back here!

439
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,010
I'm free!

440
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:43,721
Somebody help me please!

441
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:45,181
There's a pervert
on the loose...!

442
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:46,849
I'm being chased by
a big, scary perv!

443
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:50,603
Hold up Berserker...!
It's not a good idea

444
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:52,605
to chase me through
the crowded streets!

445
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:55,024
That's right.
Follow me, ya big lug...

446
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:56,317
Little does he know-
I'm psychologically

447
00:20:56,317 --> 00:20:57,902
manipulating him!

448
00:20:57,902 --> 00:20:59,362
All I had to do
was piss him off

449
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:01,155
and he'll chase me to
the ends of the Earth!

450
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:14,794
You're not gettin'
away this time.

451
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:17,254
Hold on...! Let's
talk this out!

452
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:18,422
Here we go!

453
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:20,299
Everything's going
according to plan.

454
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,009
This is gonna be great!

455
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:25,763
Just one more step...

456
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:36,107
Huh... You're kidding...

457
00:21:36,107 --> 00:21:39,068
Did you really think I was
gonna fall for that...?

458
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:41,862
You have seriously
underestimated your opponent.

459
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:43,781
Nice try, buddy...

460
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:45,992
but this is the end.

461
00:21:45,992 --> 00:21:47,576
You figured me
out, Berserker...

462
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:48,911
I can't believe you were
able to see through

463
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:50,955
my perfect plan!

464
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:52,373
Now die!

465
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:53,624
Oh no...! Don't hurt me!

466
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:56,669
Fooled ya, didn't I? !

467
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:04,010
How ya like that...? I've
been digging this hole

468
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,386
since I was a
little kid...

469
00:22:05,386 --> 00:22:07,096
I'm so glad I finally
got to use it...!

470
00:22:07,096 --> 00:22:08,472
I call it trap two-

471
00:22:08,472 --> 00:22:10,307
it's harder to get out
of than the first one.

472
00:22:10,307 --> 00:22:11,976
You jumped right
over trap one

473
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:14,020
but you didn't see
this one coming!

474
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,187
I lured you
into my trap-

475
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:17,356
like a game of
Tic-Tac-Toe...!

476
00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:19,984
And that's why I call
it Operation Triple O...

477
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:21,902
Pretty smart, huh?

478
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:23,529
You could learn
a thing or two.

479
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:25,281
Want me to tell you why
I'm standing here at the top

480
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:27,283
and you're at the
bottom of trap two?

481
00:22:27,283 --> 00:22:29,243
Go ahead and tell me...

482
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:31,579
Maybe you're right- I
could learn a thing or two.

483
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:34,623
While you may be able to see
what's two steps ahead of you...

484
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:38,169
I can see even farther ahead
thereby surpassing you all!

485
00:22:48,804 --> 00:24:06,340
[Music]

486
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:20,479
I am a master
of weapons.

487
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,189
Who would've thought
my disciple would leave

488
00:24:22,189 --> 00:24:24,108
because I chose to
fight with them?

489
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:26,235
You've sided
with the enemy.

490
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,863
I feel like I've been
bitten by my own dog.

491
00:24:28,863 --> 00:24:30,030
I'm sorry, Freya
but I can't stand

492
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,824
in your shadow any longer.

493
00:24:31,824 --> 00:24:33,701
I have to walk
my own path.

494
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:34,535
It's nothing personal.

495
00:24:34,535 --> 00:24:36,245
You talk a big
game, Kisara-

496
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:38,581
but against my staff
you're helpless.

497
00:24:38,581 --> 00:24:40,457
You may have been
my student once

498
00:24:40,457 --> 00:24:42,334
but I have no problem
destroying you now.

499
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:44,003
Fine, then let's do this.

500
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:45,880
We'll just see who
comes out on top.

501
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,214
Here goes!
