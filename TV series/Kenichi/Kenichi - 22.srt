1
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:52,197
Yo, yo, my brutha!
How's it going?

2
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:54,824
No freaken way...

3
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:58,536
Your main man and best buddy,
Niijima has come to back you up!

4
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,804
Niijima! I want you
to quit stalling

5
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:21,476
and tell me exactly
what it is you're up to!

6
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:23,269
What?

7
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,064
What the heck is that
thing supposed to be?

8
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:33,947
A flag, I guess.

9
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:36,241
Come on, that's not what I mean!

10
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:38,952
This, this, this gang!
This Shinpaku Alliance

11
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:42,413
or whatever you call
it, what's it about?!

12
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,707
Oh, come on, we
already covered this.

13
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:47,210
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot,
you wanna explain this whole

14
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,504
'Shinpaku Alliance" thing,
to me? And it better be good!

15
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:51,422
Well I think it's pretty
obvious, if you take

16
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,341
the first characters
of my name and tack on

17
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,426
the first characters of yours
you end up with "Shinpaku".

18
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:55,969
Cool huh?

19
00:02:55,969 --> 00:03:00,306
I can spell, you idiot, that's
not what I'm talking about!

20
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:03,434
I'm not fooling around here!
I want to know exactly

21
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,895
what you're planning in
that twisted mind of yours!

22
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,772
It's all part of my scheme
to finally achieve

23
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,774
my life long dream.

24
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:13,611
Haven't you worked it out yet?
I am going to rule the world.

25
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:16,781
But naturally,
I'll need your help.

26
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:19,075
Now I want you to just
listen to me for a minute.

27
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:22,453
If we combine your brawn with
my superior intelligence.

28
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,790
you and I could become the
strongest team in history!

29
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,834
That hurt.

30
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,295
Hello, Niijima?

31
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:32,999
Time to wake up and
smell the coffee!

32
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,097
General Niijima,
I need to see you!

33
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:46,269
Sorry to intrude!

34
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,312
General Niijima!

35
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:49,897
What happened?!
General, speak to us!

36
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,691
Crap! I can't let
myself get sucked

37
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,818
into this alliance
scheme of his!

38
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:55,653
I don't believe it!
He's completely out!

39
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,614
Get some water!

40
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:59,282
Now that I think about it,

41
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:02,160
Niijima did come to
save me from Ragnaorok.

42
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,579
I shouldn't have gotten
so carried away.

43
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:08,583
I tried to hold back, but...

44
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,002
...I've been having trouble
controlling my strength lately.

45
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,754
Apapapapa!

46
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:14,547
Just like someone else I know.

47
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:18,509
There you are! Kenichi!

48
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,553
We've got trouble!

49
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:24,599
Izumi! What's wrong?

50
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:25,933
Please, I need your help!

51
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,811
There's a guy in a karate outfit
hanging around the Garden Club!

52
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,355
Do you think maybe
the Karate Club

53
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,357
is going to trash
the place again?

54
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,446
Stop!

55
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:45,453
Whoa! I'm not gonna
pick them, honest!

56
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,373
I just wanted to
smell them, really!

57
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:51,542
Oh, man! What a relief,
it's just you two guys!

58
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,670
It's a surprise, though,
is something wrong?

59
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,713
Nah, Ukita here just
wanted to thank you

60
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,632
for everything you did
for us the other day.

61
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,550
You idiot, it was
your idea to drag me

62
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,469
all the way over here
to say thank you.

63
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:04,013
You guys don't have to thank me.

64
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,682
I'm glad you both look well.

65
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:07,725
It's good that your
injuries were so minor.

66
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:08,643
Hmph!

67
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:11,688
I haven't sunk so low that
I need you to worry about me,

68
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:12,522
ya' punk.

69
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:15,066
Oh, of course not.

70
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:21,447
Oh, yeah, by the way, I thought
I might come back to school

71
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:24,158
and take up judo again, you
know, just to keep my hand in.

72
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,202
I joined the club yesterday.

73
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:28,079
They're mostly a bunch of
wusses who couldn't throw

74
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,499
my grandmother, but, I figure
that I can whip 'em into shape.

75
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,501
Anyway, that's my story. Later!

76
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,336
Uh, uh, uh!

77
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:38,548
What was that supposed to be,
the six o'clock news report?

78
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:42,010
You were gonna say something
else, weren't you, big guy?

79
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,726
I know I'm in your debt and
I promise I'll pay you back!

80
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:51,894
And you can just like
it or lump it okay!

81
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,063
Wait, is that your
idea of a thank you?

82
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:57,400
Hey! Why don'tcha shut up?!
Ya blue-haired freak!

83
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,570
You'll have to excuse him,
he was raised by wolves.

84
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,239
Still, I tried.

85
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,949
No sweat.

86
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,706
That dumb blonde!

87
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:20,631
That stupid cow!
She's going to pay.

88
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,550
Kisara's wound pretty
tight isn't she?

89
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,178
She shoulda' listened. I told
her that Blondie was a monster.

90
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:29,057
What?! Koga, you idiot,
keep your big mouth shut!

91
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:32,769
Did you say something,
you little weasel?!

92
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,771
I've had it with all of you!

93
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:38,608
He's not real good at reading
a woman's subtle signals, is he?

94
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:42,487
Kisara, I just got some
orders from Hermit.

95
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:45,323
He said we're supposed to lay
off the Shinpaku Alliance...

96
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,325
...for now.

97
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:49,368
He what?! He can't be serious!

98
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:52,121
I can clean up that group
of amateurs by myself any--

99
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,916
Orders from above
can not be questioned.

100
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:59,462
Dammit, what is he thinking?

101
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:02,673
Whatever.

102
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,258
Okay, fine.

103
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,718
Yes?

104
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:08,221
What if I just "happened" to
bump into them on the street

105
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:13,893
and a fight broke out?
Would that be a problem?

106
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:17,021
For instance, if I just happened
to run into that dairy cow...

107
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,189
What? But that's--

108
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:19,232
Alright losers!

109
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:22,193
Go find ninja girl and
bring her back here for me!

110
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:22,652
Yes, ma'am!

111
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,487
Let's go!

112
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,623
With that cow's
fighting ability,

113
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:38,960
and the fact that Hermit is
sticking his nose into this,

114
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,920
it makes me wonder.

115
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:48,928
Maybe this Shinpaku Alliance
is a more powerful threat

116
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:50,596
than I'd thought.

117
00:07:56,227 --> 00:08:01,519
One two three four.
One two three four...

118
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,654
So, you really beat
all those gang members?

119
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:10,366
Sure did! I tore those
lousy punks apart.

120
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,869
A complete victory!

121
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:16,122
They were toast!

122
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:18,749
Ah, a complete
victory, is that so?

123
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,586
As I recall, it was Miu
who defeated their leader.

124
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:23,254
She did, really?

125
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,298
Yeah, yeah, I know.

126
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:27,717
I just wanted to be
able to say it once.

127
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,886
Now, now, don't sulk.

128
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:31,804
If that friend of
yours hadn't shown up,

129
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:34,265
you'd've been dead meat.

130
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,726
Now Kenichi, don't
get too cocky.

131
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:39,687
Yes sir! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, sorry...

132
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,355
What a drama queen!

133
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,358
Nevertheless, Kensei is
right, and you know it.

134
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,819
You caught a lucky
break this time around,

135
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:49,614
but you know you can't always
count on that happening again.

136
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,449
You've got to focus on
learning more techniques

137
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:54,035
as quickly as possible.

138
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:56,287
It always comes back to that!

139
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,707
You're thinking, "It always
comes back to that," aren't you?

140
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:04,712
How does he do that?!

141
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,089
At any rate, I think
this Shinpaku Alliance

142
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,384
or whatever it's called might
turn out to be a good thing.

143
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,054
Well, think about it, it could
work as a deterrent, you know.

144
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,972
And there's strength
in numbers. Here.

145
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,433
No, it's no good.

146
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:19,769
If we gather a big mob of
people and start throwing

147
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:22,021
our weight around,
we'll be just like them.

148
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:24,945
We'd end up just as
bad as Ragnarok is.

149
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,696
I hadn't thought
about it like that.

150
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:35,201
Well, our disciple is
starting to think like a man.

151
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:38,913
Big brother, you're so cool!

152
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:42,833
Yeah, I know.

153
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,212
Ah. You know, when it
all comes down to it,

154
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:48,714
the only person you can
really count on is yourself.

155
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,300
That's true. Take me for
example, back in the day

156
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,762
I found myself fighting all
alone against the Chinese Mafia.

157
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,847
What? Chinese Mafia?

158
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,808
How'd you get in a
situation like that?

159
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,059
That's not important.

160
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,939
Just know that fighting
requires three things.

161
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,858
What are they?
Please tell me master!

162
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,486
You need your
courage and faith...

163
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,322
...and your fists!

164
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:16,784
And now you're thinking,
"He's got to be kidding", right?

165
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:18,828
Uh. Stop it!

166
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:33,030
Yeah! There's nothing better
than walking the city streets

167
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,116
showin' these people who's
boss, with my gang at my back.

168
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:38,785
Hey, everybody! How do
you like all the respect

169
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:40,788
we're gettin' from these
people on the streets, huh?

170
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:44,750
Are you kidding me?
This is totally cool!

171
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,877
Oh yeah, it never gets old.

172
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:49,254
By the way, sir, where's
your co-commander,

173
00:10:49,254 --> 00:10:51,673
General Shirahama?
Is he feeling alright?

174
00:10:51,673 --> 00:10:53,175
Huh? Oh, yeah.

175
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:55,385
He's off doing some
secret training somewhere.

176
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:57,763
Man, it was amazing the
way he was able to take on

177
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:59,807
those Ragnarok punks
all by himself!

178
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:03,602
General Shirahama is really
an incredible fighter!

179
00:11:03,602 --> 00:11:05,187
Well, of course he is!

180
00:11:05,187 --> 00:11:07,606
After all, I trained
him myself, right?

181
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,794
Who are you! Speak up!

182
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:30,671
The Shinpaku Alliance
is coming through,

183
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:32,214
so get out of the way!

184
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:34,967
Wait just a second, guys.

185
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:37,970
Oh, man, this is
worse than I thought.

186
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,474
That guy, he's
Ragnarok's Sixth Fist,

187
00:11:42,474 --> 00:11:43,976
Hermit!

188
00:11:43,976 --> 00:11:46,520
What's your problem man?
Are you deaf or what?

189
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,314
No! Kamioka, get
back here right now!

190
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:54,403
You bastard!

191
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:55,612
Uh-oh.

192
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:12,629
If you answer my question,

193
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:18,552
I may just let you
live a little longer.

194
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,945
If you answer my question...

195
00:12:36,945 --> 00:12:38,947
I may just let you
live a little longer.

196
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:41,199
Oh, crap. It figures
we'd run into this guy

197
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:43,493
when Kenichi isn't
here to fight him.

198
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:44,620
Now what?

199
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,539
Kamioka! Are you alright?

200
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,625
Damn! He'll be
sorry he did that!

201
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:55,422
Hey, General Niijima,
do you know that guy?

202
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:57,674
Huh?

203
00:12:57,674 --> 00:12:58,884
General?

204
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:14,524
You lame fool! Do you
have any idea who I am,

205
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:16,860
you can't talk to me like
I'm some dumb street punk!

206
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,112
Ha! I'm the notorious
general of the invincible

207
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:21,907
Shinpaku Alliance,
Lord Haruo Niijima!

208
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:24,159
Beat it, you guys.
Back to headquarters!

209
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,285
But General--

210
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:26,953
Shut up! And don't
question my orders!

211
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:30,540
I can handle this
punk all by myself!

212
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,833
You're the boss, General.

213
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,669
We'll grab Kamioka
and get out of here!

214
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:35,754
No! Just forget about
him! Once I've finished off

215
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:38,048
this loser I'll take
care of Kamioka myself!

216
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:40,759
Now get out of here, all
of you, do as you're told,

217
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,802
move, move, move!

218
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:43,011
Right!

219
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:53,772
Now answer my question.

220
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:58,110
So, your partner, the one
called Kenichi Shirahama.

221
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,529
Where did he acquire his
martial arts training?

222
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:05,826
Huh? That's all he wants? Why
would he confront us about that?

223
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:09,079
You've got three
seconds. One...

224
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,083
Heh! Oh, you really
wanna know, do you?

225
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:13,917
Two...

226
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:16,920
So you're serious?
You really wanna know?

227
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,797
And three. Talk.

228
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:23,260
The answer...

229
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,511
I don't know!

230
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,513
Forgive me!

231
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:33,437
Sir! To tell you the truth,
Kenichi and I aren't really

232
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:36,022
that close, it's more of
a professional relationship.

233
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:37,649
Actually, I'm just sort
of borrowing his name,

234
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:39,443
it's like a licensing
agreement, you know.

235
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:41,737
So please let me go!
I'm sorry! Forgive me!

236
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:45,323
I beg you! I'm just a
worthless little nobody!

237
00:14:45,323 --> 00:14:46,992
The way you ambushed
us was brilliant!

238
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:48,827
No wonder you're one
of Ragnarok's leaders!

239
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:49,786
Stupid fool!

240
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:51,955
Yup, that's me, stupid fool,
that's what they call me,

241
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:54,124
I'm a complete dunce!

242
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:58,754
I hate weaklings like you.
Your kind is beneath contempt!

243
00:14:58,754 --> 00:15:01,631
Ah! Oh, yeah, his
training, I remember now!

244
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,217
Where is it? Where does
he do his training?

245
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:09,139
Let's see, it was, uh...

246
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:14,394
I don't know, you moron!

247
00:15:14,394 --> 00:15:19,107
Ha! Later, dude!

248
00:15:19,107 --> 00:15:23,945
Damn. What an idiot.

249
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:26,782
People don't call me a slippery
little snake for nothing,

250
00:15:26,782 --> 00:15:29,159
this filthy drainage ditch
is like my own back yard!

251
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,412
Ah! There's my
missing lackey ahead!

252
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:35,582
Here we are, safe and sound!

253
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:37,584
Too bad for you,
Mr. High and Mighty Hermit!

254
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:39,753
I memorized a map of
the city's sewer system

255
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:44,049
a long time ago for
emergencies like this!

256
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:45,258
General Niijima?

257
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:48,595
I'm so glad that
you're alright Kamioka!

258
00:15:48,595 --> 00:15:49,971
You mean you risked your life

259
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:52,599
and jumped into this nasty
sewer just to save me?

260
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:56,228
Well of course I did!

261
00:15:56,228 --> 00:15:58,730
What about that guy?

262
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,817
I beat him to a bloody
pulp with my own hands!

263
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,236
You're amazing!

264
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:06,363
The Shinpaku Alliance
is the greatest!

265
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:07,697
I'm so glad I joined up--

266
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:11,159
You know, Hermit was right.
Kenichi's skills keep improving

267
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:14,246
but I don't know where he's
training or who his sensei is.

268
00:16:14,246 --> 00:16:15,747
I'd better start
looking into it.

269
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:18,500
I'd give my life for
you, General Niijima!

270
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,210
I swear it!

271
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,737
I'll begin my investigation
first thing tomorrow morning.

272
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:31,436
Man that smarts, I still
can't get used to this

273
00:16:31,436 --> 00:16:33,354
new level of training
at the dojo!

274
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:35,857
At least you don't
pass out anymore,

275
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:38,026
that's a major improvement!

276
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:44,490
It doesn't feel like much
of an improvement to me.

277
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,826
But it is, you've definitely
gotten a lot stronger

278
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:48,411
since you moved in.

279
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:52,332
I have?! Miu, would you mind
repeating that one more time?

280
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:53,875
By the way, when you
take your stance

281
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,711
you should hold your arms a
little closer to your body.

282
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:59,714
You aren't going to
say it again, are ya?

283
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:02,719
If I march up and ask him he's
not gonna tell me anything.

284
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:08,681
I'll just have to
follow him instead.

285
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:12,769
Hey everybody, I'm back!

286
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,854
Ha! So this is it, huh?

287
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:22,236
Whoa, that's one
seriously intimidating

288
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:23,947
front door they've got.

289
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:34,957
It's no use, I
can't even budge it.

290
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:38,044
They must have it barred from
the other side or something.

291
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:39,754
Well, at least I've
got the address now.

292
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:42,924
That's all I really
needed, right? I should go.

293
00:17:42,924 --> 00:17:45,551
No, no. it's just no good.

294
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:49,055
As general it's my duty to find
out what's going on in there.

295
00:17:58,147 --> 00:18:01,693
Suddenly things are looking up.

296
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:04,153
Uh, yeah, hey, nice to meet
you, I'm a really good friends

297
00:18:04,153 --> 00:18:08,825
with Kenichi's and I was
wondering if he was in.

298
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:11,661
Sure.

299
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:13,413
Thank y--

300
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,419
Why is she carrying a sword?

301
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:21,921
And why is she dressed
like a ninja pin-up?

302
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:27,218
My suspicion radar just
kicked into high gear!

303
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:29,262
What the--
Where'd she go?

304
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:39,462
Hey! I'm looking for
Kenichi Shirahama!

305
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:46,414
Why would anyone put a pillar
in the middle of a walkway?

306
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:55,204
Hi! My name's
Apachai, what's yours?!

307
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:57,039
You're going the wrong way.

308
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,333
He's that way.

309
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,543
Apa?

310
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:05,465
Apapapa.

311
00:19:31,449 --> 00:19:32,825
--Monster!
--Hm?

312
00:19:50,676 --> 00:19:52,678
Another monster!

313
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:55,765
I never said I was a beauty,
but that was just rude!

314
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,314
Hi! It's me, Apachai, again!

315
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:23,709
Well, now, whom have we here?

316
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:27,255
A white haired beast!

317
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:31,259
An upside down devil maiden!

318
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:34,178
A tanned ogre!

319
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:37,348
A drunken demon!

320
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:39,475
A statue carving maniac!

321
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:42,270
An old man!

322
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,564
Daydream goblins!

323
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:46,607
It's... it's... a...

324
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:51,616
house of monsters!

325
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:56,868
Ah... Oh boy, oh boy.

326
00:20:56,868 --> 00:21:00,913
Um, that sure sounded
like Niijima's voice.

327
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:02,748
Apaaa...

328
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:09,088
Mm, he looks tasty...

329
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:11,215
Niijima!

330
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:12,300
It is you!

331
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,927
Just what the heck are
you doing here anyway?

332
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:18,848
Kenichi! Where have you been all
this time, you miserable jerk?!

333
00:21:18,848 --> 00:21:20,516
Huh? What's up?

334
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:22,602
If you're hungry,
eat him, he's tastier,

335
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:24,020
and he's got more meat on him!

336
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,313
Hey, calm down.

337
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:29,066
I'll live, no matter
what happens!

338
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:32,111
Okay, I don't know what's going
on, but my deranged friend here

339
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:34,322
is terrified of you guys,
so would you mind giving

340
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:35,990
him a little space
until he calms down?

341
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,618
You mean, this guy
is a friend of yours?

342
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,620
Well, I'll be...

343
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,954
Apa?

344
00:21:41,954 --> 00:21:42,538
What?

345
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:44,665
They actually did what
you told them to?

346
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:47,001
Wait, wait, are you trying
to tell me that these huge

347
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:49,295
powerful monsters are all
under your command?

348
00:21:49,295 --> 00:21:51,756
No, far from it,
they're my masters!

349
00:21:51,756 --> 00:21:53,883
Oh, Kenichi, I could kiss you!

350
00:21:53,883 --> 00:21:56,385
If those fearsome creatures
are under your control,

351
00:21:56,385 --> 00:21:57,720
or better yet,
if those creatures

352
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,180
were under my control...

353
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,932
No, you've got it wrong!

354
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:02,975
Not, not just this district...

355
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:05,603
The country, and then
the whole world...

356
00:22:05,603 --> 00:22:10,942
will really be mine!

357
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:13,778
Hello! You're doing it again!

358
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:19,742
We'll gather an army of monsters
and take over the world!

359
00:22:19,742 --> 00:22:22,995
Open up those big ears freak!

360
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:26,958
Shinpaku Alliance!
Hooray! Hooray!

361
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,918
Come on, snap out of it!

362
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:32,838
Shinpaku Alliance forever!

363
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:38,177
Ni-Nijima?

364
00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:40,137
Hey, man, are you okay?

365
00:22:49,188 --> 00:22:52,483
A Demon!

366
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:23,032
Uh, I really wish I could
get closer to Kenichi,

367
00:24:23,032 --> 00:24:24,825
but I don't know what to do.

368
00:24:24,825 --> 00:24:28,954
Have no fear, young lady! I
can make your wish come true!

369
00:24:28,954 --> 00:24:32,041
You're that freaky alien
kid! Stay away from me!

370
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,168
Okay, girlie, just
mind your manners!

371
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:37,546
If you listen to me, I can
guarantee Kenichi will be yours!

372
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:39,757
Seriously?! Are you for real?

373
00:24:39,757 --> 00:24:41,926
Of course! Now come with me!

374
00:24:41,926 --> 00:24:44,637
The battle for Kenichi's
heart is about to begin!
