1
00:01:39,227 --> 00:01:40,561
It was perfect!

2
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:44,106
I finally got to take Miu out
on a date! Just the two of us!

3
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:47,318
But Niijima showed up and
the day started to go wrong.

4
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:50,363
And then those Ragnarok
guys decided to attack me.

5
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:52,782
Jeez, how did this happen?

6
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:54,408
Are you people insane?

7
00:01:54,408 --> 00:01:56,994
You used Miu-san as bait so
those thugs would attack me

8
00:01:56,994 --> 00:01:58,371
and I'd have to fight them?!

9
00:01:58,371 --> 00:01:59,956
It's no different
from the lioness

10
00:01:59,956 --> 00:02:02,083
who throws her cubs from the
cliff to make them stronger.

11
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,876
Perhaps cruel but
it's "tough love".

12
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:05,962
Well, I don't need
love like that, okay!

13
00:02:05,962 --> 00:02:07,588
Hey, whether you like it or not,

14
00:02:07,588 --> 00:02:09,131
those bullies are
comin' for you.

15
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:11,968
That's right. Remember the enemy
will never stop attacking you.

16
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:14,720
I get that. But you don't
have to help 'em do it.

17
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,888
Tell me, son.

18
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:18,683
Have you already decided you're
never going to run away?

19
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:20,685
Well, sort of...

20
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:23,938
If that's true, you must
prepare yourself to fight!

21
00:02:34,115 --> 00:02:37,076
Why won't this stupid
thing go straight?!

22
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:45,543
How did she do that?
Miu is so awesome!

23
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:55,553
Whoa, yes!

24
00:02:55,553 --> 00:02:57,471
No matter how cute
she is in her uniform,

25
00:02:57,471 --> 00:02:59,390
nothing compares
to a leotard!

26
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,142
Thank you, stupid wheelbarrow,

27
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:02,894
for steering me
toward this window!

28
00:03:02,894 --> 00:03:05,730
And, man! She's an
amazing gymnast, too!

29
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,231
And flexible!

30
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:10,693
I've never seen anybody move
like that! Have you, Takashima?

31
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:12,695
She's-- she's okay.

32
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:14,697
I'm sure she's just
eating this up.

33
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:16,490
Just because she's
cute and blonde

34
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:21,537
and can do a back flip into
splits, everybody loves her.

35
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:24,999
Oops! What moron would leave
a pin lying around like this?

36
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:28,419
I nearly tripped over it
and broke my neck.

37
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:30,129
Oh, crud! I kicked it too hard!

38
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,380
Look out!

39
00:03:43,935 --> 00:03:45,519
--Are you okay?
--I was so scared!

40
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,939
That was amazing!

41
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,774
Why couldn't it have hit her?!

42
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:56,113
Miu is amazing at
anything she does.

43
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:58,115
It's like she doesn't
even have to try.

44
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:00,117
She's gotta be some
kind of genius.

45
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:04,622
But look at me, I
can't do anything

46
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:07,959
without six weeks of
intensive training first.

47
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,502
So why me?

48
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,174
Do you know what a punch that
fast could do to a human face?

49
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:17,551
Nooo!

50
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:21,180
Why does it have to be my face?
I really like my face!

51
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:25,226
So that's the jist of it.

52
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:29,814
To keep my face, I'll be staying
at the dojo on the weekends.

53
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:31,649
What does that even
mean, keep your face?

54
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:34,735
Is this a 'respect' thing?
Explain yourself!

55
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:37,113
Well, then, take
care, everyone.

56
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:40,366
No, please, Kenichi!

57
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,451
They're only going to hurt
you, I know they will!

58
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:44,161
Please don't leave us!

59
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:45,663
This is just silly.

60
00:04:45,663 --> 00:04:48,416
I have to become strong as
soon as possible, otherwise I--

61
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,209
...simply won't have a chance.

62
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:51,627
According to them.

63
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:53,796
So, there's no option.

64
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:57,508
Of course there's an option!
It's sit your butt down!

65
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:58,259
Right now!

66
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,844
Wait, Kenichi!

67
00:05:02,263 --> 00:05:05,141
Alright, Honoka. I guess
I'll see you on Monday.

68
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:11,063
Did you see his eyes?! That
boy has been brainwashed!

69
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:13,190
This supposed dojo
must be one of those

70
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,317
doomsday cults I've read
about where they lure you in

71
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:16,986
with the promise of
karate but who knows

72
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:18,070
what they're going to do?!

73
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,072
We have to do something
to save him, Saori!

74
00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:21,782
Please, calm down, dear.

75
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:24,827
Hey, Dad! Look what I've got!

76
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:27,079
Yes? What now? Go on.

77
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,789
I snuck into Kenichi's room

78
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:32,752
and copied the map of the
dojo he's been going to!

79
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:35,379
Brilliant! Our daughter
is a certified genius!

80
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:37,923
Quick, calm, and cool,
just like her old man.

81
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:45,181
Rise, Sebastian!

82
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:49,185
Well, I'm going for a walk

83
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:51,354
and might drop by
the dojo to say hello.

84
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:52,355
With your gun?

85
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:53,606
Yeah, way to go, Dad!

86
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:57,193
You told me that you had
to work this weekend.

87
00:05:57,193 --> 00:06:00,363
Oh, dear, work is nothing
compared to my family.

88
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:02,782
But don't worry, I
already called my boss

89
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:05,284
and told him I was
undergoing emergency surgery.

90
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:08,496
Hurry up, Dad, let's get going!

91
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:12,500
I'll return home with our son
in no time, safe and sound.

92
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:17,379
What? Dad's not, coming?

93
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,839
Once your father calmed down,

94
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,010
he realized he had a very
important meeting to go to.

95
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,513
Here, take this with
you to the dojo.

96
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:27,681
And please try to
be polite to them.

97
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:33,187
One question, do they sell such
a thing as a paralyzing drug?

98
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:36,649
Now, being polite does
not mean drugging them.

99
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,610
She's definitely her
father's daughter.

100
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,112
I know it seems strange,

101
00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:43,072
but I feel like we
can trust this dojo.

102
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:44,615
If it was actually dangerous,

103
00:06:44,615 --> 00:06:47,284
then I'm sure Kenichi
would have left by now.

104
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:49,870
That's not my take on it.
I think he wants to leave,

105
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,747
but they've said they'll
kill him if he does.

106
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:53,916
But I'll find out one
way or the other.

107
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,167
Just be careful.

108
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,335
Roger!

109
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:59,630
Nobody thought that I would
last for more than three days,

110
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,006
but here I am!

111
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:04,885
I've endured their training
now for a whole month!

112
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:06,804
Willpower!

113
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:08,305
So are you ready to practice?

114
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:11,600
Sure am! Let's do it!

115
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,770
Well, some might think I've
only held on for this long

116
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,398
so I could be close to her.

117
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:19,441
There are a few peculiar
things I've noticed

118
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:21,485
while getting used to the dojo.

119
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:22,611
Apa!

120
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:24,905
Apa! Apa!

121
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:26,115
Apa!

122
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:30,578
These masters never go
a day without training.

123
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:32,037
They never stop...

124
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:34,665
I'm starting to wonder if
they even sleep at night.

125
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:39,378
Hey, Shigure.
Are you going somewhere?

126
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:42,089
Um, no.

127
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:44,258
Some people will just
mysteriously disappear

128
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:46,177
and not return for a few days.

129
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:50,014
Stay sharp, Miu.

130
00:07:50,014 --> 00:07:54,268
Good morning, Sensei.
It's a nice day, huh?

131
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:56,270
And there are a few people

132
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,149
that I just can't figure out
no matter how hard I try.

133
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:03,360
But time after time, this
man has proven himself

134
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,030
to be the most caring and
empathetic of them all.

135
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,283
Alright, Kenichi, it's about
time for some serious training.

136
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:10,826
At least that's what I thought.

137
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:13,537
Um, Akisame sensei...

138
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:15,039
What is this thing?

139
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,749
This device is a
stretching machine

140
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,250
based on my own design.

141
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,502
I call it the
Great Leg Divide.

142
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:21,295
There.

143
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:23,380
I'd love to teach you
how to fight right away,

144
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,049
but first we need
to loosen you up.

145
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:27,760
It's a basic fact,
flexibility is just as crucial

146
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,221
to a martial artist
as his strength.

147
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:33,182
A stiff body is
restricted within itself.

148
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:34,808
And frankly, I've
seen metal pipes

149
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:37,269
with more flexibility than you.

150
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:38,771
To accelerate your flexibility,

151
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:40,773
we'll keep you strapped
in for about a day.

152
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:42,483
Go ahead, Miu, give him a push.

153
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:43,943
Sure!

154
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:45,486
I don't believe this...

155
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:47,863
But I guess it's a little
late to question him.

156
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:49,782
We'll start nice and slow...

157
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:54,119
That's too much,
I can't take it!

158
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:58,207
Oh? If it becomes unbearable,
then call out Ge...

159
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:00,292
This will be our safety
signal to let you out.

160
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:02,503
But the machine is designed
so you can't get out

161
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:04,171
until your legs are fully split.

162
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:06,674
What was the signal?!

163
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:09,301
You said it quiet so I
couldn't hear, didn't you?!

164
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:10,761
What was it?!

165
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:13,681
Alright, Miu, don't let up no
matter how much he screams.

166
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:14,807
No problem!

167
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,809
After this you'll be
able to split your legs

168
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:18,227
a full 180 degrees.

169
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:21,647
And it should only
take 16 hours or so.

170
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:23,941
If it starts to hurt too
much, just let me know,

171
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:25,192
and I'll ease up on it.

172
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:27,403
What do-- What do
you mean if it starts?!

173
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:31,907
More, more!

174
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:34,285
There you go, you got it!

175
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:35,536
Tres bien!

176
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:36,328
Look at you!

177
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:39,498
I'm surprised at how
flexible you are.

178
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:43,085
Torture and ecstasy, no
wonder Kenichi's confused.

179
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:47,506
At this rate you can make
180 degrees in just 13 hours!

180
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,552
How terrible! Those
creeps have my brother

181
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:53,929
strapped into some kind of
medieval torture device!

182
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,015
I've gotta stop 'em!

183
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:57,641
Just a little farther.

184
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:00,394
No no no no, yes yes!

185
00:10:00,394 --> 00:10:02,229
Please don't stop!

186
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:03,439
Wow...

187
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:04,440
Not bad.

188
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,360
Let's try and take it
all the way in one move.

189
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,237
Ge- Geronimo!

190
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:12,865
You leave my brother alone!

191
00:10:16,535 --> 00:10:17,745
Whoops...

192
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:20,623
I-I accidentally slipped, sorry.

193
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:23,751
Am I hearing things or did
he just shout Geronimo?

194
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:24,877
That didn't take long.

195
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:27,022
I'm just surprised he
heard the safety signal.

196
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:33,134
Really? The safety
word was Geronimo?

197
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,510
It's a miracle!

198
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,803
Kenichi!

199
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:36,804
Honoka?!

200
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:42,059
Don't touch, it hurts too much!

201
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,854
Akisame! I think
I broke Kenichi!

202
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:46,814
He should have listened
to me. Oh, well.

203
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,859
This is what he gets for not
taking the full 16 hours.

204
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:50,860
There!

205
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,655
What'd you do that for?!

206
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,700
What? It's not still
hurting, is it?

207
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,203
Hey! How about that!

208
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,706
I have a bonesetter's
clinic in the back.

209
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:06,751
Kensei has an acupuncture
station there as well.

210
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:10,129
I'm a certified professional
when it comes to bone setting.

211
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:11,881
So no matter how many
times you get hurt,

212
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:15,342
I'll just fix you up again.

213
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,637
This man can break me and fix
me like some kind of toy.

214
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,974
What have I gotten
myself into here?

215
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:24,101
What do you think
you're doing to him?

216
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,395
What's this? We have a guest?

217
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,481
Uh, she's, my sister.

218
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,191
What? She's your sister?

219
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:33,277
Oh, wow! She's so adorable!

220
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,820
What?

221
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,909
Awww! You have the same eyes!

222
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,747
Now I get it.

223
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:46,874
Honoka, what are you doing here?

224
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,877
Just stay back and keep quiet!

225
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,129
So, you got your
nails in him, huh?

226
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,340
She looks just like
a little doll.

227
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,300
You're so cute!

228
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,346
Stop right there! Keep
away from my brother!

229
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:03,015
Don't you even realize?

230
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,518
This big-boobed wonder
has totally got you

231
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:07,269
wrapped around
her little finger!

232
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,312
Oh yeah?

233
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,732
Well, I'd like to wrap my
fingers around your neck!

234
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:28,707
She is just too precious!

235
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:32,419
I can't believe this! I thought
Kenichi was in danger,

236
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,339
but it's just this tramp
stringing him along.

237
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,508
What's with the
uh... little kid?

238
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:38,884
Apapapa?

239
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,595
She's Kenichi's younger sister.

240
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,849
Younger sister? Just how young
are we talking exactly?

241
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:47,601
Oh, no! I'm
completely surrounded!

242
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,104
Cutie, what's your name?

243
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,439
Kenichi! Time to go!

244
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:53,023
Hey, wait! Honoka!

245
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,191
Hurry it up!

246
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,991
Are big boobs really
that important to you?!

247
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:04,201
Kenichi! I'm disappointed!

248
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,995
Hey! Quit making
a scene, will you?

249
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:08,038
I don't know what the heck
you're talking about!

250
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,249
I'm here to learn
karate and that's it!

251
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,501
Wow, so this must
be what it's like

252
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,129
to have siblings,
I'm so envious.

253
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:19,425
Hey, you! Top heavy! My mom
wanted you to have this!

254
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:23,762
Top heavy? Well...
Okay, thank you.

255
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:24,972
I'm going home for today!

256
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:28,851
But don't you think I'm
giving up that easily!

257
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,395
I'll be back! Got it?!

258
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,772
Oh no you won't!
You little freak!

259
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:37,943
How sweet. I think she liked
me, she gave me a gift.

260
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,612
Do Apachai smells sponge cake?!

261
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,071
Lucky you.

262
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:44,408
What I wouldn't give to have a
cute little sister like that.

263
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,327
Don't you have
any siblings, Miu?

264
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,663
Actually, I haven't even
met your parents.

265
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,999
Well, I barely knew my parents,

266
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,210
they both passed away
when I was little.

267
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,464
And well, The only family I
have now is my grandfather.

268
00:13:58,464 --> 00:13:59,590
What?

269
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,760
Uh, I've got a lot of
chores to take care of,

270
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,512
so I'll talk to you
later, okay? Bye.

271
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:09,767
Aaa-pa-pa.

272
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:12,144
So were you born without
a heart or did you sell it?

273
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:15,814
What?! No, no, I
had no idea, really!

274
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,441
Please believe me, I
never would've said that!

275
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,194
Oh yeah? Try
telling that to Miu.

276
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,570
Hey, don't say that!

277
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,281
Don't worry, it happened before
she can even remember.

278
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:28,327
It's the thought of memories she
doesn't have that makes her sad.

279
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:32,373
I'm a monster! What have I done?

280
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:38,170
Miu... You're so smart and
beautiful, and always smiling.

281
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,256
And not only are you
talented at martial arts,

282
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:43,133
but you're an amazing
gymnast as well.

283
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,594
But the truth is that you've
hardly been able to enjoy

284
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:48,430
a normal life because
you've been stuck here...

285
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,057
...in this dojo.

286
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,060
You've been forced to cook and
clean for these annoying men

287
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,315
in order to keep this absurd
dojo from falling apart!

288
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,110
And you never experienced
the love of your parents.

289
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,697
You do so much but
you receive so little.

290
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:06,699
Did he say absurd dojo?

291
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:07,992
And annoying men?

292
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:10,911
Oh, poor little Miu.

293
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,748
Miu has lived a rather unusual
life, to say the least.

294
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,876
She spent most of her childhood
traveling with her grandfather,

295
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:21,922
making pilgrimages
throughout the country.

296
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,674
Making pilgrimages?.

297
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,426
You mean she's been
studying martial arts

298
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:26,885
since she was only a child?

299
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:27,845
You got it.

300
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,514
Elder knew her life would be
tough without her parents,

301
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,350
so instead of spoiling her,
he chose to train her

302
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,561
for all of the difficulties
she might have to endure.

303
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,895
That's terrible!

304
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,231
How could I just assume she
was some sort of genius

305
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,608
and not think about
how hard she's worked?

306
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,820
I was too busy feeling
sorry for myself!

307
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,946
I've gotta find her!

308
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,239
Not so fast!

309
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,657
You're still in the
middle of training.

310
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,118
Oh. But!

311
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,537
Apachai, why don't you
take over for the day?

312
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:56,123
Alright! It's
Apachai's turn, now!

313
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:03,130
S'what you get for
calling us annoying.

314
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,305
I'm back. Hello.

315
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,307
Welcome home, Shigure.

316
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,851
You're back sooner than usual.

317
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:19,063
It's none of my business,
but I can't help but wonder--

318
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:24,693
So...

319
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,528
The kid still alive-ish?

320
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,947
Who? Oh. Yes,
he's still kicking.

321
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:32,159
He probably wishes he
was dead, but he's alive.

322
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,369
Oh.

323
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,665
Not the lens!

324
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,294
Apa.

325
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,090
Hey! It's Shigure!

326
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:50,511
Hm... He's not dead after all.

327
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,180
Hey! Apachai! I'm like jelly!

328
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,225
Kenichi! I don't think
bodies move like that!

329
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,227
--You jelly-ized me!
--Oh no, that's scaring me!

330
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:02,940
So, Shigure. Are you
concerned about Kenichi?

331
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,191
No.

332
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:09,822
I really should be grateful to
Kenichi. His arrival has somehow

333
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:12,241
managed to lift everyone's
spirits around here,

334
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:14,076
even Shigure's.

335
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,332
R-really?

336
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,543
You made all of this
by yourself, Miu?

337
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,544
That's great!

338
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:27,089
Stop it! Flattery won't
get you any extra food.

339
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,757
Here! Hope your hungry.

340
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,843
Um, yeah. Thank you so much!

341
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:32,553
But, that's not fair.

342
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,264
You know, come to think
of it, where's Shigure?

343
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:38,642
I don't know why, but Shigure
prefers to eat by herself.

344
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:41,770
She usually eats
up in the attic.

345
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,189
She's kind of
strange, isn't she?

346
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,858
Speak for yourself, Kenichi,

347
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,193
is that how you
always eat your food?

348
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,987
You're hiding it.

349
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:50,821
Well, I...

350
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,489
I guess I've just
seen a few too many

351
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,576
of those old kung fu
movies, y'know?

352
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:56,410
But master!

353
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,037
They'd always say that eating
was also part of the training!

354
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,956
So stay back.

355
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,708
Relax. You can rest assured!

356
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,169
We would never do
such an unseemly thing.

357
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,462
Ah, thank god.

358
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:07,921
I think it's a great idea!

359
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,008
Now you try to take my food!
It's all part of the training!

360
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,974
Only the truly fit
are truly hungry!

361
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,476
Apa-pa-pa-papa!

362
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:21,852
Hey, hey, everybody!

363
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:24,396
Mind your manners and
save some for your elder!

364
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,482
Oh, Grandpa!

365
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:30,611
No! You ate all my dinner!

366
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:37,062
Not, a, bite.

367
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:39,439
And that was Miu's
homecooked meal, too...

368
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:41,024
It's just not fair!

369
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:43,110
And now I have to sleep
on an empty stomach!

370
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,986
How am I supposed
to train like this?!

371
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:46,279
And on top of it all,

372
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,115
I have to sleep on the
floor of the dojo by myself!

373
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:50,784
Sleep tight and pleasant dreams!

374
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:52,911
What?! We're sharing
a bed together?

375
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:56,039
Of course. That's
not a problem, is it?

376
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,250
No, not at all!

377
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,585
I don't mind the slightest
bit, I promise!

378
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:02,712
Why don't we make
ourselves comfortable.

379
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:05,465
That's what I was hoping for,
but it'll never happen.

380
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:07,092
This is reality.

381
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:10,053
But why can't it collide
with fantasy for once?

382
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:11,054
Pst!

383
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:15,016
Miu?!

384
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:15,892
What does she--

385
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:18,395
Here's my chance to collide!

386
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:21,273
Hello, Miu.

387
00:19:21,273 --> 00:19:22,482
What?

388
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:29,364
Huh?

389
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:34,953
Hey, is she trying
to mess with my head?

390
00:19:34,953 --> 00:19:35,453
What...

391
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:38,540
What the heck is going on?

392
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,292
Ta-da!

393
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,335
Akisame told me to
make sure you got fed

394
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:45,297
and not to let anyone else know.

395
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:47,966
He doesn't want you doing any
training on an empty stomach.

396
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:51,595
Wow! Thank you!

397
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:56,099
Y'know, that guy, he's
actually pretty decent, huh?

398
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,559
That goes for everyone else too,

399
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,352
though it might not
always seem like it.

400
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:00,770
They aren't very...

401
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,481
...adept with social skills so
they're a little off sometimes.

402
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:04,190
Here.

403
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,317
--Thanks.
--Sure.

404
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:07,444
Uh, Miu, you know I'm
really sorry about earlier.

405
00:20:07,444 --> 00:20:10,322
Oh, it's nothing
to apologize for.

406
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:12,949
Even though I never really
got to know my parents,

407
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:15,202
everyone here is my family.

408
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:16,286
And look up.

409
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:20,665
How can I be sad with that view?

410
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:23,585
It's almost like I
can touch the moon!

411
00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:25,086
Right, I know!

412
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,550
I think this is my favorite
place in the whole wide world.

413
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,595
I've always dreamed of
bringing a friend up here.

414
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:38,225
Someone to just sit here and
watch the stars with me.

415
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:40,393
Honoka! Honoka!

416
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:43,104
Welcome home, Dad...

417
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:44,940
What's going on?

418
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,108
Tell me! What's
happening at the dojo?

419
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:48,693
It's an evil cult isn't it?

420
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:51,321
No, it's just that big busty--

421
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:54,324
What do you mean?
Who's busted? Kenichi?

422
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:55,784
Huh?

423
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:01,247
Well then, I guess your
dream came true after all.

424
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:02,290
You're right!

425
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,709
And it's just like I
hoped it would be.

426
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:06,711
So tell me what your dream is.

427
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:10,006
Well, it sounds kind of silly,
but, my long-term dream

428
00:21:10,006 --> 00:21:12,592
is to someday become a
novelist and win the Pulitzer.

429
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:14,636
But, my future seems to be

430
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:17,180
headed off in a different
direction than I expected.

431
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,890
No, I'm sure you can!

432
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,141
How about you?

433
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:22,143
Do you have any big
plans for the future?

434
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:23,645
What?

435
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:25,647
Hey, that's a secret!

436
00:21:25,647 --> 00:21:27,440
Oh come on! Tell me!

437
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,985
You can't do that, now I
have to know! Spill it!

438
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:31,152
Why is it such a secret?

439
00:21:31,152 --> 00:21:32,529
It just is, okay?

440
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:34,030
That's really not
fair, you know!

441
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,824
"My dream for the future is...

442
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:36,408
Huh?

443
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:39,786
...to one day get married and
have a big, beautiful wedding."

444
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:44,499
Signed Miu Furinji,
Class 1-D, 8th grade.

445
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:48,503
Gimme that!

446
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:52,674
Aw! That wasn't
very nice, Shigure!

447
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:54,843
Well, that's kind of
a relief to hear.

448
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:57,679
It's good to know at least
Miu's dreams are normal.

449
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:02,642
Kenichi, I'm gonna go
back in from the other side.

450
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:04,728
If my grandfather
catches us together,

451
00:22:04,728 --> 00:22:06,813
he'll kill you and use
you as a punching bag.

452
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:07,939
Huh?

453
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:09,357
I'm not joking.

454
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:12,235
Wait, Kenichi?

455
00:22:12,235 --> 00:22:14,321
What is it?!
Hurry up and tell me.

456
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:16,614
I kinda don't feel
like dying tonight.

457
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:22,620
I hope we can stay good friends
for a very long time, k?

458
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,872
You mean always?

459
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:25,832
Yeah, forever!

460
00:22:25,832 --> 00:22:28,126
So does that mean that we'll
always just be friends

461
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:28,835
no matter what?

462
00:22:28,835 --> 00:22:31,713
Yeah, we'll always
be good friends.

463
00:22:31,713 --> 00:22:34,257
You know, I think
she just told me

464
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:37,177
I'll never have a shot
at being her boyfriend.

465
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:45,810
Well, I think I can live
with that, for now.

466
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:21,948
The Ragnarok gang is after me

467
00:24:21,948 --> 00:24:24,284
and I still don't have the
strength to take them on!

468
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:26,369
I'm just like this flower,
I'll never bloom!

469
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:28,705
Quit crying. If you give
a plant water it'll grow.

470
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:30,206
We just have to
give you something

471
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:31,499
a little more
specific than water.

472
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:33,001
What do you have to give me?

473
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:36,171
Rigorous, painful, nonstop
training of course!

474
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:39,090
But if you give a flower
too much water, it'll spoil!

475
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,010
So maybe too much training
