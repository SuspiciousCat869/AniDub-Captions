1
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:41,925
Apachai's not hiding in here,
this room is empty.

2
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:43,593
Please go away now.

3
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:48,056
Apa!

4
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:51,059
I saw the giant again!
He's hiding in the bathroom!

5
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:52,519
I apologize for her behavior.

6
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,522
It's her first home visit,
and I think she's a bit nervous.

7
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:57,691
Don't worry. Really.

8
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:01,027
Yes, but how about
we put an end to this.

9
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:03,154
Why don't you go ahead
and come clean with me?

10
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:04,656
You're not Miu's
mother, are you?

11
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:06,783
She's clumsy, doesn't
like to be alone,

12
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:08,368
worries about what
other people think,

13
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:11,579
and tends to be scatterbrained,
but she's a really good kid.

14
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:13,289
She was afraid you
wouldn't understand

15
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,499
if she told you the truth.

16
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:18,586
Try not to be too hard on her,
she didn't mean any harm.

17
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:21,339
I caught him, Yasunaga!
I caught the giant!

18
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:23,675
I told you he was real!
I'm not crazy!

19
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:27,929
Kenichi!

20
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:30,056
What's going on here?
Don't tell me you're the one

21
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:31,433
that's been living
together with Miu!

22
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:33,309
No, no, it's not
what you think it is!

23
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:35,186
Yes, where living together, but
we're not "living together"!

24
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:35,729
You idiot!

25
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:38,189
What do you think
"living together" means?!

26
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:47,449
Oh, my. Am I seeing this?

27
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:48,450
Oh, c'mon!

28
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,745
Why did I have
to pick this room?!

29
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:54,539
Uh, are you okay sir?

30
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,541
I've never seen anything
like this before.

31
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,252
As a history teacher, I've
devoted my life to the study

32
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:02,088
and appreciation
of Japanese culture.

33
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:05,216
But this is the most magnificent
collection I've seen.

34
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:10,221
So he isn't living
with Miu, he's merely

35
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:13,349
residing here as a pupil?
I had no idea this was a dojo.

36
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,226
And I never would have
guessed it was the dojo

37
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:16,144
of the grand master.

38
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:18,062
I'm sorry for screaming
and jumping on your back.

39
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:20,231
And I'm sorry for bursting
through walls with you.

40
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,692
Despite the misunderstanding,
it's been an honor.

41
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:24,194
We are honored as well.

42
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:27,614
It's always a privilege to
meet one of Miu's teachers.

43
00:03:27,614 --> 00:03:30,450
Please understand our disciples
were looking out for Miu.

44
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,994
They're a little misguided,
but please forgive them.

45
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:34,537
And Kenichi.

46
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:38,124
I'd noticed that you've
seemed more confident lately,

47
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:41,377
though I couldn't figure out why
But now I think I understand.

48
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:44,047
You've been training to
become a great artist.

49
00:03:44,047 --> 00:03:48,092
I have to admit,
I'm quite impressed!

50
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:50,386
I might as well
let him think that.

51
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:04,609
Thanks for the work-out!
I needed that!

52
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,402
Did you find the
location of our target?

53
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:07,445
Yessir!

54
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:10,907
Excellent! Then the
time has finally come!

55
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:13,326
Ryozanpaku's going down today!

56
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:21,876
Having problems are we, Kenichi?

57
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:24,295
You haven't even landed
a single punch yet!

58
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:25,964
Hey! It's not for
lack of trying!

59
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:27,799
I just can't find any openings!

60
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,509
"Can't find any openings?"

61
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:31,386
Are you even looking
at your opponent?

62
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:33,263
Of course!

63
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:36,432
It's almost impossible to attack
and defend at the same time,

64
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:38,601
even for the greatest
martial arts masters.

65
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,478
Well, don't just stand
there! Do something!

66
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,106
If you don't attack,
you'll never score a point!

67
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:45,149
I can't! You block everything!

68
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:49,279
In a prolonged fight, your
opponent will eventually tire,

69
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,531
let their guard down,
and reveal an opening.

70
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:55,326
Oh, man!

71
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:56,911
An opening! Finally!

72
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:59,539
If I strike her now,
I'll score a point!

73
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:02,876
But, should I? What if I miss?

74
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:09,465
You shouldn't have hesitated!
I was wide open!

75
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:14,929
She's right, you know.
You blew a perfect opportunity.

76
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:16,472
And a real opponent would never

77
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:19,309
make an opening for
you like Miu just did!

78
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:22,395
Wait?! She did it on purpose?!

79
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:24,772
She did it on... purpose.

80
00:05:24,772 --> 00:05:26,024
I never had a shot.

81
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:29,235
She thinks I'm pathetic.
A weenie. A loser.

82
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:31,070
Lower than a dog.

83
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:37,243
This is the worst
stinkin' day of my life!

84
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:40,163
Hey! Why did you
tell him I did that?!

85
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:42,415
For a martial artist,
there's nothing more dangerous

86
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:45,043
than being overconfident
with their ability.

87
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:47,170
Thanks to you, he would have
thought he was stronger

88
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,714
than he really was.

89
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:53,426
Oh, I hope I didn't hurt
Kenichi's feelings too badly.

90
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:54,969
I'm so stupid.

91
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,448
Love these new shoes!

92
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:17,033
See ya later!

93
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,493
Are you going to the dojo?

94
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:19,160
Yep!

95
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,246
Wow!

96
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:24,707
Did someone say "dojo?"
What a coincidence!

97
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:27,627
I've been meaning to stop by
and say hello to the masters!

98
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:28,836
I'll go with you, sweetheart!

99
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:30,463
Ahem, Honey?

100
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:33,549
Is there a reason why you're
wearing a heavy coat...

101
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:34,425
...in summer?

102
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:38,012
What?! Summer?
A-Already? I had no idea!

103
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:40,640
Time sure does fly by
quickly! It seems like

104
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,642
we were celebrating
New Years yesterday!

105
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:44,352
Having some bubbly,
making resolutions,

106
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,688
and bundling ourselves up in
long overcoats to protect us

107
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:49,983
from winter's icy chill!

108
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:52,235
Then what's in your coat?!

109
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:55,196
If you're going, you're
leaving Sebastian here!

110
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:56,698
Gotta go! Bye!

111
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:58,032
Honoka, wait, sweetie!

112
00:06:58,032 --> 00:07:00,326
Don't you need a ride?
Daddy will give you one!

113
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:01,369
Oh, no, you won't!

114
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,787
Uh, thanks, Dad,

115
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:05,915
but I've already got a ride,
and it's a fast one!

116
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:24,350
Apa!

117
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,852
Hey!

118
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:26,811
That was quick!

119
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:28,396
Apachai was over at the park,

120
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:29,939
playing with the
pigeons just now!

121
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:32,191
Get away from my daughter,
you monster!

122
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:37,447
Maximilian, come forth!
Say hello to my little friend!

123
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:40,825
My second favorite
shotgun, Maximillian!

124
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:44,662
Now back away from my
daughter, or you're gonna--

125
00:07:44,662 --> 00:07:45,288
Huh?

126
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:47,874
You have fun, dear! Just be
back by dinner time, okay?

127
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:50,126
Mom, why do you always
treat me like a baby?!

128
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:52,587
All my friends
have later curfews!

129
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:55,381
Let's go!
Hi-yo, Apachai, away!

130
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,386
Mom! You don't worry!

131
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:02,680
Apachai and Honoka will
be back for dinner!

132
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,974
Uh, wh-why thank you.

133
00:08:04,974 --> 00:08:08,519
A-pa!

134
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,314
Apapapapapapa!

135
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:14,192
Pa! Pa!

136
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:16,736
Well, he gives new meaning
to the word "jumpy".

137
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:29,832
Man! It's not enough
I get exhausted in every

138
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:32,794
training session, but almost
every time I go to my room!

139
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:35,171
Why aren't there any stairs
in this part of the dojo?

140
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:36,047
I'll tell you.

141
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:38,091
Oh, uh, Master Koetsuji.

142
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:41,594
One night a few years ago,
Sakaki and Kensei got drunk.

143
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:43,179
What are these things? Stairs?

144
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,640
A true master doesn't need
stairs, do they Kensei?!

145
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,892
No way! Only a weakling
would need stairs!

146
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:50,812
Do we look like weaklings?
Say goodbye, dumb stairs!

147
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:56,067
You'll never darken this
part of our dojo again!

148
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,902
For some reason, they took
out their aggression

149
00:08:57,902 --> 00:09:00,780
on a defenseless flight of
stairs and demolished them.

150
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,115
You don't say.

151
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:04,325
I thought about rebuilding
them, but then I decided

152
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:07,328
that putting a rope here would
provide a much better work-out.

153
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:08,830
Master! Wait!

154
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,874
I need to talk to
you about something!

155
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:12,959
What am I gonna do?

156
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,129
I really need to
talk to someone.

157
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:17,964
It's open. Come on in.

158
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:19,841
I will. Than--

159
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:24,595
Hey, what gives?
This thing's so heavy!

160
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,975
What's all the racket out here?

161
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:33,855
Is there something
I can help you with?

162
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:35,356
And then...

163
00:09:35,356 --> 00:09:37,483
Wait. Let me get this straight.

164
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:40,027
She gave you an opening,
but you still couldn't hit her?

165
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:42,071
Yeah. Do you have any idea why?

166
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:42,864
Ah, nope.

167
00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:45,283
Um, couldn't you at least
give it some thought?

168
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:46,159
Geez kid.

169
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,869
What do I look like,
a shrink or something?

170
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:50,496
Why don't you go annoy Akisame
and see if he can tell you?

171
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:54,041
He's gone. I'd ask Master Ma,
but he's not here, either.

172
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,835
Well, since I'm the
sole voice of wisdom

173
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:59,839
I guess I'll give it a stab.
Ya see there's people out there.

174
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,341
Scared people. Sometimes
they can't attack

175
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:04,802
because they're afraid of their
opponent's counterattack.

176
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:07,305
Say they're lined up to deliver
a finishing blow right,

177
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,807
and they start to wonder "what's
gonna happen me if I miss?"

178
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:10,975
This causes them to hesitate

179
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,352
and instantly puts them
at a disadvantage.

180
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:20,651
That's never been a problem
for me because I don't hesitate.

181
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:23,613
The first opening
I get, I take it.

182
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:25,114
He's right.

183
00:10:25,114 --> 00:10:28,534
Now that I think about it, I was
afraid of her counterattack.

184
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:31,162
Kenichi. A man's worth is
determined by whether or not

185
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:33,539
he can strike a blow
at the critical moment.

186
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:37,293
If he doesn't strike,
he's going to get crushed.

187
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:38,294
Right!

188
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:46,739
Apapapapapa!

189
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:49,158
Apa! Apa!

190
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:51,535
Nice pitch, son! You're
getting really good at this!

191
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:53,120
Now let's see your fast ball.

192
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,000
Huh?

193
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,175
Hey! There's Shigure!

194
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:07,426
Cool!

195
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,930
Here it comes!

196
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:13,808
Do you wanna play with us?

197
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,267
Uh, sure.

198
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:17,436
Come on! Let's
see that fastball!

199
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:19,980
So, what game should
we play today? Any ideas?

200
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,273
Let's play cards!

201
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:22,733
Oh no!

202
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:25,569
Dad! Did you see that tall
man jump from the sky?

203
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:27,530
Son, if you keep
imagining things,

204
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,448
you're gonna have to
back to the psychiatrist.

205
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:32,368
There was a lady with a
mouse on her head, too!

206
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,206
A man's worth is determined
by whether or not

207
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,542
he can strike a blow
at the critical moment.

208
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,044
If he doesn't stike,
he's crushed.

209
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:46,841
Since I didn't strike
because I was afraid

210
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:51,804
of Miu's counterattack,
I must be totally worthless.

211
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:54,056
Why do I have to
be such a loser?

212
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:56,559
Open up in there!

213
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,977
I said open up!

214
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,813
Who could that be?

215
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:03,983
Now!

216
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:10,364
We're here to see
this dojo's masters!

217
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:20,207
Uh, can I tell them
who's calling, sir?

218
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,544
Tell them Shiken
Odori dojo's here.

219
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,296
And its master...

220
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:30,801
The great and terrible
Gonzai Kumatori!

221
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:31,927
And...

222
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:33,721
...your reason
for coming? Sir?

223
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:36,182
Oh, that's a simple one, boy!

224
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:39,685
We've come to challenge
Ryozanpaku and take its sign!

225
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:59,705
Miu! Miu! Where are you?
We've got big trouble!

226
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:02,666
Some guys are here
to challenge the dojo!

227
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,085
Really? Cool. No problem.

228
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,922
Whaddya mean no problem?
There's a big, scary,

229
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:10,049
musclebound guy in
Kabuki makeup out there,

230
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:12,384
and he's got henchmen
with him, too!

231
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:14,303
So it's a big group
of people then?

232
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:16,597
In that case, I'd better go
let them inside right away.

233
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:17,932
What?! Are you crazy?

234
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:21,060
We need some help now.
Hey wait! Master Sakaki!

235
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,312
Oh, he just left a few
minutes ago to buy some beer.

236
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:26,941
What?! Then we'll just get
one of the other masters,

237
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:28,067
like Apachai or Shigure!

238
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,110
Well actually, they're
not here, either.

239
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,488
They're on a playdate with
your cute little sister.

240
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:34,698
Akisame's busy at
his bone clinic...

241
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:36,408
Kensei's doing acupuncture...

242
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:38,452
And Grandpa's travelling
on business today.

243
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:40,120
Talk about your
busy schedules!

244
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,332
Looks like you and I are the
only ones home right now!

245
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:45,960
Are you kidding me? How come
they're always around when

246
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,462
you don't need them, but when
you do need them, they're gone!

247
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:49,129
It's not fair!

248
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,216
Come on! It's not polite
to leave guests waiting!

249
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,844
Please have some tea! I insist!

250
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:59,556
Master, no! Don't drink it!
She might've poisoned it!

251
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:13,988
No tea?

252
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:16,740
The only thing we're interested
in brewing is a fight!

253
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,784
You can dispense with
the pleasantries, girl!

254
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:21,036
We didn't come here
for a social visit!

255
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:22,663
Very well then, sir.

256
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,873
First, I'll need you to write
down your name, address,

257
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:26,792
and fighting style
in our register.

258
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:29,211
Then you'll need to read
and agree to this disclaimer

259
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:31,130
per our Elder's instructions.

260
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:34,967
Wha--

261
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,593
It says here that
each challenger

262
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:38,971
must pay a fee
of 10,000 yen!

263
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:41,348
Yes, and that's
10,000 per person.

264
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,767
If you all pay, you get
to attack us as a group!

265
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:44,768
Pay you?!

266
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,562
Are you nuts? Why, I oughta--

267
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:47,438
Stand down!

268
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:48,188
But, Master...

269
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:51,108
No, it's fine.

270
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:53,569
Thank you for your
business, sir! So, all of you

271
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:55,904
will be attacking us as a
group then, am I correct?

272
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:58,240
No, I will be the
sole challenger.

273
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,450
Huh?

274
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,202
There are many strong
fighters here at Ryozanpaku.

275
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,496
However, as a karate master,
it's only fitting

276
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:07,041
that I challenge this
dojo's karate master.

277
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,208
Therefore I demand to fight

278
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:12,463
the 100th degree street
fighter himself, Shio Sakaki!

279
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:14,048
Master Sakaki?!

280
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:15,924
Sorry, he's not
here right now.

281
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:17,676
The other masters
aren't either.

282
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:22,556
So then by default, you'll
just have to fight with me!

283
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,516
If that's alright, it'll
just take me a minute

284
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:27,686
to go get changed. Wait here
and I'll be back in a jiffy!

285
00:15:27,686 --> 00:15:31,815
How dare you?!
You insolent little brat!

286
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:35,402
I came here to fight a master,
not some little girl!

287
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,904
What an insult!

288
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:39,573
No one mocks me like this
and gets away with it!

289
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:42,576
I'm going to make
you pay dearly!

290
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:45,245
Stop it!

291
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,623
So you want to play hide
and seek, eh, Sakaki?!

292
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:50,542
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

293
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:01,220
Get away from her!

294
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,763
Do it! Now!

295
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:03,388
What the--

296
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:05,057
It's that puny kid from before!

297
00:16:05,057 --> 00:16:07,017
What is this?
Some kinda joke?!

298
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:08,894
You shut up!

299
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:12,856
I'm First Disciple of
Ryozanpaku! Kenichi Shirahama!

300
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:15,400
And if any of you
lay a finger on her,

301
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,903
you're gonna have to
answer to me, got it?

302
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:22,991
That goes for you most
of all, Mr. Crab Head!

303
00:16:22,991 --> 00:16:24,701
What? Crab Head?

304
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:26,685
Kenichi, get out of here!

305
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:32,232
That's twice now
I've been insulted!

306
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:34,901
It's time I taught you
little whelps a lesson!

307
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:37,237
You there! Bring
the bats out now!

308
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:38,447
Yes, sir!

309
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:44,244
See that? I'm gonna do
the same thing to you

310
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:45,746
I did to those bats!

311
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:47,706
Eep! Not good!

312
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,709
Ha! In the Shiken Odori
style, we forge our bodies

313
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,045
until they're tougher than
the hardest steel, punk!

314
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,589
Ha, ha! So are you
scared yet, kid?

315
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:58,216
You should be 'cause you're
going up against the master!

316
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:00,594
This is gonna be good!

317
00:17:00,594 --> 00:17:02,554
Kenichi, let me handle this!

318
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:03,930
No, Miu! You stay back!

319
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,556
Huh?

320
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,932
I may not look like much,

321
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:07,934
But I'm First Disciple
of Ryozanpaku!

322
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:08,810
No, don't!

323
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,438
Die!

324
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,148
I see it!

325
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:14,858
It must be because I
deal with the masters'

326
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:17,110
superhuman speed every day!

327
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,654
But...

328
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:20,489
Being able to see it and
being able to dodge it

329
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,532
are two different things!

330
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,453
Oh, no! Kenichi!

331
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:30,666
Oh, man, this is bad!

332
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,417
My body can't keep up
with my eyes yet!

333
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:35,003
Well, boy. Have you
had enough yet?

334
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:37,255
You're not so mouthy
anymore, are you?

335
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:40,592
I guess Ryozanpaku's not
all it's cooked up to be.

336
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,386
All this time, it's
been called a legend

337
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:46,473
when it's really just a joke.
A bad one at that, too.

338
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:49,309
The masters here are idiots if
they chose a weakling like you

339
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:50,268
to be First Disciple.

340
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,269
Masters...

341
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:54,690
Hmph! And Sakaki's
legendary reputation!

342
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,776
It's probably exaggerated and
overblown as well to scare off

343
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,986
any real challengers
who might come along.

344
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:02,656
Speaking of challengers,
if there aren't any real ones

345
00:18:02,656 --> 00:18:05,575
here for me to fight, we'll take
that sign and be on our way.

346
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:08,078
Hey, didn't you hear me before?
I said I'd fight you!

347
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:09,621
Cr-Crab Head!

348
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:13,458
You want a real challenge?

349
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,420
Fine, you've got one.

350
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,755
From me!

351
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:22,342
The First Disciple
of Ryozanpaku!

352
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,054
Hm. Managed to get up
after my kick, eh?

353
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:29,182
A weakling like you?
I'm actually impressed.

354
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:30,225
Must be dumb luck.

355
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:32,519
Heh Heh! Nope,
just good training!

356
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,438
All the masters here
have taught me well!

357
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:36,815
No. Not well enough obviously.

358
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,359
If think you can survive
another hit from me, kid,

359
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,569
you're crazy.

360
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:43,363
But since you have a
death wish, so be it.

361
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:46,158
In fact, I'll even let you
take the first punch.

362
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,994
It'll have no effect then you'll
realize how weak you are,

363
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,662
and that's when I
deliver the killing blow!

364
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,205
K-killing blow?!

365
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:55,417
Well, what are you waiting for?
Come on, kid, strike him!

366
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:58,003
Hah! I bet he's too
scared to do anything!

367
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:02,591
I'd be, too, 'cause the master's
counterattack'll kill him!

368
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,468
Oh, Kenichi...

369
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:15,645
This isn't good!

370
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:19,107
He's cracking under
the pressure!

371
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:21,318
Sometimes they're afraid to
attack 'cause they're afraid

372
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:23,236
of their opponent's
counterattack.

373
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:29,659
So you're not only a weakling,
but a coward, too, huh?

374
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:36,666
Huh?!

375
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,292
What the?!

376
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,418
He hit him?!

377
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:40,837
Kenichi saw an
opening and took it!

378
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:59,439
Master! Are you hurt?

379
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:02,067
Y-you sneaky little
snot-nosed punk!

380
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,985
You waited and struck
me right at the moment

381
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:05,654
I relaxed my stomach muscles!

382
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:08,490
Brilliant! One might be able
to strengthen their body

383
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,617
until it's as hard as steel,
but that means nothing

384
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:12,536
if they get struck when
their muscles are relaxed!

385
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:14,246
Kenichi, you're a genius!

386
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,917
Kenichi. A man's worth is
determined by whether or not

387
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,169
he can strike a blow
at the critical moment.

388
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,841
Time to die, punk!

389
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:34,641
Hey, buddy?

390
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:36,726
I heard you wanted
to challenge a master,

391
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:39,521
so why are you messin'
with our disciple?

392
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:42,399
Master! Th-that's
him! That's the guy!

393
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:43,692
The famous street fighter!

394
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:45,193
Yeah, that's Shio Sakaki!

395
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:46,653
You're Sakaki?!

396
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:49,406
Sure am. Now how
'bout that challenge.

397
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:51,783
L-let go! You're crushing
the bones in my wrist!

398
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:52,993
Hey, Kenichi.

399
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:55,328
I've been watching you take
care of our guests here.

400
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:58,373
That was a nice strike.
You barely hesitated at all.

401
00:20:58,373 --> 00:21:01,668
Y-you mean you were here and
were watching this whole time?!

402
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:05,755
C'mon get a grip, it's okay!
You handled it perfectly!

403
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:07,507
So, Crab Head.

404
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:13,013
You helped our Disciple
learn a valuable lesson,

405
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:16,224
but now it's time for you
and your friends to go.

406
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:33,158
Ow! Kenichi, let go!
You're grabbing me too tight!

407
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,618
I can't breathe.
You're smashing my--

408
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:37,329
Geez. It's not
over already, is it?

409
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,873
Oh, man, you gotta
be kidding me.

410
00:21:39,873 --> 00:21:42,834
And I thought Crab Head guy
was a ferocious fighter!

411
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:48,298
Master Sakaki makes him look
like a choir boy in comparison!

412
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:50,842
These guys have gotta be the
lamest bunch of challengers

413
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,761
I've ever faced in this dojo!

414
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:55,055
Apachai, when are we
gonna play some more?

415
00:21:55,055 --> 00:21:57,891
Apa! After I do a
favor for Sakaki!

416
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:00,685
He asked me to take all these
people to Akisame's clinic!

417
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:02,145
We'll play when I'm done, okay?

418
00:22:02,145 --> 00:22:03,438
Okay.

419
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:06,316
Apachai, why are all
these guys asleep?

420
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:07,943
What's wrong? Are they
sick or something?

421
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:09,778
Sakaki put them to sleep
because they have

422
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:12,072
lots of broken bones that
have to be reset.

423
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:14,199
It won't hurt if it's done
when they're asleep.

424
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,450
The only thing that will hurt,

425
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,118
is that Akisame is
going to charge them.

426
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:19,621
I get it. An arm
and a leg, right?

427
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,543
You're getting extra sake
thanks to what we made today!

428
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,754
Alright! Nice haul, huh?

429
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:31,216
And for your part,

430
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,926
you're getting an extra
special side dish!

431
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:34,844
You better guard your
plate good, kid!

432
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:38,056
All this butt kicking today
has made me hungry!

433
00:22:40,684 --> 00:22:41,893
See ya!

434
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:46,481
So the dojo makes money
by taking on challengers

435
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:48,858
who pay to fight?
And then makes even more

436
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:51,278
by sending them
to Akisame's clinic?

437
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:52,988
Oh, man...

438
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:22,285
Hey, Miu! Drop what
you're doing! I've got big news!

439
00:24:22,285 --> 00:24:23,620
We're all going to the beach!

440
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,330
To the beach? Wow, really?!

441
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,207
Yeah! The masters said
they're gonna take us!

442
00:24:27,207 --> 00:24:29,501
In that case, I better go
buy a new swimsuit then!

443
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,377
The one from last year
has gotten too tight!

444
00:24:31,377 --> 00:24:32,921
Huh? Too tight?

445
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,465
Oh, wow. Y-you mean you've, um,

446
00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:38,426
filled out more in certain areas
over the last few months?

447
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:39,969
Oh, thank you, God!

448
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:42,555
Ah! Kenichi, your
nose is bleeding!

449
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:45,350
And you're starting to pass
out, too! What's going on?

450
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,559
Say something!

451
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,686
I can't wait to go to the beach!
