[Music]

2
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,828
So here I am,
deep in the mountains

3
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:47,789
where the Elder took
me to "train."

4
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,874
And I'm in really,
really big trouble...

5
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,544
This is probably where
I am going to die.

6
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:58,967
This is a huge gamble...

7
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:00,176
If Kenichi can
make it back

8
00:02:00,176 --> 00:02:01,928
out of the Dark
Valley intact.

9
00:02:01,928 --> 00:02:03,304
Then he will continue
to grow in strength

10
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:06,224
and technique as a
martial artist...

11
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:08,476
However... if he
gets too lost...

12
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:12,981
the Kenichi we know
will disappear...

13
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:14,691
forever.

14
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:18,069
How you feeling?

15
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:21,656
Good. I'm glad
you're awake...

16
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:23,116
You think you can
choke some food down?

17
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:24,450
Food!

18
00:02:28,746 --> 00:02:29,789
Well, I guess you're
in better shape

19
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:31,958
than I thought, huh?

20
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,501
More!

21
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:36,004
Sure thing.

22
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:40,174
So what are you doing in
these mountains, friend?

23
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:42,927
A mean old man brought me here
for martial arts training.

24
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:44,804
Martial arts?

25
00:02:44,804 --> 00:02:46,723
Forgive me but you're
a martial artist?

26
00:02:46,723 --> 00:02:49,392
I am disciple, yeah.

27
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:52,353
You're quite the enigma,
you know that kid?

28
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:53,980
I forgot to ask...

29
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,690
So who are you, anyway?

30
00:02:57,316 --> 00:02:59,277
Whoa. Are you a sculptor?

31
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:03,322
I guess you can say that.

32
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:05,033
Well whoever you
are, thanks...

33
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,909
I think you
saved my life...

34
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:09,287
Oh. I'm Kenichi
Shirahama, by the way.

35
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:11,330
Nice to meet you.

36
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,791
And my name is Ogata
Ee-sheen-sai...

37
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,335
I think maybe you
should hang out with me

38
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:18,296
until this man who's looking
for you works his way here...

39
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:21,549
These mountains can be a
little dangerous sometimes.

40
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,301
You're so nice!

41
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:24,510
Allllright.

42
00:03:27,722 --> 00:03:29,390
This guy saved me
from total disaster

43
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,017
and almost certain death...

44
00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:32,852
Ogata Ee-sheen-sai...

45
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:35,313
He's like 20 times
cooler than the Elder!

46
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:40,485
Okay. So you had a fight with
your childhood friend...

47
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:42,320
Ryuto Asamiya,
that's right,

48
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,821
and he kinda
kicked my butt...

49
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:45,156
But the worst part
is that he took

50
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:46,449
something important to me.

51
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:48,201
And now I need
a rematch...

52
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:49,577
So that I can beat
him this time...

53
00:03:49,577 --> 00:03:50,995
and win the thing back.

54
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:52,747
What is this
important thing?

55
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:54,832
-A badge!
-Hold on... a badge?? !

56
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:57,460
Yes! And I get pissed off
just thinking about it...

57
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,003
Really... Pissed... Off!!

58
00:04:00,963 --> 00:04:02,799
Sorry, that was
the last one.

59
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,050
Seriously? We're done?

60
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,384
I was just getting' goin.'

61
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:07,303
Yeah, I could see that...

62
00:04:07,303 --> 00:04:09,639
But I really shouldn't have
my guest working anyway.

63
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,932
Hey, you saved my life!

64
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:13,184
Chopping some firewood
is the least I can do...

65
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,352
And besides...

66
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:15,478
The Elder says I'm not
allowed to practice

67
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:17,855
martial arts for
an entire week...

68
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:20,775
I have to do something
or I'll go crazy!

69
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,444
I hope there aren't any bad
kids doing martial arts...

70
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:25,363
Good children listen
to their masters!

71
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:30,743
-Ogata!
-Uh... what's up??

72
00:04:30,743 --> 00:04:32,203
Please give me
more work to do.

73
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:33,454
Anything. I don't care.

74
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:34,914
Well, whatever you say...

75
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:36,874
If you really want
something to do that badly,

76
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:38,584
you could get me some
water from the river.

77
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:40,503
Get some water?

78
00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:42,755
Here I go!!

79
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:44,966
Um, Kenichi? The
river's back that way.

80
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:54,100
Jeez, he's like an arsenal
of fireworks, that one...

81
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,061
I wonder what this
master of his is like.

82
00:04:57,061 --> 00:05:00,648
Wait... The Kenichi that
we know will disappear?

83
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:02,859
What is that
supposed to mean?

84
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:04,569
There are essentially two
types of martial artists

85
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,279
in this world.

86
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,738
Those who remain
calm in a fight

87
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:09,490
and rely on talent
and training...

88
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,867
And those who
lose control...

89
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:13,327
Forget all their
training in their rage...

90
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:14,745
Yeah, we know, so??

91
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:16,664
Kenichi is at a
crossroads now,

92
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:19,375
as to which of these types of
fighter he will become...

93
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,751
He has a choice to make.

94
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:21,919
Hey! Hey! Hey...

95
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,129
That's bad.

96
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:24,881
Apachai does not want
Kenichi to become fighter

97
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:26,174
who cuts limit ...

98
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:28,801
I do not know how to
say, but is dangerous.

99
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:30,469
Yes... I understand
what you mean,

100
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:31,846
and I think you're right...

101
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:33,598
But I'm afraid he must
come to that conclusion

102
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:36,058
on his own or it won't
mean anything to him.

103
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:37,351
This is worrisome...

104
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:38,686
There are medicines in
China that can help

105
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:40,396
you release your limit...

106
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:43,149
they make it hard for your body
to gage the danger it's in.

107
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:45,651
This medicine works by
releasing adrenaline...

108
00:05:45,651 --> 00:05:47,069
But it's dangerous even
when administered

109
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:48,613
by a professional...

110
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:50,573
And if used incorrectly,
the fighter becomes

111
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:53,284
an unstoppable
killing machine.

112
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:55,328
You think Grandpa took
Kenichi to the forest

113
00:05:55,328 --> 00:05:56,787
to give him that
medicine?? !

114
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,581
No, the Elder would
never do that...

115
00:05:58,581 --> 00:05:59,916
However...

116
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:03,169
He might have something
just as dangerous in mind.

117
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:05,004
Kenichi...

118
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:15,431
It must be the Elder.

119
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:19,685
Of course! He's spying
on me to make sure

120
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:22,605
I'm not using any
martial arts!

121
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:24,398
Man, he's such a jerk...

122
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:26,025
He drags me out to
this no-man's-land,

123
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:29,362
then abandons me to fend
for myself with no food.

124
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:31,405
Try to take it
from me, go ahead.

125
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:36,827
Alright, you wanna see the fury
of a man deprived of food?

126
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:38,412
You got it.

127
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:40,623
Gosh, it sure feels
weird not practicing!

128
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:43,334
No matter how
good you are,

129
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:44,585
you can't be psychic...

130
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:46,128
I'll just act natural...

131
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:50,258
It's too bad I can't
train right now...

132
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:51,175
Cause if I could...

133
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:54,637
Ha! I got ya!

134
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:56,180
How does it feel...

135
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,598
You like that...

136
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:58,724
Hold on a minute.

137
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:01,310
That's...

138
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,062
not... him...

139
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:03,729
Unless, uh...

140
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:05,356
You did something different
with your hair...

141
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,195
Why is that bear so big? !

142
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:12,947
According to The Daigakukan
Wild Animal program,

143
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:15,950
it should be
about half that size!

144
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,326
He's still chasing me!

145
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:18,953
And he's fast!

146
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:22,123
The Asiatic Black Bear can
run 37 miles per hour...

147
00:07:22,123 --> 00:07:24,709
so never be stupid enough
to think you can outrun it.

148
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:25,876
Running is bad.

149
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:27,169
'Kay!

150
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:33,592
Now he's even madder!

151
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:36,887
Never throw anything
at a bear...

152
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:39,181
He will be more angry and
more likely to eat you.

153
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:40,850
'Kay.

154
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,356
He's still coming!

155
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:50,693
Don't forget, the Asiatic Black
Bear is an expert tree climber!

156
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:51,944
'Kay!

157
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,785
This is bad. I can't move.

158
00:07:59,785 --> 00:08:01,620
Wait, I know, I'll
just play dead!

159
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:04,999
Hungry bears have
been known to eat

160
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:06,792
the corpses of dead animals...

161
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,753
So playing dead is
probably not a good idea.

162
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:12,048
Listen bear!

163
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:13,549
I'm not going down without
a fight! You hear me?

164
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,137
I'm dead!

165
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:21,599
Elder!

166
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:24,727
Wait, you're not him.

167
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:31,025
Well if that's not it then
just tell us what he's doing!

168
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:32,360
I see.

169
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,694
It's him.

170
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:34,987
I believe so.

171
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:37,198
Before Sakaki and
Apachai came here...

172
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:39,492
when Miu was
just a girl...

173
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:42,244
Ryouzanpaku had
a disciple...

174
00:08:42,244 --> 00:08:44,121
You see, Kenichi is
not this dojo's first

175
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,581
student of the martial arts.

176
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,626
His name...

177
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:50,544
was Ogata Iishinsai.

178
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:52,129
Countdown... palm!

179
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:56,801
And so the time has come.

180
00:09:09,188 --> 00:09:10,648
He's amazing...

181
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:12,692
I can't believe
it's the same Ogata!

182
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:15,069
Um... I guess you
saved me again...

183
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,570
Thanks a lot!

184
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:20,032
What's he doing?

185
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,123
Ogata...

186
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:28,749
I think... the bear's dead.

187
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:34,171
That's enough! Cut it out!

188
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:39,468
I'm sorry about that...

189
00:09:39,468 --> 00:09:40,720
I didn't mean
to scare you.

190
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:43,806
My God...

191
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:46,225
Who is this guy??

192
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:49,061
Ogata Iishinsai -...

193
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:50,938
I never knew there was
another disciple of

194
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:53,816
Ryouzanpaku
before Kenichi.

195
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:56,777
He was a student that
Kensei and I accepted...

196
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:59,405
against the Elder's
recommendation.

197
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:02,867
There's something dangerous
in this young man's eyes.

198
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,785
And he was right.

199
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:06,745
The Elder saw Ogata's
true nature before

200
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:08,748
either of us
figured it out...

201
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:11,417
and soon after he was
expelled from Ryouzanpaku...

202
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:12,668
we heard he'd been
disqualified

203
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:13,919
in the middle of
a tournament,

204
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,755
due to an accident.

205
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:17,590
He killed his opponent.

206
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:22,344
Then Kenichi is in danger.

207
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:26,265
Please, both of
you, calm down.

208
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:28,213
We must have faith in
the Elder's judgment.

209
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:35,190
I didn't mean to hide the fact
that I'm a martial artist...

210
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,442
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you before...

211
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:38,610
Actually, that's one
of the reason's

212
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,321
I'm here in the Dark Valley.

213
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,323
I can't believe he's
a martial artist...

214
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:45,158
What are the odds?

215
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:47,411
-You listening?
-Oh uh, yeah?

216
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:48,829
So you're out here
in the mountains

217
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:50,706
to do some training
on your own?

218
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:52,541
Yeah. Something like
that, anyway...

219
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,294
You know, you're a pretty
interesting specimen, Kenichi.

220
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:57,337
Me... I'm not interesting.

221
00:10:57,337 --> 00:10:58,463
Sure you are.

222
00:10:58,463 --> 00:10:59,548
I mean, look at you...

223
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:01,425
You have the basics down-
it's like a blueprint

224
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:03,302
for the fighter you
might one day become.

225
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:04,511
Blueprint?

226
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:06,805
I want you to picture what
I'm about to describe...

227
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:07,931
Can you do that
for me, Kenichi?

228
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:09,433
Kay.

229
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:13,645
You're walking in
an empty field.

230
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:16,231
And suddenly you come
upon a huge castle.

231
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:17,691
Only it has no walls.

232
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:19,443
No roof. It's
just a framework.

233
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:20,903
Wouldn't you be surprised?

234
00:11:20,903 --> 00:11:22,779
Yeah, I guess I would.

235
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:23,905
Well that's what
it's like for me,

236
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:25,032
meeting you in this forest

237
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:26,908
and knowing what
you might become.

238
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,452
Now I don't know
who this master is

239
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:30,078
you've been training with...

240
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:32,039
But he's building a great
framework inside you.

241
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,790
He is?

242
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,125
Kenichi.

243
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,335
Yeah?

244
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:38,128
I'd like for you to
become my disciple.

245
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:39,504
What?

246
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:01,526
That's great... Kenichi's
at a crossroads

247
00:12:01,526 --> 00:12:02,986
and where does he take him...

248
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:04,988
To a damn aSURa master...

249
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:07,616
What the hell is that
idiot old geezer thinking?

250
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:11,203
The Elder took him there
because he's at a crossroads.

251
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:14,206
Just because a martial artist
is of an excitable nature...

252
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:15,540
doesn't mean that
they are destined

253
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,668
to follow the path of Asura.

254
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:19,127
You yourself
are that type.

255
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:20,295
And Apachai...

256
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:22,673
but both of you chose
a different path.

257
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:24,341
Because...

258
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:26,593
You are both men of
great character...

259
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:29,096
and you control the
power within you...

260
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:31,723
You found a way to control
your incredible strength.

261
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:34,685
-Oh, well...
-But...

262
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:36,812
Kenichi was deeply
affected by the loss

263
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:39,231
he suffered at the hands of
his childhood friend...

264
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:40,941
the First Fist...

265
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:45,028
He is now concentrating on his
training solely to gain power.

266
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:47,114
It's a dangerous mind-set
for him to be in.

267
00:12:51,618 --> 00:12:53,161
Which is why he's there...

268
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:54,705
The Elder wanted to
show him someone

269
00:12:54,705 --> 00:12:56,790
who had chosen the
path of Asura...

270
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,542
He wants him to see
with his own eyes

271
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,419
what he could easily become.

272
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:02,045
Seems like a pretty
big gamble for some

273
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:03,839
self-reflection
if you ask me.

274
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,550
The next card I draw will
show us Kenichi's fate...

275
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,677
Ah... Okay, it is a joker...

276
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:11,388
But I don't know
what that means.

277
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:13,682
Your... disciple?

278
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:15,976
I can give you all of the tools
you will need to beat him...

279
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:17,519
this boy...

280
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,104
this enemy of yours
who took something

281
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:22,023
so important from you the
last time the two of you met.

282
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:23,233
Yeah?

283
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:24,943
Without a doubt.

284
00:13:26,695 --> 00:13:28,697
This master of
yours was stingy...

285
00:13:28,697 --> 00:13:30,198
Looks like he's been
holding you back a bit...

286
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:33,785
Either that or he
underestimated your abilities.

287
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:36,997
Yeah... You're so right!

288
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:39,458
Wow! I can't believe you're
saying this stuff...

289
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,294
They're not big
on praising, see.

290
00:13:42,294 --> 00:13:45,005
So! Let's try, huh.

291
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:46,798
We'll unlock the true
potential inside you.

292
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:51,303
My true... potential??

293
00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:54,973
Yes... You will learn to
make sacrifices in battle,

294
00:13:54,973 --> 00:13:57,601
as long as you gain experience
from your opponents.

295
00:13:59,686 --> 00:14:01,855
In martial arts...

296
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:03,231
The emphasis of your
training should be

297
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:06,401
on destroying your
enemy no matter what.

298
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:08,487
That's why it's called...

299
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:11,573
The art of killing!

300
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:13,533
I'll teach you
everything I know...

301
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,118
Until you've
learned it all...

302
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:18,038
I'll teach you how to
kill your fiercest enemy.

303
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:19,831
Someday, there will be
no one in the world

304
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:21,208
who can defeat you...

305
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,335
You will be the
strongest man in history.

306
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:27,756
You... really think so.....?...

307
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:29,925
I could be the strongest
man in history?

308
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:31,301
That's right.

309
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:33,970
All you need is the
right kind of training.

310
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,140
I know it's up to Kenichi
where he'll go from here.

311
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,225
But I can't
help worrying

312
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:39,810
that he'll end up
like my brother...

313
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,853
There was a point in
Sougetsu's life

314
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:44,481
when he came up against
this very decision.

315
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:46,733
So that's what Akisame
was talking about

316
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:49,361
when he said the Kenichi
we knew would disappear.

317
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:56,201
Oh, please be safe...
And come back home to us!

318
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,913
Suppose... this
great plan fails...

319
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:01,665
Do you think the old
man ever once stopped

320
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:04,084
to consider that??

321
00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:05,293
I'm sure he did.

322
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,546
If I know the Elder
I'm sure he considered

323
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:09,506
every possible outcome...

324
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:11,258
And he'll have a
backup plan in place,

325
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:13,969
should Kenichi stray too far
from the path of righteousness

326
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:15,595
and need a guiding
hand to pull him back.

327
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:20,851
What do I do, if he fails?

328
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:25,021
I ask you again...

329
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:27,315
Say you'll become
my disciple...

330
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:28,692
Kenichi Shirahama.

331
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,283
Sorry I can't do that.

332
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:39,161
But... But why??

333
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:41,204
Don't you want to be
a martial artist??

334
00:15:41,204 --> 00:15:42,330
I do!

335
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,791
But I want to be one
to protect people...

336
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:45,876
My friends...

337
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:47,294
And anyone else who
needs someone to fight

338
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:48,628
for a good cause.

339
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:50,088
So...

340
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:51,965
I don't really need to
learn how to kill people.

341
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:53,258
You know??

342
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,470
You sound like the person
I hate more than anyone

343
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,181
in the world when
you talk like that.

344
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:03,184
His eyes look like
they did before...

345
00:16:03,184 --> 00:16:05,812
Like a demon's
possessing him.

346
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:08,148
My legs are shaking...

347
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:09,524
He's scarier looking
than Ryuto

348
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:11,902
when I fought him
in the park...

349
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:13,612
He's scarier
than my masters,

350
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:15,780
and that's saying something!

351
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,116
Who is this guy... ..?

352
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:21,328
What is he doing up here
in the mountains all alone?

353
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:23,830
It's been said that
Miyamoto Musashi mourned

354
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,832
the death of his soldiers
by endlessly sculpting

355
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:27,667
the Buddha in his temple...

356
00:16:30,128 --> 00:16:32,589
Not me...

357
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,175
To me, sculpting
is just a hobby.

358
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:36,551
No...

359
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:38,428
It can't be...

360
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:39,721
Well, that's too bad...

361
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:41,473
you're pretty sure, huh??

362
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:43,725
Fine... so be it then.

363
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:45,018
Yeah...

364
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:46,519
But please don't feel bad!

365
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,146
It's the Elder, see...

366
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:49,522
He told me "No
martial arts!"...

367
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:50,732
It's dumb...

368
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:52,025
but what am I gonna do... ..?

369
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:53,777
He can be really scary!

370
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:56,947
Fine... You wanna
practice, do you, boy?

371
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:58,740
Then practice flying!

372
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,116
Ssorry, but I
think I'd go crazy

373
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:02,786
if I with another
master threatening me!

374
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:05,246
You were thinking I'd let you
stay on with your old master

375
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:06,831
and just share
you with him?

376
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:09,793
You mean, that
wasn't the plan?

377
00:17:09,793 --> 00:17:11,628
You definitely don't
want to take me on...

378
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:13,588
See I already have
five masters,

379
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:15,340
in addition to the old man!

380
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,217
Five?

381
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:18,885
Um, hey...

382
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:20,303
Are you okay??

383
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,348
What's up?? !

384
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:35,110
Listen to me, Kenichi.

385
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,319
Yes, sir.

386
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,862
Unfortunately it would
seems that our paths

387
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:40,657
were meant to cross
only this one time.

388
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:42,701
Why.....?... I
only just met you,

389
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:45,203
I feel like there's so
much more to talk about...

390
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:48,456
I don't want to have to say
goodbye to you right now...

391
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:50,750
Just because I have to
go back to my master...

392
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,294
doesn't mean we
can't be friends.

393
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:54,462
I'm sorry...

394
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:55,672
But I'm afraid
that's exactly

395
00:17:55,672 --> 00:17:57,465
what it does mean...

396
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:59,342
You have to walk
your own path.

397
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:02,679
Oh! By the way...

398
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,473
The place where this master
of yours set up camp...

399
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:07,434
I just might
know where it is.

400
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:10,145
Really, that's great.

401
00:18:10,145 --> 00:18:11,855
You're saving me again!

402
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:20,040
Ahhh...

403
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,502
It looks like the stormy
weather is past us now...

404
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,714
What's this?

405
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:30,842
That's bear meet.

406
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,768
Ho ho, buh-bye now,
I'll see you later!

407
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:41,186
-Hey!
-Ohhh! Kenichi!

408
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,604
You came back to
me on your own!

409
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:44,397
I'm so proud!

410
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:45,774
Glad you're safe, son...

411
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:47,859
Oh yeah, right!

412
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:49,403
That's it, laugh...

413
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:50,779
I almost starved to
death in that forest

414
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:52,364
and I was attacked
by a bear...

415
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,157
And where were you? !

416
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:57,160
I don't know what I
would've done

417
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,870
if Ogata hadn't saved me...

418
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,122
I told him about
the walnuts

419
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:02,165
and he told me where
the trees grew...

420
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:03,750
so I went looking for them,

421
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,335
but I wasn't paying
attention...

422
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:08,255
and the ledge broke off
and I fell in the river...

423
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:10,924
and I floated away...

424
00:19:10,924 --> 00:19:13,510
Why didn't you
come for me...

425
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,011
I thought I was
dead for sure!!

426
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:19,266
You might've
been scared...

427
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:21,726
But you still managed to
keep control of your inner rage.

428
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:27,524
Oh... I'm angry, don't kid
yourself, old man!

429
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:29,401
How could you just leave
me out there to die? !

430
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,528
As I thought, he
has a strong will...

431
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:35,073
and he has chosen the path of
the true martial artist.

432
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,950
Glad you're
back, Kenichi...

433
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,827
Good to see you
haven't changed.

434
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:40,787
Oo-kay... thanks.

435
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:44,749
What happened to the
bear meat he gave me?

436
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:45,959
Where is it?

437
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:47,335
Where'd it go? Where?

438
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:49,004
Oh, that package
you had with you?

439
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:50,589
It's long gone.
It floated away.

440
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:54,301
So it's back to
Devil Walnuts, then.

441
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:55,635
Oh I don't know...

442
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:56,970
Why don't you try
catching some fish?

443
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,181
Because fish are wet
and slimey and fast...

444
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:00,765
I can't catch
them, I can't!

445
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:03,476
Just calm down and
give it a try...

446
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:05,103
You must work with
your surroundings

447
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,647
by reflecting them
in your movements.

448
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:09,858
Try to stop the
water, Kenichi.

449
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:14,237
Why do you make it sound
like that's so easy??

450
00:20:14,237 --> 00:20:16,323
Why don't you stop
whining and try??

451
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:20,785
I'll try...

452
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:22,454
but it won't work.

453
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:27,417
That's weird...

454
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:28,835
Why am I so calm
all of a sudden??

455
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:32,797
Maybe its just because
I am so exhausted.

456
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:38,094
There!

457
00:20:38,094 --> 00:20:40,931
Do not allow your heart to
be uncertain of itself...

458
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:43,350
Remove all ambitions...

459
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,144
and become a stone
within the river's path.

460
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,771
Become...

461
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:49,231
a stone??

462
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,692
I get it...

463
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:54,110
He means I
should be still.

464
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,243
That's better.

465
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:04,037
I can hear the sound of
the river clearer now...

466
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:07,165
And the fish aren't afraid
to come near me anymore.

467
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,293
They're getting closer.

468
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:12,796
I should concentrate on
the radius of my reach.

469
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,800
That's too far.

470
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,803
But they're swimming
closer on my left.

471
00:21:19,803 --> 00:21:21,429
That's right...

472
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:23,098
Don't rush it.

473
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:24,057
I see!

474
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:25,892
The reason I couldn't
grab them before

475
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:28,270
was because they always
swam ahead of my reach!

476
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:31,815
Then the place I
should be reaching...

477
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:34,359
Isn't where they are...

478
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,486
It's where they're going!

479
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:42,367
I got one!

480
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,952
Alright!

481
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:48,915
Hey!

482
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,293
You're kidding me.

483
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:52,961
You mean you're the one
who's been swiping

484
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:56,047
at the back of my neck all the
time since we've been out here??

485
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,800
Well, it took you long
enough to catch on.

486
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,386
You mean that one time...

487
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,221
And that other time...

488
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,266
So fast! You're like a sports
car or a secret agent!

489
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:08,435
But you managed to
block my attack...

490
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:11,563
Maybe you'll discover your
own Seikuuken technique yet.

491
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,398
I definitely just made
a break through...

492
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,232
You're right...

493
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,318
I think I'm gonna
figure it out real soon!

494
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:19,946
Now, now, don't
get cocky, boy.

495
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:23,116
Your Death Dark Valley
training hasn't even begun yet!

496
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:27,078
Have mercy!!

497
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:31,374
Ryo-uzahn-pah-koou...

498
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:33,877
And that damn old man.

499
00:22:33,877 --> 00:22:36,880
He used me to
train his disciple.

500
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,883
I knew Kenichi Shirihama
was a city boy,

501
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:41,176
through and through.

502
00:22:44,304 --> 00:22:46,556
Makes me itch to leave the
mountains for a while

503
00:22:46,556 --> 00:22:48,350
and pay the city a visit.

504
00:22:48,350 --> 00:24:09,431
[Music]

505
00:24:18,148 --> 00:24:20,817
Uh oh. Kisara's not
answering her cell.

506
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:22,444
What about you, Matsui?
Any luck??

507
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:22,986
No sir.

508
00:24:22,986 --> 00:24:25,280
Assistant Commander Takeda's
not picking up either!

509
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,615
Damn. I have a bad
feeling about this...

510
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:29,492
What about Ukita? Where is he?

511
00:24:29,492 --> 00:24:31,202
I'm trying him
right now...

512
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:32,954
Ukita, sir?
Where are you...

513
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:35,957
What.....?..? Ukita! Ukita!

514
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:37,292
What's going on?!

515
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:39,169
I think I heard
him scream... But...

516
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:40,295
But he got cut off!

517
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:42,714
Damn those Ragnarok
ruffians to hell...

518
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:45,216
I think they're really
trying to kill us this time!
