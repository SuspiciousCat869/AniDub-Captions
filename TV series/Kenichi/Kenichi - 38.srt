1
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:50,379
The Falling Tree!

2
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,805
I can't believe my Fighting
Sumo technique is dead...

3
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:02,808
That was my dream-
what do I do now?

4
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:05,435
What are you
talking about?

5
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:07,354
All I wanted from you if
you lost was a promise

6
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:09,481
that you'd quit Ragnarok...

7
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:12,275
I don't remember asking
you to give up any dream.

8
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:16,822
I hope you do keep developing
your new Sumo technique,

9
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:18,699
just like you planned...

10
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,827
I think it's a pretty
amazing idea...

11
00:02:21,827 --> 00:02:23,412
I wish you luck.

12
00:02:35,257 --> 00:02:37,467
Alright, Thor, if
that's what you want...

13
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:39,177
How bout I tell the boss
you're interested

14
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:41,555
in early retirement.

15
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:44,850
What's wrong, Valkyrie...?

16
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,935
It's just a little fun
between friends...

17
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:50,355
Don't you wanna prove
you're a team player?

18
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:51,982
If we don't know you're
part of the team,

19
00:02:51,982 --> 00:02:54,901
then how can
we trust you?

20
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,737
And if we start to think
we can't trust you,

21
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:59,031
then how are we ever
gonna be friends, Val?

22
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:01,700
Friends?

23
00:03:03,577 --> 00:03:04,619
Right...

24
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:05,912
None of us will
ever be friends

25
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:08,331
like they are in the
Shinpaku Alliance.

26
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:10,792
Siegfried was my only
friend around here...

27
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,502
I'm not even sure
the rest of you know

28
00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:14,046
what the word friend
really means.

29
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:17,632
The Shinpaku Alliance?

30
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,509
Yet another fan of
theirs, huh...?

31
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:20,761
That's interesting...

32
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:22,763
The boy, Shirihama
intrigues me a little,

33
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:24,848
I have to admit...

34
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:26,224
I've never seen anyone
with a fighting technique

35
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:27,809
quite like his.

36
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:29,269
Alright, that's enough...

37
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:30,562
Look, Valkyrie...

38
00:03:30,562 --> 00:03:32,481
You know you have to participate
in Thor's punishment,

39
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:33,648
or we'll have
to punish you.

40
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:34,900
Uh huh.

41
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,985
So does that mean we decided
for a hierarchy based

42
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,487
on fear and pain ?

43
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:39,696
Valkyrie.

44
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:41,782
Yeah, yeah,
Freya, I'm on it.

45
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:44,242
(sigh)

46
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,911
So Ragnarok's
unbeatable fists

47
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:47,913
are droppin' like
flies around here...

48
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:50,707
Any one worried we'll be
swatted by the Shinpaku?

49
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:54,586
You're a funny
little girl.

50
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:55,837
I'm out!

51
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,220
Hey, Freya...

52
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,138
you'd better keep an eye
on that one for us...

53
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:06,807
That's your job, isn't it?

54
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:08,558
In Norse mythology
anyway...

55
00:04:08,558 --> 00:04:10,393
It was Freya's
responsibility

56
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:12,979
to rule over the battle
hungry Valkyrie...

57
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:15,607
and keep them from getting
into too much trouble.

58
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:17,859
You don't have to warn
me about Valkyrie.

59
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:20,570
I was planning to keep
close tabs on her anyway...

60
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,072
My team and I would
never even consider

61
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:23,490
betraying Ragnarok...

62
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,617
or letting anyone else.

63
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,126
Come on, Touchumaru.

64
00:04:34,126 --> 00:04:35,877
Why can't you stop hiding
out in my lunchbox

65
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,963
and just stay home
like a good rodent?

66
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:43,969
What, is Shigure not
feeding you or something?

67
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:46,888
Cause I'd be happy to talk to
her about that for you...

68
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:49,599
Just promise you'll stop
eating my lunch, okay? !

69
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,143
Oh, I'm sure he
just wants to see

70
00:04:51,143 --> 00:04:52,936
where you spend
your day...

71
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:55,147
It's not that he's trying
to deprive you of your lunch!

72
00:04:55,147 --> 00:04:56,523
What makes you
think that...?

73
00:04:56,523 --> 00:04:58,442
Maybe he's just sneaky.

74
00:04:58,442 --> 00:05:00,277
What was that?

75
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:01,570
What was what?

76
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,904
That meow?

77
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:14,291
Oh, look...! Awwwww!

78
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,043
It's a kitty!

79
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:18,962
That looks like Kisara...!

80
00:05:18,962 --> 00:05:21,173
Miu, we have to go... look
who it is over there!

81
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:22,591
Yeah

82
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:28,722
Heyyyy!

83
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:32,851
Why is she kicking
that box...?!

84
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:34,644
That's so not cool!

85
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:36,938
Kenichi...?

86
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:38,690
We're gonna have
to kill her.

87
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,278
Hold on, Miu...

88
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:44,654
Let's calm down.

89
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:47,407
Oh, don't worry...

90
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:49,242
I'm at least half kidding.

91
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:51,286
I'll leave all her
vital organs alone.

92
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:52,871
I can't let you do that!

93
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,669
Whenever someone
comes up behind Miu,

94
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:00,921
she can't help herself.

95
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:02,714
She throws them on reflex.

96
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:04,424
Miu... I really think you--

97
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:07,510
Come on, let's
just talk about th--

98
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:12,599
It's finally clear
to me, Ragnarok is evil...

99
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,434
And now I'm going
to put a stop to it.

100
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:20,565
Why are you all by
yourself, cat...?

101
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:23,401
There. Drink up.

102
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:27,989
Sorry, scruff...

103
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:29,824
but I can't
take you home...

104
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,785
I'm afraid my apartment
doesn't allow any pets.

105
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:33,745
But... I can come by
and feed you every day

106
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:36,373
until someone finds
you and adopts you.

107
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,750
How does that sound, huh?

108
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,293
Whaddaya know.

109
00:06:40,293 --> 00:06:41,711
You're not so
bad, are you?

110
00:06:45,507 --> 00:06:47,217
Hey! It's been awhile.

111
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:48,385
So what happened
to this guy...?

112
00:06:48,385 --> 00:06:49,928
Poor little thing.

113
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:51,596
Is it okay with
you if I hold him?

114
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:53,014
He's cuuuute.

115
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:55,433
It's--the--dairy cow, and--

116
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:01,731
What's up...? Hey, is
this your cat...?

117
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:04,067
I just, uhh...
saw it here, annnnd--

118
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,360
Oh, don't bother...

119
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,863
We saw you giving it milk,
didn't we little guy, yeees.

120
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,865
What? ! No, this is my milk.
I just spilled some!

121
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,701
Oh yeah? Okay,
then, what's that?

122
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:17,205
Oh this is mine...! I
just can't get enough...

123
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:18,540
ha ha ha.

124
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,419
It's so good!

125
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:24,212
Don't worry... Really...!

126
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:26,381
It's okay--we promise we
won't tell anyone

127
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:27,549
you're a big softie.

128
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,427
Oh my god...

129
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:31,970
What if that alien freak
in the Shinpaku gang

130
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,389
hears about this...

131
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,141
Extra, extra, read
all about it:

132
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:39,394
Ragnarok's Valkyrie exposed as a
super pansy kitty cat lover!

133
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:40,979
That's right, you heard it
here first, folks,

134
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,689
Kisara the bad ass wants
to squish all their

135
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:44,024
wittle itty bitty,
cuddly wuddly faces!

136
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:47,861
My rep would be ruined!

137
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:52,073
You feelin' okay?

138
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:53,575
The only way this
doesn't get out

139
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:54,868
is if I kill
you both today.

140
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:07,756
Check it out, dude,
cat in the road.

141
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:09,049
Well that's
gotta be worth... What,

142
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:10,925
like, twenty points?

143
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:15,513
You okay?

144
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:24,856
Hello...? Are you guys
still alive...? ...

145
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:26,733
The one you kicked
looks pretty rough.

146
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:30,153
Uh... what happened man, did
we just die or something?

147
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:32,822
If not, I'm getting
rid of my bike.

148
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:34,949
Kitty cat's
safe and sound.

149
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,284
Arrren't yooou?

150
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:37,535
Hey! Give it back!

151
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:40,413
No...! I'm not
done lovin' yet!

152
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:41,956
That's right...

153
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:44,292
She's talking to
them now, Freya.

154
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:47,796
Okay. We'll keep
an eye on her...

155
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:49,047
And if she gives us any
reason to think

156
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:50,757
she's betraying Ragnarok...

157
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:53,218
You can trust us to
put a stop to it...

158
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:54,761
This is the Walkyrie. Out.

159
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:18,104
Hey...! What'd I do...?
I hope that's not for me,

160
00:09:18,104 --> 00:09:20,064
I'm only havin' one
drink, woman...!

161
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:21,524
'Man can have a
beer, can't he?

162
00:09:24,402 --> 00:09:25,736
Okay, Miu?

163
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,488
Uh huh... I guess
it's nothing.

164
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:34,996
Aaaa?

165
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:43,504
Miu.

166
00:09:43,504 --> 00:09:44,964
Not that I care...

167
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:46,924
But how 'bout if one of you
guys takes this cat home...?

168
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:48,175
I can't keep him
cause my apartment

169
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:50,052
doesn't allow pets.

170
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:52,054
I'd really love
to, but I can't...

171
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:53,264
My little sister's sister
Honoka's allergic

172
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:54,765
to fur or something.

173
00:09:57,143 --> 00:09:59,770
Nuh-uh I'm not allergic!

174
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,230
Alright, what about you?

175
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,858
Oh, who, me...?
My house...

176
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,369
No! My house is
no good either!

177
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:17,204
It's for the cat's
well being, we promise!

178
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:20,249
You guys are so
worthless...!

179
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:22,543
Yeah, yeah, so Blondie here
might have a giant rack...!

180
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:23,711
but that's all!

181
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:25,379
What did you just say? !

182
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,673
I said you have great
big, bouncy,

183
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:28,716
basketball sized...

184
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:30,301
Shut uuuuuup!

185
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:34,138
You're going?

186
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:36,098
I guess I don't
need to ask where...

187
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:38,017
But what should we
do about dinner?

188
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:40,269
I'm sorry!

189
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:41,312
No...

190
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:42,605
Wait.

191
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,526
What do I make with... this?

192
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:50,154
Shigure... You mean you're
gonna make dinner for me?

193
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:51,364
Mm-hmm.

194
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,577
Well I --Oh never
mind, I'll do it.

195
00:10:56,577 --> 00:10:58,412
No, you should take
the evening off.

196
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:01,165
You just let me worry
about dinner tonight...

197
00:11:01,165 --> 00:11:02,667
Shigure and I are
more than capable

198
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,710
of handling the cooking...

199
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,004
I'm quite a respectable
chef, you know.

200
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:08,464
Yeah?

201
00:11:08,464 --> 00:11:10,341
Of course this is the first
we're hearing about it...

202
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:12,635
He was too busy
with his magazines.

203
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:14,637
I apologize for
not realizing...

204
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:16,347
We've been working
you much too hard

205
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:19,016
around this place for a
long time, my dear girl...

206
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:22,019
You're too young to be
cooped up inside every day.

207
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,439
Oh, Kensei...!
I love you...!

208
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:27,692
Thanks!!

209
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:30,069
I'm impressed, old man, I never
knew you could be anything

210
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:32,029
but perverted
when it came to Miu.

211
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,407
Is that what you think of
me, Kenichi, really...?

212
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:37,076
That I'm just some...
perverted old geezer?

213
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:38,744
Alright, kid...

214
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:40,413
I think it's about
time you told us

215
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:43,249
why Miu's been acting
so weird lately.

216
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:45,876
It's true. You are
hiding something.

217
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:47,712
Yes, and secrets
are not nice...

218
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:49,171
They're bad.

219
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:51,298
That's right...
They're bad...

220
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:53,592
So why don't you just tell
us what's going on here?

221
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:55,094
Sure. It's uhhh...

222
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,557
I don't think she'd
want me to say.

223
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:01,100
Then why don't you just
talk to yourself for a while

224
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,727
and we'll listen in?

225
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:04,562
Or maybe you should
give us some clues.

226
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:06,105
Not that we'd ever force
you to do anything

227
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:07,773
you felt uncomfortable
with, of course.

228
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:09,692
Nooo...!

229
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:11,736
No force. Just talk...!

230
00:12:11,736 --> 00:12:13,696
Go, Sakaki...!

231
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:15,698
And Akisame...!

232
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:17,742
and Kenichi...!

233
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:19,368
Ap-pa-pa!

234
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:21,829
Now don't hurt
yourself, Kenichi.

235
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:24,373
No! I'll never tell!!

236
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:52,443
-Awww, look at the kitten!
-Cuuute!

237
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:54,028
Just look forward.
Don't make eye contact.

238
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:57,406
What a sweet little thing!

239
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,003
What are you doing?

240
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:13,339
Oh, you're here again?

241
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,382
Maybe you can
figure this out...

242
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:17,468
I put a big sign on the
box and everything...

243
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:19,512
But nobody wants
to take him away.

244
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,430
Of course not with
that face of yours!

245
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,474
Oh, well excuse the
hell outta me...

246
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:25,184
but this is the
only face I got!

247
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:26,811
Sure, but you don't have
to use it to glower

248
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:28,187
at people all the time!

249
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:29,313
I just don't want some
creep picking him up

250
00:13:29,313 --> 00:13:31,649
and taking him home while
I'm not looking is all...

251
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:33,025
I want him to have a nice
home with somebody

252
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:34,652
who'll play with
him and stuff...

253
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,987
I don't think that's
too much to ask.

254
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:39,824
Look, I get that you want
to keep him, I really do...

255
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:41,492
But you have
to let him go.

256
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:43,869
Yeah... I know that,
thank you very much...!

257
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:45,037
Why do you think
I'm out here?

258
00:13:58,092 --> 00:13:59,760
So, uh... you
like cats, huh?

259
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,679
Not really.

260
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,682
She won't let the tough
act go for a second!

261
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:06,642
Okay, well I
really love them...

262
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:07,893
I like the fluffy ones...

263
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:10,020
And the lazy ones, too...!

264
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,897
Actually, the cats
were the best thing

265
00:14:11,897 --> 00:14:14,108
about the trip I took around
the world with grandpa.

266
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:17,570
You went around the world.

267
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,114
Yeah...! And it didn't
matter where we went...

268
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:22,783
There were always lots
of cats everywhere.

269
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:25,119
They always
looked so content.

270
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:30,916
I really wanted to take
one home with us...

271
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,502
But you know, they say
a cat chooses its owner.

272
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:36,172
And I've never stayed
in one place for long...

273
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:37,590
it'd probably be hard
for me to take care

274
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,508
of a pet that way.

275
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:42,344
I actually did have
a pet cat once.

276
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:44,346
Oh! You did...? Really...?!

277
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:46,015
You have to tell
me about him...!

278
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,100
What kind of cat was
he, do you know?

279
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,019
All I know is
she was black...

280
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,729
And that's why we
called her Noir.

281
00:14:51,729 --> 00:14:53,397
Noir, yeah, that's
a great name!

282
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:55,316
It was a birthday present
from my parents...

283
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:57,776
Back in the days when we
were still on speaking terms.

284
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:59,904
Awwww! It's so cute!

285
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:02,615
I love how fluffy
and black it is!

286
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:05,826
So what are you gonna
call it, sweetheart?

287
00:15:05,826 --> 00:15:07,661
You mean I get to name it?

288
00:15:07,661 --> 00:15:08,871
Of course, honey!

289
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:09,997
It's your cat!

290
00:15:11,874 --> 00:15:13,375
Then how about Black Cat?

291
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:17,922
I don't think she's
too fond of that one.

292
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:20,174
Um, maybe Black Shadow?

293
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:21,717
Blackers?

294
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:23,510
Blacky.

295
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,137
Kisara... It's a girl.

296
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:27,181
Maybe something
more feminine?

297
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:29,892
Oh, right. How
about Blackette!

298
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:31,435
Blackine?

299
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:32,436
Black!

300
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:36,815
How about Noir, dear?

301
00:15:36,815 --> 00:15:38,400
What's that?

302
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,736
Noir is the French
word for black...

303
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:42,404
How bout it, kitty?

304
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:45,616
Look, I think she
likes it...!

305
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:47,159
Noir...

306
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,327
Noir!

307
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:51,330
That's it then!
Your name is Noir!

308
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,961
And we'll always be
together, won't we, Noir?

309
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:58,128
Always.

310
00:16:00,923 --> 00:16:02,341
Funny, that makes
me think of home

311
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:04,343
like I haven't in a while.

312
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:06,053
Kisara? Where's Noir now?

313
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:15,688
She was a little cat, but
she was pretty brave...

314
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:18,148
There was this big dog that
was going to attack...

315
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:19,692
And she died protecting me.

316
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:24,321
Oh! Jeez I'm stupid,
what am I doing...?!

317
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,323
Why would I tell
you all that? !

318
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:28,492
Quiet...! You better calm
down or you'll wake the cat.

319
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:31,996
Man! No one's gonna
take him home

320
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:33,706
if the rain keeps
up like this.

321
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:36,834
Maybe I could take him
home just for today

322
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,544
if I'm really careful.

323
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:40,754
I'll hide him in here
all nice and safe.

324
00:16:40,754 --> 00:16:42,089
Good idea...

325
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:44,258
And I'll go buy you
guys an umbrella.

326
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:46,635
I didn't ask you to do that,
so don't expect any thanks!

327
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:47,928
Oh, I won't!

328
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:52,057
I guess it's pretty cool that
she's so worried about him.

329
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:55,978
Fraternizing with
the enemy, Valkyrie?

330
00:16:58,272 --> 00:17:00,649
Save it...! We don't
wanna hear your excuses!

331
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:01,900
The Walkyrie!

332
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,069
How dare you challenge
one of the Fists...?!

333
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,155
What... Do all of you
have a death wish?

334
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:17,291
What? !

335
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,961
Cats... Are allowed...
In Ryouzanpaku?!

336
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:22,880
Sure... Who ever said
that they weren't?

337
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,674
Yeah, we're not some kinda
barbarians, we love animals.

338
00:17:25,674 --> 00:17:27,009
Is true...

339
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:28,385
How could not
love kitties?

340
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:29,595
And don't you worry...

341
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:32,848
We won't make him our new
disciple... I swear.

342
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:35,559
Touchumaru could take on
any cat so tell her...

343
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,019
Bring'im.

344
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:38,896
I'm sorry Miu felt like
she couldn't ask...

345
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:40,773
Ryouzanpaku is her home...

346
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:43,275
economically speaking, a cat
wouldn't make a difference...

347
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:47,029
so make sure you tell her
that it's not a concern.

348
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:49,156
This is awesome!
I'll go tell her right now!

349
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:54,953
Hey if it isn't a
little stowaway...!

350
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:57,039
What are you doing, Touchumaru-
just hitchin' a ride...?

351
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,791
Oh, right! I get it!

352
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,127
You heard Ryouzanpaku's
getting a new member!

353
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:03,962
And you just wanted
to see if you approve?

354
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:14,183
I don't know what you idiots
think you're planning...

355
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:16,351
but surely you know that even if
you come at me all at once,

356
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:17,686
you amateurs
aren't strong enough

357
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:19,938
to beat the Eighth
Fist in a fight.

358
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:21,482
We did our research...

359
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:24,151
And under normal circumstances
you'd be right...

360
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:25,652
We'd never stand a
chance against you

361
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:27,446
at the top of your game...

362
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:29,656
But...

363
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:31,867
If you're hindered by the need
to protect something...

364
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:33,535
say, that little kitten
you've got there...

365
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:36,205
you're an easy target.

366
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:39,082
Freya went out of her way to
vouch for you with Ragnarok...

367
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:41,168
And this is how
you repay her...?

368
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:43,253
You deserve
what you get!

369
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:12,407
Would you just. Back. Off? !

370
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:21,500
She can't take all
of us at once...!

371
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,210
-Together!
-Right!

372
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:33,387
Noir!

373
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:44,189
No! Noir!

374
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:46,858
You really care
about this thing!

375
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:48,485
Now finish her off!

376
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:06,628
Wait a minute...

377
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:09,131
Where did Kisara go?

378
00:20:09,131 --> 00:20:10,465
She wouldn't take the
cat in the rain

379
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:11,925
without an umbrella...

380
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:13,260
This is weird...

381
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,595
Something isn't
right here.

382
00:20:14,595 --> 00:20:16,221
I can feel it.

383
00:20:16,221 --> 00:20:18,515
Oh, man, Miu's
gonna be so happy!

384
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:20,225
What do you
think, Touchumaru?

385
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:21,727
You think she's gonna
be so ecstatic

386
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:23,186
she'll just break
down and kiss me?

387
00:20:30,402 --> 00:20:31,945
What an idiot...

388
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:33,947
You should've taken us-
you almost did-

389
00:20:33,947 --> 00:20:36,199
but you couldn't let go of
that stupid ball of fluff,

390
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:37,659
could you?

391
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:39,036
Mind your own business.

392
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:43,290
Oh god... He's not
moving at all...!

393
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,751
I have to get him
to a hospital!

394
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:48,879
Kisara... You swore your
loyalty to Freya...

395
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:50,756
but you betrayed
her trust in you...

396
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:53,425
Why would you disgrace
the Walkyrie like this?

397
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:55,177
Wasn't it enough of an
honor for you to serve

398
00:20:55,177 --> 00:20:57,387
at the side of the Third
Fist of Ragnarok...?

399
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:59,264
Or did you just use her to
become a Fist yourself,

400
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:00,265
and then throw her away?

401
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:02,267
I told you little girls
to mind your own business,

402
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:04,269
and I won't say it again!

403
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:06,063
Maybe I can get past 'em.
I've gotta try!

404
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:12,361
She's getting away!

405
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:13,945
Hibiki...! Now!

406
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:22,621
Sorry I'm so late.

407
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:24,247
Damn it, I didn't
see that one.

408
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,959
I have to get
him to the vet.

409
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,252
Fast!

410
00:21:29,252 --> 00:21:30,587
Kisara...!

411
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:32,089
Kitty!

412
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,133
Miu!

413
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:37,260
There you are!

414
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,388
Hey... Is everything
okay at home?

415
00:21:39,388 --> 00:21:41,682
Actually, yeah, everything's
better than okay...!

416
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:43,433
I've got some really great
news, are you ready?

417
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:45,310
Stop it! Let me go!

418
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,937
You're talkin' pretty
big for someone

419
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:48,772
who's trapped, Valkyrie.

420
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:50,357
I said let go!

421
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:54,069
It's the cat...!
She can't fight!

422
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:56,196
Blondie, you're here!

423
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:58,407
Please! You have
to take the cat!

424
00:21:58,407 --> 00:21:59,658
Noir needs help!

425
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:01,243
Please!

426
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:04,746
I'll protect you this
time, Noir. I promise!

427
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:06,373
You should mind
your own business!

428
00:22:10,836 --> 00:22:11,920
Where's he hurt?

429
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,755
I don't know... Just hurry!

430
00:22:13,755 --> 00:22:17,050
Hey...! That girl's a
Shinpaku...! Pin her down!

431
00:22:29,604 --> 00:22:32,065
Now... Why don't we all
just take a breath.

432
00:22:43,326 --> 00:23:08,560
[Music]

433
00:24:18,046 --> 00:24:19,798
Yo. Kenichi.

434
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:21,466
Hey! Shigure!

435
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:22,801
What are you doing here??

436
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:24,219
I came to bring
you home quickly.

437
00:24:24,219 --> 00:24:26,179
So dinner
doesn't get cold.

438
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:28,598
Um, yeah. Not
the best time...

439
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,433
Kinda in the middle
of a fight right now.

440
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:32,811
And look! All these
girls have weapons!

441
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:35,105
Weapons...? Interesting...

442
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:36,857
I hope they don't think
they can leave here alive

443
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:38,692
after I'm done with them.

444
00:24:38,692 --> 00:24:41,194
Oh no. Shigure
looks serious.

445
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:43,572
Listen, girls? Girls?

446
00:24:43,572 --> 00:24:46,032
Run! Run for your lives!
