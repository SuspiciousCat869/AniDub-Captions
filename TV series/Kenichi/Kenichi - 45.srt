[Music]

2
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:41,074
I have a staff...

3
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:42,701
a longsword, a katana...

4
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:44,286
and even a knife...

5
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:46,955
But it looks like the staff
is your preferred method.

6
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:48,582
Let's finish
them off, Miu!

7
00:01:48,582 --> 00:01:49,791
This is our chance!

8
00:01:58,425 --> 00:01:59,551
While you may be
able to see

9
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:01,595
what's two steps
ahead of you...

10
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:04,639
I can see even farther ahead
thereby surpassing you all!

11
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:09,227
Take this...!

12
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:11,354
Things are about to
get really sticky!

13
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:16,651
Once this glue dries you
won't be able to move

14
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:19,154
and I can't wait to take
pictures of you all helpless!

15
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:22,157
You won't be able to show
your face on the streets again!

16
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,792
Commander I think we
have a problem, sir!

17
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,710
Huh...? Why? What's
the matter, Matsui?

18
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:38,215
Nice try, little man.

19
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:40,342
You're different than
the other fighters...

20
00:02:40,342 --> 00:02:42,969
I've never fought anyone
like you before...

21
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:45,388
That first round was
fun, Haruo Niijima.

22
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:48,725
But how... How'd
you get out? !

23
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:51,144
Too bad we don't have time
for another round right now.

24
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:52,896
But I got an
Alliance to crush.

25
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:54,439
This isn't good.

26
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,900
I didn't expect him to be
able to escape from trap 2.

27
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,109
What'll I do now?

28
00:02:58,109 --> 00:02:59,236
This guy is huge!

29
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:00,821
He could totally crush me!

30
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:02,239
It's time.

31
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:12,332
I've failed
you, Kenichi...

32
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:13,959
I tried to take care of
Berserker on my own

33
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,585
but I couldn't do it!

34
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:19,214
That was a close one.

35
00:03:19,214 --> 00:03:20,549
It looks like I got
here right on time.

36
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,594
Sieg! How'd you find me.

37
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:26,638
My driver heard reports
of an alien running naked

38
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:28,056
through the streets...

39
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:29,307
I figured it was you.

40
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:31,184
Let go, you traitor.

41
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:34,688
I can't leave you here!

42
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:37,023
Go, now...! I can handle
this weakling all on my own!

43
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:39,150
You bastard!

44
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,569
Good luck, my friend!

45
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,289
Women naturally have
less power than men...

46
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:54,583
That's why we have to rely
on weapons to beat them...

47
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,751
I don't understand why
that bothers you so much,

48
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:58,837
Kisara.

49
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:02,340
I'm a master of weapons
and I take pride in my skill...

50
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,176
Meanwhile my former disciple
has turned into a traitor.

51
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:14,644
It almost feels as though
I've been bitten...

52
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:16,187
by my own dog!

53
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,444
Their fight has nothing
to do with you-

54
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:24,154
if you girls wanna try
to start some trouble

55
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:26,573
then you're going to have
to get through me first-

56
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:28,491
and I'm not gonna
go easy on you!

57
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,201
Thanks, Miu...

58
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:32,329
Freya... I've
already told you...

59
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,497
I'm gonna walk my own
path from now on...

60
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:36,333
I'm not going back.

61
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,877
No...! I refuse to follow
in your footsteps

62
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:40,337
ever again!

63
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:41,296
Wow...

64
00:04:41,296 --> 00:04:43,214
I liked you better before.

65
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:52,098
Shinpaku...!
Shinpaku...! Shinpaku!

66
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:53,558
I'm not letting
you down there.

67
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:55,352
You'll have to swim
if you want him...

68
00:04:55,352 --> 00:04:56,686
Jump in and give
it your best shot,

69
00:04:56,686 --> 00:04:58,021
but I promise you'll fail.

70
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:00,190
The Commander can swim faster
than anyone I've ever met.

71
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:04,611
What the hell? !

72
00:05:05,862 --> 00:05:07,906
La-la-la...

73
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:22,212
What's the matter Sieg,
can't take the heat?

74
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:25,048
Guess my punches are just
too powerful for ya, huh?

75
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,716
I can handle the power
of your punches...

76
00:05:26,716 --> 00:05:28,593
It's your sloppy,
untrained fighting style

77
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:30,011
that I'm not
accustomed to.

78
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:31,888
It's so unsophisticated.

79
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:33,056
Oh yeah?

80
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:40,355
Do-Re-Mi-

81
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,483
Impressive...

82
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:46,027
Random street fights can be
quite entertaining sometimes.

83
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:48,238
Yeah... Those two are really
going at it, aren't they?

84
00:05:48,238 --> 00:05:49,739
Hey... Check it out...!

85
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:51,491
There's something in
the water over there!

86
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:52,617
What...?

87
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:54,035
Where?

88
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:55,537
The big guy's moves
are too flashy.

89
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:57,706
Reminds me of how
Kenichi used to be.

90
00:05:57,706 --> 00:06:00,041
Why are you talking about
Kenichi in past tense?

91
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,668
He's not dead he's just
doing special training

92
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:03,336
in the mountains this week.

93
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:05,463
Somebody misses
his disciple.

94
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:08,091
I'm just gonna keep punching
you through the fence!

95
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:09,759
And I'm going to dodge.

96
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,885
Got ya.

97
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,892
Such a powerful
kick with forzando!

98
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:18,852
How the hell was he
able to kick me

99
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:20,395
from that position?

100
00:06:23,106 --> 00:06:24,357
I found your weakness.

101
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:26,401
It seems you can't
block me in mid-air.

102
00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:28,820
He got me good.

103
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,739
It feels like he
broke three ribs...

104
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:33,533
This calls for
drastic measures.

105
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:52,302
Jeez Is that
Mozart's Requiem?

106
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:02,228
I won't let you escape!

107
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:03,521
Why'd you do it, Sieg?

108
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:05,231
What made you decide
to leave Ragnarok

109
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:07,150
and join the
Shinpaku Alliance?

110
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,485
What is it they got?

111
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:10,361
I'm afraid that you could
never really understand,

112
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:11,738
my friend.

113
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:13,865
Whenever the Shinpaku
Alliance comes together

114
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:15,658
I hear a beautiful melody.

115
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:17,118
It's unlike anything
I ever heard

116
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:18,495
while I was
with Ragnarok.

117
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:20,955
It's allegro and
always con anima!

118
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:23,291
As long as that melody is
there I will continue

119
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,460
to fight for the
Shinpaku Alliance...

120
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,920
Even if it kills me.

121
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,254
You kidding?

122
00:07:28,254 --> 00:07:29,672
Do these eyes look
like they're joking?

123
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:34,469
And now... My
ultimate attack...!

124
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:36,930
Requiem...! Buster!

125
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:40,433
Normally we'd be falling
towards concrete

126
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:42,685
but tonight we'll fall
into the water instead!

127
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:45,021
It's a nice
night for a swim!

128
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:46,981
Whoa! They fell
into the water!

129
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:49,400
Eh. The guy in the hat had
a death wish anyway.

130
00:07:53,404 --> 00:07:55,490
I had hoped to hear that
melody of friendship

131
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,450
one more time...

132
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,160
Ah, too be young again.

133
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,371
Those kids'll risk it all
for something they believe in.

134
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,331
"Risk it all?" Ha...!

135
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:05,708
They may smell like sewer
but I doubt they'll die.

136
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,252
I 'd say that we
should save them...

137
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:09,838
but we shouldn't get
involved... in a duel.

138
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:13,258
What the-

139
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:15,426
You're a dead man.

140
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:17,679
So much power and
so suddenly...!

141
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,264
This must be his
Berserker mode!

142
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:35,154
I hope you're okay, Sieg!

143
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:36,906
If we're not careful the
whole Shinpaku Alliance

144
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:38,658
is gonna be wiped out!

145
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:40,368
Damn it, Kenichi!
Come back already!

146
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:46,374
You saw what happened?

147
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:52,213
Let's do it! We gotta find
opera boy before he drowns!

148
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:55,049
I've got a question
for you Sakaki-

149
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:56,718
where are you planning
on landing?

150
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:58,178
What...?!

151
00:08:58,178 --> 00:09:00,638
Don't tell me you're aiming for
the top of that sign too...?!

152
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:02,682
You idiot!

153
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:07,937
Damn, you're heavy...

154
00:09:07,937 --> 00:09:10,356
Less complainin'
more searchin'.

155
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:11,357
I found him.

156
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:14,444
-Catch!
-Apa!

157
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:16,237
Who's he...? That
opera boy...?

158
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:18,156
But where's is his hat?

159
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:21,117
Apachai is thinking dead
man's hat looks better on him!

160
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:23,912
He's not dead
yet, ya big dummy.

161
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:26,831
This young man was
quite courageous today.

162
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:29,250
Let's take him back
to Ryozanpaku with us.

163
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,463
Kenichi, my
friend, hurry...

164
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:35,882
We really need
your help... now...

165
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:38,134
Please hurry back before the
Alliance is destroyed...

166
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:41,346
Not too bad, Kisara...

167
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,431
You always were my
favorite disciple-

168
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:45,850
you were so talented.

169
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,478
Unfortunately, your attacks
are no match for my staff.

170
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:50,772
Since you've chosen
not to use weapons...

171
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:52,732
You've given up any
chance of being victorious

172
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:54,025
against me.

173
00:09:56,736 --> 00:09:59,197
Why do you insist on
making me the enemy...?

174
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:00,615
There was a time,
not long ago,

175
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:02,367
when you looked up to me.

176
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:15,171
I got you.

177
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:17,215
Let go of me!

178
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,758
You like to fly,
little girl?

179
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:23,388
You can kick all you want
but your little woman kicks

180
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:25,932
are no match for
this big man's muscles.

181
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,562
That hurt you
little bitch!

182
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:33,356
I was goin' easy on ya
cause you're a girl

183
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:34,899
-but forget it!
-Shut up!

184
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:46,285
Holy crap...! That chick
just knocked him out!

185
00:10:46,285 --> 00:10:48,454
How the hell
did she do that? !

186
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:51,541
She was able to defeat
that guy with one punch!

187
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,627
I don't know who she
is but she's amazing.

188
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:56,713
You've got a
lot of talent...

189
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:58,214
How would you like
to join my team?

190
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:22,414
Here ya go, Freya.
I brought you a drink.

191
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:23,206
Thank you.

192
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,209
You train so
hard every single day

193
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,253
it's no wonder you've
got such an awesome punch!

194
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:38,847
How'd you do that? !

195
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:40,682
I'll show you.

196
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:45,103
I keep a staff hidden
on me at all times-

197
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:46,730
it's my weapon of choice-

198
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,356
that way whenever
I end up in a fight

199
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:50,400
I'm sure to win no matter
who my opponent may be.

200
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:54,863
A full size staff would
be too hard to conceal

201
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:57,324
so I shortened it and
then cut it in half...

202
00:11:57,324 --> 00:11:59,743
That way I can hide them
but if I need a longer staff

203
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:01,786
I can just screw
them together.

204
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,342
It's the ultimate skill...

205
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:18,094
and I've trained really hard
to be able to attain it.

206
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:20,388
Now whether I go up
against a man or a woman

207
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:22,474
at least I'll know
that it's a fair fight.

208
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:23,600
Amazing...

209
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,435
I simply wanted
you to understand

210
00:12:25,435 --> 00:12:26,937
the importance of weapons...

211
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:31,358
And back then I really
respected you for that, Freya...

212
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:33,526
So cool!

213
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:35,820
So what changed your mind?

214
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,030
What made you decide
that using a weapon

215
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,823
is sign of weakness?

216
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:41,493
That is why you left the
Wall-keer-ee, isn't it?

217
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,745
You refused to use
weapons in battle.

218
00:12:43,745 --> 00:12:45,872
I know that using
weapons takes skill...

219
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:47,040
-Its just that...
-What?

220
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,460
I didn't want you
constantly forcing

221
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,003
that skill upon me, Freya...!

222
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:54,923
I just wanted to
find my own path!

223
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:56,800
There's this guy named
Kenichi Shirahama

224
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,718
and he said something
I'll never forget...

225
00:12:58,718 --> 00:12:59,761
Oh yeah, he's
her boyfriend.

226
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:01,221
He's not my boyfriend!

227
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:02,514
He's more like a
silly younger brother!

228
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:03,765
Or maybe more like
the family dog!

229
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:05,058
You know, one of those
stray dogs you take in

230
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:06,059
cause you feel
bad for him? !

231
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:08,728
Yeah, that what he is!
Hey come back here!

232
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:10,730
Do you know what
he said to me?

233
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,441
I've told myself that
I'll never fight a woman.

234
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:15,485
I'm not going to change my
principles 'cause of you.

235
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:18,279
I was stronger than him
but he refused to fight me...

236
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,156
It really pissed me
off at the time

237
00:13:20,156 --> 00:13:22,450
but when I thought about it
later I realized something...

238
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,036
He wasn't patronizing me
or trying to be cool-

239
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:27,288
he was just trying to stick
to what he believed in.

240
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:30,333
I understand you
have your pride...

241
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:34,129
But I have my principles!

242
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:35,964
I realized that if he had
the strength to stand up

243
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:38,216
for himself then
I should too.

244
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:40,301
He's the reason I'm
standing up to you now...

245
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:42,053
I don't feel the need
to rely on a weapon-

246
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:44,306
I don't have to use one
if I don't want to...

247
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:48,059
It doesn't mean I think any
less of you because you do...

248
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:49,853
That's just how I
feel about it...

249
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:52,439
I won't use a weapon!

250
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:54,274
I'm sorry you feel like
I betrayed you by leaving

251
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:57,027
the Walkyrie but
that wasn't my plan.

252
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:58,653
I wasn't trying
to betray you...

253
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:00,780
All I wanna do is
walk my own path...!

254
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,324
I want to find my own way!

255
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,295
Go ahead and use your weapon
it's no match for my fists...

256
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,673
Now is my chance to prove
myself to you, Freya!

257
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:20,008
Kisara!

258
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:24,304
If only Kenichi knew the
positive effect he had

259
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:25,764
on the people around him...

260
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,390
It's a rare talent-

261
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,185
and something he's
always been able to do.

262
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:31,186
What the hell
are you doing? !

263
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:32,520
We're not done
with you yet!

264
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:39,444
Her moves are
ridiculously good...

265
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:41,446
It's almost like she's
light as a feather!

266
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:43,573
And she's able to take
us all on at once...

267
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:45,492
She's a lot stronger
than we thought.

268
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:49,412
I wonder what Kenichi's
up to right now?

269
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:54,459
Good work, you've finally
made it through level five,

270
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,044
Kenichi.

271
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:04,844
What's with the angels...?

272
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,179
Hi guys...!

273
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,556
Does this mean
I'm about to die?

274
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:11,142
You can't die yet we're just
about to start level six.

275
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:16,147
I'm so proud-look
at all that energy-

276
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:17,357
I was gonna give
him a break

277
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:19,234
but I think he's
ready for more.

278
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,153
Here goes level six!

279
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:27,117
I can't take much
more of this, Elder!

280
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,569
What's the matter...?

281
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:35,654
Don't tell me that's
all you've got... Kisara!

282
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:37,364
Her attacks
are relentless.

283
00:15:37,364 --> 00:15:39,783
There has to be some way
I can get close to her.

284
00:15:39,783 --> 00:15:41,035
Long kick!

285
00:15:44,538 --> 00:15:46,749
I got so close but she
still was able to block me...

286
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:48,417
I can't get close
enough to make impact!

287
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:51,212
No way- I caught
her staff!

288
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:57,760
I use this staff as an
extension of myself...

289
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,136
You'll never be
able to stop it!

290
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:04,475
A weapon is like a fist so
strong it can never be broken!

291
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:06,185
She's so strong...

292
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:10,648
You're not going to defeat
me with your fists alone,

293
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:11,857
Kisara.

294
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:21,492
You big breasted monster!

295
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,578
What'd you say? !

296
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:27,081
I'm tired of all
these nicknames-

297
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:29,583
Dairy Cow, Blondie, Big
Breasted Monster, Big Boobs.

298
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,877
I have a perfectly good
name- it's Miu Furinji-

299
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:33,629
and you idiots
should try using it!

300
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:35,297
Miu...

301
00:16:35,297 --> 00:16:38,008
Kisara...! I took care
of her lackeys for ya...

302
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:39,218
Good luck with
your fight...

303
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:40,511
Win it!

304
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,974
That's easy for
you to say...

305
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:47,226
At least someone
has faith in me.

306
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:49,979
I have to do this.
I have to beat her.

307
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:52,189
You still have the strength
to stand up, huh...?

308
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:53,816
That takes some
serious conviction...

309
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:55,359
Kisara.

310
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,653
If Miu was able to beat
all of those girls on her own

311
00:16:57,653 --> 00:16:59,530
then I should be
able to defeat this one.

312
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,491
She was so light
on her feet-

313
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,076
almost like a feather...

314
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:05,577
I wonder if I
could do that?

315
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:10,541
What the hell? !

316
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,959
She's got new moves? !

317
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,586
How'd she do that...?!

318
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:14,878
She watched me do
that move once

319
00:17:14,878 --> 00:17:16,588
and she figured it out.

320
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:18,090
What a fast learner.

321
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:21,760
She's not moving
so stiffly anymore!

322
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,137
It looks like
she's loosened up!

323
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:24,471
Hey Kisara...!

324
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:26,682
Don't waste your time trying
to dodge her attacks.

325
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:28,434
Try following
them instead!

326
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:29,935
Do what?

327
00:17:29,935 --> 00:17:31,145
Don't concentrate
on kicking-

328
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:33,689
focus on getting into
her personal space!

329
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:35,065
Personal space?

330
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:41,071
She can't protect the
area above her head!

331
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,453
Damn it! It's closing in...!
I can do this!

332
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:53,417
What did I tell you...?!

333
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,210
My staff is an
extension of myself...

334
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,962
You can't get close
enough to touch me!

335
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:58,297
Oh yeah...?!

336
00:17:58,297 --> 00:17:59,381
We'll just see
what happens

337
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:01,175
when I kick with
my other leg!

338
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:05,262
Double long kick!

339
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:10,893
Wow, that was the
best fight ever...!

340
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:12,269
Your first kick
was so strong

341
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:13,937
she used all her
power to block it

342
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:16,273
and that left her
wide open for you.

343
00:18:16,273 --> 00:18:17,649
Thank goodness she didn't
have the strength

344
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:20,069
to counterattack cause
that could've gotten ugly.

345
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:21,820
It's not over yet...

346
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:25,616
I won't lose to you...

347
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:27,284
I can't...

348
00:18:29,036 --> 00:18:31,622
Great... So now her weapon
is even more dangerous.

349
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:34,166
I can't do this...

350
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:40,172
You've won this
round, Kisara.

351
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:43,217
I can't do much of anything
with a broken staff...

352
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:45,010
I've no choice but
to admit defeat.

353
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,053
What're you
talking about? !

354
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:47,721
Let's finish this!

355
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:49,348
I understand...

356
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:51,433
The pieces of her staff
are like spears now

357
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:53,352
and that's too dangerous.

358
00:18:53,352 --> 00:18:54,937
Weapons masters are
not out to kill-

359
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:56,397
that's not their goal...

360
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:57,648
They simply wanna fight

361
00:18:57,648 --> 00:18:59,483
until they've rendered
their opponent defenseless,

362
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:00,818
isn't that right?

363
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:02,361
Correct... If you
want to kill someone

364
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:04,655
then a gun or a knife
would do the job...

365
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:07,157
But I'm a martial
artist not a murderer.

366
00:19:07,157 --> 00:19:09,868
I can tell you feel very
strongly about this...

367
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:11,370
Thank you, Freya.

368
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,830
Why don't you just go
get another weapon...?!

369
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,915
We can still do this!

370
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:16,583
I'm done for the night...

371
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,128
I don't think I could
beat you right now anyway.

372
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:23,841
I'm proud of
you, Kisara...

373
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:25,968
You're strong.

374
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:27,469
Thanks Freya...

375
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:36,437
I'm still amazed Kisara
was able to change her

376
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:38,647
style so effortlessly...

377
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,983
I've never seen
anyone do that before.

378
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:42,109
I bet if she had
a good master

379
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:43,861
she'd get even better.

380
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:50,617
Hey, did you
hear the news?

381
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:53,078
The Shinpaku Alliance
was almost annihilated!

382
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:55,247
Yeah, I heard!
Man, that's crazy!

383
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:57,666
Those Ragnarok guys
aren't playing around.

384
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,710
Yeah but I also heard that
all the members of the alliance

385
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,837
are okay- so no one
really got hurt.

386
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:03,297
Jeez, boys are stupid...!

387
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:04,882
It's all they've
been talking about.

388
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:07,259
I really hope nothing's
happened to Kenichi...

389
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:08,260
It's been a long time
since he's been

390
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,928
to the gardening club.

391
00:20:09,928 --> 00:20:11,388
I heard that Ragnarok's
patrolling the streets

392
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:12,681
looking for him!

393
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:13,807
Oh, poor guy!

394
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:30,616
I never thought
I'd say this

395
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:32,910
but it's kinda lonely here
without these idiots.

396
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:40,083
Captain Tanimoto...!

397
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,418
I'm so happy you've
decided to join us!

398
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:45,547
Would you let go of me!
You've got the wrong idea!

399
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:47,591
Jeez... I came to enjoy
the peace and quiet

400
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:49,009
now that you've
been dispersed.

401
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:50,052
What are you
talking about? !

402
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,720
The Shinpaku Alliance
hasn't been dispersed!

403
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,139
In fact, we could really
use your help right now!

404
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:55,724
How many times do I have
to tell you I don't wanna

405
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:57,810
join your gang of losers-
I'm not interested!

406
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,228
Okay, but...

407
00:20:59,228 --> 00:21:00,646
Whether you join or not
we'll still consider you

408
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:02,606
a member because we all
think you're pretty awesome!

409
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:05,067
Here's a map of
the building

410
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:06,652
where the Commander
is hiding for now...

411
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:08,153
I know you're not
an official member

412
00:21:08,153 --> 00:21:09,905
but I think I can
trust you with this.

413
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:10,989
-Why the hell--?
-See ya...

414
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:12,366
Captain Tanimoto...

415
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:13,825
Shinpaku!

416
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:14,785
Wait!

417
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:17,037
I just came to get
the Commander's PDA...

418
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:18,330
We're planning
to counterattack

419
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,165
whenever Captain
Shirahama gets back.

420
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:30,259
-Big nose?
-Gray!

421
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:33,011
Access granted.
Come on in.

422
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:34,972
Got your PDA sir...
It was at school.

423
00:21:34,972 --> 00:21:36,390
Who's there? !

424
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,433
Hey...! Koga the
kicker's back everybody!

425
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:40,644
He's all that's left
of Kisara's squad...

426
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:43,230
Turns out the little guy was
playing dead the whole time.

427
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,439
I see...

428
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:46,149
I brought something
for you, Commander.

429
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:47,734
The guys told me you're
really into Space Cola

430
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:49,194
so I got you a bottle...

431
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:50,404
This stuff's hard to find-

432
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:51,822
it took me forever
to hunt it down.

433
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:53,031
Why thank you very much-

434
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:54,950
that's so thoughtful
of you...

435
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,159
Still I gotta wonder
why you were asking

436
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,869
about my favorite soda.

437
00:21:57,869 --> 00:21:59,955
It just came up
in conversation.

438
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,375
Wanna tell me why the
cap's already open...?!

439
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,252
You should give it a
little taste test for me!

440
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,255
Why'd you make me
drink that crap? !

441
00:22:13,302 --> 00:22:15,429
Where's the bathroom? !

442
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:17,514
Jerk... He put
laxatives in it...

443
00:22:17,514 --> 00:22:19,808
Go lock all the doors
and bunker down, Matsui!

444
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:22,352
Yes, sir...! But why so
urgent all of a sudden?!

445
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:29,234
We've got a
big problem...

446
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:31,278
Ragnarok's found
our hiding place.

447
00:22:36,658 --> 00:22:37,909
Where's the bathroom? !

448
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:39,703
Over there, you dumb ass.

449
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:42,664
That kid's a useless spy
he barely bought us any time.

450
00:22:42,664 --> 00:22:44,958
We've got them trapped
like rats in a cage...

451
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,335
That's right...

452
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:47,836
no gettin' away this time.

453
00:22:47,836 --> 00:24:13,338
[Music]

454
00:24:18,301 --> 00:24:19,803
What's the
matter, Kenichi?

455
00:24:19,803 --> 00:24:21,221
Why are just
staring blankly

456
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:22,681
at your cell phone like that?

457
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:23,932
Oh, I'm sorry-

458
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:25,767
it's just that I got
an email from Niijima

459
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:26,727
that's kinda
freaking me out.

460
00:24:26,727 --> 00:24:27,978
I don't know what
to make of it.

461
00:24:27,978 --> 00:24:29,646
Let me take a look at it.

462
00:24:29,646 --> 00:24:31,481
Hmm... That is a
strange email.

463
00:24:31,481 --> 00:24:32,816
I wonder what happened.

464
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:34,860
I don't get it.
He's never leak his plans.

465
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,319
Even if he had to die
to protect them-

466
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,571
he'd take them to the grave.

467
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:39,406
You know, the more
I look at this

468
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:41,199
the more it reads
like a will.

469
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,075
A will...?!

470
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:43,910
Oh no! Don't tell me
something happened to him

471
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,828
while I was gone!

472
00:24:44,828 --> 00:24:46,246
I gotta go back!

473
00:24:46,246 --> 00:24:47,205
Niijima!
