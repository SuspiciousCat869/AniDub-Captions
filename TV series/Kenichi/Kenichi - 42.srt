[Music]

2
00:01:53,798 --> 00:01:54,966
Attack!

3
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:56,217
Not happenin'.

4
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:02,056
Kenichi, I appreciate the fact

5
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,308
that you're so dedicated to
your training these days...

6
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:06,644
but this is dumb.

7
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:08,521
I'm sure losing that
fight to the First Fist

8
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:10,773
was a bit of a letdown...

9
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:12,400
But that attitude isn't
helping your form.

10
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:16,153
I didn't lose exactly...

11
00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:17,905
I just let him win.

12
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,658
Mustache Man- that
wasn't very nice.

13
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:22,618
Yes. I know.

14
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:25,788
Naked, naked,
naked, naked WOMEN!

15
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:27,206
Attack!

16
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:28,416
Not now.....!
I'm busy!

17
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:33,629
Hey you pervert!

18
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:36,048
Get back here and
apologize to my big brother!

19
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:37,466
Dude... This is sad...

20
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:38,968
I think you're at your
limit, little man,

21
00:02:38,968 --> 00:02:40,970
you might wanna take a
breather for a while.

22
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,680
Master...!
Tell me, is it true

23
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,682
I have no talent at
all for martial arts??

24
00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:46,183
Yes. That's true.

25
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:47,727
And you guys have taught
me everything you could

26
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:49,270
while I've been
at Ryouzanpaku,

27
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,939
so basically the only reason
I lost was because I suck.

28
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,524
Well, I can't argue
with any of that.

29
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,569
You're mean!

30
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:58,738
Sorry, I don't
believe in lying.

31
00:02:58,738 --> 00:02:59,989
Ryuto...

32
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:01,907
He said...

33
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:04,118
He said the reason I
won't win is because...

34
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,327
My naĂŻve personality

35
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:07,830
makes all my martial arts
training pointless.

36
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,915
So I wanted to learn to
put more killing intent

37
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:11,417
into my attacks.

38
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,794
No. That's where
you'd be wrong.

39
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:16,881
Yay!

40
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:18,549
Hi! I'm glad you're here.

41
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:20,760
My brother screwed up and
you need to fix it...

42
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,052
Okay, grandpa??

43
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:23,763
'Kay... You'll
leave it to me??

44
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:25,389
Yup... Make me proud!

45
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:29,727
How about it, Kenichi...?

46
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:31,395
What would you say to
some one-on-one training

47
00:03:31,395 --> 00:03:32,813
with an old man like me??

48
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:36,484
You're kiddin'... This guy??

49
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:37,777
In all the years
I've known him,

50
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:40,321
he's never taken
on a disciple.

51
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,530
I think our young friend

52
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,532
could use a different style
of training for a while,

53
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:45,659
just to shake things up,
don't you agree??

54
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,453
And I even know of
a special training

55
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:48,746
place to take you, Kenichi...

56
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:50,956
So whaddaya say?
You gonna give me a shot?

57
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:53,125
If you think it'll give me a
chance to beat the First Fist,

58
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,002
I'm not afraid to face
any kind of training

59
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,045
you throw at me!

60
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:57,088
That right...?

61
00:03:57,088 --> 00:03:58,798
Not afraid at all, are you...?

62
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:01,675
Is that the story you're
sticking with??

63
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,552
No... Sorry...
I'm scared.

64
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:05,638
Really. Really, really.

65
00:04:05,638 --> 00:04:07,181
I'm just kidding...

66
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,891
No reason to
be scared, son.

67
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:12,436
Right... There is definitely
a reason to be scared.

68
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:14,104
Scared or not...

69
00:04:14,104 --> 00:04:16,106
I just hope he comes
back in one piece.

70
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,695
Meanwhile...
the Shinpaku Alliance...

71
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:26,575
Singin'
Ragnarok, oh Ragnarok,

72
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:28,661
we're gonna stomp you
in the face... hey...!

73
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,246
Stomp you in the face...

74
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:31,539
stomp you in the face...

75
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,165
Break it down, Siegfried.

76
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,044
-Would ya shut up!
-No.

77
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,629
So alien...

78
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,714
you really believe you're
gonna be able to keep this chat

79
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,299
we're having with
Kisara peaceful...?

80
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,926
What makes you
think that...?

81
00:04:43,926 --> 00:04:45,302
Good karma??

82
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:47,680
Duh... Isn't it obvious...?

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,682
I'll make her a
simple, fair trade.

84
00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:50,850
Like I said...

85
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,227
We're just here to
have a cozy chat.

86
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,272
What do you think of
my photography...?

87
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,898
I think I'm pretty talented.

88
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,775
So what is it that
you want from me...?

89
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,818
Do you want money??

90
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:03,070
No! You misunderstand...!

91
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,364
We just have a tiny,
little request.

92
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:07,032
Yeah? What kinda request??

93
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:09,827
Well... If you don't want
those incriminating photos

94
00:05:09,827 --> 00:05:11,453
spread all over
the city...

95
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:13,622
Then you're
going to join us!

96
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:15,374
What...?..?...!
That's blackmail!

97
00:05:15,374 --> 00:05:17,418
Or I could just
kill you right now!

98
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:18,586
This is going
too far.....!...

99
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,254
What's in those
photos anyway.....?...

100
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,130
Show me!

101
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,131
Whoops.....!...

102
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:24,049
My hand slipped.

103
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:25,467
-Help me pick 'em up!
-Right!

104
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,761
Oh... So Kisara likes cats.

105
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,347
Yep! And as long as
I have these files,

106
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:32,558
I can print as much
proof of it as I want!

107
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:33,851
But if she pledges
her allegiance

108
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,603
to the Shinpaku Alliance...

109
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,354
I will lock her dirty
little secret in a vault

110
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:39,315
and throw away the key.

111
00:05:39,315 --> 00:05:40,566
Shall I kill him now??

112
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,569
But it doesn't matter
if they kill me or not,

113
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:44,945
isn't that right,
Siegfried...?

114
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,532
Because only we know
where the master...

115
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:50,034
-Hey! Give me that thing!
-What are you doing, you idiot!

116
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,577
You weren't supposed
to bring that!

117
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,750
Forgive me,
my wise commander...

118
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,085
But I've also deleted the
backup files of her pictures

119
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:01,128
that you had on
your computer.

120
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,130
But... why, Siggy...?

121
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,132
You were my most
faithful lackey!

122
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:09,386
No, my friend!

123
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:13,057
You will not stoop

124
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:16,185
as-low-as-Ragnarok-doooeees,
they're-jeerks.

125
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:18,145
And you are great!

126
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,480
And blackmail

127
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,898
Is way beneath you

128
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:23,567
So I will not let you do it.

129
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,486
Though I would follow you
to the ends of the earth

130
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:28,072
should you happen
to ask it of me.

131
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:29,114
But I hope

132
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,199
That you wouldn't

133
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,993
Because...

134
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,411
You see...

135
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:44,338
I have a really, really really
really really good plan

136
00:06:45,714 --> 00:06:47,091
It is quite a
grandiose plan

137
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,717
and I think you
will enjoy it...

138
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:51,053
My demon king.

139
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:52,930
That... was beautiful.

140
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,598
Grandiose...

141
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:56,016
I like that...

142
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,309
sounds kingly...

143
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,936
You may continue,
my subject.

144
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:00,771
Sir.

145
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:02,147
Listen Valkyrie...

146
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:04,566
From the moment you became
a member of Ragnarok

147
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:06,610
I could see that you were
diligently trying to suppress

148
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,487
your warm and
loving melody.

149
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:09,613
And now...

150
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:12,074
Without the organization
of Ragnarok...

151
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:14,743
your team is just a
cacophony of delinquents.

152
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:17,705
It will be dangerous
for all of you,

153
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:19,915
out there on your own
without protection...

154
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:21,625
Now is the time
to join us!

155
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,793
For your loyalty...

156
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:23,752
your friendship...

157
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:25,963
We offer... This
adorable kitten!

158
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,926
I know you're not
allowed to have pets...

159
00:07:30,926 --> 00:07:32,803
but I'll make you
a glorious deal...

160
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:35,180
There's room
in my house...

161
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,392
I'll let you keep the kitten
there for now if you want...

162
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,185
I already have 20
other dogs and cats

163
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:41,437
so it won't make
much difference

164
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:44,231
and you can come play with
it whenever you so desire.

165
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,315
Sure! Fine! Whatever!

166
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:47,651
Just give me that kitty!

167
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:50,279
Ah.....!... an
exploitation of weakness.

168
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,614
Soooo cuuuuutee...

169
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:54,074
I also have a
fluffy one...

170
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,868
and a hairless one
if you'd rather.

171
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:57,703
What are you a
magician now, Siggy??

172
00:07:57,703 --> 00:07:58,954
Whatever, it worked...!

173
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:00,039
Good job.

174
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:06,253
This is embarrassing
to watch even for me.

175
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:09,173
Hah! Like I even care
about a bunch of cats!

176
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:10,424
Too late for
that, sweetie.

177
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:11,925
Nice try.

178
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,886
Sure... I mean who could
think about kittens

179
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:15,763
at a time like this, right?

180
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:18,015
what with the
Second Fist coming.

181
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,141
So he is on the move!

182
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:22,144
The Second Fist...

183
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:23,562
He's known as Berserker.

184
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:26,774
The fiercest of the
Three of Cards...

185
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,942
And he's making his
move to wipe us out...

186
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,819
Doesn't look good...

187
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:33,697
A truce between us is
inevitable, Kisara...

188
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:35,699
For your own protection.

189
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:37,493
I normally only shake
the hands of people

190
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:39,036
who have defeated
me in a fight,

191
00:08:39,036 --> 00:08:41,914
but I guess I have to make
an exception this time...

192
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:43,082
We have a truce.

193
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:47,795
Well then, we're off...

194
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:50,255
We should be back in
about a week I think...

195
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:52,424
But... I guess that's
up to Kenichi.

196
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:53,675
Be careful...

197
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:55,135
And you just try
your hardest, 'kay??

198
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,553
It's a rare opportunity

199
00:08:56,553 --> 00:08:58,722
to train with someone of
the old man's caliber...

200
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:00,724
So you better not
waste it, you hear me??

201
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:03,394
Apachai wants to go to
the secret training place!

202
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:04,853
You can't go...!

203
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:06,271
You're in charge of watching
over the house with me!

204
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:07,981
Did you already forget??

205
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,316
Elder... Can you tell us

206
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,527
where you're taking Kenichi
for this training??

207
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:13,487
We're going to the
heart of Japan...

208
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,072
A place still untainted

209
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:17,616
by the ravages of
development and industry.

210
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:20,411
You don't mean...
The Dark Valley??

211
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:22,079
Why? Would that be so bad??

212
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,456
No... No...

213
00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:26,500
He's taking quite a risk...

214
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,127
Bringing him to a place

215
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:31,755
where even the smallest misstep
can lead to disaster...

216
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:34,258
We'll just have to put
our trust in Kenichi now.

217
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:36,510
-So, we ready??
-Yep!

218
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,178
Kenichi...!

219
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,179
No matter what happens,

220
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,764
don't forget to
believe in yourself.

221
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:42,641
And trust your training
to see you through.

222
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:44,184
Thanks... I'll remember!

223
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,190
Good luck, bro...! Bye!!

224
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,650
Come back safely...

225
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,443
our number one disciple!

226
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:11,822
Jeez! Odin sure likes to
make his own moves, huh??

227
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:14,825
Of course, he did say he
wanted Shirahama left alone...

228
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:17,870
Yet he still wants us to get rid
of the Shinpaku Alliance...

229
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,080
If he'd just let me
finish the kid off...

230
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,999
we might not have lost four
of our strongest fighters

231
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:23,334
to a bunch of
high school kids,

232
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:24,543
you know what I'm sayin'?

233
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:27,546
I mean, it's a pity all

234
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:30,132
the decisions for Ragnarok
are up to him...

235
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:32,927
right, Berserker??

236
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:34,720
Got him!

237
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,014
So, hey... whaddaya think...?

238
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:40,601
You wanna make this hand a
little more interesting??

239
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:41,894
Sure...

240
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:44,355
What do you have in mind??

241
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:46,524
Let's play for the new
leadership position...

242
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:49,026
In the Raganrok we're gonna
form after Odin's gone.

243
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:51,737
Hah...! Oh I'm
just kidding...

244
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:53,155
don't worry.

245
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:54,573
I wasn't worried.

246
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:57,326
Well, that's good...

247
00:10:57,326 --> 00:10:59,203
I'm glad we're both
on the same page...

248
00:10:59,203 --> 00:11:00,746
I'll just take one.

249
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:04,708
Muscle-bound idiot...!

250
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,962
Loki's a pro at making
the game go his way.

251
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:09,213
Wouldja look at that...

252
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:12,633
It's four of a kind!

253
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:14,510
Hold on... where're
you going...?

254
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,136
Don't you want
another chance??

255
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:19,557
I'm going to look for
the Shinpaku Alliance...

256
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:21,058
like Odin said...

257
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:23,060
'less you happen to have
them up your sleeve, too.

258
00:11:25,104 --> 00:11:27,398
Damn... That sly bastard...

259
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:28,649
Hard to tell what
he's thinking

260
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:30,317
when he just sits
there chewing his gum

261
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:31,652
and refusing to talk.

262
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:36,240
Oh well...
What did he have?

263
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:40,119
He got a royal flush!

264
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:44,331
Hey? What's wrong...?
What'd he do??

265
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:45,666
I stacked the deck and

266
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,294
he still got lucky
enough to beat me.

267
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:52,256
He's got a godly physique
and an ungodly talent...

268
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:55,634
add to that his ability to
stay cool in a crisis...

269
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:57,761
And there's no
doubt about it...

270
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:59,555
Berserker's
definitely the man

271
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:02,349
to lead the New Ragnarok
to greatness!

272
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:04,810
Ah!

273
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,020
Stop! Stop!

274
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,479
I'm falling!

275
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:09,732
Just keep quiet
and hang on!

276
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:11,942
Sorry Kenichi, but if
we went at your pace

277
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:13,569
I'd probably die of old age

278
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:15,070
before we got to
where we're going!

279
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:23,370
This is it...
we're here.

280
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,498
The place I trained
when I was a disciple.

281
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:28,417
This is the heart of Japan...!

282
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:31,337
The Dark Valley.

283
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:32,755
Three hours on
the train...

284
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:34,048
Two hours on a bus...

285
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:35,674
then four hours on
the Elder's back...

286
00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:37,843
How can we still
be in Japan??!

287
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:39,970
We're surrounded by
mountains on each side...

288
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,723
This forest is far
from civilization...

289
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:45,225
which means it's removed
from the safety of urban life.

290
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:49,438
It's weird. The air feels really
different in this place.

291
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:51,357
Good. You noticed it...

292
00:12:51,357 --> 00:12:54,109
The valley air is
thick with humidity.

293
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:55,527
If you train in
these conditions,

294
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:56,945
your wounds heal faster,

295
00:12:56,945 --> 00:13:00,908
and your level of concentration
increases exponentially.

296
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:03,869
That's why the legendary martial
arts masters we learn about

297
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:06,830
did their early training in
the surrounding mountains.

298
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,749
Maybe that's true, but your
main reason for coming here

299
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,668
was to make sure you cut
off any escape route

300
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:12,419
I could use to get away
from you, wasn't it?

301
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:15,464
Such a smart boy!

302
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:16,840
What kind of
training is it

303
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,093
that you're so sure I'm
gonna want to run away?!

304
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:21,929
It'll be a bit hard for you in
your current state of mind.

305
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:23,764
If it'll help me beat the
First Fist in a fight,

306
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:25,140
I'll withstand anything!

307
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:32,648
Fine. Then I want
you to do nothing.

308
00:13:32,648 --> 00:13:34,233
So for the rest
of this week...

309
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,360
You will not use
martial arts...

310
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,404
You will do no
training whatsoever.

311
00:13:38,404 --> 00:13:40,114
What?! No way...!

312
00:13:40,114 --> 00:13:43,033
Training is why I came to
this god-forsaken place!

313
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,284
It is...?

314
00:13:44,284 --> 00:13:46,161
I thought you came
out here for me...

315
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:48,414
But I guess if that's how
you really feel about it-

316
00:13:48,414 --> 00:13:51,375
You can just head back the way
we came on your own, okay...?

317
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,419
I'm pretty sure you won't be
able to find it yourself,

318
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:54,837
but oh well.

319
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:57,381
As long as you don't run
into any of the wild bears

320
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:58,841
that roam these mountains,

321
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:01,760
you'll probably last
at least three days.

322
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,803
Maybe two.

323
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:05,264
He's the devil.

324
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:07,766
I know what I'm
talking about.

325
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,518
Why don't you just
trust me, Kenichi??

326
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,856
Finding firewood,
douching water.

327
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:17,401
He didn't bring
me here to train,

328
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:19,528
he brought me here
for a camping trip.

329
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:21,113
How'm I supposed
to beat Ryuto

330
00:14:21,113 --> 00:14:23,490
when I'm lounging around
here doing nothing...?

331
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,576
Maybe I should do some
training in secret!

332
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:28,662
What's that??

333
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:29,997
Did I just imagine it??

334
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:31,373
Hey! Kenichi!

335
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:32,583
What are you doing?

336
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,294
Where's my firewood??

337
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:36,962
Oh. Sure, that's convenient.

338
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:40,674
Something wrong, boy??

339
00:14:40,674 --> 00:14:41,884
Oh, uh...

340
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:42,634
No.

341
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:50,934
How did you forget
food.....?..?...!

342
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:52,686
If you thought we were
gonna catch fish everyday,

343
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:54,188
why didn't you
bring a pole?!

344
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:55,773
It's too late now...

345
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:57,649
If we don't catch something
before it gets dark,

346
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,485
we'll be going
hungry til morning.

347
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:04,198
At least I don't have
to worry about a rematch

348
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:05,991
if I die of hunger first!

349
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,037
Ooh, that's right,
Elder...!...

350
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:11,413
Show the bears
how it's done!

351
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,418
Alright, heading
back to camp.

352
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:18,086
Yeah, I think
I will, too...

353
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:20,422
That should be enough for the
both of us, shouldn't it??

354
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:22,883
Huh? Oh no, this is just
enough for my dinner.

355
00:15:25,427 --> 00:15:27,221
We each take care
of our own meals

356
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:28,555
when we're camping.

357
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:33,727
How the hell did he catch
those fish.....?..?...!

358
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,020
This is so stupid!

359
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,151
What, no luck Kenichi...?

360
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:42,819
Well, if you can't
catch any fish

361
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:44,905
you might look for something
to eat in the forest.

362
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:46,823
Okay.

363
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:55,290
A walnut...!

364
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,167
Yes!

365
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,962
There's more over here...!
And here...! More!

366
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:01,421
I'll just eat
them later...

367
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:02,631
First I have to
bury my stash

368
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:05,133
so the Elder doesn't
take them away from me!

369
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:07,511
My brother...
the squirrel.

370
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:11,056
What is that??!

371
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:13,809
Ever since I got here,
something's felt...

372
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:14,518
weird.

373
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:21,775
That's a Devil Walnut...

374
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:23,110
Not much meat, anyway.

375
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:26,822
I've officially burned
all the calories

376
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:28,073
this would've given me...

377
00:16:28,073 --> 00:16:30,659
I hate this!

378
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:31,868
Well, I'm tuckered out...

379
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:33,370
Goodnight, Kenichi.

380
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,830
Yeah, right, whatever.

381
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:38,584
There, that should do it.

382
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:39,710
Damn him...

383
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,878
The Elder must be getting
softer in his old age...

384
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:44,131
I can't just give up on my
training right now...!

385
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:45,757
Not til I beat him!

386
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:57,631
Look, Kenichi's
bowl just broke...!

387
00:16:57,631 --> 00:16:59,258
Great... that's not good.

388
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:01,093
You just leave
it to Apachai...!

389
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:04,263
I'll do my
super-duperdeluxe prayer!

390
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:05,514
That's not a prayer.

391
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:06,724
It's a curse.

392
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:09,060
Oh... His teacup's
broken, too.

393
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:13,064
You see...?

394
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:15,107
This is what happens
when you disobey me

395
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:16,776
and start training in
the middle of the night!

396
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:19,278
You end up exhausted
and starving...

397
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:21,572
You should pay more attention
to your master's instructions.

398
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:23,532
How does he know??

399
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,367
Now you listen to me...

400
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:28,162
Mountain training is a survival
test for a martial artist,

401
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:30,247
not something to be
treated lightly.

402
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:31,832
You may have to eat
bark or insects

403
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:33,334
to keep yourself alive...

404
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:35,461
You have no idea how the
mountain will choose

405
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:37,088
to test your character.

406
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:38,839
Do you understand
what I'm saying...?

407
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,633
Good. Then go
catch some fish.

408
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:48,015
I tried.

409
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:54,063
I've had nothing but
walnuts for three days.

410
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:55,356
Did you know that, buddy?

411
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:56,607
Walnuts sure
are nutritious.

412
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:57,817
You know how I know that?

413
00:17:57,817 --> 00:18:00,111
Cause I'm still
alive, that's how.

414
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:02,905
You must really love
those walnuts, Kenichi...

415
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:05,282
You look more like a
squirrel every day!

416
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:07,785
No! I do not love
these walnuts...!

417
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:11,080
They're just the only things I
can find in this stupid forest!

418
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,915
That's just because you
haven't figured out

419
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:14,333
how to look for it, my boy...

420
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,876
The Dark Valley is endowed

421
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:18,045
with a number of tasty,
filling tidbits.

422
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:24,218
-See??
-Wha??!

423
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:26,262
So, Elder...

424
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:28,889
How 'bout you share some of that
plentiful harvest with me??

425
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:31,767
No! This is an important
part of training!

426
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,811
I miss Miu's cooking!

427
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:37,857
What is that?
What is it?!

428
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:40,025
I've been feeling it
ever since I got he...

429
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:44,822
Yes, attack!

430
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:49,952
You certainly have guts,

431
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:51,287
trying to steal my
hard earned food,

432
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:52,455
I'll give you that...

433
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:54,456
Might as well wrestle a
mama bear for her cub,

434
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:56,083
you silly boy.

435
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,084
Are you...

436
00:18:57,084 --> 00:18:58,669
gonna eat the bones??

437
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:00,129
Calcium, yum!

438
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:03,174
Food!

439
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:07,678
It feels like you're
a wild animal

440
00:19:07,678 --> 00:19:09,805
and I'm a trainer
in the circus!

441
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:11,599
Come back here!

442
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,893
Oooh! Bet you
can't catch me!

443
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:16,187
Stop! If I can't catch you

444
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:19,106
then I'll have to stop
you like this!

445
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:20,316
Not bad, Kenichi!

446
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:21,317
Good arm!

447
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:23,027
Get back here, you jerk!

448
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:28,741
Totally lost him.

449
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:32,703
Speaking of lost...

450
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:33,996
where am I??

451
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:35,497
My brother...

452
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:36,957
in trouble.

453
00:19:36,957 --> 00:19:40,169
I'm so hungry I feel like
I'm gonna pass out...

454
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:43,088
I don't see how this can even
be considered training...

455
00:19:43,088 --> 00:19:45,382
I mean the other Masters
were pretty tough...

456
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:47,051
but at least with
them I usually knew

457
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:48,844
what they were
trying to teach me.

458
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:50,471
I better keep
looking for camp.

459
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:56,185
I wish I'd thought to bring

460
00:19:56,185 --> 00:19:58,270
Diagakukan's survival
guide with me.

461
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:09,990
It's late...

462
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:14,662
Wait...!
Didn't the Elder say

463
00:20:14,662 --> 00:20:16,455
this forest is full of
tasty filling treats

464
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:17,915
if you know where to look??

465
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:32,012
Not... so tasty.

466
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:37,893
Come back! Come back
here so I can eat you!

467
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:44,984
Master...? C'm out here!

468
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:51,907
Is this where
I'm gonna die??

469
00:20:58,414 --> 00:21:00,457
Kenichi's other
bowl is broken...

470
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:02,293
It broke right
into halvies.

471
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:03,460
Uh oh...

472
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,463
His chopsticks are
broken now... look.

473
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:07,756
Ominous...

474
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:08,924
Okay. That's it.

475
00:21:08,924 --> 00:21:11,093
This is just getting
freaky you guys.

476
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:16,181
Akisame... what do you
know about this place??

477
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,599
Oh, I don't
know anything...

478
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,143
Nothing at all.

479
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:20,352
Maybe not...

480
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:22,146
but when you touch your
stache like that...

481
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:25,274
it usually means you're
lyin' about somethin'.

482
00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:27,192
Akisame if you
have any inkling

483
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:29,570
of what my grandpa is up to
you better tell me right now!

484
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,738
I... don't??

485
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:32,031
Apachai wants
to know, too!

486
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:34,658
If you don't tell, I won't
play Othello with you no more!

487
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:38,662
Calm down, both of you.

488
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:41,915
We all know how stubborn
Akisame can be when he wants to.

489
00:21:41,915 --> 00:21:43,584
He's not going to
tell us any secrets,

490
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:45,377
no matter how
much we grill him.

491
00:21:45,377 --> 00:21:47,463
But... Even the
most stubborn person

492
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:49,506
must have a
weakness, right...?

493
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:50,758
Akisame...

494
00:21:50,758 --> 00:21:52,926
if you really insist on
keeping all of us worried

495
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:54,011
and in the dark...

496
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:55,346
Miu and I will
have no choice

497
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:57,931
but to serve you green bell
peppers at every meal...!

498
00:21:57,931 --> 00:21:59,683
And I'm talking main course!

499
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:02,102
How did he figure out I
don't eat green bell peppers??

500
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:03,187
Yes, that's it...!

501
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:04,605
I'll serve them until
you have peppers

502
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:05,773
coming out your ears!

503
00:22:05,773 --> 00:22:08,609
Peppers! Peppers! Peppers!

504
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,444
Peppers with rice!
Peppers in soup!

505
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:12,446
Little green
pickled peppers!

506
00:22:12,446 --> 00:22:14,281
Peppers! Peppers!
Peppers! Peppers!

507
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:15,657
Peppers! Peppers!
Peppers! Peppers!

508
00:22:15,657 --> 00:22:16,784
That's enough.

509
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:19,995
I have thought
long and hard about

510
00:22:19,995 --> 00:22:22,998
whether or not to let you
all in on my suspicions...

511
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:24,958
I've decided it's
best if I don't...

512
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,252
As it would serve no
purpose at this time.

513
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:30,089
This is a huge gamble...

514
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:33,050
If Kenichi can make it back
out of the Dark Valley whole...

515
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,386
then he will continue to
grow in strength and technique

516
00:22:35,386 --> 00:22:37,513
as a martial artist...

517
00:22:37,513 --> 00:22:39,848
However... if he ends
up getting lost...

518
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,311
the Kenichi we know
will disappear...

519
00:22:44,311 --> 00:22:45,479
forever.

520
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:51,235
[Music]

521
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,239
Wait a minute...

522
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:21,074
The Kenichi we know
will disappear...?

523
00:24:21,074 --> 00:24:22,743
What're you talking about??

524
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:24,745
There are two types
of martial artist...

525
00:24:24,745 --> 00:24:25,954
The type that remains calm

526
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:27,790
and relies on talent
and training...

527
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,291
And the type that
forgets everything

528
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,376
they know in a fight...
loses it to rage...

529
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:32,878
-We know. We know.
-So what?

530
00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:34,963
Kenichi is at a crossroads now,

531
00:24:34,963 --> 00:24:37,090
as to which type of
fighter he will become...

532
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,926
and if he loses
himself out there

533
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:40,886
and chooses the wrong path...

534
00:24:40,886 --> 00:24:42,846
Yeah...? If he chooses
the wrong path, what??

535
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:45,265
He will be consumed
by the fire and anger

536
00:24:45,265 --> 00:24:47,017
of the Asura realm.
