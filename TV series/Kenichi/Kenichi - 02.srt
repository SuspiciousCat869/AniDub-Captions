1
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:42,261
Shio Sakaki, the karate master,

2
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:45,056
known as the 100th
degree street fighter!

3
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:49,519
Apachai Hopachai, the grim
reaper of Muay Thai boxing.

4
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,523
There's no greater master of
Chinese Kenpo than Kensei Ma.

5
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:55,358
Akisame Koetsuji...

6
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:58,444
Jujutsu master and
warrior philosopher.

7
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:00,613
When it comes to handling
swords and weapons...

8
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:03,366
Shigure Kosaka's
the best there is!

9
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:06,869
Then there's me, Hayato,
elder and master of the house!

10
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,831
This is a gathering place
for martial arts masters

11
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:11,958
who have no patience
for the modern trends

12
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,836
that turn our sacred
discipline into a sport.

13
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:17,046
A place where martial
arts are treated

14
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:18,923
with the respect they demand,

15
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:21,259
a den of strength and honor,

16
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:23,553
Ryozanpaku.

17
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:33,062
I wanna go home!

18
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:34,647
Well alrighty then.

19
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:38,109
I'll run down to the kitchen
and make everybody some tea.

20
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:40,820
Please don't leave
me alone with them!

21
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,780
Is it just me, or did Miu just

22
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,490
dump this kid on
us and take off?

23
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,241
Our Miu...

24
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:47,660
She's like a child who
wants to help a bug

25
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,872
escape from a spider's web, but
when things get a little sticky,

26
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:53,750
she shows her age
by running away.

27
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,919
That was a superb analogy.

28
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,506
So, what do you think we
should do with this little bug?

29
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:03,843
Well now, I think we should
let the bug speak for himself.

30
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:07,430
Are you certain your ready
to receive our teachings?

31
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:12,268
It's a simple question
Kenichi, but I'll ask it again:

32
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:16,856
Will you devote yourself to our
training and join Ryozanpaku?

33
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:21,944
Yes, I wanna be stronger!

34
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:31,579
Excellent! Just sign your
name on this contract.

35
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,580
Sure!

36
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:35,333
You owe us tuition...

37
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,627
20,000 yen a month!

38
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:38,920
No way!

39
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:42,882
10,000, take it or leave it!

40
00:03:45,134 --> 00:03:46,552
I've got your tea.

41
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:49,931
Here you go...

42
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,641
Uh, thank you.

43
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,309
Thank you.

44
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:58,189
5,000 then. Final offer.

45
00:03:58,189 --> 00:03:59,440
Is this guy for real?

46
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,818
That's enough Kensei.
it's vulgar to beg.

47
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:04,320
Now, now, Akisame, it's alright.

48
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,489
The simple fact
of the matter is,

49
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:09,826
the dojo has been experiencing
some financial difficulty.

50
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:11,118
You've got money problems?

51
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,537
I'll take that!

52
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:13,371
Well uh,

53
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:17,124
we've managed thanks to
Miu's clever book-keeping.

54
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,626
She's only in High School

55
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,336
and she's in charge
of keeping your books?

56
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:22,046
Yes and the laundry
and the cooking

57
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:23,631
and the cleaning
and everything else.

58
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,882
Indeed, without our Miu,

59
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:28,177
we'd be a pretty pathetic
bunch of martial arts masters.

60
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:34,100
Hey!

61
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,561
Buy me some sake!

62
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:37,520
Go get it!

63
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,272
No I can't!

64
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:41,649
If I do, we won't have
any money left for food!

65
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,441
Oh Really!

66
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:45,278
Then you've left us
with no other option!

67
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:47,864
Apachai! I want you
to go pawn Miu!

68
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:48,781
Do it now!

69
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:49,866
Apa!

70
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:53,494
Kenichi, help me!

71
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,496
How can they be so cruel...

72
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,541
I'll be here every day to
protect Miu from these maniacs!

73
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,585
So tell us, what
kind of techniques

74
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:02,461
are you hoping to learn here?

75
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:05,798
Well, I've always
really liked karate...

76
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:08,342
It would be awesome if
we could start with that.

77
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,511
I told you I do not
take on disciples!

78
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,679
Actually...

79
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:14,640
I think it might be best
if you taught him, Akisame.

80
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,684
Oh, yeah? Do you think so?

81
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,019
Yes, she's right.

82
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:21,647
You have experience teaching
our disciplines, Akisame.

83
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:24,191
You will make
a fine instructor.

84
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:28,946
Besides, anyone else the boy
will be dead in a week.

85
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:31,240
Miu! Help me!

86
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,826
Don't worry Akisame's
a very good teacher

87
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:35,203
and he's a really nice man.

88
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:38,497
Really? Are you
sure about that?

89
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,082
For the most part...

90
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:41,500
So this will be the beginning

91
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,169
of your training
in the martial arts?

92
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:44,545
Uh, yes.

93
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,464
A guy at the Karate
Club wants to fight.

94
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,341
I think he's gonna kill me!

95
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:49,592
Kill him?

96
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:53,220
I see. So you've
got a bully after you.

97
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,222
I can relate.
Believe it or not,

98
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,809
I was pushed around, bullied,
and beaten up when I was a boy.

99
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,937
Well, Jujitsu is the
perfect discipline

100
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:02,939
for protecting yourself.
And don't worry,

101
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:05,733
contrary to popular belief,
I'm not a strict teacher.

102
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:06,943
Perfect!

103
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,285
Se-Sensei!

104
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:18,913
My arms are gonna break!

105
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,251
It feels like my fingers
are about to rip off!

106
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:28,089
Many have said that but
I've rarely seen it happen.

107
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:29,632
Wait, didn't you
just tell me

108
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:31,717
that you weren't a
very strict teacher?!

109
00:06:31,717 --> 00:06:33,261
Hmm?

110
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:35,304
I did, and I'm not...

111
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:36,389
really.

112
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:41,102
It this isn't strict, then
I'd hate to see what is!

113
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:50,987
Now, I think it's time we
both took a little break!

114
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:53,155
Let's take a stroll down
to Soramigaoka Park.

115
00:06:53,155 --> 00:06:55,491
Soramigaoka Park?
You can't be serious!

116
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,702
That's like three
train stops away.

117
00:06:57,702 --> 00:06:59,453
Wait, are you telling
me I'm supposed

118
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:00,413
to pull this thing--

119
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:02,873
Noooo!

120
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:04,208
You'll run!

121
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,253
You're slow!

122
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:09,338
You're like a turtle!
Now run faster!

123
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:12,133
He's evil!

124
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:15,011
I've met snails that can
run faster than you.

125
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:16,387
Pick up the pace!

126
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:18,264
We'll see you guys later!

127
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:27,440
Well, since it's the first day I
decided to take it easy on you.

128
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,067
Today was light, but
tomorrow's a different story

129
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,318
so get plenty of rest.

130
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,280
As soon as the sun comes up,
we begin your real training.

131
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,364
'Night.

132
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:40,161
He calls this light?

133
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:43,289
He treats me worse than any
bully I've come across!

134
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:44,707
I'm gonna quit!

135
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:45,833
I'm gonna--

136
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:51,380
Hey, Kenichi!

137
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:53,215
I know this is really tough,

138
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:55,885
but I hope you'll give
it your best tomorrow.

139
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:09,023
On second thought, I don't
think I'll quit after all.

140
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:12,777
Apachai is so nice that
he made you a walking cane!

141
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:14,111
Buh-bye!

142
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:17,031
Who would've thought a brute
like him had a sensitive side.

143
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:18,532
What a nice guy!

144
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:23,079
Maybe I shoulda' tried
Muay Thai boxing instead...

145
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,830
Your head's too high!

146
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,500
Keep your hips down low!

147
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,709
Much better.

148
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:32,254
Now, shuffle your feet quickly
and move between the posts!

149
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:34,465
This is harder than it looks!

150
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:37,259
How much longer do I have
to keep doing this?!

151
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,345
It's been nothing but muscle
training for two days straight!

152
00:08:39,345 --> 00:08:40,596
Enough's enough!

153
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:44,266
When are you gonna start
teaching me jujitsu?

154
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:45,810
Regardless of what
you might think,

155
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,269
building your
strength is the key.

156
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,355
no matter how skilled
or trained he might be,

157
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:51,690
an ant can't defeat
an elephant, can he?

158
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,610
Wait a minute are you
comparing me to an ant?

159
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,278
Perhaps that was insensitive.

160
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:58,239
That analogy is unfair...

161
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,240
...to the ant.

162
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,783
Now you're just
making fun of me!

163
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:02,993
I wanna quit, do you hear
me, I've had enough!

164
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:06,413
Kenichi listen. Despite of its
meager size, an ant possesses

165
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,125
the power to carry items several
times its own weight.

166
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,169
There is much you could
learn from an ant.

167
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,130
Um, I know I'm kind of small

168
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,215
and I'm not the
strongest guy around...

169
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:19,593
but I'm willing to learn if
you'll tell me what's next!

170
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,512
Well, let's take
a little break.

171
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:25,641
Alright now get back to work!

172
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:28,686
It was a great idea

173
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:31,021
to pick Akisame as
his first instructor.

174
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:33,816
He's giving him
excellent guidance.

175
00:09:33,816 --> 00:09:35,109
He has disciple...

176
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:37,111
Lucky!

177
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,112
Moving on.

178
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:40,573
You will now begin your
training in Muay Thai Boxing.

179
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:41,615
Fun, yes?

180
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,576
I think I heard my spine break!

181
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:46,787
Hmm. Maybe I should teach
him a few pointers myself.

182
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:50,458
I really don't think my body was
designed to contort like this!

183
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,668
You know you're a
very fortunate boy

184
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:55,462
to have such amazing
resources at your disposal.

185
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,174
Even a king would be lucky
to have so many masters.

186
00:09:58,174 --> 00:10:00,509
You call this lucky?!

187
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,640
I better hurry--

188
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,684
So tell us the plan Daimonji,

189
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,352
are you really gonna
fight him, huh?

190
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:12,229
You might wanna take
it easy on the kid.

191
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:14,148
You'll break those weak knees
if you're not careful.

192
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,649
Taking it easy ain't my style.

193
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,152
we can't have a weakling
like him hanging around.

194
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:21,071
The Koryo Karate Club has a
rep, and I'm gonna keep it.

195
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:24,533
Shirahama's a dead man. I'm
gonna beat that little twerp

196
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,660
into a pulp and make sure
he never steps foot

197
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,912
inside our dojo again!

198
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:29,580
Sounds like a plan to me.

199
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,040
You noticed little sissy boy

200
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,083
hasn't shown his face
around here lately, right?

201
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,460
Yeah, he's prob'ly at home

202
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,712
hidin' under his covers,
wetting his bed!

203
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,095
I've gotta do something
to help Kenichi.

204
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:51,523
It's a miracle that
I didn't die today.

205
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:53,233
Hey Kenichi.

206
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:54,985
Miu, what's up?

207
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:56,069
I'm glad I caught you.

208
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,155
I have a couple things
I wanted to show you.

209
00:10:58,155 --> 00:10:59,531
What? Are you gonna teach me

210
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:00,991
some cool fighting
moves or something?

211
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,577
Well, sort of, but it's
more like a way of walking.

212
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:04,369
Oh...

213
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:05,704
It's called the
"stepping method".

214
00:11:05,704 --> 00:11:08,331
I want you to watch me
while I do it first, 'kay?

215
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:09,499
Alright.

216
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:12,169
See that?

217
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:14,671
When the toes come together
it's called "kouho".

218
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:17,674
And when you pivot out
it's called it "haiho".

219
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:19,259
Uh, okay.

220
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,013
You know, it might be easier
if I just let you try it.

221
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:23,930
Here's what we'll do;

222
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,225
this might seem weird but
I want you to attack me.

223
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:28,351
I won't do it...

224
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:30,062
If you think I'm the kind of guy

225
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:32,189
that would hit a girl then
you're nuts. Forget it!

226
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:34,941
That's noble in a
weird sorta' way.

227
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:38,403
All I really want you to
do is try and touch me!

228
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:41,072
Wh-wh-wh-what? You
want me to touch you?

229
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:43,450
Yeah, just come at me and
I'll teach you a trick.

230
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,369
So I can really touch
you? Anywhere I want?

231
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:47,162
Right...

232
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:49,081
He's creeping me out.

233
00:11:58,632 --> 00:12:01,301
What the heck was that move?

234
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:03,261
Do you see what I
did to you there?

235
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:05,055
The key is how you
move your feet.

236
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:07,724
Now that I've stepped forward
with my right foot I can put

237
00:12:07,724 --> 00:12:10,352
all my weight on it and that
leaves my left foot free,

238
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:12,062
so I can pivot like this.

239
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:13,563
You're use your footing
to get around

240
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:15,148
to the other side
of your opponent.

241
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:16,608
You leave your upper
body in place

242
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:17,776
until the very last moment.

243
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:19,319
And by quickly pivoting away,

244
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:21,238
you can easily avoid
your opponent's attack.

245
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:23,198
'Kay, let's see...

246
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:27,536
I point the tip of my right
foot toward my left foot--

247
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:33,583
Right, um...

248
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:40,841
Hey, maybe we
should just focus

249
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:42,634
on moving one foot
at a time for now.

250
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:43,927
Yeah...

251
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:46,638
Just take a deep breath
and stay focused.

252
00:12:46,638 --> 00:12:49,432
If you lower your stance
you won't fall down.

253
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:56,857
I give up.

254
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:59,234
There's no way I can do this,
I don't have what it takes!

255
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:02,195
I'm gonna squash you
like a little bug!

256
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:03,947
Even if I get this down,

257
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:06,449
there's no way that I'll
ever beat Daimonji.

258
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:08,952
If that's the way you feel,
then maybe you should consider

259
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:10,829
running away while you
still have the chance

260
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:12,372
Well what am I
supposed to think?!

261
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:14,082
If I step in the ring with him,

262
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:16,001
I guarantee you I won't
make it out alive!

263
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:18,461
There's no such thing as an
absolute guarantee in fighting.

264
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:21,131
you don't know what'll
happen unless you try.

265
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:22,090
Yes I do!

266
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,675
I'm gonna get the crap
beaten outta me.

267
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:27,053
If you saw his muscles
you'd be scared too.

268
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:28,138
You're right.

269
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:31,433
The way you're acting,
you're probably gonna lose.

270
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:33,935
Try to be more optimistic.

271
00:13:33,935 --> 00:13:38,106
You haven't even fought yet and
you've already lost your spirit.

272
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:40,901
She's right, I've given up.

273
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:45,197
My entire life I've
always been a quitter.

274
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:46,239
That's right.

275
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:48,491
There's one thing I
almost forgot to tell you.

276
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:49,576
Huh?

277
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:07,761
Aw, aren't you cute.

278
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:14,351
I wonder where he is?

279
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:18,396
Kenichi's always running late,
but he's never been this late.

280
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:22,943
Maybe he's laying low for
a while to avoid that bully.

281
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:26,154
Oh well, it's his life,
he can do what he wants.

282
00:14:26,154 --> 00:14:28,865
If he decides to run away,
then that's his choice.

283
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:30,033
I can't change his mind.

284
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:30,784
Hey, look!

285
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:34,746
How creepy, what in
the world is he doing?

286
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:36,331
Kouho...

287
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:37,666
Haiho.

288
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,042
Kouho...

289
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:40,377
I didn't think you'd come.

290
00:14:40,377 --> 00:14:42,754
Hey Miu, I'm sorry
I'm running so late.

291
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:45,507
I walked all the way
from home like this.

292
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:49,177
I gave myself an extra hour but
it looks like I'm still behind!

293
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:51,513
Uh, hey Miu listen.

294
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:54,557
I'm definitely gonna be
late, so you go on ahead,

295
00:14:54,557 --> 00:14:56,059
I don't want to make you late.

296
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:57,727
You don't have to
wait for me, okay?

297
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:59,813
I'm going to walk to school
like this every day.

298
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:01,564
You're crazy if you
think I'm actually

299
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:03,066
gonna leave you by yourself.

300
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:05,902
You're my friend, I'm
staying by your side.

301
00:15:05,902 --> 00:15:09,739
I walked every day
for an entire week.

302
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:15,870
I trained hard, and pushed
myself to my limit.

303
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,248
And after a week of
blood, sweat and tears,

304
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:21,710
I was able to master
two techniques.

305
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,920
I can do this and this.

306
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,380
That's it?!

307
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,049
First I do this then
this! That's all?!

308
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:30,010
Shirahama! You've
got some nerve,

309
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,302
showing your face in my club!

310
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:34,389
Uh, well we-we agreed we'd
meet in a week so I thought--

311
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:36,141
You fool!

312
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:37,308
Go home.

313
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:38,977
There's no way you're
gonna beat me.

314
00:15:38,977 --> 00:15:40,687
You should run away
while you still can!

315
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,397
Well?!

316
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:45,108
I'll never know if I don't try.

317
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:46,693
Oh really?

318
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:51,448
Since you seem to
have a deathwish...

319
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:58,246
...I'm more than
happy to help ya.

320
00:15:58,246 --> 00:16:01,082
Alright then. I'll be the
referee for the fight.

321
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:02,709
Do it, Daimonji!

322
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:05,086
Teach him a lesson
he'll never forget!

323
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:06,296
Begin!

324
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:12,594
I'm definitely gonna die!

325
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,393
Out of bounds!

326
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:21,770
Ohh, he just totally
annihilated him!

327
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,313
Man, that was hardcore!

328
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:25,065
This is awesome!

329
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:29,152
What do you wanna do
kid? You wanna give up?

330
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:30,695
No...

331
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:32,197
No, I...

332
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:33,740
I'm not done.

333
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:39,579
Calm down. Just
keep it together.

334
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:40,747
Give it up already!

335
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:41,873
Yeah, you gotta death wish?!

336
00:16:41,873 --> 00:16:43,792
He's gonna destroy you!

337
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:44,918
Begin!

338
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:48,213
What did Miu said?

339
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:49,964
If you try to avoid an attack,

340
00:16:49,964 --> 00:16:52,550
you'll end up in an even
more dangerous position.

341
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,843
You have to step forward

342
00:16:53,843 --> 00:16:56,387
before your opponents
momentum builds, got it?

343
00:16:56,387 --> 00:16:58,848
Now remember, you have
to be sure to wait

344
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:00,809
until the last moment
before you make the move.

345
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:02,894
Step too early and
it's not gonna work.

346
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,062
That's it!

347
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:06,231
Okay.

348
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:07,398
Step...

349
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:09,109
...and pivot!

350
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,528
What? He just disappeared!

351
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:16,449
When did you--

352
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:36,427
You're gonna break your hands
on these pecs of steel.

353
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:37,929
you're gonna end
up hurting yourself

354
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:39,806
a lot more than me, punk.

355
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:41,724
You want out kid?

356
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,393
No I'm fine.

357
00:17:45,186 --> 00:17:46,354
Begin!

358
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:54,988
My attacks...

359
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:56,531
They aren't fazing him!

360
00:17:56,531 --> 00:17:58,867
You idiot!

361
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:01,995
You can dodge all day
long, but you won't win.

362
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:03,163
You can't win.

363
00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:04,122
Ya fool!

364
00:18:04,122 --> 00:18:06,291
He's right about that!

365
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,376
What am I gonna do?

366
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:22,015
You're not gonna beat me
if ya don't fight back.

367
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:26,060
I'm in trouble. If he lands
a single punch, I'm done for!

368
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,228
Oh man...

369
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:29,981
Daimonji's hits are powerful,
but the kid's just too fast!

370
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:35,111
I know. If this keeps ups
Daimonji gonna wear himself out.

371
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:37,780
He has to have had
some kind of training.

372
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,283
You really don't seem to
get it. You can side step

373
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:42,869
till' you're blue in the face,
but if you don't attack me,

374
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:44,287
you're a dead man!

375
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:47,081
He's right.

376
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:48,333
But even so...

377
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,793
I've got to keep dodging
him to stay in the fight!

378
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:52,337
He thinks he's so smart...

379
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:54,631
There's no way I'm
gonna let him beat me!

380
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:58,009
Huh?

381
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:06,100
Get up! You're making
us look bad Daimonji!

382
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,477
You're not gonna let
the kid win, are you?

383
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:10,855
Yeah man, don't give up now.

384
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:12,732
What just happened?

385
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:14,400
It was like I was able to use

386
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,028
his momentum against
him to throw him off.

387
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:20,114
That's right.

388
00:19:20,114 --> 00:19:22,325
There's one thing I
almost forgot to tell you.

389
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:24,577
The strongest, most
effective technique is one

390
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:28,414
that you can use defensively and
offensively at the same time.

391
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:35,964
Like this!

392
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:38,258
You see?

393
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:41,302
So that's what she meant...

394
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:44,225
I get it now, that's how
stepping method works.

395
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:49,383
Daimonji you sure
you wanna continue?

396
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:54,179
Now you die!

397
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,975
Now it all makes sense!

398
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:00,352
When I get back into
the right stance...

399
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:03,689
...I take an extra step forward
and push with all my weight.

400
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:05,482
Then I draw my opponent in

401
00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:08,152
using my momentum as
I return to my stance.

402
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:09,987
That way my defensive move

403
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:12,156
becomes an offensive move!

404
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:24,084
Hey, go and get me
a bucket of water!

405
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:25,085
Did you guys see that?

406
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:25,836
There's no way...

407
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:26,753
Is this for real?

408
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:28,547
He hit the ground head first!

409
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:29,590
I can't believe it!

410
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,676
That scrawny punk took him out.

411
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:35,220
Uh, did I just win?

412
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:48,358
Hey that didn't count
as a win, did it?

413
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:49,485
That was a throwing move!

414
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:50,569
You're pathetic.

415
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:52,237
The loser has
to quit the club.

416
00:20:52,237 --> 00:20:54,782
That's the promise the
two of you made, right?

417
00:20:58,535 --> 00:21:00,454
But that wasn't a
legit karate move.

418
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:02,289
The kid cheated!

419
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:04,958
Please, I just--

420
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,668
I don't wanna quit the club!

421
00:21:06,668 --> 00:21:09,963
Please don't make me
quit, karate's my life!

422
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,093
Um, I was wrong. I know
throwing moves are illegal,

423
00:21:15,093 --> 00:21:17,095
I shouldn't have done
it during a match.

424
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:20,891
He won the fight.

425
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:24,645
He beat me fair and
square so I'll leave.

426
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:26,522
Thank you very much!

427
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,530
I got kicked out of
the club after all.

428
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,156
The warrior's back.

429
00:21:37,866 --> 00:21:39,159
Leave me alone.

430
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:40,869
I'm really not in
the mood for this.

431
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:43,664
I'm just curious. How'd
the fight turn out for ya?

432
00:21:43,664 --> 00:21:45,749
I lost the match alright?

433
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:47,751
Word around the street
is you lost the match

434
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:49,211
because you made
an illegal move.

435
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:50,837
But you know I can always tell

436
00:21:50,837 --> 00:21:52,464
when someone isn't
telling the truth.

437
00:21:52,464 --> 00:21:56,385
And I think you and I both know
that's not what happened here.

438
00:21:56,385 --> 00:21:58,220
That move might have been
against tournament rules,

439
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,013
but you were forced
into a real fight.

440
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:02,641
So, no matter what anyone
says about it Kenichi,

441
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:05,269
in my humble opinion, you won.

442
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:10,023
Well thank you very much.

443
00:22:10,023 --> 00:22:12,943
hey wait, did you just
call me by my name?

444
00:22:12,943 --> 00:22:15,153
I think that's the first time
you've called me anything

445
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:17,155
other than "weak-knees",
or "sissy boy", or--

446
00:22:17,155 --> 00:22:19,783
As a reward for your
victory, I've got some info.

447
00:22:19,783 --> 00:22:21,743
The guy who refereed your
little fight session

448
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:23,996
is pretty fired up.
I think it's only right

449
00:22:23,996 --> 00:22:25,914
to give you fair warning
and let you know

450
00:22:25,914 --> 00:22:27,040
that he's gunning for you.

451
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,751
He what? Are you kidding me?!

452
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:31,628
You'll have your hands
full with that Tsukuba.

453
00:22:31,628 --> 00:22:33,672
After all, he is the
most dangerous fighter

454
00:22:33,672 --> 00:22:34,923
in the Karate Club.

455
00:22:34,923 --> 00:22:36,091
Not to mention the fact

456
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:38,176
that he's in tight
with a gang of thugs!

457
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:40,846
Sorry buddy, but you're
a dead man walking.

458
00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:47,769
No!

459
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:52,900
What am I gonna do?!

460
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:22,630
Oh man, if I have to fight this
Tsukuba guy I'm dead for sure!

461
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,674
What's the matter with
you now Kenichi?

462
00:24:24,674 --> 00:24:26,301
There's no reason to panic!

463
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:28,469
One of the seniors from the
Karate Club has challenged me

464
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:30,763
to a duel. There's no
way I can possibly win!

465
00:24:30,763 --> 00:24:32,140
I'm gonna be ripped to shreds!

466
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,433
A duel?

467
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:36,311
Well, that's quite a situation
you've gotten yourself into.

468
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:39,188
What should I do, don't
you have any advice?

469
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:41,357
The only way to win
a duel is to train!

470
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:44,569
That means 150 laps around the
neighborhood pulling tires!

471
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:47,697
But that'll kill me before I
even get the chance to fight!
