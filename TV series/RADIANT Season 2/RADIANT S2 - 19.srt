[SANTORI]
Oh, come on!

2
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:12,858
Don't tell me that finished you.

3
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:14,775
Ya should've dodged
my face easy!

4
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:17,442
Am I about to be disappointed
twice in one day?

5
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:19,942
[yells]

6
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:24,692
Your illusions are weak.

7
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,025
And furthermore,
I know how they work!

00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:30,817
[DIABAL gasps]
He crushed the stone.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,067
Seth.

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,400
Whoo! That was a
pretty fun tussle.

11
00:00:34,483 --> 00:00:36,650
It was a bit shorter than
I've grown accustomed to,

12
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,483
but we've still got some time.

13
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:42,025
Now get back up on your feet
so I can knock you down again.

14
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,525
Stand and fight!

15
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:45,983
Do it for your friends,
or for freedom,

16
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:47,983
or for the sheer thrill of it!

17
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:52,150
There's no way you're finished.

18
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:54,400
I'm sure you've got
more fight in you.

19
00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:56,358
[growls]

20
00:00:56,442 --> 00:01:00,025
You may look goofy with your
tiny horns, but you're strong.

21
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:01,650
I respect your abilities.

22
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:03,192
There are many sorcerers,

23
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:06,733
but none of them can come
close to matching your vitality.

24
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,275
That's why I hoped you'd escape
us back in Rumble Town.

25
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:14,150
If I didn't have a sorcerer like
you to chase around Pharenos,

26
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:16,400
then I would be bored
out of my mind!

27
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:18,525
Hunting sorcerers is good sport,

28
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:20,942
plus you people need
to be controlled.

29
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:22,775
Most people live in fear of you.

30
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:24,108
They'd breathe much more freely

31
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:25,983
if you were all put in chains.

32
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:28,317
And as a Thaumaturge
of the Inquisition,

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,858
it's my duty to protect people--
help them feel safe.

34
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:34,817
[SETH]
Do you think you sound noble

35
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,108
as you repeat the lies
you've been told?

36
00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:41,608
You Inquisitors don't want
people to "feel safe."

37
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:44,067
It's their fear that
gives you power.

38
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,442
[OCOHO yells]

39
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:47,650
Hurry up and kill them!

40
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,442
We'll do the same
with any other slaves

41
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:51,275
who refuse to do as
they've been told!

42
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:52,858
This ends right now.

43
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:56,983
We're offering your kind
a proper place in this world.

44
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:58,442
Why can't you see that?

45
00:01:58,525 --> 00:02:01,275
Why can't you let us choose
what to do for ourselves?

46
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:03,775
We don't have any interest
in becoming slaves!

47
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:07,067
Oh, please! What're you
getting mad at us for?

48
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,442
It's the Nemeses that made
you less than human,

49
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:11,275
we're just making do
with what's left.

50
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:14,692
[SETH]
You think we're less than human?

51
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:17,650
And don't try to act like
having magic's improved you.

52
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:20,067
I've attained a power that
makes you look weak,

53
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,150
and I did it without becoming
a monstrous hybrid.

54
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:25,942
The pinnacle of humanity
is standing right here.

55
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,817
If you disagree, then lift
your head and say so.

56
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,525
Unless you're ready
to become a slave.

57
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:34,025
Well? Are ya gonna give me
the fight I want or not?

58
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:35,858
[SETH]
You're the real slave.

59
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:37,483
What are you mumbling?

60
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:39,983
[SETH] And I'd break
your chains if I could,

61
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:42,233
but they're in your
heart and your mind.

62
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:43,900
And you put them on!

63
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,817
What? How?

64
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:51,942
Gysoni!

65
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:56,733
[chuckles]

66
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:01,067
[SETH] You can weigh us
down with shackles,

67
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,650
or toss us into cages,

68
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,567
but sooner or later...

69
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,275
...we'll break free of you!

70
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:11,067
Funny thing about the infected.
We're all survivors!

71
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,192
You could never understand
what that means.

72
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,442
[SETH] But whether
you accept us or not,

73
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:18,858
we are human!

[SETH yelling]

00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:25,608
You've got me in rapture, kid.

76
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:27,192
Somehow, I knew that
you'd be the one

77
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,858
to give me the fight
I've always yearned for!

78
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:33,317
I can't tell you how grateful I
am to have finally met a monster

79
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,692
who can best me in battle!

80
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:38,067
I'm not your damn monster.
Just a pissed off human!

[SANTORI screams]

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,275
I wish you the best, truly!

83
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:44,900
You've fulfilled my wildest
dreams and more!

84
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:50,192
By my beard, I swear!
This is my finest day!

"I Can't Hear Your Voice."

87
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,483
[NARRATOR] After a battle
both fierce and brutal,

88
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:04,025
Seth managed to defeat
the Thaumaturge Santori.

89
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:07,025
At the same time, Ocoho
cornered Baron Doussant,

the mastermind behind
the entire invasion.

91
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:12,192
It seemed for a
moment that the end

92
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:15,442
of the fighting was close
at hand, however...

How dare you defy me,
you lowly slave!

94

Give up already.

All of your schemes are
collapsing around you.

I'm gonna make you
answer for your crimes.

[DOUSSANT]
I appreciate the help, Alkon.

109
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:05,983
To be perfectly honest,
I'm surprised you made the jump.

110
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:10,150
I usually leave it to my lesser
to take the bad falls for me.

[ALKON]
Hmph.

[PAZZ]
What happened?

114
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:17,275
I think you owe us an
explanation, Baron Doussant!

115
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:19,525
You said that this country
would be ours by now,

116
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:21,400
but these people
are still fighting!

Yes, I share his concerns.

118
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,358
Why, they might even drive
back this mighty fleet.

119
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:31,608
[DOUSSANT] Relax. This land
will be ours either way.

120
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:34,858
Our propaganda has been
disseminated across Pharenos.

121
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:37,192
If the battle is lost,
we'll just call it proof

122
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:39,775
that this country's
barbaric sorcerer tyrants

123
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,608
have strength enough to
threaten the whole world.

You do know how to spin things.

Wait. What does this all mean?

Will the land be
mine soon or not?

Stop your whining, Mordred.

Once I break off the Gysoni,

you won't have to live
with this anymore.

00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,150
I guess this is what
I should've expected,

160
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:24,775
seeing as how you're
barbaric sorcerers.

161
00:09:24,858 --> 00:09:25,858
[DOC]
Think again!

162
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,525
This is only the
beginning of our plan!

163
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:29,650
[ARTO]
Make ready!

164
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:31,108

Foul Thaumaturge!

[GUEN]
You're about to see...

166
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:35,692
[ANCESTORS] ...what "barbaric
sorcerers" can do!

167
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:36,817
Huh?

168
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:41,317
Wait, don't tell me...

169
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,692
This was your plan?

170
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:50,150
They defeated him.

00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:52,567
[DOC] How's it feel to get
buried by your own power,

172
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,817
Thauma-turd?!

'Bout time I got some
respect around here!

Hey. What's this
sinister feeling?

Hm?

182
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:17,025

This bodes ill.

183
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:19,108
[ARTO]
The air grows dreadful thin.

184
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:21,942
Fantasia has ceased to
drift out of the forest.

185
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:23,817
Wh-What's happening?

186

[BRANGOIRE]
Don't tell me.

187
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,025
Is it the device Ocoho spoke of?

188
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:28,275
What kinda device?

189
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:29,817
[BRANGOIRE]
A Fantasia vacuum.

190
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,108
They must have
one in the forest.

Tell us what your

Get back here, ya brat!

195

[LANDLAKE] I'm sloshing
about in your stomach!

196

[GUEN]
My deepest condolences.

197
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:56,942
I suppose this must have
been Major Ullmina's doing.

198
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,067
[LANDLAKE]
That scamp's rather swift,

199
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,608
once he's turned his tail.

200
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:06,692
[GUEN]
Leave him.

201
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,150
Our main concern
should be disabling

202
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,567
whatever is causing this
Fantasia vacuum.

203
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,817
[ARTO]
True.

204
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,317
Though I know not how
we'll break the thing

205
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,317
if we can't use
Fantasia near it.

206

[LANDLAKE]
It matters not!

207
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:19,150
By Merlin, we're sworn
to defend this land!

208
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,900
[ARTO]
Aye. We'll find a way!

209
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:22,067
[ANCESTORS]
Right!

[DOC] N-N-N-N-N-N-No!
Hang on a minute!

211
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:27,608
Our job was to rescue the queen
and get her to safety, right?

212
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:28,775
Well, we rescued her,

213
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,567
but now we need to get
her someplace safe

214
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,025
and stay there to protect her!

215
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,608
[GUEN] Even after besting
a Thaumaturge,

216

he's still gutless at his core.

not changed a bit.

of a eunuch, so sad!

Oh, shut up!

220
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,275
What kind of an idiot would
march into danger deliberately?

Silence, knave!

What did you call me?

00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,942
[GUEN]
Enough! Time is short!

224
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:48,692
[ARTO] Shall we carry
the queen with us?

225
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,733
[GUEN]
I think we must.

We've installed the Harmonizium

228
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,608
deep in the Caillte Forest.

229

It's working as we speak.

it maintains maximum output.

Are you sure about this?

00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,192
We've been warned that
it can severely damage

I'm aware of that.

We have a duty to
avenge Colonel Santori.

236

The destruction of this
ancient forest will help

the infected to comprehend
the gravity of their crime.

238

Sorry about that.

So, what should our infantry do?

242
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,525
I see no need for
our brave soldiers

to shed any more
blood on this day.

Order all our forces
to withdraw at once.

to those who've lost their
lives in this battle today.

248
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,775
Once I've utilized my miracle,

249
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,483
I'll be exhausted,
and quite defenseless.

250
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:01,358
Please don't let the sorcerers
have their way with me.

[INQUISITION SOLDIER B]
No, ma'am. I would never.

[ULLMINA] Take strength from my
blessing and miraculously rise.

Now, use the strength I've lent

00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:53,233
You won't fool us.

268
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:55,483
You must've been brought back
the same way as the others.

00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,025
That weird light's been turning

fallen comrades and enemies
alike into bloodthirsty ghouls!

[SETH] Bloodthirsty ghouls?
What are you talking about?

00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:04,358
The light isn't
attached to this one.

273
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:06,900
Then, does that mean
you're really alive?

274
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:10,233
[SETH] Of course I am.
What kind of question is that?

275
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,608
You're saying people who died in
the battle have been moving?

No! We're surrounded!

If you can hear me,
then come meet me there!

I heard a voice as well.

From the Sidh, I think.

N' why can't I catch a break?

Jill. Myr. Please be safe!

[SOLDIER C] We can't use
magic at all anymore.

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,567
I can't even conjure a map
of the battlefield now.

from the air again.

They have that
many fresh troops?

302
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,858
[GUENOLINE] No. I don't think
"fresh" is the right word.

303
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:38,650
[ORDERIC] Regardless, we're
outnumbered, and we lack magic.

Gather up any stragglers
and fall back!

00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:03,733
[OCOHO]
Let's hurry!

315
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,567
[SETH]
Myr! Myr!

316
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:13,483
[SETH]
There he is!

317
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,192
It's not safe here!

318
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,983
C'mon! We have to leave.

319
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:20,442
[MYR]
Please don't be gone.

320
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,942
Don't leave me alone, sweet pea.

321
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,733
Talk to me.

322
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,483
[SETH gasps]

323
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,858
[SETH]
No. No...

324
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:31,942
[DOC]
Hey, Seth! What is it this ti--?

325
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:36,317
[OCOHO]
My Queen. Lord Brangoire!

326
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,317
[BRANGOIRE]
Ocoho?

327
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,650
Uh. Who is that?

328
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:42,192
--[DOC] It's me, Doc!
--You're kidding me.

329
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:45,067
[MYR]
Jill... Our babies...

330
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,067
[SETH] Hey. Didn't I heal
inside a bubble like that?

331
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,025
Indeed you did.

332
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:55,733
In that case, I kinda
feel like your kids

333
00:16:55,817 --> 00:16:57,608
are my little siblings.

334
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:58,608
[BOTH chuckle]

335
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:00,400
You can look at it like that.

336
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:03,650
Everything's related in nature,
if you think about it.

337
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:07,150
Yeah, it really is.
Thanks for everything, Myr.

338
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:10,983
[MYR]
You can't, Jill.

339
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:13,858
You can't let the humans
do this to you.

340
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:15,775
Those vicious, greedy creatures.

341
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:17,858
I'd've wiped them all
out if not for you.

342
00:17:17,942 --> 00:17:20,983
I would've cleansed this land
of their filthy race forever.

343
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:24,900
But you respected every
life. Even theirs.

344
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:27,358
"Myrddin," you said.

345
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:29,025
When you got angry with me,

346
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,442
you would always call
me by my full name.

347
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:34,275
And you would always stop me
with the same stern words.

348
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:35,817
"This land doesn't
belong to you,

349
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,025
it's for all living things."

350
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:40,817
And you were right,
Jill, I know that.

351
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,442
But you aren't around
to stop me anymore,

352
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:46,567
'cause they took you from me!

353
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,817
[growls]

354
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:52,025
[grunting]

355
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,275
[yells]

356
00:17:57,358 --> 00:18:01,317
[MYR] When the humans killed
you, they sealed their fate.

357
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,858
I swear I will avenge you. I'll
slaughter every one of them!

358
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:12,692
[SETH, MYR yell]

359
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:15,483
[MELIE] Seth! Don't let
yourself lose control!

360
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:20,817
No!

361
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,733
Wait! Seth!

362
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,983
That monster was Myr?
But how can that be?

363
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,317
[DOC] I think he just
showed us his true form.

364
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,942
We should get outta here.

365
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:35,150
[ARTO]
Is it possible? Is that--?

366
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:37,275
[LANDLAKE]
Yes. I believe it is.

367
00:18:37,358 --> 00:18:39,067
I know that name.

368
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,650
The historians say that it's
the great one's true name.

369
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,025
That creature is Merlin!

370
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:51,150
[SETH, MYR yelling]

371
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:54,025
[DIABAL] This is bad.
Seth's losing himself.

372
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:56,150
Acting like a beast.

373
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:59,525
Maybe I could slow him down
by creating a new Spectre.

374
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:02,692
No. I'd need another stone.

375
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,942
The Spectre I did make couldn't
really help him either.

376
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:07,983
Seth's been risking
his life in this battle,

377
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:10,733
and I haven't been able
to support him at all.

378
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,942
Or I could've--

379
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,317
But I lack the courage
to risk my own neck.

380
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,192
[PIODON]
Don't be so hard on yourself.

381
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:20,483
I'd say you risked plenty
when you summoned that spectre.

382
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:23,608
It's what allowed
me to find you.

383
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:25,483
[DIABAL]
Piodon.

384
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,358
Long time no see, brother.

385
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:30,358
I really have missed you.
Hope ya know that.

386
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,650
[MYR roars]

387
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:52,358
[GUEN] My strength is
fading. I feel heavy.

388
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,900
[DOC]
Oh, come on. Muscle through!

389
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:57,442
You're the ones who wanted
to come here, remember?

390
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:59,150
[LANDLAKE]
But-- By Merlin.

391
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:01,983
Without Fantasia, we're
completely powerless.

392
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,150
We can't even move.

393
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:06,608
[DOC] Hey! Don't put
all this weight on me!

394
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:09,525
You're way too heavy!
Let me out, you jerks!

395
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,775
[ARTO]
Child with the grating voice,

396
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:13,525
we leave the rest to you.

397
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:14,483
[DOC]
What are you sayin'?

398
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:17,358
My voice is beautiful! Sheesh!

399
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:19,733
Hey! Don't just leave me!

400
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:20,733
[BRANGOIRE]
That's the device!

401
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:22,150
[OCOHO]
We'll be right back, Doc!

402
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,025
[DOC cries]

403
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,858
So this is it.

404
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:30,317
[MELIE]
Let's destroy it quickly.

405
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,942
Then we can go and help Seth
get back to his senses.

406
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,733
[BOUDICA groans]

407
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,192
[BRANGOIRE]
Please be careful, My Queen.

408
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,983
We have no way of knowing
how this device works.

409
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:41,525
Myrddin, I failed you.

410
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,775
I didn't know you've
been right here.

411
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:45,983
I'm sorry.

412
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:48,233
I couldn't guard the
land you gave me,

413
00:20:48,317 --> 00:20:50,900
and now your beloved lies dead.

414
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:54,442
[SETH snarls]

415
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:12,733
[INQUISITION SOLDIER C]
What is that? It seems inhuman.

416
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:15,650
Oh, dear. That poor
little darling.

417
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,483
[INQUISITION SOLDIER C] This
position isn't safe anymore.

418
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,775
We need to fall back before
that thing reaches us!

419
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:20,858
[ULLMINA]
I disagree.

420
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:22,733
[INQUISITION SOLDIER C]
But, Major-- Ah!

421
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:24,275
Never in my life
have I laid eyes

422
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:26,775
on a soul in such utter torment.

423
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:29,108
I've no choice but to save him.

424
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:39,108
This is my sacred
mission. My calling.

425
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:41,608
As a Thaumaturge, I must guide
those who've been tainted

426
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:44,483
by sorcery's darkness
back to the light.

427
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:49,817
Ah! I can feel it!

428
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,983
His soul's been twisted
into an exquisite knot

429
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:54,692
of boundless grief
and anguished rage.

430
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:58,900
Magnificent! Please,
let me suffer with you!

431
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:00,900
I call on you,
Patrem Inquisitor,

432
00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:03,400
noble bringer of all miracles.

433
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:05,275
Let your divine
light shine forth

434
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,692
and guide those who are lost!

435
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:13,983
I've never seen such
complete and utter agony.

436
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,650
You poor child.

437
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:18,817
It'll be all right, dear.
Just let it out, okay?

438
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,400
Give it to me,
and don't hold back.

439
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:23,067
There you go.

440
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,650
I'm able to put even a soul
of purest black at ease.

441
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,108
I shall soak in your corruption

442
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:30,650
and cleanse you to
your tainted core.

443
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:35,150
Release your pain so we
can revel in it together,

444
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:38,525
from now until the end of time.

445
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:11,900
[NARRATOR] Myr rampages
across the battlefield,

446
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,150
destroying everything
in his path.

447
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:16,733
Queen Boudica's spirit
reaches a breaking point,

448
00:24:16,817 --> 00:24:19,567
and Seth is in
Ullmina's clutches.

449
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,650
Melie, Ocoho, Doc, and Dragunov
are beset on all sides.

450
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:25,775
Will they find a
way to stop Myr,

451
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:28,692
or perish with the
rest of mankind?

452
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:30,233
Next time on <i>Radiant</i> ,

453
