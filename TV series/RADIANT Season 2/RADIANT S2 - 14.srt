[DIABAL] Triton was also
suspicious of the idea at first.

He's another brother of ours.

[SETH gasps]

ask about Piodon, right?

218
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:41,275
[SETH]
Uh. Yeah.

219
00:13:41,358 --> 00:13:42,858
Well, I can't tell you
what he's after,

220
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:44,817
or who he really is.

221
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,400
But I'll say this,

222
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:50,983
if you put your trust in him,
then you will come to regret it.

223
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:53,192
I spent a few years with him.

224
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:56,192
We first met when
I was just a kid.

225
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:59,483
I was able to use Fantasia
with my bare hands,

226
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:03,192
so even the infected
saw me as a monster.

227
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,108
Wasn't long before
the orphanage I was in

228
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:09,733
handed me over to
the Inquisition.

229
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:13,400
Despite my youth,
I was sentenced to death.

230
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:16,567
But as I awaited my
execution date in Bome,

231
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,025
Piodon saved me.

232
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:21,025
Hey. I came down
here to save you.

233
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:22,483
You're my precious brother,

234
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:25,900
and I'm gonna watch your
back from this day forward.

235
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:27,608
[DIABAL]
That was all it took.

236
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:31,067
He won my trust instantly.

237
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,608
He healed me. Fed me.
Taught me how to use Fantasia.

238
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:39,442
So when he asked me to fight
for him, there was no question.

239
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:43,317
For the first time in my
life, I felt needed.

240
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,192
When it came to magic,
I was a fast learner.

241
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:47,900
And the stronger I got,

242
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:51,150
the stronger the bond
between me and Piodon grew.

243
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:55,567
Or rather, the stronger
his hold over me became.

244
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,567
I started losing more and more
of my freedom over time.

245
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,567
I'd wake up in strange places

246
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,025
and be forced to fight enemies
I knew nothing about.

247
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:10,275
I grew afraid. Felt like I was
starting to lose myself.

248
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:12,442
So one day...

249
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:17,108
...I decided to secretly follow
Piodon on one of his outings.

250
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:20,650
I thought I'd lost his
trail in Vivacyne, but...

251
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,817
Then I saw someone else.

252
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,400
A brother who looked even
more like me than Piodon.

253
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,983
His name was Triton.

254
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:32,817
And he had a similar
story to mine.

255
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,983
Piodon was his savior as well.

256
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:37,608
We came up with a theory,

257
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:41,358
that we brothers are the first
ever natural-born sorcerers.

258
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,733
But how can that be?

259
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,067
I thought only Nemeses
could infect people.

260
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,525
[DIABAL]
Right. That's common knowledge.

261
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:48,942
If you can defy the odds

262
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:51,858
and you somehow survive
contact with a Nemesis,

263
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:54,442
you become a sorcerer with
your own unique curse.

264
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:57,942
It's not something you
can be born with. Never was.

265
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,775
But new infections
appear all the time.

266
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:05,567
So what if someone's infection
let them have infected children?

267
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,067
Triton and I considered all
kinds of possibilities.

268
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,900
But what made the most sense

269
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:13,025
was that we had been
born sorcerers.

270
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:14,900
That explained everything.

271
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:17,692
We're essentially
the second generation.

272
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:20,942
It's only natural that we have
an affinity for Fantasia.

273
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:25,692
And that all of us can gather
it with our bare hands.

274
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:28,775
It must be why we all
look alike, too.

275
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:32,108
We inherited these horns
from one of our parents.

276
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,942
But more importantly,
it also explains something else.

277
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:37,858
Why the Inquisition
is so determined

278
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:39,692
to catch a horned sorcerer.

279
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:41,567
There's something they
don't like about us?

280
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,442
[DIABAL] If there are people
who can have infected children,

281
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:46,942
the number of
infected will grow.

282
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:49,692
Furthermore, our descendants
will be a whole lot stronger

283
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,983
than the average sorcerer.

284
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:54,858
You and I are the Inquisition's
worst nightmare.

285
00:16:54,942 --> 00:16:56,275
I get it now.

286
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:59,067
Due to our birth,
you and me and our siblings

287
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,358
have the power to change
this world for good.

288
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:03,942
Hang on. Who were our parents?

289
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:07,108
Wait. Piodon! Did you guys
ever try asking him?

290
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,817
[DIABAL]
Of course.

291
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,983
We told him our whole theory
and asked him exactly that.

292
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:15,567
How did it go?
Did he tell you anything?

293
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,067
[DIABAL]
Nothing.

294
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:21,733
[DIABAL] He handed us both
over to the Inquisition

295
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:24,858
and left us to the mercy
of their torturers.

about the Spectral
Nemesis attacks.

305
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,983
Someone has been feeding
them information.

306

I'm sure that this traitor would
love to stab me in the back,

00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:08,233
but they can't while I
stand before my troops.

308

They'd only be
exposing themselves.

If nothing had changed

In that case,

00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:30,317
just as he did in times of old.

318
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,858
King Prasutag! King Taran!
And King Ogmios!

319
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:35,025
Lend me your power!

320
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:38,192
Fight for Cyfandir
as you always have!

321
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:39,983
[ALL]
We are with you!

322
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,817
Those are the kings of the past.

323
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,608
That's right.

324
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:44,067
Wherever she goes,

325
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,900
Queen Boudica keeps their
memory stones close at hand.

326
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:49,608
They contain a portion
of the king's powers.

327
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:52,650
[PRASUTAG]
It's good to see ya, sweetheart.

328
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,067
Fog! I summon you forth!

329
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,692
Protect the people I hold dear!

330
00:18:57,775 --> 00:18:59,983
Niwl!

331
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,108
[SANTORI laughs]

332
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:06,817
[SANTORI]
What a spectacle.

333
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,483
It's too bad, eh?

334
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:10,900
We've lost our view
of their giant queen.

335
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,317
That magnificent creature.

336
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,692
Huh?

337
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,942
[VERONE] Our shots appear
to be rebounding.

338
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,275
[SANTORI]
What?

339
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:26,233
We'll only have the
mirror fog's protection

340
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:27,858
for a few more seconds.

341
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:31,400
Be prepared. Once it
comes down, then counter!

342
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:32,442
[ORDERIC]
Right!

343
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:35,233
Soldiers, look sharp.
And load up!

344
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:40,442
The fog seems to be
retreating now.

345
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:43,775
I can already make out
the queen's silhouette.

346
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,567
[ORDERIC]
Fire!

347
00:19:58,108 --> 00:20:00,108
[INQUISITION SOLDIER C]
Massive shot incoming!

348
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:03,942
Huh?

349
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:06,358
Ah!

350
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:08,650
What's going on here?

351
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:13,775
[INQUISITION SOLDIER D]
Watch out!

352
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:16,650
So the sorcerers have
anti-gravity rounds.

353
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:20,275
Ah. How I wish I could
float in the sky.

354
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:25,233
The enemy fleet is beginning
to advance on our position.

355
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:26,942
[KNIGHT-SORCERER A]
Inquisition attack incoming!

356
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,192
Please get back, Your Majesty!

357
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:32,525
[BOUDICA] There's no need.
Knights, clear a path!

358
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,942
[BOUDICA]
Taran!

359
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,900
Lightning.

360
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:41,233
Let your judgment crash down
on these insolent fools!

361
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:42,942
Mellt!

362
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,067
[INQUISITION SOLDIERS gasping]

363
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,942
[INQUISITION SOLDIER E]
I don't wanna die!

364
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:02,608
[INQUISITION SOLDIERS screaming]

365
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:04,108
[laughs]

366
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:06,900
The queen struck them all down
in a mere blink of an eye.

367
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:11,942
[SOLDIERS cheering]

368
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,192
This battle has
been far too easy.

369
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:21,067
There's no way this is all
the Inquisition's capable of.

370
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,608
[BARELL]
This is our chance!

371
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:25,317
The enemy commanders
are wide open!

372
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,858
Follow me!

373
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:29,108
We'll wipe the fiends out in
the name of the Great Merlin!

374
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:32,025
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS] In the name
of the great Merlin, we fight!

375
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,275
[BARELL] What the--?
Our spells had no effect!

376
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:39,775
They don't appear to be trying
to defend themselves either.

377
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:42,650
It matters not!
Continue the charge!

378
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:50,150
[ALL screaming]

379
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:52,733
They're falling.
Were they shot down?

380
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,692
[OCOHO]
That machine...

381
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:02,025
Wait, is it negating Fantasia?

382
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,858
[SANTORI] Ha! I'm standing
in plain sight, sorcerers.

383
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:12,108
Come and strike me down.

384
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:13,525
Be brave.

385
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,608
Charge at me like the valiant
knights you claim to be

386
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:18,567
and make that exquisite
queen of yours proud.

387
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,108
Surely you sorcerers
must have more power

388
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:22,983
than you've displayed thus far.

389
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:24,942
Give me your all,
so I can squeeze

390
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:27,650
some more entertainment
from this battle.

391
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:32,025
Do this for me and I'll grant
a painless death to each of you.

392
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:35,358
I swear it upon my mighty beard.

393
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:11,317
[NARRATOR] As the battle
grows ever fiercer,

394
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,900
many knights fall to the
Inquisition's Fantasia vacuum,

395
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:17,858
and only Ocoho realizes
what's happening.

396
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:19,650
Seth hurries to the battlefield,

397
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:23,192
but is intercepted by a
determined Captain Dragunov.

398
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:27,650
The two of them face off yet
again, and an offer is made.

399
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,275
Next time on <i>Radiant</i> ,

400
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:32,983
"Led to the Abyss
by a Melody of Death."
