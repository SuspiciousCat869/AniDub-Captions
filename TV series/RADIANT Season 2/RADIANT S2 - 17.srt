00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:19,733
What? You're kidding me, right?

162
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:22,692
And even though you know that,
you're still working with them?

163
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:24,692
Can't you see how evil this is?

164
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:27,692
General Torque is
pursuing a just cause.

165
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,983
And I owe him my loyalty.

166
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:32,400
General Torque. You mean--?

167
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,108
No friggin' way. You're
loyal to that bastard?!

168
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:41,650
How righteous can he be?

169
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:44,650
He's attacking people who're
just tryin' to live their lives!

170
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,983
I can understand
your frustration,

171
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:50,733
but this world is more complex
than you'd like it to be.

172
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:52,025
Is that so?

173
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,567
Yes, it is.

174
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,442
I concede that the Inquisition
is a deeply flawed institution,

175
00:09:57,525 --> 00:10:00,858
but it exists to protect
the defenseless.

176
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:02,775
The infected may be oppressed,

177
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:05,942
but you have magic,
and the means to abuse it.

178
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:09,983
The Inquisition stops cruel
sorcerers from becoming tyrants.

179
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:15,192
Are you really speaking
for yourself?

180
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:18,400
Or are you just repeating what
you've been told to believe?

181
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:25,192
I want to end this war
before it gets worse.

182
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:28,775
That's my personal wish,
I can tell you that.

183
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,692
You aren't lying, are you?

184
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:35,983
You'll find out soon enough.

185
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,400
That's Dragunov's signal!

186
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:46,358
It seems he managed to catch
the horned sorcerer.

187
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:51,192
Oh-ho! Cease fire,
the lot of you!

188
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:56,150
They suddenly stopped firing.

189
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:58,150
[SOLDIER B] Was it in
response to that signal?

190
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,233
Where did that flare
even come from?

191
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:02,108
[SOLDIER D]
Hey. You see that kid?

192
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:04,567
[SOLDIER E] He looks like
that Spectre we saw.

193
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,775
How dare you destroy our land!

194
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:09,233
You crushed my grandfather's
field, ya damn monster!

195
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:11,442
Get outta here!
And never come back!

196
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:14,108
[SOLDIER I] Drop dead,
you ugly horned menace!

197
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:16,900
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

198
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:19,567
You have a harsh rebuttal
for everything I say,

199
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:23,025
why not defend yourself
against their comments?

200
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:25,858
[SETH] There's no point
in arguing with them.

201
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:28,775
I don't know how you got there,
but you did everything you could

202
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:34,025
to minimize the damage you
caused as a Spectre, right?

203
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:37,483
Of course I did,
but it wasn't enough.

204
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,150
I still caused damage.

205
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,733
They have every
right to be angry.

206
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:45,900
If our roles were reversed,
I would feel the exact same way.

207
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:48,692
Just who are you?

208
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,817
Captain Dragunov has proven
to be quite resourceful.

209
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,108
Thanks to his and
Liselotte's efforts,

210
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:56,900
our lost lamb is
heading back home.

211
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,192
Go signal the ships.

212
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:03,067
[INQUISITION A] The time
has come! Assume formation!

213
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,733
They're forming ranks.

214
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:07,358
[SOLDIERS chattering]

215
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:08,817
What are they up to?

216
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,192
And what's with all
of the commotion?

217
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:13,942
Impossible.

218
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,817
Hey. What the heck is that?

219
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,275
A ship. The mightiest
to come out of Bome.

220
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:36,817
Our flagship, <i>Uranos</i> .

221
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,108
Why bring it out now?

222
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,775
It looks like playtime's
finally over.

223
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:43,150
It's regrettable
that we couldn't

224
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:45,525
drag the game out
a little longer,

225
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:46,775
but at the very least,

226
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:49,650
we can ensure that this
war ends with a bang.

227
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:53,025
I swear on my beard,
I shall make it happen.

228
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:09,983
[CITIZENS gasping]

229
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,442
They're targeting
the standing stones!

230
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:20,733
We have to hurry back!

231
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:26,067
[CITIZENS screaming]

232
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,608
[crying]

233
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,817
It's only a child.

234
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,692
We need to ru--

235
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:50,275
The magical barrier that's
protected Caislean Merlin

236
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:53,358
for centuries oughtta fall
within the next few moments.

237
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:56,483
I swear on the splendid
sheen of my moist beard,

238
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:58,483
I couldn't be more excited!

239
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:02,567
What a thrill it is to witness
the demise of a kingdom.

240
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,150
I do hope that you're enjoying

241
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:07,900
this glorious spectacle
as well, my dear queen.

242
00:14:10,442 --> 00:14:12,025
Thought we had a deal, Eyepatch!

243
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:14,192
Weren't they supposed
to stop their attack?

244
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:16,858
Or did you just say that to
get me out of the castle

245
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:20,358
so your friends could destroy it
without killing their prisoner!

246
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,108
They aren't stopping.

247
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:25,150
[TORQUE]
We'll attack Cyfandir.

248
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:28,942
Teach its infected lords
humility and reclaim our place

249
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:32,400
as this world's enforcers
of justice and order.

250
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:35,775
But our main goal is to capture
that horned sorcerer.

251
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:38,025
I cannot stress enough
how essential it is

252
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:39,692
that we catch him.

253
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:45,025
You're conflicted. I understand.

254
00:14:45,108 --> 00:14:48,817
And I have faith in your ability
to judge what is right.

255
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,192
[TORQUE] Perhaps you're
uncertain as to whether

256
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:57,775
the horned sorcerer
deserves to be taken.

257
00:14:57,858 --> 00:14:59,108
When it comes to that boy,

258
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:02,108
I must ask that you put
your faith in my judgment.

259
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,817
I'm guessing you
also have concerns

260
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,483
about the impending campaign
in Cyfandir, is that correct?

261
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:08,317
Yes, sir.

262
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Put your fears to rest.

263
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:13,317
I wish only to rebuild the
Inquisition's authority

264
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,108
so we might uphold order
throughout the world.

265
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:19,150
I hope to shed as little
blood as possible.

266
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:22,108
I understand, sir.

267
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:24,942
I wanted to trust him.

268
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,067
What was all that about
stopping the war?

269
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,608
This smells like betrayal!

270
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:31,067
That it does,
and I'm the victim.

271
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,567
Ah! Don't you dare make
this all about you!

272
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,400
Tell your soldiers
to stand down!

273
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:37,192
I can't. I don't have
that kind of authority.

274
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:40,567
Then I'll find out
who does. Jerk.

275
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,442
Wait. What are you planning?

276
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,983
[SETH] To find out
who's calling the shots

277
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,025
so I can beat him
to a bloody pulp.

278
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:50,108
Hold on. You shouldn't just
charge forward without thinking!

279
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:52,983
[SETH]
Right.

280
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:55,858
You want me to "calculate" how
things might turn out first.

281
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:57,942
But if I do nothing,
I'll regret it.

282
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:01,692
So I'll think as I move and
fight for what feels right.

283
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,483
Uh?

284
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:12,067
It's a lone enemy!

285
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,567
Whoa. I think it's
the horned sorcerer!

286
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,692
Skull Attack!

287
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,233
[INQUISITION screaming]

288
00:16:19,317 --> 00:16:20,400
[INQUISITION E yells]

289
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:25,733
Keep going till you reach
the center of the battlefield.

290
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:28,275
You'll find Colonel
Santori there.

291
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:29,858
You're helping me now?

292
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:32,733
Old as he may seem,
he's a strong fighter.

293
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:33,900
Be careful.

294
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:35,692
While moving,
he's only able to enlarge

295
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:39,442
any one part of his body,
so don't let him stand still.

296
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:40,692
But why would you--?

297
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:42,650
What're you standing
around here for?

298
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:46,525
Charge on forward.
Make them stop.

299
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,525
Explain yourself,
Captain Dragunov.

300
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:51,983
What did we just witness?

301
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:55,650
A soldier realizing that
his cause was unjust.

302
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:57,525
How dare you speak such words!

303
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:59,608
What kind of
Thaumaturge would--?

304
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,692
You guys are here, too?
Why track me down?

305
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,442
You've earned our
absolute loyalty.

306
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:10,942
We'll follow you in
whatever you do, sir.

307
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:13,442
Whatever your goal,
you aren't in this alone.

308
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:15,483
Not to brag, but we've
gotten a lot stronger.

309
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,358
Wait till ya see us
in action, Captain!

310
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:18,567
Yeah, and we even figured out

311
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,775
how to make some
of your recipes.

312
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,900
I see now.

313
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:26,692
Not all of us were stuck
in place. It was just me.

314
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:27,942
Huh?

315
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:30,067
All right, men, here's the deal.

316
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,400
For the time being at least,

317
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,650
we'll act as an
independent company.

318
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:36,942
Now, this won't be great
for our careers, mind you,

319
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:38,275
but we have other concerns.

[INQUISITION]
Sir!

321
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:47,733
Goodbye, Ocoho. Die well.

[gasps]

323
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:54,608
Hey. What're you doing, Dracoon?

324
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:55,942
You found me in the Sidh.

325
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:57,942
I guess you wanted
to say goodbye.

326
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:00,358
[grunts]

327
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,567
You can pull my cape
all you want,

328
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,317
but it's not gonna save me.

329
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,108
I'm completely under
Mordred's control.

330
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:13,025
I do appreciate your
persistence, but...

331
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:16,442
Wait. I'm moving of
my own free will.

332
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:18,817
How is that?

333
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,067
You still have a Gysoni flame.

334
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,525
Oh, I get it now. I never
released you from the spell.

335
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:26,358
That left us with a
lingering connection,

336
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:28,858
which you used to save me.

337
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,608
Draccoon!

338
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:37,567
Huh?

339
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,900
[OCOHO]
Please, Draccoon!

340
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:39,900
Don't leave me!

341
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:41,817
Shouldn't you be
falling right now?

342
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,900
What part of "jump off the ship"
did you not understand?

343
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:48,525
Oh. You're back to your senses.

344
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:50,358
Well, that's inconvenient.

345
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:52,150
Looks like I'll have to make
another mess on the deck

346
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,067
and get yelled at.

347
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,733
Be careful, gentlemen.
This one's wild.

348
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:58,025
Don't talk.

349
00:18:58,108 --> 00:19:00,567
Don't you get it?
You have no chance.

350
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,608
Right or wrong, you've lost.

351
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:05,358
I'm curious, how'd you manage
to break the curse?

352
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:07,067
Is it just that you care
more about your life

353
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:07,858
than some peasants?

354
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,317
Shut your mouth.

355
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,525
We were friends.

356
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,108
I don't wanna hurt you
more than I have to.

357
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,025
If you want a painless death--

358
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,400
[OCOHO]
Shut up!

359
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:17,567
As long as I've known you,
you've been using me.

360
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,858
Well, guess what? Now it's
your turn to be the puppet.

361
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:22,858

[BARON MERCHANT gasp]

364
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:35,942
I need to get out of this hole

365
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:39,233
before our bombardment breaks
down the magic barrier.

366
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:44,108
Just what are you
trying to prove?

367
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:46,400
There's a reason you're
called the infected.

368
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:48,108
It's because you
people are sick.

369
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:52,275
You think that we're all sick?

370
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,692
Yeah. Right.

371
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,192
Anyway, I have to admit,
you put up a better fight

372
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:57,858
than I was expecting.

373
00:19:57,942 --> 00:20:01,692
You defended well, but a
defensive focus has its limits.

374
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:04,233
[MELIE]
Same thing goes for offense.

375
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:06,608
Here. Let me show you!

376
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:09,817
What's the matter, Thaumaturge?

377
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,525
Can't you fight
in close quarters?

378
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:13,525
[LISELOTTE]
What's going on with this girl?

379
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:15,650
Everything from her footwork
to her expression

380
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,650
has suddenly changed.

381
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,192
I feel like I'm fighting
a different person.

382
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:24,025
Why are our soldiers
breaking formation?

383
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:25,692
What's going on up there?

384
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:28,275
Sorry. We're getting
torn apart, Colonel!

385
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:29,900
That horned sorcerer's
on a rampage--

386
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:31,733
we can't even slow him down!

Indeed it does!

Guess I'm gonna get to
stretch my legs after all.

393

The giantess was a big let-down,

394
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:47,358
so a spirited scrap with
the horned sorcerer

395
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:49,358
is just what this old man needs.

an enigmatic sight to behold.

It would appear to
be raining soldiers.

but where's the brat?

Estimated casualties?

That barrage wiped out
around 30% of our soldiers.

Tch.

412

And they've captured the queen.

We need to get her back,
no matter the cost.

414
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:31,567
The rain's concealing
her location.

Even so, I'm forming
a party to search for her.
