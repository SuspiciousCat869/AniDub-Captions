00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:52,567
I wish to rescue the
horned sorcerer.

163
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,733
Can you help him?

164
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:55,858
[GRIMM]
Hmm...

165
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:59,692
[ULLMINA]
Oh! This feels incredible.

166
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,942
Wave after wave of black torment

167
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:05,150
is flowing from your
soul to mine.

168
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:06,942
You're the horned sorcerer.

169
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:09,608
I've heard a great
deal about you, dear.

170
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,608
This is wonderful.
I'm so glad you're here.

171
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:17,150
Now, I'd like to take
you to Bome with me,

172
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,983
what do you say?

173
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:21,650
[ULLMINA gasps]

174
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:24,817
We got him!

175
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,442
Return that black soul
to me at once, you fiends!

176
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:29,233
It belongs to me
and no one else!

177
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:31,400
Don't talk about Seth
like he's a thing!

178
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:34,025
He doesn't belong to
anyone, understand?!

179
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:35,608
You can't! No!

180
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:39,067
No! No! No! No, give it back!

181
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,067
Let's go.

182
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,358
[GRIMM]
Right.

183
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:47,775
I've done all that I can to
help you for the time being.

184
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:51,108
Stay alive so you can
prove your cause is just.

185
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,108
I'm rooting for you.

186
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:58,233
Major Ullmina, are you--? Uh!

187
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:03,192
It's gone. Without the pain,
all I feel is emptiness.

188
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:06,233
Why did the pain
have to leave me?

189
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:07,650
Bring it back to me...

190
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,650
[VERONE] Major Ullmina,
pull yourself together. Major.

191
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:13,108
...don't care how many sink.
I want my black-hearted...

192
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:14,192
[VERONE]
Mother!

193
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:15,150
[ULLMINA]
Huh?

194
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,400
[INQUISITION CAPTAIN B yells]

195
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:19,275
Compose yourself.
We have work to do.

196
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:21,442
Prince Verone, it's you.

197
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,608
You should know better

198
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:25,025
than to use your miracle
on a living being.

199
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,608
It's too dangerous.

200
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:28,775
You subdued that tainted
creature for a time,

201
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:31,400
but at the cost of
entwining your spirits.

202
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,275
You lose your mind.

203
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,192
[ULLMINA]
You're quite right.

204
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:39,525
Yes. I was driven briefly mad.

205
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:42,650
Dragged towards the pit
in that sorcerer's soul.

206
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,358
[ULLMINA]
But I was pulled out too soon.

207
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:48,400
One day, I will dive
into that abyss again

208
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:52,358
and drink his pain
until I drown.

209
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:55,150
[VERONE] Major Ullmina,
the Harmonizium you deployed

210
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:58,817
in the forest has been disabled.

211
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,150
Also, the colonel has fallen.

212
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,442
That's most unfortunate.

213
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:06,275
I suppose we should
take our leave.

214
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,067
For now, the infected
will remain free,

215
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,150
but we will return soon to save
them from their depravity

216
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:15,275
and guide them back
into the light.

217
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:16,650
I look forward to the day

218
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:20,192
when I can give
them my blessing.

219
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:23,400
[ORDERIC]
Look! They're turning around.

220
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:25,525
The invaders are retreating!

221
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,858
[SOLDIERS cheering, laughing]

222
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:29,733
[SOLDIER A]
We did it!

223
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:33,067
[GUENOLINE]
Cyfandir has been saved!

224
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,025
[MYR roars]

225
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:38,942
What is that?

226
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:47,067
[SOLDIER B] It sounded like
some kind of beast.

227
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:52,525
What in Merlin's
green earth is that?

228
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,275
[MYR roars]

229
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:01,108
[INQUISITION SOLDIERS scream]

230
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:01,942
[MELIE gasps]

231
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:02,608
[gasps]

232
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,400
[SOLDIERS gasp]

233
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,775
[gasps]

234
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:11,733
[SOLDIER B] It's attacking
the Inquisition's ships!

235
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:14,358
[SOLDIER C] Could it have been
sent by the great Merlin?

236
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:15,525
[SOLDIER D]
It must've been!

237
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:18,192
Let's hear it for
Merlin's familiar!

238
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:19,275
[SOLDIERS]
Huzzah!

239
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:21,317
Yes, let us thank
our newfound ally:

240
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,150
The embodiment of
Cyfandir's fury!

241
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:27,858
Please, Noble Beast, tell us
how we can thank you!

242
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:31,192
[GUENOLINE] Speak if you're
able. We're listening!

243
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:34,233
I'll slaughter them all!

244
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:43,483
[roaring]

245
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,400
Make a shield!

246
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:45,858
[SOLDIERS]
Sciath!

247
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:47,900
[roars]

248
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:51,608
Fall back to the castle,
but stay ready to defend!

249
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,442
[GRIMM] That is nature's
wrath incarnate.

250
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:58,817
Those sorcerers don't have
a chance of defeating it.

251
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,817
Then we need Seth.

252
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,483
Please, Seth, we need you to
come back to your senses!

253
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:04,942
Myr's about to kill
a lot of people

254
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:06,983
and no one else can stop him!

255
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:08,733
Come on.

256
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,608
[GRIMM]
Try not to excite him further.

257
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:12,358
He's grown much stronger,

258
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:14,192
which makes him
harder to restrain.

259
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:15,983
Sorry, but I have to risk it.

260
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,983
Seth wouldn't want
us to do nothing.

261
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,733
Your friend is in pain, Seth.

262
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:23,775
Wake up so you can calm him
down before people get hurt!

263
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:25,567
[roaring]

264
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,608
[SETH yelling]

265
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:30,942
[GRIMM]
Grimm warned you.

266
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:33,525
He'll break out of his
bonds at this rate.

267
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:34,900
[MELIE]
What can I do?

268
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:36,150
[gasps]

269
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:38,483
[MELIE] Maybe if I talk
to him through the Sidh.

270
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:42,983
Seth, if you can hear
me, we need you back.

271
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,233
[gasps]

272
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:54,275
What is this thing?

273
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:58,608
Hey, Seth, are you
somewhere in there?

274
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:00,025
[gasps]

275
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,900
Ocoho, how'd you know to come?

276
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:06,942
I heard you scream. The sound
carried through the Sidh.

277
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:09,192
So Seth is inside
this thing, right?

278
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,567
[MELIE]
Yeah.

279
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,983
This is a really crummy time
for you to get overtaken

280
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:14,733
by your inner darkness,
you know that?

281
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:17,608
I thought you'd been
training to prevent this!

282
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:20,317
Please, Seth. Listen!

283
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,025
Myr is on a rampage!
We have to stop him!

284
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:29,067
[roaring]

285
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,942
Hold on. What's that
Inquisition ship doing?

286
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:35,108
[ORDERIC]
Is it trying to help us?

287
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:38,317
Did we kill it?

288
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,733
[roars]

289
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:43,067
Our shots landed, but
the beast wasn't injured.

290
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,400
How can that be?

291
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:46,983
It doesn't matter. We just
need to slow it down.

292
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:48,775
If we keep shooting,
it'll give some soldiers

293
00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:49,817
a chance to escape.

294
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,858
[GOUDEAU, GARVICE]
Sir!

295
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:53,233
[OCOHO]
Seth! Turn around, damn it!

296
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:55,483
Just look at us, please!

297
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,567
[GARVICE]
Uh! This is bad.

298
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,692
The beast is facing us now!

299
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:06,067
Turn us around! Hard to port!

300
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:12,650
[SOLDIERS gasp]

[GRIMM]
The bindings are coming loose.

303
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:22,608
If you're going to wake
Seth, then hurry!

304
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:24,150
Before he breaks free!

305
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,650
[yelling]

306
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:29,442
Look, Seth,

307
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:31,608
I know what it's like
to see a loved one die.

308
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,108
We understand your pain,

309
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,025
but we're not gonna let it turn
you and Myr into monsters!

310
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:38,733
No matter how hard it is
or how badly it hurts,

311
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:41,150
we keep our eyes open
and do what's right!

312
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,317
You said you'd find a way
to control this thing,

313
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,025
but that you'd need help.

314
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:49,108
Well, that's why I'm here.
So let me help you, Seth.

315
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:51,775
Please don't leave
me behind again!

316
00:16:54,942 --> 00:16:57,608
Myr needs you, Seth. Hurry!

317
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,358
[roars]

318
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:03,525
This attack'll be even
bigger than the last!

319
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:04,858
Oh, no.

320
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:13,442
[SETH]
Titan... Punch!

321
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:24,025
[DRAGUNOV]
It's him. The horned sorcerer!

322
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:25,400
[chuckles]

323
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:29,150
I guess you could say
this makes us even.

324
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,733
So now what?

325
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,692
Perhaps we should flee while the
beast is distracted, Captain.

326
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:34,817
But once Cyfandir
falls, we're next.

327
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,608
So as long as we have the
strength to make a difference,

328
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:38,858
we'll use it.

329
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,567
Helping them helps us.
Let's keep up the fight!

330
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:45,150
[growls]

331
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:53,233
Listen, I need you to
calm down, okay, Myr?

332
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:54,817
[growls]

333
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,692
Seeing Jill like that broke me.
So I can't imagine how you felt.

334
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,400
But even so, we both know

335
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:01,858
that she wouldn't
have wanted this.

336
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:06,983
No. You're right.
Jill didn't want any of this.

337
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,358
Right.

338
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:11,942
[MYR] But... if I had crushed
your filthy brethren

339
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,775
when they first gathered
around the forest

340
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:16,025
and started tearing
at its edges,

341
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:18,692
none of this would've happened.

342
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:21,650
And she would still
be alive right now!

343
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,692
Stop! What do you think Jill
would say if she were here?

344
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:27,858
She's not here. She's gone!

345
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,192
[MELIE gasps]

346
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:35,275
[roars]

347
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:39,692
Here goes nothing:
Gravem Carserem!

348
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:41,775
[roars]

349
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:44,442
[GRIMM]
Nubes Spectris!

350
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:47,817
[growling]

351
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,483
[SETH]
Hurry.

352
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,275
We should be rushing
to the others

353
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,692
to help them stop Myr right now.

354
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,858
What are you doing?

355
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:14,317
[DOC]
I'm checkin' somethin'.

356
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,067
When I got close to Jill's body,

357
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,233
the memory stones
all started to glow.

358
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:19,525
[OCOHO]
Huh?

359
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,692
Then do you think there's
something under her?

360
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:22,900
[gasps]

361
00:19:22,983 --> 00:19:25,067
[SOLDIER D]
Take shelter behind the wall!

362
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,567
[SOLDIER E] Trust in Merlin!
His ramparts will protect us!

363
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,067
Trust in Merlin?
I am Merlin, you fools!

364
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,608
And nothing will protect
you from my wrath!

365
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:41,108
[GRIMM] With that much Fantasia,
he'll send the walls flying.

366
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:43,775
[roars]

367
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,317
[MYR]
Jill.

368
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,900
If I had just followed
my first instinct...

369
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:56,233
If I had chased the first
settlers away from this land...

370
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:10,733
[MYR] If I had ignored your
words of kindness and mercy...

371
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:15,525
If I had unleashed my rage when
they first provoked it...

372
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:17,692
...we'd be together.

373
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:23,150
The little ones...
You and me...

374
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:26,858
You never would've
been taken from me!

375
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:33,358
[MISTER BOOBRIE yells]

376
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:38,983
[MYR]
Huh?

377
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:42,108
[gasps]

378
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:45,442
[ORDERIC]
Hm?

379
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:07,817
Hold on, where'd these vines
come from? Are they magic?

380
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,858
Wait... Jill?

381
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:12,858
Is that you, Jill?

382
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:14,400
[SETH]
No, Myr.

383
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:22,025
[SETH] It hurts just saying it,
but she's not coming back.

384
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:23,400
Listen.

385
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,858
You know this better
than I do, but still.

386
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:31,608
Your wife was stronger
than any human weapon.

387
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:34,483
The Inquisition didn't
kill her with their machine.

388
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:36,483
At least, not directly.

389
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:42,150
You see, she could've
survived without Fantasia...

390
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,900
...but they couldn't.

391
00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:47,108
So she made a choice.

392
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,608
Jill chose to give her life
so they would have a chance.

393
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,400
[NARRATOR]
Prejudice, slavery, war.

394
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,358
These things prove that
humans are foolish and weak,

395
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:17,150
which is why they must
work together to grow.

396
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:19,567
The long battle
has ended at last,

397
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,775
and in the hopes of
a brighter tomorrow,

398
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:24,483
Queen Boudica must
make a decision.

399
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:28,067
Seth's quest, full of fast
friendships cut short,

400
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,650
must continue.

401
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,108
Next time on <i>Radiant</i> ,

402
00:24:31,192 --> 00:24:33,692
"The Future Is With You."
