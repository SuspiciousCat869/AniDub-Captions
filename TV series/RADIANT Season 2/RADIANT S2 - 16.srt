00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:12,317
[NARRATOR] The knight-sorcerer
ordination ceremony

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,817
was cut short when a wounded
scout arrived to warn

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,442
of a rapidly approaching
Inquisition war fleet.

4
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:24,317
Under Queen Boudica's command,
the knight-sorcerers mobilized.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,733
For their part, the Inquisition
deployed under the command

6
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:32,692
of three Thaumaturges:
Santori, Ullmina, and Verone.

7
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:34,733
The massive armada
at their control

8
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:39,442
boasted far more soldiers
than Cyfandir could muster.

9
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:42,233
The mastermind
behind this invasion

10
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:44,233
is the merchant baron Doussant.

11
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:47,192
He and his allies wish to
strip the knight-sorcerers

12
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:49,025
of their status
and enslave them,

13
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:51,150
along with all other sorcerers.

14
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:52,483
To this end,

15
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:55,525
he offered the Inquisition
use of the Harmonizium,

16
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:59,608
a device with the power
to nullify Fantasia.

17
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,483
Good and evil.
Idealism and greed.

18
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:05,567
All is confused in
the chaos of battle.

19
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,067
In the midst of it all,

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,400
Lord de Gulis and
his favored pupils

21
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:13,108
boarded Baron Doussant's airship
in order to discuss a truce,

22
00:01:13,192 --> 00:01:15,775
only to receive a
shocking revelation.

23
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:18,983
Mordred, Sagramore's
childhood friend,

24
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:21,942
is the son of Baron Doussant.

25
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:36,150
My trusted pupil is your son?

26
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:39,400
[DOUSSANT]
Yes, that is correct.

27
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:44,358
Despite all the years he's
spent here, Mordred is mine.

28
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:46,400
I take it these are
your co-conspirators

29
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:48,483
with the Faithful
of the Hermit?

30
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,733
Yes, they are.

31
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:53,317
[DOUSSANT] Then we owe
them our sincere thanks.

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,275
Just what are you trying to say?

33
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:56,942
We can explain later.

34
00:01:57,025 --> 00:02:00,067
But first, it looks like we have
another visitor to welcome.

35
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:02,817
[gasps]

36
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,775
[OCOHO screams]

[NARRATOR] "The Light
of Life Is Extinguished."

38
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,983
[SOLDIER A]
Fire! Fire!

39
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,317
[BRANGOIRE]
Your Majesty!

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,900
What's the situation?

41
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,650
Ocoho's instincts were correct.
That machine negates Fantasia.

42
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:59,692
Our magic doesn't
work around it.

43
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:04,858
Worse yet, the area affected
seems to be expanding over time.

44
00:04:04,942 --> 00:04:07,900
If this continues,
then in roughly an hour,

45
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:11,483
our army'll be all-but
completely incapacitated.

46
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,817
[BOUDICA] Do we have the means
to destroy this machine?

47
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,483
[BRANGOIRE] No, Your Highness,
not with Fantasia.

48
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,108
[BOUDICA]
With our dragons, then?

49
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,483
[BRANGOIRE]
As you can see,

50
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,983
that Thaumaturge is
protecting it with his power.

51
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:25,067
We won't make it past
him without magic.

52
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,775
[BOUDICA] To think that
the Inquisition found a way

53
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:28,942
to strip of us of
our one advantage.

54
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,858
[BRANGOIRE]
I can't believe it either.

55
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:34,525
And yet, this land
doesn't belong to them.

56
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,650
It belongs to Merlin's heirs!

57
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,650
Ogmios!

58
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:43,192
[OGMIOS] Awaken, stone!
Rise up and defend our land!

59
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:45,442
Carreg!

60
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:46,900
What's going on here?

61
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:48,733
It's an earthquake?

62
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:49,733
[ALL gasp]

63

[INQUISITION SOLDIERS screaming]

64
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,692
[INQUISITION SOLDIER D]
They have stone golems!

65
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,108
Now for the counterattack!

66
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:05,442
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Right!

67
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:08,317
[BRANGOIRE] You've awakened
the stone guardians.

68
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,692
But how long can you
keep this up, My Queen?

69
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:15,025
[BRANGOIRE]
This is our chance!

70
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:16,358
We'll use our scrolls
to take out

71
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,608
as many enemy weapons as we can!

72
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,275
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Yes, sir!

73
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,442
[SANTORI]
How delightful!

74
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:29,358
[SANTORI chuckles]

75
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:30,775
The enemy's sending a trio

76
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:33,483
of enormous stone puppets
to crush our troops.

77
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,108
There's just no limit
to their barbarism.

78
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:37,983
This isn't good at all.

79
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:39,400
[SANTORI]
Hmm?

80
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:40,817
[VERONE] Our troops
don't have any weapons

81
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,400
that can damage those golems.

82
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:45,942
I'll lend them my assistance.

83
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,358
Knock yourself out, kid!

84
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:49,025
You've got a good head
on your shoulders--

85
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:51,233
I'm sure you'll do
great out there.

86
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,692
Despite being the youngest
of all the Thaumaturges,

87
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,983
he's proven to be quite capable.

88
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,608
I look forward to seeing
the boy's capabilities

89
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,733
on the battlefield.

90
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:05,650
[INQUISITION SOLDIERS screaming]

91
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:10,775
He took our cannons!

92
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:13,900
Go! Before he can
do more damage!

93
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:16,942
Yeah. Come on, try and stop me.

94
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,567
You made two mistakes.

95
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,150
The first one was coming
to Cyfandir uninvited.

96
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:24,025
And the second one...

97
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:26,983
...is right on the
tip of my tongue.

98
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:32,858
Know what?! The first
one was bad enough!

99
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:38,775
[BRANGOIRE]
Now...

100
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:40,400
All forces advance!

101
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,067
[SOLDIERS yell]

102
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,567
[ringing]

103
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,733
That's a strange sound.

104
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:50,858
The stone guardians!

105
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:59,900
[SOLDIERS screaming]

106
00:07:08,817 --> 00:07:10,733
Wait, that one's just a child.

107
00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:13,358
I don't care!
Let's take him out!

108
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:14,733
No. Don't do it!

109
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:17,942
[VERONE] O Patrem Inquisitor,
bringer of miracles.

110
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:20,442
May the sound of
your truth ring out.

111
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:24,775
And silence these sinners from
now until the end of time.

112
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:44,108
The heck is this net made of?

113
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:45,525
It's black silver,

114
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:48,400
so you won't be able to
use magic against it either.

115
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:50,275
Cool, thanks for the tip.

116
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:52,692
How did you get here?
Were you following us?

117
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:55,567
Yes, Ocoho's been on our trail
pretty much the whole time.

118
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,733
And she figured us out,
too. Smart girl.

119
00:07:57,817 --> 00:08:01,025
Her one mistake was believing
we were led by Queen Boudica.

120
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:02,275
[LORD DE GULIS]
Hold on.

121
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,358
Are you saying that the
queen isn't our leader?

122
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,358
Yeah, you get it now.

123
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:09,192
But if not her, then who
have we been fighting for?

124
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:11,275
[MORDRED]
Yourselves, of course.

125
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,692
Old man Merlin didn't give you
this land to share, right?

126
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:17,942
The queen's name got
me pretty far though.

127
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:20,358
By saying she was the
one behind all this,

128
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:24,108
I was able to fool both
you and Ocoho.

129
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:26,150
We thought we'd summoned
the Spectres in order

130
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,942
to punish those who had betrayed
the great Merlin's will.

131
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:31,108
But it seems we were really
laying the groundwork

132
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:32,400
for an invasion.

133
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:33,442
[OCOHO]
I don't get it.

134
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:34,983
What would the
merchant barons gain

135
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:38,025
from making the Faithful
of the Hermit attack farms?

136
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:42,108
Profit. We've been making
investments. Far and wide.

137
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:43,942
Investments?

138
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:46,317
[DOUSSANT] In the peasantry,
to be specific.

139
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,983
Before we can start
making use of this land,

140
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:51,983
we need to obtain the
trust of its denizens.

141
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,150
[LORD DE GULIS] Whatever
you've spent, it was wasted.

142
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,692
The people will never
trust the likes of you.

143
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:58,775
[DOUSSANT]
Many of them already do.

144
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:00,567
And what makes you think that?

145
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,317
[DOUSSANT] The queen and her
lords send thoughts and prayers

146
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,358
to those affected by
Spectres, but that's it.

147
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:08,108
They don't send assistance.

148
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:10,942
They leave them to rebuild
as best they can.

149
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,192
I've heard no complaints.

150
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:15,983
[DOUSSANT] That's because
of me and my associates.

151
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,775
We step in and offer
to rebuild the farms

152
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,775
you knights destroyed
at our own expense.

153
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:24,817
Asking for nothing in
return, I might add.

154
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,775
Almost every farmer we
talked to accepted our aid.

155
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,942
How could they not?

156
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:31,192
The alternative was
to risk starvation.

157
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:32,942
This was all well and good,

158
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:36,483
but it wasn't enough to convince
the Inquisition to invade.

159
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:40,400
For that, we needed the horned
sorcerer you've been hiding.

160
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:43,025
Hold on a minute.
Do you mean Seth?

161
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:45,900
[MORDRED] No, there's
another one named Diabal.

162
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,983
[DOUSSANT]
The horned sorcerer my son met

163
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:51,150
lurking deep beneath
Caislean Merlin.

164
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:53,942
I've been informed that he's
an international criminal.

165
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:54,733
[LORD DE GULIS gasps]

166
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:56,067
What did he do?

167
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,733
That's odd. I'd assumed
you'd have some idea.

168
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,567
Well, not that it matters.

169
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,358
I doubt he's done half
of what they say.

170
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:07,192
Still, the knowledge of
his presence among you

171
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,733
was just what I needed
to get General Torque

172
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,275
to send his armada.

173
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:15,025
That and the promise
of glory restored.

174
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:16,358
[DOUSSANT chuckles]

175
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:19,108
[DOUSSANT] I've invested
time and money aplenty,

176
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:21,983
but it'll all pay
off soon enough.

177
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:23,192
The knights of Cyfandir

178
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:25,483
will never surrender
to the Inquisition.

179
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:26,817
This land belongs to us.

180
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,067
Ripe for development
as this land may be,

181
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,608
it's not our main objective.

182
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:32,900
What else could you
want to take from us?

183
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:35,108
We wanna take your freedom.

184
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:37,358
Our true goal is to make
Cyfandir's sorcerers

185
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:41,192
look like villainous monsters
so we can enslave them all.

186
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,067
Enslave them?

187
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,900
[MORDRED] You attacked your own
people with Spectral Nemeses,

188
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,608
refused to help them rebuild,

189
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,733
and started a completely
unnecessary war

190
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:53,400
by harboring an
international criminal.

191
00:10:53,483 --> 00:10:55,775
Your tyrannical actions are
proof that the infected

192
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,525
are both power hungry
and dangerous,

193
00:10:57,608 --> 00:11:00,192
so you're screwed.

194
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:01,858
But we never meant to--

195
00:11:01,942 --> 00:11:04,400
No one cares what you meant.

196
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:06,900
You so-called Faithful
of the Hermit...

197
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:10,275
You've helped us seal
your country's fate.

198
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:15,067
You did fine work for us.
We're in your debt.

199
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,442
And to repay you, I shall pry
the knight-sorcerer boot

200
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:20,775
from the neck of
Cyfandir's people.

201
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:22,317
You won't have to
trouble yourselves

202
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,650
with any more difficult choices,
once you're our property.

203
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:28,608
But you're talking about
enslaving the people

204
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:30,525
most capable of fighting
for their freedom--

205
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:32,317
you'll never stand a chance!

206
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,483
[MORDRED]
Sure we will.

207
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:37,733
We have a device that strips
the air of Fantasia.

208
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:40,400
You saw its strength
for yourself, right?

209
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:42,650
It renders magic powerless.

210
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,192
And without magic,
your army's done for.

211
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:47,358
Cyfandir will fall.

212
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:48,858
Even if you won,

213
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,942
the infected have lost any
sympathy they had in this world.

214
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:54,983
There's no point in
fighting on. Just surrender.

215
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:58,233
We'd hate to have
to shed more blood.

216
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,775
There's no way this is
what you actually want!

217
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:02,025
You were tricked,

218
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:04,025
or you're getting
blackmailed or something!

219
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,275
That's not true.

220
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,900
The fact of it is,

221
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:09,692
I've been preparing for
this day my entire life.

222
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:13,108
I knew I'd betray you guys
from the first day we met.

223
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,817
You can't really mean that.

224
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:33,525
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS screaming]

225
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,442
Uh. Sciath!

226
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:47,942
Our comrades are falling
left and right.

227
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:53,442
[SOLDIERS]
Your Majesty!

00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:55,067
[BOUDICA groans]

229
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,192
Please. You should
fall back and rest!

230
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:59,983
My loyal knights are
fighting for their lives.

231
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:03,775
You want me to sit back...
and leave them to be killed?

232
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:06,067
You've done more
than enough, My Queen!

233
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,942
[BOUDICA] All I've done is send
others to die on my behalf.

234
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,608
They laid down their
lives for Cyfandir,

235
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,233
so I will do the same!

236
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:17,692
[SOLDIER E]
Your Majesty!

237
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:19,650
[SOLDIER F]
Please, come back!

238
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:28,442
[screams]

239
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:29,608
It looks like their queen's

240
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:31,525
trying to charge us
all by herself.

241
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:33,233
Woman must've lost her mind.

242
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:34,858
[INQUISITION SOLDIER G]
Fire!

243
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,067
[BOUDICA yells]

244
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:48,858
[SANTORI]
Hmm.

245
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:51,608
Look at the way that glorious
she-beast moves her haunches.

246
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:53,817
I was hoping I might get
to face an opponent

247
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,650
with some stature today.

248
00:13:55,733 --> 00:14:00,358
Ready... fire!
Bring her down for Bome!

249

[INQUISITION SOLDIERS yell]

250
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,608
I don't get it. What does
she hope to accomplish?

251
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,775
She's just forcing
a desperate charge.

252
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:09,608
[INQUISITION SOLDIER L]
Open fire!

253
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:12,442
[INQUISITION SOLDIER M]
She isn't slowing down!

254
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:13,775
[INQUISITION SOLDIER L]
It's fine.

255
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:16,108
She's running straight into
the Fantasia vacuum

256
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:17,817
around the Thaumaturges.

257
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,567
We'll take her once
her shields fail.

258
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:28,983
Hold on. What are
you doing, My Queen?

259
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:33,817
You must turn back, My Queen!

260
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,400
Please listen! You're right
by the Fantasia vacuum!

261
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:39,900
[KNIGHT-SORCERER F]
Please don't do this!

00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,942
[KNIGHT-SORCERER G]
Your Majesty!

263
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:44,858
This is it!
Aim for the queen's legs!

264
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,108
[SANTORI]
Queen Boudica.

265
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,233
How long I've been
dreaming of the day

266
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:06,358
I'd get to face you in battle.

267
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:07,942
Might you step on me?

268
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:11,317
Crush me between your fingers
and toss me into the sky?

269
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,442
I used to lie wide
awake in my bed

270
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:17,067
just fantasizing about how you
and I would come to blows.

271
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,233
Well, I'm sure you can imagine
my disappointment.

272
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:24,192
You just blindly ran forward
till ya got taken down.

273
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:29,192
Even those golems you summoned
gave us more trouble than that.

274
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:32,442
I swear on my triumphant beard,

275
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:35,275
under the leadership of
a fool such as you,

276
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:40,150
it was only a matter of time
before this country collapsed.

277
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,900
Oho!

278
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,483
Wonderful, it seems
you still have

279
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,775
a little fight in you after all.

280
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:50,817
Get yourself together, Queenie.
I want you at your best.

281
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,650
I'm gonna climb you like
a cat and start scratching.

[SANTORI]
You never wanted to fight me.

292
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:35,150
You were after the
Harmonizium from the start.

293
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:37,233
Arrogant witch.

294

[gasps]

295
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:41,483
[SANTORI]
This just proves that your kind

296
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,817
can never be shown mercy!

297
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:52,942
Guess things could be worse.

298
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,358
It doesn't look like you managed

299
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:56,900
to destroy the
device completely.

300
00:16:56,983 --> 00:17:00,733
You just tipped it over,
disrupted it for a time.

301
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:03,150
And now that I've
captured you, My Queen,

302
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,525
I can swear on this
glorious beard,

303
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,025
the Inquisition's
victory is assured.

304
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:09,942
That being said,

305
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:14,442
simple victory isn't nearly
enough for yours truly.

306
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:17,025
I need a fight that's
worth remembering.

307
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:20,858
That horned sorcerer needs to
get his butt over here quickly.

308
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:23,442
Nobody else can quench
my bloodthirst.

309
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,608
Either he comes to me,
or I'll tear through

310
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:29,942
every town in this country
until I find him.

[DOUSSANT]
Good news.

It would appear that the
queen has been captured.

[SAGRAMORE]
What?

No way. That can't be!

00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:37,358
[LORD DE GULIS]
We must save her!

316
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:40,233
Or use your heads and come up
with a more prudent plan.

317
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,900
[LORD DE GULIS]
Such as what?

318
00:17:41,983 --> 00:17:44,942
Be it for good or ill,
this country's fate is sealed.

319
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:47,025
If I were you, I would
focus on securing

320
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,900
my personal safety and freedom.

321
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:50,942
[LORD DE GULIS]
I'm sure you would.

322
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:53,692
You've nothing to be
afraid of, my lord.

323
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:56,067
You and your pupil are heroes.

324
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,983
We'd be honored to welcome
both of you into our ranks,

325
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,692
and not as slaves, either.

326
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:02,025
[gasps]

327
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:03,442
[LORD DE GULIS] I've heard
quite enough from you.

328
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:07,525
We're proud knight-sorcerers!
And we shan't yield.

329
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:11,775
Seems negotiations have failed.
How very regrettable.

330
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,233
[CRISTOLOM]
Ha-ha!

331
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:16,108
Have at you, knave!

332
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,400
[LORD DE GULIS]
Ha! Not bad!

333
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:18,817
[CRISTOLOM] You're rather
impressive yourself!

334
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
They just fell off the airship!

335
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:28,817
I don't suppose that you
would care to negotiate?

336
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,483
When the terms involve
selling out my own country?

337
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:33,608
What is this, Mordred?
Wake up already!

338
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:35,608
Don't think I can
when I'm not asleep.

339
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:37,233
Let me lay it out
for you plainly.

340
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:40,775
I've lived my whole life in
anticipation of this moment.

341
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:42,900
Ever since I was a kid.

342
00:18:42,983 --> 00:18:44,442
Except I knew you as a kid--

343
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,817
you've always been
my best friend.

344
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,400
You expect me to believe
all that was fake?

345
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,817
I just played the role
of your friend.

346
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,608
It wasn't a very
difficult role, either.

347
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:58,608
Why are you saying all this?

348
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:00,942
I only bothered with keeping
up the act all these years

349
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:03,275
because it seemed efficient.

350
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:05,067
You were my first
guaranteed recruit

351
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,067
into the Faithful of the Hermit.

352
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,317
Why would you go so far

353
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,858
just to earn the favor
of a father like him?

354
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,025
My place is to obey
my father's orders,

355
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:15,025
not to question his will.

356
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:17,692
This is just the way things are.

357
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:21,525
Look, there isn't much point
in asking me why I do something.

358
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,525
I'm really just an empty shell.

359
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:25,650
You seem like a
whole person to me.

360
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:26,983
You just need a harsh reminder

361
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:29,358
that your actions
have consequences.

362
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:31,692
Yeah, that sounds like
something you'd try to do,

363
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,692
but you aren't about
to defeat me.

364
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:35,275
Even now, there's no
way you'll be able

365
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:37,275
to bring yourself
to cut me down.

366
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:38,858
We'll see about that.

367
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:42,150
Your calm, collected nature
was one of your only advantages.

368
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:44,400
Don't allow yourself
to get worked up.

369
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,483
You'll just make more mistakes.

370
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:49,525
We'll continue this later,
once you're on the ground.

371
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:51,400
You're welcome to try.

372
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,483
[CRISTOLOM,
LORD DE GULIS shouting]

373
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,692
Well, color me impressed.

374
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:04,733
Your skills are as
sharp as your blade.

375
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:06,108
But why use such a large sword,

376
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:08,400
are you trying to compensate
for something?

377
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:09,942
You aren't pretty
or red-headed enough

378
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:13,025
to be asking about my anatomy,
Sir Thunderthighs!

379
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:15,733
Though I confess that crossing
blades with you is thrilling!

380
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:17,275
You have a lethal grace!

381
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:19,192
And you are
swiftness personified!

382
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:23,233
[BOTH screaming]

383
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,483
If you swallow your pride
and agree to become a slave,

384
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,817
I promise you'll be
treated mercifully.

385
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,692
What kind of self-respecting
knight would agree

386
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,108
to become a mere slave?

387
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,608
[CRISTOLOM]
The smart kind!

388
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:39,233
You'd be a slave in name
alone, I assure you.

389
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:42,025
We'd be taking you under our
protection, you arrogant fool!

390
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,317
That's funny, I didn't
realize I was in danger

391
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,983
until you started swinging that
pathetic toothpick of yours!

392
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:49,108
It's called a rapier,
and if you don't listen,

393
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:50,608
it'll be the blade
that ends you.

394
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,525
If that's my fate, so be it!

395
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:53,692
There are worse ways to die

396
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:55,650
than at the hands
of a worthy rival.

397
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,817
Slay me if you can!

398

It's just as I thought.

You might seem cold-hearted
at a glance, but in truth,

414
00:22:05,983 --> 00:22:07,317
you're a nice guy,

for his friends.

417

And it's that naive streak

418
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:21,442
that made you such an easy mark.

No!

[NARRATOR] General Torque's
aim is to capture

422
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,317
the horned sorcerer, Seth,
not to conquer a nation.

423
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,650
Dragunov believes
this to be true

424
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:20,192
and follows his
orders accordingly.

425
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:22,817
Seth doesn't wish to see
Cyfandir torn apart

426
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,150
by war either, so he agrees
to let Dragunov take him in.
