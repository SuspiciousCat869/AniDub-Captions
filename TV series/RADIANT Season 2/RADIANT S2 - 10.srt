00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:12,400
[NARRATOR] Upon their return
from Caillte Forest,

2
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:14,483
Ocoho and Melie were
summoned to the palace

3
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:16,900
and accused of insubordination.

4
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,817
But due to Mordred's
intervention,

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,733
they were spared
the Queen's wrath.

6
00:00:20,817 --> 00:00:23,317
At the same time, Seth
was making great strides

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,775
under Myr's guidance,

8
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,150
though he has yet to master
the dark power within him.

9
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,733
Myr tells Seth of a
mysterious darkness

10
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:32,942
which tried to engulf
him in the Sidh,

11
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:37,483
and Seth's misgivings about
Piodon continue to grow.

12
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:40,567
[MYR] Ah. This is getting to be
more than I can handle.

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,358
That's enough for now.

14
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:49,233
[MYR]
So I was right.

15
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:53,900
When it can't see through the
peephole, it decides to leave.

16
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:55,358
I need to know, Seth.

17
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:57,192
If this is from your "brother,"

18
00:00:57,275 --> 00:01:00,358
why would he put something
like this inside of you?

19
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:03,983
Do you really think his
objective was to save your life?

20
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:26,275
[SETH sighs]

21
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:27,650
[SETH groans]

22
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:29,608
Well, that could've gone better.

23
00:01:29,692 --> 00:01:30,983
[MYR grunts]

24
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,525
[MYR] We've gained some
important knowledge

25
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:34,733
about this freeloader of yours,

26
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:37,525
but you couldn't quite manage
to take control of it.

27
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:39,692
I feel like I came
pretty close though.

28
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:42,733
I just need something to give me
a little bit more of an edge.

29
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:45,275
I had that exact thought myself.

30
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:47,567
Jill, why don't we whip it out?

31
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,108
Sure.

32
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,192
Huh?

33
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:54,650
[MYR] Across the line
and under the vine.

34
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:55,858
There.

35
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:56,983
[SETH]
Hmm...

36
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,275
Is it an armband?

37
00:01:59,358 --> 00:02:02,067
Well, I'd call it a bracelet.

38
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,650
[chuckles]

39
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,483
And, um, not that you asked,

40
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:06,900
but it's made of wood and hair

41
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:09,608
from a very special
part of my body.

42
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:12,983
[screams]

43
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:16,150
[SETH]
What?!

44
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,483
[NARRATOR] "The Qualifications
of a Knight."

45
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:55,150
[SETH screams]

46
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:58,442
[SETH] What the heck did
you put on me, Myr?

47
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,317
I was just kidding, relax!

48
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,275
Learn to smell a joke
already, would ya?

49
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:06,733
Phew. That's a relief.
You got me good there.

50
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:08,858
So, what is it really?

51
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:12,067
Oh, just a little idea
that Jill floated to me.

52
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,067
It should help you keep
that freeloader at bay.

53
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,150
Tell me, do you feel
anything by chance?

54
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,567
It's really warm.

55
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,942
Almost like it's been
out in the sun.

56
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:27,317
It was fashioned from
the bark of a special tree

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
found here in Caillte Forest.

58
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:32,192
You do remember that we immersed
you in a bubble of Jill's sap

59
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:35,483
in order to bring you back from
death's door earlier, don't you?

60
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,025
[SETH]
Yeah.

61
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:39,983
[MYR] Well, that sap seeped
inside you through your wounds.

62
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,567
Which means Jill is
now a part of you.

63
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,108
As is the forest itself.

64
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:50,942
[JILL chuckles]

65
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:52,983
Now let's hear how
grateful you are.

66
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:56,108
Oh, yeah. I owe you
big time for this.

67
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:57,942
[MYR]
Mh-hm.

68
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:00,442
Let that band strengthen
your newfound connection

69
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:01,900
to the forest.

70
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:04,275
Whenever you fear you might
lose control to the shadow

71
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:05,817
that monitors you from the Sidh,

72
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,067
use that piece of the forest to
anchor yourself to this world.

73
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,817
I'll try that. Thanks!

74
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,067
Guess that's all, right?

75
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,067
You mind if we get
back to training now?

76
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,567
Mhm. Sure.
But one last thing, Seth.

77
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,400
I feel I should give
you a quick warning.

78
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:21,567
Huh?

79
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,150
Well, um, frankly,

80
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:27,608
what I saw in the
Sidh scared me.

81
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:30,150
The force of darkness called
forth by the freeloader

82
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:32,442
you described as a peephole,

83
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:34,942
you need to be wary
of it, understand?

84
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:37,150
[JILL]
Yes. Myr's right.

85
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:39,400
If that darkness engulfs
you completely,

86
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:40,858
then there's a chance
that you might never

87
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,150
regain consciousness again.

88
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:46,192
[MYR] Jill and I have spent a
great deal of time in the Sidh.

89
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:47,858
We delve into it every day,

90
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:51,317
and we've never encountered
something so hostile there.

91
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:54,358
So, yeah.

92
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:56,442
You just need to get that pesky
little freeloader sealed away

93
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:58,858
so as to keep it from telling
the darkness where you are,

94
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,400
and then you'll have
nothing to worry about!

95
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:04,150
How this goes will depend
the state of your heart.

96
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:06,817
That, and the size
of your stones.

97
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,817
[chuckles]

98
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,067
Whatever.

99
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,067
Look, I made a promise to Melie

100
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,025
and I'm not about
to break my word.

101
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:15,442
I'll get this thing
under control.

102
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:19,108
No matter how long
it takes, I'mma do it!

103
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:20,608
[MYR]
We're glad to hear that.

104
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:22,358
You've got the right
attitude, Seth.

105
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:24,192
Work hard and have fun doing it.

106
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:25,233
Totally!

107
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:26,733
I bet Melie and
Ocoho are training

108
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:28,983
with the knight-sorcerers
day in and day out.

109
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,317
I've gotta hustle to keep up!

110
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,608
[horn blaring]

111
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,483
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS chattering]

112
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,108
What's going on?

113
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:50,817
A Nemesis has appeared
in the farmland

114
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,275
on the outskirts of town.

115
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,650
[BRANGOIRE]
Is it a Spectre?

116
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:54,858
[SAGRAMORE]
No.

117
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,733
It appears to be the
standard variety, sir.

118
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,150
All right.

119
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:00,483
All knight candidates and
squires should make ready.

120
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:03,108
I want you on your dragons
in the next two minutes.

121
00:07:03,192 --> 00:07:05,233
Anyone who lags behind
will be punished

122

first by my fist
and second by my-my--

Oh, what's it matter?

124
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,942
The point is, you'll
be punished severely!

125
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:14,067
Yeah. So move it!

[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Sir!

127
00:07:15,483 --> 00:07:17,317
That order was for knight
candidates and squires,

128
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,733
not for you trainees.

129

stay home for this one.

You can set your
worries aside now.

136

Under my command, I promise
you'll find glory aplenty.

137
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:38,275
More than enough to restore
your recently sullied honor.

Tell me, my carrot.

Are you planning to join
us on this operation?

142
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,983
Um, I'd like to.

143
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,942
It seems fire has kissed
your hair and your soul!

144

Thou art a cruel Valkyrie!

145
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:56,150
I can picture you soaring
over the battlefield already!

146
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,025
I should--

147
00:07:57,108 --> 00:07:58,817
And I'm certain I'm not alone

148
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,567
for I daresay a captivating
beauty such as yours

149
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,192
could beguile any hero,
living or dead.

150
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,775
Huh. Okay.

151
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:09,900
Ah, but wait! Battling a Nemesis
can be terribly perilous!

152
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,358
Knowing that,

153
00:08:11,442 --> 00:08:13,358
I want you to stay in the
safest place in this world.

154

Yes. You'll fly

Sure. Got it.

[chuckles] Very good.

And as one last precaution, I'll
give you this protective charm.

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,192
[MELIE]
Oh, no. I'm really sorry!

162
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:35,358
[LORD DE GULIS]
Don't be, my dear, it's fine.

163
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:37,692
All has gone according
to plan, I assure you.

164
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:40,358
What's a thorn or three to a
seasoned warrior such as mys--?

165
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:43,150
[BRANGOIRE]
That's enough, Lord de Gulis!

166
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:44,817
We're in the midst
of an emergency--

167
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,358
we must move immediately.

168
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,067
Pha! I see that your approach

169
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,400
is just as graceless
as it's always been.

170
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:51,858
[BRANGOIRE]
Come again?

171
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:54,442
It's in times of urgency
that we need to relax the most.

172
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:57,233
Fear and anxiety tend to
spread like twin plagues.

173
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:59,983
A true knight-sorcerer serves
as both the people's sword

174
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:01,775
and their star of hope.

175
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:04,108
Therefore, we must be
elegant in all things.

176
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:05,150
[BRANGOIRE grumbles]

177
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,900
Let's just go already.

178
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:09,108
Knights, mount your
dragons at once.

179
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:11,192
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Sir!

180
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:13,275
[OCOHO]
'Kay. You ready?

181
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:16,317
Let's hunt this Nemesis.

182
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:27,275
[FARMERS yelling]

183
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:30,817
Petro!

184
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:34,358
[PETRO screams]

185
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:42,150
Whoa. How are we okay?

186
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,817
By Merlin's beard, we're safe.

187
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,942
[LORD DE GULIS laughing]

188
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:53,067
You good people had quite
the close call, I see.

189
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,650
I'm Lord de Gulis.

190
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,317
If you've heard stories about
Gulis the Nemesis Slayer,

191
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,025
then you know my name well!

192
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:00,692
[laughs]

193
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:03,650
[FARMER A]
Whoa. The Golden Knight!

194
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,025
[LORD DE GULIS yells]

195
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:06,733
[LORD DE GULIS]
What's happening?! Where am I?!

196
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:09,233
Confounded cape!

197
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:13,525
Fear not, citizens!
This is all according to plan!

198
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:14,858
[BRANGOIRE]
Lord de Gulis!

199
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:17,483
We're meant to fight
the Nemesis as a group.

200
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:20,525
Forgive me.

201
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:22,233
When I saw these helpless
villagers in danger,

202
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:24,483
my longsword all-but
moved on its own.

203
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:25,942
[growls]

204
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,150
Dismount!

205
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:28,817
We'll start by
assessing the damage,

206
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,192
then move on to cleaning
up the Nemesis corpse.

207
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:32,442
[KNIGHT-SORCERERS]
Sir!

208
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:38,108
[MELIE] Wow. He killed it
with a single strike.

209
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:40,858
That's amazing. I didn't
know he was so strong.

210
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:42,317
Although he is still weird.

211
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,483
Oh, yeah.

212
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,317
Lord de Gulis is one
of the most powerful

213
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,942
knights-sorcerers we have.

214
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:49,192
But you're right
that he's weird.

215
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:52,108
He has mentored both Mordred
and Sagramore though,

216
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:53,650
and look at how they turned out.

217
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:56,025
They may well be the most
promising knight-candidates

218
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:57,692
of our generation.

219
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,150
Those two were brilliant
to begin with though,

220
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:03,025
so that's to be expected.

221
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:05,150
Huh. But...

222
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:08,317
Even though they're both
prestigious knight-sorcerers,

223
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,983
Lords Brangoire and Gulis
seem kind of, well...

224
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,650
...they're very different.

225
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:14,817
Yeah, I'm sure you've noticed

226
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,025
that they don't get
along all that well.

227
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:19,233
And I wouldn't really
expect them to.

228
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:21,108
They have completely
opposite concepts

229
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:23,692
of how knight-sorcerers should
conduct themselves.

230
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,400
What would you say is
the main difference?

231
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:27,650
To put it sympathetically,

232
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:31,067
Lord de Gulis is kind of
a heroic individualist.

233
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,983
He believes that knights should
showcase their unique abilities

234
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,858
and behave like
champions of the people.

235
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:38,025
While on the other hand,

236
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:40,067
Lord Brangoire is a
firm disciplinarian

237
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,775
who values humility and
efficient teamwork.

238
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:46,192
It sorta seems like he's
the one who's actually right.

239
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:47,108
Kind of.

240
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:48,358
Teamwork is great,

241
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,442
but Lord Brangoire
can take it too far.

242
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:52,775
I wish he was more
flexible, you know?

243
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:54,525
Also, his gruff
approach to things

244
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:57,983
hasn't done much for
his public image.

245
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:59,317
[MELIE]
Interesting.

246
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,275
So even though they're
knights of the same order,

247
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:03,775
they still disagree about stuff.

248
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:05,650
Yeah, that's perfectly normal.

249
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:06,900
Is it now?

250
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:09,608
So is that why you like
to disobey your orders?

251
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:11,608
You're the one who
charged into Caillte Forest

252
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:13,400
after I warned you not to.

253
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,817
[BRANGOIRE] What are you
two blabbering about?

254
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,442
[OCOHO]
Uh-oh.

255
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:18,025
[MELIE yells]

256
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:22,067
That girl again... Honestly.

257
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,858
Huh? What's this?

258
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,608
[KNIGHT-SORCERER B]
Lord Brangoire! There's trouble!

259
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:27,650
[BRANGOIRE]
Report!

260
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,650
Another Nemesis
has appeared nearby!

261
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,525
[BRANGOIRE]
Nearby. Which way?

262
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:33,317
Just on the other
side of that hill,

263
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,233
near a settlement
to the north, sir!

264
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:37,817
It's much larger than
the last one was.

265
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:40,900
Cease your work
for the time being!

266
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:43,817
There's a giant Nemesis we've
gotta take out, so mount up!

267
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,567
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Sir!

268
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,108
[LORD DE GULIS laughing]

269
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:47,275
Huh?

270
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:49,067
I hear that a Nemesis
of prodigious size

271
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,650
has just appeared.

272
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:52,067
I must ride!

273
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,942
If you're in the air now,
you can form my vanguard!

274
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:55,817
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Sir!

275
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,192
Ah, crap.

276
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:59,692
Of course de Gulis would
try something like this.

277
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,025
The rest of you are
with me, get moving!

278
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:03,400
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Yes, sir!

279
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,483
We should move.

280
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:05,775
Right!

281
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:09,817
[FARMER D] Ah. Those knights
are an inspiration!

282
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,733
I pray the great
Merlin's blessing

283
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:13,775
will ride with every
last one of them!

284
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:17,275
You've got this!
Kill the monster!

285
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:19,900
Now that was a stirring
call to action, my boy!

286
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:22,233
You've a warrior's
heart! Well said!

287
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:27,025
Drink your milk so you can grow
up strong like me, all right?

288
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:29,525
You're a fine soldier,
but as a knight-sorcerer,

289
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,900
you should give
more consideration

290
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:32,650
to the image you cultivate.

291
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:34,025
There's no need.

292
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:36,067
I don't care if these civilians
love us or hate us,

293
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,983
just so long as they're safe.

294
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,775
Regardless, we should
discuss our strategy

295
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:42,275
for vanquishing
that huge Nemesis.

296
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:43,775
Hmm...

297
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:46,608
This one's a real threat.
We should approach with caution.

298
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,525
Why don't we split up
into proper squads

299
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:50,233
and go for a pincer maneuver?

300
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:52,983
Using Gysoni, of course.
And keeping our distance.

301
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:56,567
Ah! You know what?
That gave me a splendid idea!

302
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,608
Why don't we have our squads
compete in a contest?

303
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:00,858
Say what?

304
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:02,483
The squad that
defeats the Nemesis

305
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,442
shall sit at a banquet
hosted by the losers!

306
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:08,650
No. I won't participate in
this absurd game of yours.

307
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:11,983
Brave knights of my vanguard,
we ride to battle!

308
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:13,358
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Sir!

309
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:14,525
[growls]

310
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:16,317
We need to back them up.

311
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,442
You heard me!

312
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,192
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Sir!

313
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,317
[PETRO] I know you can
beat him, Golden Knight!

314
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,900
You've got this!
You're the best!

315
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:25,775
[LORD DE GULIS laughs]

316
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:29,192
[LORD DE GULIS]
Thank you, son! So are you!

317
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:31,150
[BRANGOIRE] We'll do this

[OCOHO]
Hmm...

00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,900
What's wrong?

322
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:40,192
We need to get moving. It'll be
tough to catch up as it is.

323

If they see us lagging behind,
then we'll get in trouble again.

Yeah. Whatever it is,
it's not good.

Look at that Nemesis.

This won't be enough

The Echoes are scattered
all over now!

If we aren't careful,

these villagers could end up
caught in the crossfire!

with a stick, right?

360
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:21,400
Maybe I don't have a sword,

361
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:23,817
but the Golden Knight said
I had a warrior's heart!

362
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,067
Well, that much is obvious.

363
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,650
I'm sure you'll grow up
to be crazy strong.

364
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,692
[OCOHO] The Echoes are
trampling the fields.

365
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:35,817
I can't allow them to cause
any more damage here.

366
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,400
And with everyone
else so far away,

367
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:41,067
I have no choice but
to handle this myself.

368
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,525
Which means... my only
option is close combat.

out of your sight.

with all of them by myself.

They're too far to hear me.

00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:22,317
It's hopeless.

402
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,317
Thanks to Draccoon, I can see
where all the Echo Nemeses are,

403
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,275
but that doesn't help
me stop them.

00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:29,733
What can I do?

405
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,192
Of course!

406
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:34,067
Lord Brangoire communicates
at a distance with Gysoni.

407
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,817
I could do the same, but...

408
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,275
Doesn't matter!

409
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:40,025
Let's set the record straight!

410
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:42,567
How many times do I have
to tell you that on your own,

411
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,900
you're nothing?!

412
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:46,150
Your personal ambitions
are just rust on the chain

413
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:48,275
your comrades have formed!

414
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:50,525
Just be very careful
from now on.

415
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:53,442
There are many actions that
men are always praised for,

416
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:55,275
but when a woman
behaves the same way,

417
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:57,775
she'll be labeled
as impertinent.

418
00:18:57,858 --> 00:19:00,108
They may hold me in
the highest regard,

419
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:02,567
but the knights are
still a society of men.

420
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,525
And many of them do not
look upon you favorably.

421
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:07,233
Listen very carefully.

422
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:10,233
You would do well to try and
lay low until your ordination,

423
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:10,858
got it?

424
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,233
[giggles]

425
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:17,233
[OCOHO] I'm supposed to
lay low until I get ordained.

426
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:19,692
If I go against orders
and pull another stunt,

427
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:21,733
the knights could
flat out reject me.

428
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:24,108
I should've just
kept my head down.

429
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:26,775
I should've just
followed my orders!

430
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:28,067
You've got orders?

431
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,775
And why the heck
should that matter?

432
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:33,317
You think that means you can
blast whatever's in your way?

433
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,608
[OCOHO]
No!

434
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:37,192
[OCOHO]
I have to act.

435
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:39,900
Because the knight-sorcerer
I want to become

436
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:42,525
is the kind who
protects the people.

437
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:45,275
I won't be a coward who
ignores someone's suffering

438
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:46,942
because of an order.

439
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:48,983
I'll save every life I can.

440
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,942
Even if I'm giving up my
shot at getting ordained!

441
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,025
[OCOHO]
Gysoni!

442
00:19:57,358 --> 00:20:00,067
All my Gysoni bonds were
suddenly disconnected.

443
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,108
What could make that happen?

444
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:03,317
[gasps]

445

[BRANGOIRE] Where do
you think you're going?!

446
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:08,192
[BRANGOIRE] By Merlin,
they're still in Gysoni.

447
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:11,150
And it seems their flames
have gotten stronger.

448
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:13,108
What's going on here?

449
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:27,067
Okay. Fan out!

450
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,192
[OCOHO]
Find your targets.

451
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,567
Fire!

452

[OCOHO]
Protect the people at all costs.

453
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,067
Eliminate the monsters
that threaten them!

454
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,108
Don't let any escape!

455
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:41,608
Let's show these Nemeses

456
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:44,942
how the proud knight-sorcerers
of Caislean Merlin fight!

457
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:49,067
All that we do, we do for
the life of this land!

458
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,650
[growls]

459
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:05,942
Looks like we're done.
I think we got all the Echoes.

460
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,817
Okay. Good.

461
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:14,150
[KNIGHT-SORCERER A]
Huh?

462
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,192
[KNIGHT-SORCERER B]
What the heck just happened?

463
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,275
Well, we had entered Gysoni,

464
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,942
then everything got kinda
blurry all of a sudden,

465
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:24,900
and I wasn't even able to
hear Lord Brangoire's voice.

466
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,358
[KNIGHT-SORCERER C]
Same here.

467
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:29,317
I was with Lord de Gulis,
so I didn't even use Gysoni.

468
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,275
Check out all those Nemeses.
It looks like they're dead.

469
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:34,567
[KNIGHT-SORCERER F]
Who killed them? Was it us?

470
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,317
[KNIGHT-SORCERER G]
If it was, I don't remember it.

471
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,317
[KNIGHT-SORCERER B] And where
do you think all of these Echoes

472
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,275
came from anyway?

473
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,275
Look next to that building.
Do you see her?

474

Talkin' to you, Sagramore.

475

[SAGRAMORE]
Is that Ocoho?

476
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:51,150
Why is there a child
on her dragon?

477
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,608
Hey, knight lady! Wake up!

478
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,733
[DOUSSANT]
Hmm...

479
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,150
It would appear that the
knight-sorcerers defeated

480
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:04,317
both the Source Nemesis
and its Echoes.

481
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,608
I don't see any
casualties either.

482
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,650
All according to plan.

483
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,150
"According to plan"?

484
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:12,025
You can't seriously
expect me to believe

485
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:15,608
that you predicted the actions
of that knight-candidate girl.

486
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:17,942
Yes, I'll admit I was
somewhat surprised

487
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:20,942
by the extent of the
young lady's power.

488
00:22:21,025 --> 00:22:23,317
But if we play our hand wisely,

489
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,275
her strength might just
increase our profits.

490
00:22:27,358 --> 00:22:29,233
Her name is Ocoho, by the way.

491
00:22:29,317 --> 00:22:32,192
She's been extremely useful
to our cause already.

492
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:36,650
And she'll continue to be
the cornerstone of our plan.

493
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:11,817
[NARRATOR] Fantasia is
the power of imagination.

494
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,900
A link with Fantasia is
a link to the world.

495
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:16,567
Armed with Myr's teachings,

496
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,067
Seth faces the shadowy monitor
within himself once more.

497
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,108
He attempts to control
it with Fantasia,

498
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:25,150
but its strength
is hard to match.

499
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:28,275
Can Seth evict the
freeloader at last?

500
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:32,275
Next time on <i>Radiant</i> ,
"Now, Feel the World."
