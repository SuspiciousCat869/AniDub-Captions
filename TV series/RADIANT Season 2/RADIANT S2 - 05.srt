1
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:12,858
[NARRATOR] After the fight
with the Spectral Nemesis,

2
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:15,650
Seth encountered
Grimm once again.

3
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,858
Grimm asked Seth for a favor,

4
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:20,317
then suggested that Seth
look for Doc and Melie

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,317
at an inn called the Luchorpan.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,233
And so, Seth did exactly that.

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,900
[DOC] Who the heck's knockin'
in the dead of night?

8
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,275
It's you!

9
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:15,358
[SETH]
Yeah. Hey.

10
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,025
[DOC]
How did you know we were here?!

11
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:20,567
Let's call it a guess.
So is Melie here?

12
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,733
Her? Yeah, but she's
already asleep, so...

13
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:24,942
[MELIE]
Doc?

14
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:27,025
[SETH]
Then who was that?

15
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:29,150
Get outta here, will ya?
We need our rest!

16
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:30,275
[SETH]
I heard her!

17
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:32,733
Come on. Why are you
acting like this?

18
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:33,983
It sucks, but you need
to leave, 'kay?

19
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:35,858
I'm serious. This is for
your own good, Seth.

20
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,358
[SETH]
What?

21
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:40,233
Listen, Doc, I just wanna tell
her that I'm sorry, okay?

22
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:44,858
[MELIE]
What for? Why are you sorry?

23
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,233
Melie.

24
00:03:20,858 --> 00:03:24,400
[NARRATOR]
"Silent Rain, Distant Hearts."

25
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,900
You say you're sorry,
but why would you be?

26
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:35,067
I--

27
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,900
[MELIE] What made you decide
to come and see us,

28
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,317
after what you did?

29
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,650
Oh, um. Well, I--

30
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,358
For one thing,
I want to let you know

31
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:47,483
that I still plan to pay
you guys back. I swear.

32
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,858
Oh, so that's what
this is about.

33
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:52,983
Well, then there's no need
for you to say sorry.

34
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,275
You don't owe me anything.

35
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:56,150
Stop! Please tell me
what's going on with you!

36
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,275
[MELIE] I have a very
busy day tomorrow.

37
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:00,150
Wait, you're angry
because I left Artemis

38
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,150
without warning you,
is that right?

39
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,483
[MELIE]
Not at all. It's fine.

40
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,983
Then talk to me!

41
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:09,108
I just wanna know how I
made you so angry, Melie.

42
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:10,942
[MELIE]
You haven't. I'm not.

43
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:12,567
It really seems like you are.

44
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,567
I can honestly say
I'm not mad at you.

45
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,608
But... I'll admit that
I'm a bit jealous.

46
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,108
What?

47
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,858
Seth, it must be nice for you,

48
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:25,608
to move on to the next
thing just like that.

49
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:30,025
We had lots of adventures
in Artemis, didn't we?

50
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:32,692
It was fun while it
lasted, at least.

51
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:33,942
[SETH]
Yeah.

52
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:35,358
[MELIE]
We hung out at Kettle Coffee.

53
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,900
Took a job from
Master Lord Majesty.

54
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,650
Saved Doc from a Kraken.

55
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:40,650
Good times.

56
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,983
Uh. Sure.

57
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:47,233
[MELIE] Actually, a lot of what
we did was scary or sad,

58
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:50,233
but we got through it
because we had each other.

59
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:53,275
We weren't together
for long. Not really.

60
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:55,942
But even so, I thought
of us as a team.

61
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,483
As friends.

62
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:03,025
And then you left. Because you
didn't feel the same way.

63
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:04,567
Melie.

64
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,233
[MELIE] We didn't mean to
you what you meant to us.

65
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:09,442
It's just that simple, Seth.

66
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:17,358
[MELIE]
Nothing to say to that?

67
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,317
Good. That's fine.

68
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,233
Must be my fault for
misunderstanding

69
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:22,317
--where you and I stood.

70
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,108
--It isn't true.
--where you and I stood.

71
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:28,317
[SETH] You guys...
are both important to me.

72
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,483
Really. I care about you.

73
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:32,942
That's why I didn't
want to cause you

74
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:34,567
more trouble than I had.

75
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,317
You're kidding.
What kind of trouble?

76
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,733
[SETH] You know.
The kind that I get into.

77
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:40,983
Before you took off,

78
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,942
when you said you
wanted to come here,

79
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:46,150
I was so excited to see
the knight-sorcerers.

80
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:50,692
With them, I thought I'd be able
to improve my offensive magic.

81
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:53,692
It didn't even cross my mind
that you wouldn't take me.

82
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:57,692
I'm sorry. I never should've
gotten your hopes up like that.

83
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:01,025
I didn't exactly
plan all this out.

84
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:02,858
But I didn't want to
leave you guys behind.

85
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:05,483
I did it because I was
worried about you.

86
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,358
Look, I've got no idea why,

87
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:13,108
but those Thaumaturge guys
are still trying to catch me.

88
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:15,858
Honestly, I just--

89
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,525
I don't wanna put
either one of you

90
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:20,067
into any more
danger than I have.

91
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,900
[MELIE] Setting the state
of Doc's body aside,

92
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,442
we aren't children in
need of protection.

93
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:27,983
I can take care of
myself just fine.

94
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:31,858
Besides, even if something
were to happen to me,

95
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:35,275
that wouldn't be anyone's
responsibility but my own.

96
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:39,275
If you had any faith in me,
I think you'd agree with that.

97
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:43,233
But you see me as a
weakness. A liability.

98
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:46,775
So yeah. Of course you
came to this town alone.

99
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:50,400
I trust you both
completely. It's just--

100
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:51,567
[MELIE]
Go on.

101
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,650
[SETH]
Actually, you know what?

102
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,900
You're right.

103
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:01,567
It's true. I left you
behind for a reason.

104
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,150
It's because I didn't
want you around me.

105
00:07:06,983 --> 00:07:10,400
What's with you?
That was just mean.

106
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:11,983
But it needs to be said.

107
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,317
I'm not just worried about the
Nemesis and the Inquisition.

108
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,567
I'm scared of myself.

109
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,400
Fact is, I don't know when
I might lose control next,

110
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,525
and so I'm worried
that it might happen

111
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:24,858
with you guys around.

112
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:25,983
Why's that?

113
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:27,983
You've gotta be kidding me.

114
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,858
Look, have you forgotten
what I turned into

115
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:31,775
when I fought against
the Thaumaturges?

116
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:36,025
Of course I remember.
I was really scared.

117
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:38,358
Okay, in that case,
you should understand!

118
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:40,150
Whenever I lose
control of myself,

119
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:41,817
I don't know what's what.

120
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,775
I can't tell friend from foe.

121
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:46,567
So basically, you left
me and Doc behind

122
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,108
because you don't feel like
we're strong enough, right?

123
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:52,108
That's not the point
I'm trying to make here!

124
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:54,858
[MELIE] You think that I'm
so useless and fragile

125
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,400
that all I could do
if you went berserk

126
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:58,483
is get myself killed.

127
00:07:58,567 --> 00:07:59,817
I know you're tough,

128
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,858
and I don't think that
either of you are useless!

129
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:04,525
[MELIE] Right. You just
don't have any use for us.

130
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:05,900
You're wrong!

131
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:08,692
I'd've brought you, but I'm
not safe to be around.

132
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:11,025
When that other side
of me takes over,

133
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:13,442
there's no telling
what I might do.

134
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:14,317
So I can't just--

135
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,942
You can't what? Have friends?

136
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:19,775
You think that if you can't
fully control yourself,

137
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,317
then you shouldn't
get close to anyone?

138
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,983
You think that rather
than ask for help,

139
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,233
some people should
just be alone?

140
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:28,983
Come on, Seth. Look at
who you're talking to!

141
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:32,775
It's me. "Crazy Melie,"
the walking disaster!

142
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:35,275
I get it, the thought that
there's someone inside you

143
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:36,483
who could hurt your friends

144
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:39,858
without you even knowing
it is terrifying!

145
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:43,817
Who would even wanna be friends
with someone like that?

146
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,025
Not too many.

147
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,483
After years of searching,
I know that for a fact.

148
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:55,025
[MELIE]
Ever since I was infected,

149
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:57,692
there's been this growing
void around me.

150
00:08:57,775 --> 00:09:00,233
I didn't have to decide to
keep people at arm's length

151
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:04,400
like you have, Seth, the
other Melie did that for me.

152
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:07,317
She's ruined my entire life.

153
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,900
But I never stopped hoping
things would change someday.

154
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,275
That I'd meet someone who
would stand by my side.

155
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:17,983
Someone who could stop me
if I started acting crazy.

[MELIE]
And maybe, just maybe,

157
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:25,233
if that someone
had been there...

158
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:27,692
...then it's possible
that poor Venelope

159
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,025
would still be around, even now.

160
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,442
[MELIE]
Things were better.

161
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:40,025
I'd finally found someone
who understood my pain.

162
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:42,983
Someone who accepted
me and my curse.

163
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:47,483
I had a friend I could trust.
A friend who trusted me.

164
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,108
At least, that's what I thought.

165
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:11,275
I'm sorry, Seth.

166
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:14,942
I didn't wanna let you
see me act so pathetic.

[SETH]
Listen--

168
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,150
Stop talking. Please.

169
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:20,108
I didn't say all that to
get you to comfort me,

170
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:23,858
and your pity doesn't
do me any good either.

171
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:27,858
I honestly wouldn't know,
but maybe you're right.

172
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:32,108
Maybe I should be living
the same way that you do.

173
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:34,817
If I kept people
at arm's length,

174
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,608
if I stopped opening my heart,

175
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:39,983
I guess I would
stop getting hurt.

176
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,067
But it was worth the pain.

177
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,608
Having a friend who
worried with me,

178
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:49,650
who wasn't afraid
to stand at my side.

179
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,317
Know what? Maybe this isn't
about which way is right.

180
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,567
Maybe we're just different.

181
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,608
I guess you just didn't want
the same things as me.

[SETH gasps]

Goodbye.

[DOC]
You know, Seth.

187
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:02,817
I tried hard to talk Melie
out of coming here.

188
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:06,317
But she had already
made up her mind.

189
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,150
The way she put it, she wanted
to strengthen her magic

190
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:11,900
and prove that she could
take care of herself.

191
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,650
Apparently, she's joined up
with other teams before,

192
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,108
but it never lasted too long.

193
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:23,108
Each time, her curse would
take over and screw it all up.

194
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:26,817
Melie's been waiting
for most of her life

195
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,233
to meet someone like you.

196
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:31,275
Someone who wouldn't give
a damn what her curse was.

197
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:33,692
But then...

198
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:36,900
I left her. Just like
all the others.

199
00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:40,317
Even though your intentions
were entirely different,

200
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,192
you ended up ditchin'
Melie in the same way

201
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:45,733
all the people before you had,
and that was rough for her.

202
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:51,817
[DOC] So maybe try not to blame
her for how she's takin' it.

There's only one person
to blame here. That's me.

No prob. Just a second.

Where could I have
put that thing?

using it as a pillow.

Who's Lulu?

Is she why the password
was "Lulu is napping"?

You haven't actually
met her yet, have you?

251

She's a little busy.

But this is my squire, Lulu.

She helps me take
care of Draccoon.

She also pilots Draccoon,
maintains our equipment,

trains with me, and helps me
out in a bunch of other ways.

That's 'cause you're weird!

Hey! Can I guess it?

274
00:16:55,358 --> 00:16:56,900
I'm thinkin' your curse
makes you ignore

275
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:59,192
whatever anybody says
to you, is that right?

276
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:03,025
No! You just keep getting more
rude over time, ya know that?

That means I'm close.

[OCOHO] Help me drown him out,

I asked you to cover
my ears, not...

That looks cozy.

283
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:17,525
Well, anyway, I think I'll
go ahead and take the hint

284
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:20,525
to stop making guesses
about your curse for now.

285

[OCOHO sighs]

286
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,858
It's clear that you
aren't used to the way

287
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,942
things work in Cyfandir.

288
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:27,817
So tell me, where'd
you come from?

289
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,025
Most recently,
I lived in Artemis.

290
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:31,233
Before I moved there,

291
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,192
I stayed near a place
called Pompo Hills.

292
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:35,192
And you came all the
way to Caislean Merlin

293
00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:36,400
from way out there?

294
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:37,942
Why would you do that?

295
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,150
Mostly 'cause I'm
trying to find Radiant.

296
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:43,192
Radiant, huh? You wanna
find it for a reason?

297
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:44,983
To help fix the world.

298
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,400
So believe it or not,

299
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,942
I was told your
knight-sorcerers here

300
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,692
were searching for it as well.

301
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:51,817
Doesn't look like
that's true anymore.

302
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,358
It's not. That quest
ended a long time ago.

303
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,275
Which means my only chance
to find something out

304
00:17:57,358 --> 00:17:59,275
is to break into
the Castle Archives.

305
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:02,442
I wouldn't recommend it.
The archives are well-guarded.

00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:05,733
Hey, cut that out! Come on, Myr!

307

What's with you?

308
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:08,775
How long ago did you creep in,

309
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:11,108
and what are you always doing
here, ya sneaky little imp?

310
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:12,858
I'm just getting
out of the storm.

enough to drown a duck.

00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:19,025
[OCOHO] Hey! Get your paws
off Draccoons's food!

314
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:20,233
Stop pretending you're homeless

315
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:21,692
and go back to
your wife already!

316
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:23,483
I would if she'd have me.

317
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:25,150
But she's all kinds
of angry at me!

318
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,067
I got the boot 'cause
she thinks I cheated!

319
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,900
You? Cheat? No way!
You might try to.

320
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,567
[MYR]
You'd be surprised.

321
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,775
I'll have you know that I've
got more than one mistress.

322
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:35,025
I'm a ladies' man...

323
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:36,400
[SETH]
Maybe I'll leave and come back.

324
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,400
I'll play you this romantic
little number I wrote

325
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:40,025
with the girls in mind.

326
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:41,108
Ahem.

327
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:42,650
The berry first
time we did meet,

328
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,442
I did not believe
that melons could grow

329
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:45,900
so round as yours.

330
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:47,900
But in time we grew close,
and entwined and did greet,

331
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:50,233
your sister so sweet
as no wine e're poured.

332
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:51,942
And so I resolved to
make you both mine.

333
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:54,108
To declare you sweet
cantaloupes my little--

334
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:55,900
--[thud]
--[MYR screams]

335
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:57,317
Feel free to step in
and help me deal

336
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,275
with this freak anytime, Seth!

337
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:02,108
Huh? Seth?

338
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:03,900
[SETH]
Man, his songs are awkward.

339
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:05,442
[OCOHO]
Going somewhere?

340
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:08,358
Don't'cha think you've got a
little explaining to do first?

341
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,025
I'm sorry for causing
you trouble earlier.

342
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,650
It was my fault that
ya got yelled at

343
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,275
by the mean old dude
with the beard.

344
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:17,817
[OCOHO]
I don't care about that.

345
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,233
I wanna know your
secret, so spit it out!

346
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:22,692
[SETH]
What? Spit what out?

347
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:24,317
[OCOHO] The secret of how
you were able to gather

348
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,317
such an insane
amount of Fantasia

349
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,358
when we were casting
that Cromen Spell!

350
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:29,650
Well? Let's hear it!

351
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:33,067
Huh? I don't think I
did anything special.

352
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,442
I'm pretty sure you gathered
most of that by yourself.

353
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:36,775
Nope! No way!

354
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:39,108
Kinda hate admitting this,
but when I'm on my own,

355
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:42,067
I can't gather anywhere
near that much Fantasia.

356
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,150
Which means it must've
come from you!

357
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,650
Now tell me how you did it!

358
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,192
Okay, well, maybe it was me,

359
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:49,275
but that doesn't mean
I know how I did it.

360
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:50,483
So you don't know?

361
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:51,608
Right.

362
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,733
In that case, I think you
should be my sparring partner.

363
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:58,400
[SETH] But why? You and Draccoon
were doing fine earlier.

364
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:00,317
[OCOHO]
Draccoon isn't nearly enough.

365
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,275
Lord Brangoire put me
on the defense squad,

366
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:03,692
but that isn't me at all.

367
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:05,817
I'm a fighter. I'm s'posed
to be in the thick of it!

368
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,150
You know what I mean?

369
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:09,233
Anyway, I'm tryin' to beef
up my offensive strength

370
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:11,275
and polish my technique
so I can put on a show

371
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:14,650
and help him to see
my true potential.

372
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,067
I'm sorry, but I can't.

373
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,317
I've got my hands full

374
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,233
trying to deal with
my own problems.

375
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:21,233
[OCOHO]
Aw, man.

376
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:24,567
Wait, what if you
and I make a deal?

377
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,358
Help me train and I'll find
you books from the castle.

378
00:20:27,442 --> 00:20:29,525
Wait a sec? You mean
from the archive?

379
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:31,567
I can only use the
library right now,

380
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,067
but it's worth a shot, right?

381
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,983
Think about all
those history books.

382
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,192
There must be one
that mentions Radiant!

383
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,025
I should say no.

384
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,692
[OCOHO] There isn't much
time before they decide

385
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:42,483
which candidates to ordain!

386
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:43,817
Please help me!

387
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,442
I wanna be a knight-sorcerer
more than anything!

388
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:48,025
It's been my wildest
dream forever!

389
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:50,858
And I can help you, too,
so think of this as fate!

390
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:53,567
Come on! Just please
say you'll do it!

391
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,067
So you think that if you
can't fully control yourself,

392
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,442
then you shouldn't
get close to anyone?

393
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,150
You think that rather
than ask for help,

394
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:02,733
some people should
just be alone?

395
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,650
Listen.

396
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:09,192
I really doubt that I'll be
able to do anything for you.

397
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:10,817
But...

398
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,983
I'm out of leads,
so I need those books.

399
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,192
And if there's a
chance I can help

400
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,442
make that dream
of yours happen--

401
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,067
[OCOHO]
Ah! That sounds like a yes!

402
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,025
Yeah. I think we may as
well give it a shot.

403
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:24,942
[OCOHO]
Woohoo! Thanks a million!

404
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:26,525
Okay, we'll get up
at five every morning

405
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:28,108
and train for two
and a half hours.

406
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,817
Wait. D'you say five?

407
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,400
[OCOHO] I've got drills
during most of the day,

408
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:32,900
but I'm totally free at night!

409
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:34,442
So we'll meet up again
and duke it out

410
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:35,858
until one of us goes down!

411
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:36,942
Say what?

412
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:37,983
You've gotta train
at least that hard

413
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:40,150
if you wanna be a
knight-sorcerer.

414
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,317
[SETH grunts]

415
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,733
Okay.

416
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:44,150
Well, if that's how it is,

417
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:46,733
I'mma get goin' and look
for a place to sleep.

418
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:48,817
Otherwise, I'm not sure
I'll wake up in time.

419
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,858
So do you not have
a place to stay?

420
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,817
Then how 'bout you crash here?

421
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,983
Am I even allowed to?

422
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,317
Of course you're not,

423
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,608
but make sure nobody finds
out and you'll be fine.

424
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:01,983
Draccoon's super fluffy.
I bet he'll make a great bed!

425
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:05,400
Thank you, Ocoho.
This is a huge help!

426
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:08,150
I'm looking forward
to it, Seth.

427
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,775
Know what? Right back at'cha!

428

[gasps]

429
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,442
That dream... I had it again.

430
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,525
[NARRATOR]
Seth sneaks into the castle

431
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:14,025
and is perturbed at
what he sees there.

432
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:16,067
Those halls should
be a mystery to him,

433
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,650
but he finds them familiar
on account of his dreams.

434
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:22,358
When he arrives at the place
where his dreams led him,

435
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:24,483
Seth meets a tortured young man

436
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:27,817
who lives in mortal
fear of Piodon.
