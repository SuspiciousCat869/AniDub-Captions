1
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,733
[NARRATOR] In his search
for clues about Radiant,

2
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:16,192
Seth has set out for the ancient
city of knight-sorcerers,

3
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:17,858
Caislean Merlin.

4
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:21,983
Meanwhile, Dragunov begins his
first mission as a Thaumaturge.

5
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:23,650
He's been ordered to find Seth,

6
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:26,733
as the Inquisition
considers him a threat.

7
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:30,733
Seth's next adventure will
take place here, in Cyfandir,

8
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:34,150
a vast land full of secrets.

9
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:35,733
[ALMA]
Listen up, Seth.

10
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:38,650
This is right about where
we are at the moment.

11
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:41,650
Once you reach land,
look for a road heading west,

12
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,775
it should take you
to Caislean Merlin.

13
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:46,483
You need to walk, though, okay?

14
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:49,108
Why can't I just fly?
Are brooms not allowed there?

15
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:50,733
They are, but flying
makes you stand out,

16
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,608
and you need to keep
a low profile.

17
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:55,275
Remember, the Inquisition
is still after you.

18
00:00:55,358 --> 00:00:56,608
Oh. Yeah.

19
00:00:56,692 --> 00:00:59,025
--[DON BOSSMAN] Seth! My boy!
--Ah! What the--?

20
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:01,108
[DON BOSSMAN]
Here! A coupla parting gifts.

21
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:03,650
A broom to fly on and
some food for the road.

22
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,567
This'll get you to Cyfandir.

23
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,358
Oh, wow, you guys.
Thanks a million.

24
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,692
Wait, what's up with this broom?

25
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:10,817
It looks like someone cut
off the top half of it!

26
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,317
[DON BOSSMAN laughs]

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,983
That's 'cause I got
it for half price!

28
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:15,400
No way!

29
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:18,608
See, boy? It flies fine.
The other half was dead weight!

30
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:20,025
[DON BOSSMAN laughs]

31
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:21,775
[SETH yelps]

32
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:24,108
Technically it flies, but
it's really hard to pilot.

33
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:27,108
I'm sure a smart kid like
you can make it work.

34
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:29,983
Make sure you don't fall off
before you reach the continent.

35
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:31,900
Right. Will do.

36
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:33,983
And I promise I'll stay
in touch this time.

37
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:35,608
I'll talk to ya soon, 'kay?

38
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:37,650
Yeah. Whatever.
Do what you want.

39
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:41,608
We're gonna miss ya, buddy.
Be careful out there!

40
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:43,067
[chuckles]

41
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,233
[DON BOSSMAN]
Seth!

42
00:01:44,317 --> 00:01:49,275
[DON BOSSMAN crying]

43
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,942
Whoa.

44
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:57,650
So that's the continent
of Cyfandir.

45
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,067
[chuckles]

46
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:34,108
[NARRATOR]
"An Encounter in the Rain."

47
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:41,442
[GARVICE]
There you are, sir.

48
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:42,942
I wanted to let you know,

49
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,400
we'll arrive in Bome tomorrow
as planned, Vice-Captain.

50
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:49,067
Sorry, sir. Captain Goudeau
is what I meant to say.

51
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,692
No, that's all right.

52
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:52,733
You don't have to
call me captain.

53
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:55,150
We've yet to receive notice
from headquarters.

54
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:58,650
And I believe Dragunov will
always be our true captain.

55
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:01,775
[chuckles] Yes, sir.

56
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:05,317
On a side note, if you don't
mind me asking about this,

57
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,067
I've been wondering why
so many of our troops

58
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,942
have been recalled to Bome.

59
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:11,733
Are we planning a major
operation, sir?

60
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:15,900
I couldn't say. The politics
of Bome can be quite complex.

61
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:17,692
There's no telling
what sort of schemes

62
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:19,692
are being set in
motion right now.

63
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:21,108
[sighs]

64
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:24,108
I wonder what Captain
Dragunov would say about it.

65
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,192
[LISELOTTE] When the general
said he was sending

66
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:30,358
the two of us on a mission,

67
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:32,442
I thought he meant
along with our soldiers.

68
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:33,358
Yes.

69
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:34,733
But even without our troops,

70
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:37,275
its odd to see two
Thaumaturges sent so far

71
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:38,900
to hunt down a child.

72
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:42,233
Which goes to show you just how
fixated the general has become.

73
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:44,733
This horned sorcerer
must be special.

74
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:48,233
We were able to confirm that the
boy left Artemis some time ago.

75
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:51,192
And given his objectives,
we know where he'll go next.

76
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:53,900
All the way to the
continent of Cyfandir.

77
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:54,942
Right.

78
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:57,025
The homeland of the
knight-sorcerers

79
00:04:57,108 --> 00:05:00,192
who've given us no end
of trouble in the past.

80
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:07,108
Why do you always
drink from straws?

81
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:09,775
It feels right. That's
all the 'cause I need.

82
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:11,400
Oh, I'm well aware.

83
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:13,858
You've always let what
seemed "right" come first.

84
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:15,900
Are you complimenting me?

85
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,317
I only bring this up to
remind you that I understand

86
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,025
the way you think
better than most do.

87
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:25,067
And whenever you get
that look in your eye,

88
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,817
it means you're thinking about
deviating from your orders.

89
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,150
Am I wrong?

90
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:32,692
[DRAGUNOV chuckles]

91
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:34,192
[DRAGUNOV]
Oh, please.

92
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:36,442
Things are different now that
I've become a Thaumaturge.

93
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:37,733
Back when I was a captain,

94
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,775
I could get away with
a little mischief.

95
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:45,442
It's true. Your title's changed,
but you're still Dart Dragunov.

96
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:48,817
Come now, Liselotte.
I think I've grown up a little.

97
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,483
The only dreamer we need right
now is that fool sorcerer

98
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:56,358
who insists he's going to defy
all the odds and find Radiant.

99
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:06,317
[DRAGUNOV] All right, kid.
Where are you now?

100
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,692
And what are you doing?

101
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:10,858
[SETH]
Huh?

00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:20,400
Aw, man.

104
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:21,525
This crappy broom
was slow enough

105
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:23,067
before this storm showed up.

106
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,150
Hey! Get your act together
and move! C'mon, go!

107
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:28,858
Huh?

00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:30,650

[ALL]
Huh?

112
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,608
I say, did you hear
a thunk down there?

113
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:45,442
I would've described
it as more of a thud.

114
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:48,317
[SERVANT B]
Probably just some poor bird.

115
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,942
[CAPTAIN A]
We've reached our destination!

116
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:53,483
Prepare the baron's small
craft for landing at once!

00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:54,858
[SERVANTS]
Yes, sir!

118
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:58,400
My broom's been wrecked
and my food's been shredded.

119
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,775
Crap. I'm slipping off!

120
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:01,900
Huh?

121
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,692
It's another airship. Whelp.

[thud]

123
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:13,108
Did anyone hear a fwoosh
from above just now?

124
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,275
I heard more of a whoosh.

125
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:17,358
[FURGONDE] Between this fog
and the strange noises,

126
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:19,525
I don't feel entirely safe.

127
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:21,650
[BARONESS] You have heard
the rumors, right, darling?

128
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,900
They say that ghosts are known
to roam about in this area.

129
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:26,358
[FURGONDE]
Do they really?

130
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:28,692
Oh, imagine if a spirit comes
and does something to us

131
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:30,192
whilst we're asleep!

132
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:31,192
[BARONESS sighs]

133
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:32,483
Look at the bright
side, my dear,

134
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,608
at least something would
be happening in our bed.

135
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:36,775
Huh? What was that, dear?

136
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:39,608
So there are ghosts about.
Well, isn't that exciting.

137
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,692
If we do find one, I'd love
to add it to my collection.

138
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:45,108
Won't you promise to capture
a nice ghost for me,

139
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:46,442
Baron Cristolom?

140
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,275
[CRISTOLOM] Hmph. There's
no such thing as ghosts.

141
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:50,650
Don't believe every
tall tale you hear.

142
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:53,442
Then the rumors could be
about the knight-sorcerers.

143
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:55,858
What if they catch us out here?
What do you think they'll do?

144
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,025
[DOUSSANT]
Be reasonable, Baron Furgonde.

145
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:02,025
We're just a group of old
friends on vacation.

146
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:03,400
They wouldn't
attack us for having

147
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,192
a quiet picnic in the woods.

148
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:08,233
At worst, we'll be told to
finish our meal on the ship.

149
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:09,817
Hold on.

150
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,817
You aren't saying you dragged us
along on this arduous journey

151
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,233
just to have a woodland
picnic, are you?

152
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:16,150
Of course that isn't why.

153
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,733
I have a business proposal,

154
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:20,608
and I want each of you to see
this rich land for yourselves.

155
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:21,858
As with all other things,

156
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:24,817
my goal is to turn the
largest profit I can.

157
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,442
[NARRATOR]
The merchant barons.

00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:29,025
In their eyes, things like
the Nemesis calamity

159
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,358
and the plight of the infected

160
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:33,400
are simply opportunities
to line their pockets.

161
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:35,733
Behind the scenes
of every conflict,

162
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:40,483
one is guaranteed to find these
greedy merchants of death.

163
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,608
It's friggin' cold out here.

164
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:53,650
Ahh, these woods are as lovely
as they are bountiful.

165
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,108
What a feeling it is to be
the very first explorers

166
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:57,650
of a virgin land.

167
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:59,108
[BARONESS sighs]

168
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:00,983
It seems even the land is
getting more action than me.

169
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,358
[FURGONDE]
Huh? What was that?

170
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,317
[DOUSSANT] Let us take this
land. Drill it. Plough it.

171
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,442
Make use of all this hardwood.

172
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:09,733
And profit.

173
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,733
[FURGONDE] This isn't some
undiscovered island,

174
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,108
it belongs to Caislean Merlin.

175
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:17,608
That is true for now,
but they aren't using it.

176
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:20,442
Also, this continent is
home to many resources,

177
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:22,692
which are worth far
more than the land.

178
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:25,733
Speak plainly, Baron
Doussant, do you mean--?

179
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,983
[CRISTOLOM]
Say!

180
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,942
Has anyone discovered
this intriguing stone?

181
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:32,317
[DOUSSANT]
Um. No.

182
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,442
It seems quite likely
that you are the first.

183
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:37,983
[CRISTOLOM] I shall name
this rock "The Rock."

184
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,608
[SETH]
That branch isn't too far.

185
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:44,358
I can jump it. Just need to--

186
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:46,358
[screaming]

187
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,150
[SERVANTS gasp]

188
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,400
[ALL]
Hm?

189
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:51,108
Oh, my.

190
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:52,858
Uh, hey.

191
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:55,650
I can't just replace old slaves
like my ancestors did,

192
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,692
so someone needs to lift
me off these broken ones

193
00:09:57,775 --> 00:09:59,692
and patch them up for
later use, understood?

194
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:00,692
[ALKON]
Pazz! Your belly!

195
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:01,942
My what? Oh.

196
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:03,275
Well, there's always
a bit of bloating

197
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:05,192
after I have an especially
ambitious meal,

198
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:07,358
and I wasn't sure about
that sixth chicken at first,

199
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:08,025
but the taste was--

200
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,358
Look at yourself!

201
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,900
There's something sticking
out of your gut, man!

202
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,317
[SETH gasps]

203
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:18,567
Oh! It's a weird
little goat boy!

204
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,733
I must obtain him
for my collection.

205
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:23,483
If those horns are real,
he must be infected.

206
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:26,817
Ahh. So he's a
knight-sorcerer, eh?

207
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,317
Show him your steel.

208
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,567
Whoa! Hold on a second, please!

209
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,608
I'm not a knight-sorcerer,
I promise ya!

210
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:35,192
No? Then why did you
come to spy on us?

211
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:36,733
I'm not spying.

212
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:38,775
I was just flying along when
your airship crashed into me.

213
00:10:38,858 --> 00:10:41,608
My broom got shredded, so I
had to hang on for dear life.

214
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:44,817
I don't believe a word he says!
The boy's definitely a spy!

215
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,150
Tell us who it is
you're spying for

216
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:47,817
and perhaps I'll show you mercy.

217
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,817
I'm seriously not a spy
though, I mean it!

218
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,108
Well, obviously he will not talk

219
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,900
until we rough him
up a bit first.

220
00:10:52,983 --> 00:10:54,317
You guys aren't
gonna listen to me

221
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,567
no matter what I say, are you?

222
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,900
[SERVANT D]
He's fleeing!

223
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,400
Sorry to run away
mid-conversation,

224
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:07,358
but I don't have time
for your crap, okay?

225
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:08,900
His allies could be nearby!

226
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:11,900
We need to protect the
merchant barons at all costs!

227
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:14,317
Lead the way, Vigilant!
We're hunting an infected!

228
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,317
[VIGILANT caws]

229
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,025
No, this isn't fair at all!

230
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:19,733
I found the goat boy and that
means he belongs to me!

231
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:22,900
Catch the boy and bring him back
alive, won't you, Cristolom?

232
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,275
That sounds like a pain.

233
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:25,275
I shall pass.

234
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:26,983
Come now, you know
I'm good for it.

235
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:28,983
How about I give you the
vineyard in Malsudant

236
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,983
and the empty land in Mauve?

237
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:31,983
No thanks.

238
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,525
Fine, I'll add the
Two-Hills domain

239
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:35,192
and the Blades-Run Castle.

240
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:36,275
Will you?

241
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:38,150
Well, in that case, I'll do it.

242
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:41,400
Yay! And for such
a cheap price, too.

243
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:49,442
[CRISTOLOM laughs]

244
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:52,608
[CRISTOLOM] Been a while since
I've stretched these legs out.

245
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:56,233
[SERVANT D]
Keep up your pace!

246
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,067
Don't let him escape!

247
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,192
I don't have a broom and
I don't know the terrain.

248
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:01,942
I need to shake
them off quickly.

249
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:05,775
[SERVANT D]
Tarry not, gentlemen!

250
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,817
We'll catch the rascal yet!

251
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,858
That was cool.
It actually worked!

252
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:12,942
[VIGILANT caws]

253
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:13,483
[SETH]
Huh?

254
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,733
[VIGILANT caws]

255
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:19,650
Whoa! Did I really
just get shot?

256
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,275
[VIGILANT caws]

257
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:29,150
[SETH]
Oh, I get it.

258
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:31,192
The bird's telling
them where I am.

259
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:33,358
In that case...

260
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:36,775
Titan Punch!

261
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:40,775
There you are.

262
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:42,317
Ha-ha!

263
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:47,942
There aren't too many warriors
who can endure a kick

264
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,483
from my legs at full power.

265
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,358
Soon I'll stuff you and
mount you on the wall

266

for my dear old friend, Pazz.

267
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,275
I'm not a knight-sorcerer,
so just leave me alone!

00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,858
Skull attack!

Hm?

00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,942
[chuckles]

271
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,900
What the heck?

272
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:06,400
A fine attempt!

273
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:10,025
But you'll need stronger spells
than that to hurt me, boy!

274
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:11,150
You're scary!

275
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,025
[yells]

276
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:16,108
Ah! Legs like those shouldn't
even be possible!

277
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:20,608
I'll hear no complaints!
Needle Rain!

[CRISTOLOM] Take this,
you little rapscallion...

It's made of white silver.

[CRISTOLOM]
...you stubborn goat boy!

283
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,567
[CRISTOLOM]
Ha-ha!

284
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,192
Hm? I'm sure I saw him
fall somewhere nearby.

285
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,608
You can't hide from a true
explorer like me, boy!

286
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:45,275
I thrive when poking
about in the unknown.

287
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,858
There you are.

[CRISTOLOM]
Oh, no.

[SERVANT G]
We're with you, sir!

[ALL gasp]

291
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:58,358
[SERVANT E]
No. It's a ghost!

292
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:00,150
I think we should
retreat for now.

293
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:04,150
[CRISTOLOM, SERVANTS screaming]

294
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:26,858
[SETH]
What's going on?

295
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:28,358
Where am I?

296
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:43,900
[SETH]
It's you.

297
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:59,900
[GRIMM] Welcome back to the
land of the living, Seth.

298
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:03,900
[SETH]
Grimm? What're you doing here?

299
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:07,442
Did you save me from
those baron guys? How?

300
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:09,275
[GRIMM] There are many
ways to deal with threats

301
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:11,150
without resorting to bloodshed.

302
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,942
One is through fear.

303
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:14,817
[SETH]
Heh. Way to go.

304
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,067
Guess I should learn
to do that myself.

305
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,650
[GRIMM]
A wise choice.

306
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:21,358
That was a fight you could've
won for yourself though.

307
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,900
There's no doubt.

308
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:24,108
[SETH]
Huh?

309
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:26,233
[GRIMM] You hesitated to
wield your Fantasia,

310
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:28,692
and that could've
cost you dearly.

311
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:30,692
Yeah, I realize that.

312
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:39,483
Still, I want to avoid
it when I can.

313
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,108
In that final fight
at Rumble Town,

314
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:47,358
my power almost got
hundreds of people killed.

315
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:49,608
[GRIMM] Well, Grimm
would call you lucky.

316
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:52,567
What the heck is
lucky about that?

317
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,108
[GRIMM] You're fortunate
that you were stopped

318
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:55,942
from taking those lives.

319
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:58,608
You don't have to
carry that guilt.

320
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,150
So are you saying that you do?

321
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,067
You don't have to say.

322
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,358
[GRIMM]
It's getting late.

323
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:14,692
You should wait until
morning to leave.

324
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,942
Grimm cast a spell
to close your wounds,

325
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:20,067
but you'll still need to
rest to recover fully.

326
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,692
[SETH]
Okay, thanks.

327
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:24,942
Gotta say though,
you're pretty sneaky.

328
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,233
[GRIMM]
Hm?

329
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:27,817
You followed me.

330
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,775
You've been watching over
me from afar, haven't you?

331
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:33,983
I mean, why not just walk up
and say you were coming?

332
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,483
[GRIMM] Why didn't you tell
your friends you were leaving?

333
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:39,108
Why not invite them
to accompany you?

334
00:16:39,192 --> 00:16:40,900
It was for their own benefit.

335
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:42,192
I keep causing trouble,

336
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:45,233
so I decided to keep
them out of my mess.

337
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,067
[GRIMM] Grimm's reasons
aren't so different.

338
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
[PAZZ]
What happened, Cristolom?!

339
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,025
You promised me a goat boy,
and when you failed at that,

340
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:02,067
you didn't even get something
else to make it up to me!

341
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,233
[CRISTOLOM]
Don't throw a tantrum, Pazz!

342
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:07,483
We were beset by foes
like we'd never seen.

343
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:10,108
One could almost describe
them as... ghostly beings.

344
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:11,317
Well, if that's true,

345
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,650
let's leave before something
scarier happens.

346
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,817
I'm all damp and sweaty.

347
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,192
That makes one of us.

348
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:18,317
Say what?

349
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,025
If I can't add to
my collection here,

350
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:22,775
then I want to go home to
the Western States, too!

351
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:24,067
[DOUSSANT sighs]

352
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,067
It would appear that
you've already forgotten.

353
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,942
Due to damage incurred during
the Rumble Town riots,

354
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:32,567
most of our factories
were shut down.

355
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,608
And with the rising cost
of raw materials,

356
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:36,400
our margins grow slim.

357
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:37,942
[CRISTOLOM]
You aren't wrong, but--

358
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:39,442
Oh, stop it, would you?

359
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,692
Just hearing about this mess
is upsetting my tummy.

360
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:43,900
We have other factories

361
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:45,858
and Rumble Town will
recover in time.

362
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:47,192
Not to mention,

363
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,858
the Inquisition is still
purchasing weapons from us

364
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,817
at whatever outrageous
price we set for them.

365
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,067
[DOUSSANT]
Yes, yes.

366
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,067
The Inquisition is a
valuable trade partner,

367
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,025
but they're losing
ground quickly.

368
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:00,775
We must adapt to
this shifting landscape.

369
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:01,900
[ALKON]
I see your point,

370
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:04,108
but did you have to
make it from here?

371
00:18:04,192 --> 00:18:06,733
Surely we could've discussed
this matter back home.

372
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:08,025
Baroness Alkon,

373
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:10,442
we spent countless hours
discussing Rumble Town

374
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:12,483
without ever setting foot
anywhere near it,

375
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,358
and look how that went.

376
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:17,067
Those events weren't
just caused by sorcerers.

377
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,358
They were the result
of heightening tensions,

378
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:21,233
policies, and propaganda.

379
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:24,650
We failed to predict them,
and we paid dearly.

380
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:27,942
We must anticipate the
next crisis before it hits,

381
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,483
so we can navigate
the obstacles that arise

382
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,358
and exploit what
opportunities are presented.

383
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:36,025
Why do you think the next
crisis will happen here?

384
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:37,692
[DOUSSANT chuckles]

385
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:39,733
[DOUSSANT]
You'll find out in time.

386
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:41,400
[ALKON] Well, at least
tell us this much.

387
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:43,817
Do these matters have any
connection to the resource

388
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,817
more valuable than land that
you told us of earlier?

389
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,150
Indeed they do.

390
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:50,192
If we can establish
control of it,

391
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:53,567
our interests will
be well-secured.

392
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:05,775
[GRIMM]
Just follow this road

393
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:09,275
and you'll be sure to reach
Caislean Merlin in due time.

394
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,108
[SETH]
All right, cool.

395
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,192
Well, thanks for the save.
I really owe you one, Grimm.

396
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:16,400
Deep down, you're a
compassionate guy, huh?

397
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:19,442
[GRIMM] Hm? No one's ever
said that to Grimm before.

398
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,358
[SETH chuckles]

399
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:23,108
[GRIMM]
I'll warn you now, Seth.

400
00:19:23,192 --> 00:19:26,775
Take care not to stray
far from the road.

401
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:28,942
The forest around the
castle is enchanted

402
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:32,233
with a powerful
disorientation spell,

403
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:33,983
so it's not the place
to go wandering

404
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,608
unless you wish to get lost.

405
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,400
[SETH]
Ya don't say.

406
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:40,650
You certainly know your
way around Cyfandir.

407
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:42,317
Uh.

408
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,650
Hey, Grimm, where'd you go?

409
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,483
Did he really just
take off like that?

410
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:48,233
I know he isn't much
for hanging out,

411
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:51,275
but that's still pretty cold.

412
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,900
Whelp. On I go!

413
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,942
I'll see him again eventually.

414
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,733
Whoa.

415
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:29,150
It's enormous.

416
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:33,275
The city of the
knight-sorcerers. Wow.

417
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,983
[VILLAGER C]
Hey! Get back here!

418
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:40,025
[VILLAGER B] We'll strike you
down another day, Nemesis!

419
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:43,900
Hey, I'm tired of playing
the Nemesis all the time,

420
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:46,608
so why don't you guys let me
be a knight-sorcerer now?

421
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,150
Because you make
the best Nemesis.

422
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,650
That curse of yours has
the right look, ya know?

423
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,608
Why's that matter?
It's just a game.

424
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:54,108
Fine, then if you
catch one of us,

425
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:55,858
we'll have to be Nemesis next.

426
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:57,150
Okay!

427
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:58,567
[VILLAGER A] It sure isn't
gonna be me though!

428
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,483
[VILLAGER B]
It's a Nemesis! Run away!

429
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:03,025
[VILLAGER C]
Rawr! Rawr!

430
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:04,525
Huh?

431
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:26,567
[SETH] Regular people
are living side by side

432
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,650
with the infected here,
and they're getting along.

433
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:32,150
[VILLAGER D]
Ah! Look! There they are!

434
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,275
[SETH]
Huh?

435
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,692
[VILLAGER E]
It's the knight-sorcerers!

436
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:41,400
[VILLAGER F]
Oh! Oh! I'm your biggest fan!

437
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:43,858
[VILLAGER G]
Look over here! Please!

438
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:45,192
[chuckling]

439
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,525
[VILLAGER F] Sir Mordred
has such a perfect smile!

440
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:49,733
Are these guys really
the knight-sorcerers?

441
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:50,900
If you don't even know that,

442
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:52,817
you must be living under
a rock somewhere.

443
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,317
Mordred and Sagramore are
gallant knights in training.

444
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,692
Huh?

445
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,567
[NARRATOR]
Mordred and Sagramore.

446
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,192
While they've yet to complete
their induction ceremonies,

447
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:03,233
they're widely considered
the strongest

448
00:22:03,317 --> 00:22:05,025
of the knight-sorcerer
candidates.

449
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:08,942
As a pair, they're known as
the Nemeses' worst nightmare.

450
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:10,525
Oh.

451
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:13,025
So knight-sorcerers aren't that
different from Nemesis Hunters,

452
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:15,067
and these guys are
like apprentices.

453
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,150
Thanks so much for your service!

454
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:18,942
Good luck vanquishing
those Nemeses!

455
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:21,275
I know you'll both do great!

456
00:22:21,358 --> 00:22:23,233
[VILLAGER E]
Sagramore's such a beefcake!

457
00:22:23,317 --> 00:22:25,775
I wanna tug him off that horse!

458
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:28,317
Sorcerers are actually
popular here.

459
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,442
Uh.

460
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:30,608
Huh?

461
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,358
Doc? Melie?

462
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:36,150
What the--? Why are they here?

463
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,483
[NARRATOR] Seth has
finally reached the city

464
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:14,233
of the knight-sorcerers,
Caislean Merlin.

465
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:17,650
However, he's denied access
to the castle archives.

466
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:19,400
As he ponders his next move,

467
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:22,858
Seth runs into a strange
old man named Myr.

468
00:24:22,942 --> 00:24:26,358
Through Myr's orchestration,
Seth encounters Ocoho,

469
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:29,108
a bold young
knight-sorcerer candidate.

470
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:30,775
