1
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:13,442
Did we get shot at?

2
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:15,775
[SANTORI]
Well, this is peculiar.

3
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,108
Hey, Seth!

4
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:30,650
Get me outta this crazy thing!
I'm dyin' in here!

5
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:32,900
Wait, Doc?

6
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:08,358
[NARRATOR] "The Will of
the People Shines Bright."

7
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,275
[ARTO]
A fine landing.

8
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:15,483
[LANDLAKE]
Verily, my friends.

9
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:18,650
Twas an entrance worthy
of a true knight.

10
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:20,150
[GUEN]
Now then, where's the foe?

11
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:21,525
[ANCESTOR A]
Take me to the rogues at once!

12
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,817
[ANCESTOR B]
Take me as well!

13
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,942
[ANCESTOR C]
And me!

14
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:25,733
So, who all's in there?

15
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:27,858
It sounds like there's
a whole bunch of you.

16
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:29,900
[ARTO]
Hm? Who's asking?

17
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:30,817
[LANDLAKE]
Be this the foe?

18
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,108
[GUEN]
Draw your weapon, boy.

19
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:33,317
[SETH] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on a second.

20
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,525
[DOC]
Leave him be!

21
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:36,733
Seth's a friend!
Not an enemy, got it?

22
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:39,317
[ARTO] So he's a
subject of the kingdom?

23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,442
No, not exactly.

24
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:41,983
[ARTO]
Then he must be an enemy.

25
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:46,108
I just said he's not, okay?!
Life isn't that black and white!

26
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:48,400
Hey, Doc. Is that you?

27
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,233
Where'd you get
that awesome armor?

28
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,483
[LANDLAKE] The boy recognizes
greatness when he sees it.

29
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:53,775
He is a friend!

30
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:55,858
[GUEN] Tell us more about
how awestruck you are.

31
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,192
Seriously, how'd ya
end up in there?

32
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:00,817
Basically, I found a whole
bunch of memory stones,

33
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,233
but was about to get caught,

34
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:04,067
so I climbed in
this armor to hide,

35
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,650
but then it lit up
all of a sudden,

36
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,983
and the stones started talkin'!

37
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:09,817
Stop! Shut up already!

38
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,442
They keep fightin' for
control of this thing!

39
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,150
It's drivin' me nuts!

40
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,775
[GUEN]
You should learn some restraint.

41
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:16,233
[LANDLAKE]
What do you make of this pose?

42
00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:17,942
[ARTO]
Nay! Like this!

43
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:19,483
I like 'em both?

44
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:22,400
[SANTORI] I hope you'll
forgive me for interrupting,

45
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:24,817
but I came here looking
for a slugfest!

46
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,692
[DOC screams]

47
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:31,775
[ARTO] At last. The enemy
has made himself known.

48
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:33,192
[SANTORI]
Impressive!

49
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:36,817
You managed to stop my projected
fist with a single hand.

50
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:39,900
I've heard that Cyfandir's
greatest heroes

51
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:41,733
are kept in memory stones.

52
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:44,108
It would appear that the
knights of Caislean Merlin

53
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:46,358
had one last trick to pull out.

54
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:49,900
[ARTO] My lords, to win this
battle, we must fight as one.

55
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:52,817
Wait a sec. You've got
a kid in here, you can't!

56
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,650
[LANDLAKE] Aye, we'll dispatch
the wretch together.

57
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,192
Are you even listening?

58
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:57,858
[GUEN]
In Merlin's name,

59
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:00,025
we shall fight till
our lives are spent!

60
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:01,108
You're dead already.

61
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:02,025
[ARTO]
Let's go!

62
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,275
[ANCESTORS]
Right!

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,650
Oh, yeah! You're makin'
this old man feel alive!

64
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,692
[SETH]
He's actually taking damage.

65
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:16,858
I'll hit him before
he projects again.

66
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:17,817
Skull Burst!

67
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,733
[yells]

68
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:22,233
[ARTO]
The boy has spirit.

69
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:24,608
[DOC] This is our
chance to run! Let's go!

70
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:26,233
[LANDLAKE]
Shut your craven mouth.

71
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:27,692
[GUEN]
Death or glory?

72
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,775
[ANCESTORS]
Both!

73
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:31,317
[DOC]
What is wrong with you maniacs?!

74
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,942
[GUEN]
Huh?

75
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:40,692
Don't let up on him! Pulsar!

76
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,650
[ARTO]
Well struck.

77
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:45,983
[LANDLAKE]
The blackguard has fallen.

78
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:48,317
[DOC] Great! Let's run then!
Come on! Chop-chop!

79
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,275
[GUEN] That seemed rather easy.
How disappointing.

80
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,733
[ARTO]
I'm sure he fought as hard

81
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:54,150
as his old bones would allow.

82
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:56,275
[LANDLAKE] Are all our
adversaries so ancient,

83
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:58,858
or might there be some
healthy ones elsewhere?

84
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:00,608
[SETH]
No way.

85
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:03,692
That bastard fell asleep
on us! Hey, Gramps!

86
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,817
Sorry, I was just
resting my eyes is all.

87
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,900
[SETH] You'd better take
this seriously, creep!

88
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:10,483
By the way, weren't you supposed
to pull your troops back

89
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,233
once Eyepatch found me?

90
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:13,442
[chuckles] It's funny.

91
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:15,650
I fought against the
Brotherhood of the Ashes

92
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,483
for seven days and seven nights.

93
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,900
Faced the great Albur Fendragon
in an honorable duel.

94
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:22,733
Pursued the formidable Saroumor
to the ice fields...

95
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:24,942
What's he going on about?

96
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,775
[SANTORI] But of all the mighty
opponents I've tussled with,

97
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,942
none could hold a candle to you.

98
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:35,483
You never fail to surprise me,
though we've fought many times.

99
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:36,733
[SOLDIER A]
Colonel Santori!

100
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:38,192
We were trying to
restrain the queen,

101
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,108
but a giant knight-sorcerer
showed up.

102
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:41,608
We can't get past him!

103
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,567
[SANTORI] Why are you
bothering me about it?

104
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,900
[SOLDIER A]
Sir?

105
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:47,025
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm busy right now!

106
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:50,067
You'll just have to find a way
to capture the queen yourselves.

107
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,692
[SOLDIER A]
Sir!

108
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:53,483
[ARTO]
The queen of Cyfandir?

109
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,858
[LANDLAKE] By Merlin,
we must rescue her at once!

110
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:57,442
[GUEN]
Away!

111
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:01,317
[DOC] Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-no! Wait!
Hold on! Don't do this! Please!

112
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,650
[SETH]
Doc!

113
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,692
[SANTORI laughs]

114
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:07,358
[SANTORI]
Alone at last.

115
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:09,692
We can finally pick up
where we left off,

116
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:11,525
without anyone else meddling.

117
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:14,150
Come at me!

118
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,692
Hmm.

119
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:19,317
You seemed a little more savage
in our previous encounters.

120
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
What do you mean
"previous encounters"?

121
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:24,525
I've seen you once, above
Rumble Town's clock tower.

122
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:26,650
[SANTORI]
Oh, we met long before that.

123
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:30,983
The first time I saw those
horns was back in Vivacyne.

124
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:33,692
Oh, no. Don't you remember me?

125
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:36,025
And I thought what
we had was special.

126
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:37,775
Sure you were only a child,

127
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:40,442
and we did little more than
cross paths, but even so...

128
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,567
A horned child back in Vivacyne?

129
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:46,775
[DIABAL] I thought I'd lost
his trail in Vivacyne,

130
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:50,150
but then I saw someone else.

131
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:53,983
A brother who looked even
more like me than Piodon.

132
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,900
You're talking about Triton.

133
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,317
It wasn't me you saw there,
it was one of my brothers!

134
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,358
There's not a doubt
in my mind that it was you.

135
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:04,192
You had the same face
and the same tiny horns.

136
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:06,817
Well, we're brothers, of course
we would look the same!

137
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,817
Huh?

138
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,692
It's strange to
think of, but yes,

139
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:11,983
I suppose it could've
been a brother of yours.

140
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:14,358
Actually, it could
explain a few things.

141
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:15,942
What things would it explain?!

142
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,692
How ya get around so quick.

143
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:20,275
Why you're such a natural
with Fantasia.

144
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:24,525
And why my superiors are so
keen on catching the lot of you.

145
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:27,442
You and your infected
brothers are plague rats.

146
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:28,942
What's your problem?!

147
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:30,817
I'm the one you want, but you
still attacked the castle

148
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,567
after Eyepatch gave his signal.

149
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,983
He promised me you would stop!

150
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,567
This is just wonderful!
Keep it up, kid!

151
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,067
I want you fired up for this!

152
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,858
[SETH] If I'm your target,
then come at me.

153
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:42,317
Leave this country out of it!

154
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,567
There's a lot more than
you could know going on

155
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,942
behind the scenes here.

156
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:48,817
The main goal is to make
sorcerers look evil.

157
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,317
[SETH]
Huh?

158
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,275
[SANTORI] That'll ease the
people's collective conscience.

159
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:54,233
When they learn that
we've released your kind

160
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:55,858
from the shackles of freedom.

161
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,192
[SETH]
"Released from freedom"?

162
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:58,525
[SANTORI chuckles]

163
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:00,442
[SANTORI] You might not be
the reason we invaded,

164
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,692
but you are the reason
General Torque sent me

165
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:03,942
to lead our forces.

166
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,775
My orders are to beat
the fight out of you

167
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:07,150
and bring you back to the boss,

168
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,608
and I'm so glad to see

169
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:11,400
that you've still got the
strength for a brawl.

170
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:12,733
You're burning, old man.

171
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:14,358
[SANTORI]
You bet your horns I am!

172
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,483
I'm burning with the
desire to go all out

173
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:18,942
and kick your butt
in a one-on-one duel!

174
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,150
[SETH]
I meant that literally.

175
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,400
Look down, you're on fire.

176
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:23,608
Huh?

177
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:26,817
Ah!

178
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,650
Oh, no. What a blunder!

179
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,483
Think I left my
medicine in there.

180
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:33,483
Uh! Thank goodness. It's safe.

181
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:36,692
That a combat drug?

182
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:40,150
You Inquisitors seem
to like those.

183
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,233
Well, those merchant
baron techno-chemists

184
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:43,483
know what they're doing.

185
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,358
Now, as a matter of principle,

186
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,817
I only take their
anti-fantasia brew, myself.

187
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,400
I'm none too fond of
their strength enhancer.

188
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:54,108
Too many side-effects,
and too easy to get hooked.

189
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:56,692
Just look at what
it did to Konrad.

190
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,192
You look the same to me.

191
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:04,358
Trying to hide your weakness
with a blend of drugs and lies.

192
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:05,567
[SANTORI]
Hm?

193
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,067
[laughs]

194
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,108
I swear by my toasted beard!

195
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:12,150
I've met a whole heap of
obvious crazies in my life,

196
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:15,150
but none who sounded as ridicu--

197
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:20,942
Well done! You went and forced
me to use my left arm!

198
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:23,358
It's been ages since anyone's
been strong enough

199
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:25,733
to make me do that in a fight!

200
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:29,400
O Patrem Inquisitor,
bringer of miracles.

201
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:32,108
May your grandeur
be made manifest!

202
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:36,067
So this heathen can
be brought to heel.

203
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,983
Know what this calls for?

204
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:41,192
An old-fashioned
roundhouse kick!

205
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:43,192
[SANTORI laughs]

206
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:47,108
[SETH yells]

207
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,900
[SOLDIER B]
Careful, he's strong.

208
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:03,858
[SOLDIER C]
He can't take all of us at once.

209
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:07,150
I won't fall, not without
taking you lot with me.

210
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,150
[humming]

211
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,233
[SOLDIERS gasp]

212
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:12,692
[SOLDIERS scream]

213
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,025
Wait, I know that suit well.

214
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:18,192
The armor of Pen
Draig, I'm certain!

215
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:20,483
[GUEN]
So this is the current queen?

216
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,650
[ARTO] It's heartbreaking
to see her brought so low.

217
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:25,317
[LANDLAKE] Tis unforgivable.
Let us take our vengeance!

218
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,525
[ANCESTOR B]
No objections!

219
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:27,692
[ANCESTOR C]
Nor from me!

220
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:29,358
[ARTO]
Good. Let's begin!

221
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:33,233
[SOLDIERS yelling]

222
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:35,233
[ARTO]
Like wheat before the scythe.

223
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:38,067
[LANDLAKE] Twas quite knightly,
if I may say so myself.

224
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,650
[GUEN]
A stroke well-cut!

225
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:42,817
I-I feared the great
Merlin had forsaken us,

226
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,358
but if you're here,
he mustn't have!

227
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:48,608
[ARTO] You fought like
a true hero, my lord.

228
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:50,108
Wounded though you were.

229
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,692
[LANDLAKE] Fear not, we shall
carry the queen to safety.

230
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:55,525
[BRANGOIRE] Yes.
Your presence is proof enough!

231
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:57,025
I was wrong to doubt him.

232
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:59,317
Merlin was watching
over us all this time!

233
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,733
[ANCESTOR B]
Of course he was!

234
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:01,858
[ANCESTOR C]
Without fail!

235
00:11:01,942 --> 00:11:03,733
[GUEN]
Do not doubt it for a moment!

236
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:05,442
[BRANGOIRE]
I won't. Never again!

237
00:11:05,525 --> 00:11:06,733
[DOC]
Have we done enough yet?

238
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:08,233
Let's go somewhere safe!

239
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:11,233
[BRANGOIRE] Hm? I believe
I've heard that voice before.

240
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,733
Uh-huh! I know you.

241
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:14,775
We met when you tried
to bash Ocoho's head in

242
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:16,317
with that hammer!

243
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:21,067
So, the little boy I met
out in the field?

244
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,775
You're the one inside
of that armor?

245
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:23,775
[ANCESTOR A]
Along with me.

246
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:25,025
[ANCESTOR B]
And me!

247
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,275
[ANCESTOR C]
And me!

248
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:28,275
[DOC] As you can tell,
I've made a few friends.

249
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:31,067
Countless knights have tried
to harness that armor.

250
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,108
Some have even tried to do it
with the aid of memory stones.

251
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:36,275
How'd you succeed
where they failed?

252
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:39,025
I was just lookin' for a place
to hide down in the archi--

253
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:43,108
Actually, it's not important.
Let's get the queen outta here.

254
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:44,692
Hm? What was that?

255
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:46,025
I broke somethin'.

256
00:11:46,108 --> 00:11:49,233
Uh! Ah! What's goin' on here?

257
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,400
[LANDLAKE] It seems these
soldiers were petrified.

258
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:53,567
[ARTO]
Tis an unnatural demise.

259
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,400
[GUEN] What black art
could've done this to them?

260
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:02,942
Somebody help me. I'm lost.

261
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:07,442
[ARTO] How strange. What's a
child doing on the battlefield?

262
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:08,567
[GUEN]
That poor thing.

263
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,025
[LANDLAKE]
Come here. We'll help you.

264
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:12,150
Hang on! I don't trust this kid!

265
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:15,317
[ARTO] You'd have us leave the
poor boy to fend for himself?

266
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,233
Is that the same
kid from before?

267
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:19,442
Hey! Don't let him get
anywhere near you!

268
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:21,358
That boy's a Thaumaturge!

269
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,692
I call on you,
Patrem Inquisitor,

270
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:25,858
noble bringer of miracles.

271
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:27,858
May the sound of
your truth ring out

272
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:29,317
and silence these sinners
till the end of time.

273
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,108
[ARTO]
Fall back!

274
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:32,150
[DOC screams]

275
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:37,192
[LANDLAKE]
Twas too close for comfort.

276
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:38,900
He's extremely powerful!

277
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:40,483
Anything that enters
that circle of his

278
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:41,983
will be turned into stone!

279
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:44,150
That's how I lost my leg!

280
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:47,233
Don't let his looks fool you,
he's a Thaumaturge, I tell you!

281
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:49,733
[ARTO] Hmm... How best
to deal with this?

282
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:52,067
I've got a great idea!
Let's run away!

283
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,317
If we run as fast as we can,

284
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,942
he'll wear himself
out by chasin' us,

285
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,858
and then we can run
even farther away!

286
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,025
[ARTO]
Out of the question!

287
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:00,150
[LANDLAKE]
A true knight flees from no foe!

288
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,608
[DOC]
Oh, come on!

289
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:03,858
[ANCESTOR B] Leave this
cheeky rascal to me.

290
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:04,692
[ANCESTOR C]
And me!

291
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:06,692
[DOC]
No, don't do this!

292
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:08,900
[LANDLAKE]
For the queen!

293
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:15,858
[ARTO] Forsooth, the boy
hath a fearsome power.

294
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:18,317
[BRANGOIRE]
He can even petrify Fantasia.

295
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,275
[DOC] That's that! We tried
our best and failed.

296
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:21,400
Let's go!

297
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:22,150
[ARTO]
Nay!

298
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:23,358
[LANDLAKE]
By Merlin.

299
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:25,358
[GUEN]
We have found a worthy opponent!

300
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:27,108
That's easy for you to say!

301
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:28,942
You're already rocks,
ya got nothin' to lose!

302
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,650
[ANCESTOR C]
Aye! Let's attack!

303
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:32,233
[DOC]
Would a true knight hit a kid?

304
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:34,483
[ARTO]
Hm? Surely not.

305
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:35,858
[GUEN]
Twould demean our honor.

306
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:37,858
[LANDLAKE] But our brothers
lay slain before him!

307
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,942
[ARTO]
Well said!

308
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:41,317
We've no choice
but to strike him down!

309
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,150
Now! To battle!

310
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,233
[DOC]
No, no, no, no!

311
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:47,900
Stop charging in,
you crazy nitwits!

312
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:50,317
[ARTO] His defenses look
to be impregnable.

313
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,233
I'm glad you're finally
accepting that.

314
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:53,858
Now swallow your pride
and give up!

315
00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:55,317
[LANDLAKE]
By Merlin, no!

316
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,483
[GUEN]
We shall not retreat!

317
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:00,650
Why? This isn't fair!

318
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:01,775
[GUEN yells]

319
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,692
[DOC]
I'm trapped in a kid's body

320
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,108
in the middle of a battlefield
fightin' a friggin' Thaumaturge!

321
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:09,275
If he doesn't kill me,
I'll die of stress.

322
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:11,608
All of these problems'll
bury me alive!

323
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:12,817
[DOC]
Hm?

324
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,692
Stop! I've got an idea.
For real this time!

325
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:17,692
[ARTO]
Nay, we must press on!

326
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:18,900
[LANDLAKE]
We refuse!

327
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,400
[DOC] Okay, fine!
Ya leave me no choice!

328
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:23,317
[ARTO] Have you put us
in your mouth, boy?

329
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,108
That's right, and if you
don't do what I say,

330
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:26,192
I'll start chewin'!

331
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:27,108
[ANCESTOR C]
How vile!

332
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:28,442
[LANDLAKE]
Desist, I beg you!

333
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:29,775
[DOC grunts]

334
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:31,983
[ANCESTOR C] Uh! He
swallowed Lord Arto whole!

335
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,567
[DOC]
It's your fault for jostlin' me.

336
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,233
[GUEN] I can scarce believe it.
Thou art a villain!

337
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:38,483
[LANDLAKE]
What a repugnant sanction.

338
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,775
[ARTO]
Ugh! It reeks of coffee in here!

339
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:42,317
[LANDLAKE]
By Merlin.

340
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,483
[GUEN]
My deepest condolences.

341
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:46,942
All right, now listen to me!

342
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:49,400
Stop takin' turns attackin'
him with different spells!

343
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:50,983
That's nothin' but
a waste of time!

344
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:54,483
[GUEN] If we can't get close
or use magic, what can we do?

345
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,275
[DOC] I want ya to use magic,
but together this time.

346
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:59,983
You're gonna make the biggest
wave of Fantasia you can--

347
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,567
all at the same time!

348
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,233
[LANDLAKE]
Then form it into a spell?

349
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:05,775
[DOC]
Just release some Fantasia!

350
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:06,983
[GUEN]
That would be futile.

351
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:08,025
[ANCESTOR B]
I oppose it!

352
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,233
[ANCESTOR C]
I'm opposed as well!

353
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:11,775
[LANDLAKE] It's time
we staged a mutiny! Hm?

354
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:13,108
[ANCESTOR B]
Lord Landlake?

355
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:15,400
[GUEN] Did you just swallow
a second great lord?

356
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:16,983
That's right, and if
ya don't shape up,

357
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:17,942
you're all gonna join 'em!

358
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:19,108
[ANCESTORS yell]

359
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:21,108
[GUEN]
Consider us persuaded, child.

360
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,442
We shall give your plan
our best effort.

361
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:25,900
[DOC] You should've
done it earlier. Hurry up!

362
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,150
[ANCESTORS]
Right!

363
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,358
[DOUSSANT]
Mordred's gone rogue?

364
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:38,233
Fools! Stop him at once!

365
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:39,858
We can't without
hurting him, my lord.

366
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:41,608
The boy's obviously
lost his mind.

367
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,067
If he can't be spared,
then cut him down!

368
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,317
Kill him! Kill him!

369
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,692
Before he ruins everything
I've worked for!

370
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:50,150
More blood on the deck?

371
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:51,233
That's fine wood,

372
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,525
and it cost me a
fortune to acquire.

373
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:56,983
It's worth more than any
of your lives, understand?

374
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,567
Mordred!

375
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,400
Snap-to like the puppet you are
and clean up this mess at once!

376
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,733
What a worthless failure.

377
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:07,942
Ah! You hateful creature.

378
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:10,358
[OCOHO] You called your
own son a puppet.

379
00:16:10,442 --> 00:16:13,525
Said this deck was worth
more than his life.

380
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:16,525
With a dad like you,
Mordred had no chance!

381
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,858
[DOUSSANT]
Enough.

382
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:20,733
Kill that wretched girl
and my son along with her!

383
00:16:20,817 --> 00:16:23,900
[OCOHO yells]

384
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,775
[LISELOTTE]
You sorcerers are tainted.

385
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:27,025
By choice or not,

386
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:29,317
you cause humanity
nothing but pain and fear!

387
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,567
They only fear us

388
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,775
'cause you Inquisitors
tell 'em they should!

389
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:38,317
The fact is that you people
need to be controlled!

390
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,067
Why'd you ditch the witch's hat?
Was it something I said?

391
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,817
Don't test me!

392
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,692
Who are you?

393
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:51,608
I know you're not the
girl I fought before.

394
00:16:51,692 --> 00:16:54,733
I'm proof that she
won't be controlled.

395
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:58,608
Pulsar!

396
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,233
[SETH]
He projected both arms.

397
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:04,900
If I can't get him moving,
I'll be in big trouble.

398
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,192
[laughs]

399
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:10,233
[SANTORI]
In a sense,

400
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:13,150
I'm here to offer
a helping hand.

401
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,483
I bet you Inquisitors think
you're doing us a favor,

402
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,483
but the infected don't
want your help!

403
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:21,900
We're not animals to be caged!

404
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:23,483
[SANTORI]
You say you're not beasts,

405
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:24,983
but you certainly look like them

406
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:28,025
as you squirm around trying
to get away from us.

407
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:30,108
You should see
yourself right now.

408
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:33,358
The harder you fight, the closer
your natural savagery comes

409
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,108
to taking control of you.

410
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:38,900
[SANTORI laughs]

411
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:40,442
[SETH]
He's right.

412
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:43,858
I have to finish this quickly...
before I lose control again.

413
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:46,400
[SETH]
Titan Punch!

414
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,608
[SANTORI grunts]

415
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,025
[laughs] Not bad.

416
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:52,317
[laughing]

417
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:01,858
Were you hoping that I'd
punch my own lights out?

418
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:05,317
Well, hey, between you and me,
your trick almost worked.

419
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,567
But if you wanna win now,

420
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,733
you'll have to do a lot
more than just dodge.

421
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:11,733
[SETH]
Fine, how 'bout this?

422
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:16,108
Diabal! Let's take him out!

423
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,900
Right!

424
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:22,483
Oh, yeah! Your antics
never fail to entertain me!

425
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,025
You really are amazing!

426
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,858
The battles we've fought have
given me no end of delight.

427
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:34,942
Every time I think
I understand you,

428
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:37,650
ya hit me with another surprise!

429
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:41,108
Not good.

430
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:45,942
Ow! That really hurt.

431
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,983
Gee. That's gonna
smart for a while.

432
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,775
I guess I went overboard.

433
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:54,025
Oh, come on! Don't tell
me that finished you!

434
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:56,025
Ya should've dodged
my face easy!

435
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:59,233
Am I about to be disappointed
twice in one day?

436
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:02,233
[yells]

437
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:06,483
Your illusions are weak.

438
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:09,858
And furthermore,
I know how they work!

439
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,150
[DIABAL]
He crushed the stone.

440
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:15,817
Seth.

441
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,067
Whoo! That was a
pretty fun tussle.

442
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,400
It was a bit shorter than
I've grown accustomed to,

443
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:22,233
but we've still got some time.

444
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:25,817
Now get back up on your feet
so I can knock you down again.

445
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,358
Stand and fight!

446
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,817
Do it for your friends,
or for freedom,

447
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,192
or for the sheer thrill of it!

448
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:35,817
[SANTORI]
There's no way you're finished.

449
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,858
I'm sure you've got
more fight in you.

450
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,858
[growls]

451
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:42,233
[SANTORI] You may look goofy
with your tiny horns,

452
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:43,358
but you're strong.

453
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:45,108
I respect your abilities.

454
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:46,692
There are many sorcerers,

455
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:50,275
but none of them can come
close to matching your vitality.

456
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:54,483
That's why I hoped you'd escape
us back in Rumble Town.

457
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:57,900
If I didn't have a sorcerer like
you to chase around Pharenos,

458
00:19:57,983 --> 00:20:00,192
then I would be bored
out of my mind!

459
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,275
Hunting sorcerers is good sport,

460
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:04,567
plus you people need
to be controlled.

461
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,442
Most people live in fear of you.

462
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:09,733
They'd breathe much more freely
if you were all put in chains.

463
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:12,025
And as a Thaumaturge
of the Inquisition,

464
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:14,358
it's my duty to protect people.

465
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:16,942
Help them feel safe.

466
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:18,858
[SETH]
Do you think you sound noble

467
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:22,108
as you repeat the lies
you've been told?

468
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:25,567
You Inquisitors don't want
people to feel safe.

469
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,317
It's their fear that
gives you power.

470
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:31,442
Hurry up and kill them!

471
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:33,233
We'll do the same
with any other slaves

472
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,108
who refuse to do
as they're told!

473
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,025
This ends now.

474
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:40,775
We're offering your kind
a proper place in this world.

475
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:42,233
Why can't you see that?

476
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:45,108
Why can't you let us choose
what to do for ourselves?

477
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:47,233
We don't have any interest
in becoming slaves!

478
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:50,733
Oh, please! What're you
getting mad at us for?

479
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,108
It's the Nemeses that made
you less than human,

480
00:20:53,192 --> 00:20:54,817
we're just making do
with what's left.

481
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,233
[SETH]
You think we're less than human?

482
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:01,358
And don't try to act like
having magic's improved you.

483
00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:03,817
I've attained a power that
makes you look weak,

484
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,858
and I did it without becoming
a monstrous hybrid.

485
00:21:06,942 --> 00:21:09,692
The pinnacle of humanity
is standing right here.

486
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:12,567
If you disagree, then lift
your head and say so.

487
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,358
Unless you're ready
to become a slave.

488
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,275
Well? Are ya gonna give me
the fight I want or not?

489
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:19,608
[SETH]
You're the real slave.

490
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:21,150
What are you mumbling?

491
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,608
[SETH] And I'd break
your chains if I could,

492
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:25,858
but they're in your
heart and your mind.

493
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:27,858
And you put them on!

494
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,192
What? How?

495
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:33,900
[gasps]

496
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,608
Gysoni!

497
00:21:42,275 --> 00:21:44,608
[SETH] You can weigh us
down with shackles,

498
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:47,233
or toss us into cages,

499
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:51,108
but sooner or later...
we'll break free of you!

500
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:54,483
Funny thing about the infected.
We're all survivors!

501
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:56,858
You could never understand
what that means.

502
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,358
[SETH] But whether you
accept us or not,

503
00:21:59,442 --> 00:22:02,983
we are human!

504
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:07,317
[SETH yelling]

505
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,317
You've got me in rapture, kid.

506
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,442
Somehow, I knew that you'd
be the one to give me

507
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:13,525
the fight I've always
yearned for!

508
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,400
I can't tell you how
grateful I am

509
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:18,400
to have finally met a monster
who can best me in battle!

510
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:21,483
I'm not your damn monster.
Just a pissed off human!

511
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,983
[SANTORI screams]

512
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:25,942
I wish you the best, truly!

513
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:28,567
You've fulfilled my wildest
dreams, and more!

514
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:34,317
By my beard I swear,
this is my finest day!

515
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,900
[NARRATOR] Shortly after
mighty Santori's defeat,

516
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,483
Ullmina deploys a
Harmonizium in the forest

517
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:17,025
and activates her dread miracle.

518
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:19,900
As fallen soldiers rise
to fight again,

519
00:24:19,983 --> 00:24:22,608
the device rips
Fantasia from the air.

520
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:24,233
Myr loses all hope.

521
00:24:24,317 --> 00:24:28,817
Sorrow turns to rage and
a primal howl is heard.

522
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,608
Next time on <i>Radiant</i> ,

523
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:33,275
"I Can't Hear Your Voice."
