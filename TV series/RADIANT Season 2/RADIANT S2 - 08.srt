1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,442
[NARRATOR] Seth encountered
a young man named Diabal

2
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:15,817
in a hidden chamber of
the keep at Caislean Merlin.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,025
It's clear that he and
his shadowy allies

4
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:21,650
are creating Spectral Nemeses,
but to what end?

5
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,858
Even when Seth went berserk,

6
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:27,733
these new enemies had
the strength to match him.

7
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,983
[NARRATOR]
"Seth in the Forest of Time."

8
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:09,817
[SHADOW A]
He escaped?

9
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,775
[SHADOW B] Impossible! You saw
the hit he took from Diabal.

10
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:16,650
[SHADOW A] We need to cover
this breach with an illusion.

11
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:17,733
[SHADOW A gasps]

12
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:21,442
[SHADOW A]
Look down there. It's Myr.

13
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:23,275
[SHADOW B]
He's but a senile old man

14
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:25,567
who thinks he can
speak with flowers.

15
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,942
Even if that fool
were to witness

16
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:28,983
the second coming
of Merlin himself,

17
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:32,358
no one would believe
a word he said of it.

18
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:34,525
[DIABAL]
Were you able to find his body?

19
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:35,608
[SHADOW B]
No.

20
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:36,942
[DIABAL]
Then he's still alive.

21
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:39,067
We must do whatever it
takes to finish him off.

22
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,483
He knows where I'm hiding!

23
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:41,817
[SHADOW B]
Before we do anything,

24
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,692
you'll tell us who that was.

25
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:47,567
All I know is that he's with
the man who gave me these scars.

26
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:57,817
'Kay, you can let him out now.

27
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:02,942
Thanks for helping me
stow him away, my dear.

28
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:06,483
I'll come by and make it
up to you in a few days.

29
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,108
[MYR] These wounds are
beyond my power to treat,

30
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,775
but I've yet to see an injury
my wife couldn't heal.

31
00:03:16,858 --> 00:03:18,442
[gasps]

32
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:21,233
What the heck was that
weird sensation?

33
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:22,692
[MELIE]
Doc!

34
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:24,983
[DOC]
Hey, Melie.

35
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,525
Listen. I'm pretty sure
Seth's in trouble!

36
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,025
Huh? What do you mean?

37
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:35,525
Well, this is certainly
peculiar, isn't it?

38
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:38,567
This rubble looks like
a piece of the castle,

39
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,442
but there's no sign that
the exterior is damaged.

40
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:44,025
Could it have been
a projectile then?

41
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:46,608
What would it be fired from,
some kind of catapult?

42
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:49,233
I doubt that this lump would
even make it over the wall.

43
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:50,400
--Yeah.
--[CASTLE GUARD A] Hmm...

44
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:51,692
Good point.

45
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,692
All of us did hear
that explosion, right?

46
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,525
Of course we all did.

47
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:55,317
[MELIE]
Ocoho.

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,442
Yeah?

49
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:58,400
Oh, hey.

50
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:00,067
Why did you bring a
little kid with you?

51
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,567
[DOC] I'll have you know
that I'm your elder!

52
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,567
Anyway, who is this girl?

53
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,567
[MELIE] This is Ocoho,
a knight candidate.

54
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,025
She's been with Seth since he
first arrived at the castle.

55
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:13,567
Oh! That's right!
We need to hurry.

56
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,608
Have you two found any clues
to where Seth might be?

57
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:19,442
This should be near the source
of the explosion we heard.

58
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,442
Hopefully it didn't
involve Seth.

59
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:23,275
[DOC]
Of course it involved him!

60
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:24,650
Whenever there's a
mess gettin' made,

61
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:26,358
you can always find
Seth in the thick of it!

62
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:28,233
Yeah, Doc's right.

63
00:04:28,317 --> 00:04:30,358
The trail's extremely
faint right now.

64
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:33,817
But still, I'm picking up
traces of Seth's Fantasia.

65
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,233
Amazing!

66
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,483
Yep. Melie's tracking abilities
really are top-notch.

67
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,317
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

68
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:43,983
Huh?

69
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:51,900
Seth has to be close.
Vestigia Invenire!

70
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,025
[MELIE]
Come on! This way!

71
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:16,442
The tracer disappeared?

72
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,775
That's what happens when
magic reaches the gate.

73
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:21,108
These walls are designed
to cancel out any spell

74
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:23,150
that tries to pass through them.

75
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,025
Well, in that case...

76
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:28,858
I'll try again now.

77
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:31,525
Vestigia Invenire!

78
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,733
It went into the forest?

79
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:44,567
[DOC] I don't remember adults
bein' this hard to keep up with

80
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,858
when I was a real kid.

81
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:49,233
I need to take a break,
so I'm gonna!

82
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:52,817
Ow! Stupid bat! Okay,
fine, I'll keep goin'!

83
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,025
[MELIE]
Let's hurry.

84
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:55,983
[OCOHO]
Wait! Hold on!

85
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:57,983
Haven't you heard
the old legends?

86
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,733
Caillte's forest is guarded
by a powerful spell.

87
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:03,442
Whoever goes in there gets
lost for years at a time.

88
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:05,317
Some people never make it back!

89
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,900
[DOC]
Seriously?

90
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:08,442
No one goes in there.

91
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:12,317
Even veteran knight-sorcerers
steer clear of these woods.

92
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,025
Well, if you say so.

93
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,567
Let's look around
the edges instead.

94
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,192
You do that.
I'll go in alone!

95
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:19,192
[OCOHO, DOC yell]

96
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,817
[OCOHO]
Hey! Wait, Melie!

97
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,900
[OCOHO screams]

98
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:26,983
[DOC screaming]

99
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:39,400
[MELIE]
Look it. What is this place?

100
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:57,400
[OCOHO]
Idiot.

101
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,608
I get it now.

102
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:00,025
Of course you're
a friend of Seth's,

103
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:02,067
you're every bit as awful
at listening as he is!

104
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,400
How do you expect to
get out of here, Melie?

105
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:06,650
Uh, I don't feel like
it'll be that difficult.

106
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:11,192
We just turn and...
retrace our steps...?

107
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:15,275
Wait, Melie just dragged us
through a big thicket, right?

108
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:19,150
[MISTER BOOBRIE crying]

109
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:20,525
[MELIE, OCOHO yelp]

110
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:47,650
[ALL sigh]

111
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:52,108
What was that thing? Did you
feel how strong its aura was?

112
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:55,858
That monster could eat us all
in one bite! We should run!

113
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,692
I'm so sorry. It's my
fault that we're all--

114
00:07:57,775 --> 00:08:01,025
Oh. Stop. Save that
for later, 'kay?

115
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:03,275
Apologizing won't
get us anywhere.

116
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,025
Let's focus on the task at hand.

117
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:07,400
We'll be fine if we
all work together.

118
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:09,942
If we must get eaten,
we'll do it as a team.

119
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:11,775
We've got two main objectives!

120
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,900
First, we've gotta
try to find Seth.

121
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:15,567
Then we just need to leave.

122
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,358
Right!

123
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:21,067
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirping]

124
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,233
Stop your squawkin'!

125
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:23,983
You're gonna make that
monster come back!

126
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,733
What do you see?

127
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,692
[DOC]
No monster.

128
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,067
[MELIE]
Where could it have gone?

129
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,775
The question that you
ought to be asking

130
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,608
is "when" could it have gone.

131
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:37,067
Give it a rest, Myr.

132
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,775
We don't have time for your
silly riddles right now.

133
00:08:39,858 --> 00:08:40,775
Ugh. Wait!

--[MELIE, DOC scream]
--Myr?

135

Hello, everyone.

136
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:46,400
I take it that you three are
also out for a relaxing stroll

137
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:48,567
through this serene
little patch of garden?

138
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,567
[DOC] Serene garden?
It's a monster-infested jungle!

139
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,650
Oh my. Well, this is
certainly a surprise.

140
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:56,983
You three can see
the wildlife, eh?

141
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:58,817
[OCOHO]
Yeah, of course.

142
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,442
I'm also quite impressed you've
managed to avoid getting lost.

143
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,650
[DOC] We're actually
as lost as can be.

144
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,400
Are you really?

145
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:08,317
In that case, you're
welcome to come with me.

146
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,442
I'll introduce you to my wife.

147
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:13,567
Look, Myr, I'm sorry, but we're
really kinda busy right now.

148
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,567
We have to find Se--

149
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,025
[MYR]
Oh, he's with me.

150
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:16,983

Huh?!

151
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,108
Seth!

152
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,650
He looks terrible!
What happened to him?

153
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:24,608
I don't understand
these injuries either.

154
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:27,775
Which is why I'm taking
the boy to an expert.

155
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:41,525
Ah! Those birds look
just like tortibri.

156
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:43,733
Huh.

157
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,275
And those flowers.

158

I've seen them in an antique
field guide by Sextus Apuleius.

159
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,858
Almost every living thing out
here was believed to be extinct.

160
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:57,108
If these specimens are real,
this is a huge discovery.

161

Why doesn't the enchantment
of the forest affect you, Myr?

162
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:01,400
Enchantment?

163

You do know about it, right?

164
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,442
Anyone who enters
this forest gets lost.

165
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,233
People have ended up trapped
in here for decades.

[MYR]
Oh, yeah?

167

[OCOHO] The legends say
it's because of a spell

cast by Merlin himself

from invading enemy armies.

Isn't that amusing. You people
really are quite ridiculous.

171

When something confounds you,

172
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,025
rather than confess your
ignorance about it,

173
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:28,150
you come up with a
random explanation.

174
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:31,525
It's true that many people
have been lost in this forest,

175
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:33,108
but I can assure you
that this isn't

176
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:35,483
because of some magic spell.

Here we are.

Right there. Can you see it?

It's almost transparent,

but there's a little
orb around him.

Tried my best to break it,

but nothing I could come up
with seemed to do the trick.

So what did you end
up doing to get in?

228
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,525
I caused a little tree to grow

229
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:53,775
and let it push through
with its branches.

me how you're inside my head?

Inside your head?

Wow, Myr. Your friend has quite
the self-centered theory.

241
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:29,983
We're drifting through
a spiritual plane

242
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:31,692
called the "Sidh" right now.

243
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,775
[SETH]
The "Sidh"?

[JILL]
Yes. Very good.

245
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:36,942
There aren't too many who
can awaken themselves

246
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:41,192
to this plane of existence,
but everyone has a place in it.

247
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:43,025
Once you grow accustomed
to the Sidh,

248
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:45,317
you can use it to seek
out other entities.

249
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,858
You can even use it
to communicate

250
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:49,067
over great distances.

Ohh.

Now tell me, Seth.

253
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,733
Who awoke you to the Sidh?
And where'd the eye come from?

254
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:03,733
I think Piodon. He says
that we're brothers.

255
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:06,983
He saved my life,
but at a price.

00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:31,692
[MELIE]
Are they actually napping?

No, they're not!

263
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,233
They're talking with Seth.

264
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:38,275
Their auras are all over his.
Can't you sense it?

265
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:39,650
Their auras?

266
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:41,025
What do you mean?

267
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:42,567
Come to think of it,

268
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,858
I do sort of get the feeling
that they're connected somehow.

269
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:48,150
I can't normally sense
this kinda stuff,

270
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:50,942
but here in the woods,
it seems to come so naturally.

271
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:53,858
It almost feels like
the forest is helping me.

272
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:55,525
Hey! I've got an idea!

273
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:56,358
Ya ready?

274
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,025
Wait, what are you gonna do?

275
00:14:58,108 --> 00:15:00,358
I'm pretty curious, too.

276
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:06,733
[MYR]
Hmm...

277
00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:08,400
So you passed out
from the poison

278
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:11,983
and woke up inside this bubble
along with that little eyeball.

279
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:13,525
That's right.

280
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:18,150
Then the eye swallowed me up
and seized control of my body.

281
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:23,275
I couldn't stop it.
It sent me on a rampage.

282
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:27,317
I need to know--do you think
this'll happen again?

283
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,650
[MYR]
It seems likely.

284
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:34,525
Hard to say till we know
what this thing is.

285
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:37,275
It's possible that it's been
acting on its own accord.

286
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:38,442
And there is a chance

287
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:40,567
you've been controlling
it subconsciously.

288
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,192
The worst case is probably
if it's subservient

289
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,567
to this Piodon fellow
you told us about.

290
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,275
I'm holding it back
from possessing you

291
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:49,817
for the moment at least.

292
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,692
But without its raw
power to sustain you,

293
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:54,275
you're more or less stuck
at the brink of death.

294
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:56,150
[SETH]
What?! Brink of death?!

295
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:57,317
I'm really about to die?

296
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,650
Given enough time,
I can heal your wounds.

297
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:02,150
But if I were to wake you up,
you would leave the Sidh,

298
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:05,192
which could break the spell
that Myr used to trap the eye.

299
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:09,358
So you're saying that I would
lose control of myself again.

300
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:12,817
I mean, unless you can figure
out how to get a handle on it,

301
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,108
yeah.

302
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:20,858
[SETH]
I can't.

303
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:26,650
So... just leave me like this.

of them in here?

Yep.

nice to you?

you've done to me!

old coot. Fix me!

how that happened.

00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:54,900
But hey, you should turn right
back to normal when we leave.

315
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:59,525
[OCOHO chuckles nervously]

316
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:01,650
That's my guess at least.

317
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,150
Then let's leave now!

318
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,442
Huh? But we just got here.

319
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,942
I'm not staying like this one
second longer than I gotta!

320
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:11,983
So hurry up and get
me outta this place!

321
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:13,358
Aww, but--

322
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:15,442
You don't understand
what this is like!

323
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:16,775
I need to go back, now!

324
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:20,108
Okay, I'll take you back.
Just stop your shouting.

325
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,525
[MELIE] I can't believe
you're trying to give up.

326
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:39,900
That isn't who you are, Seth.

327
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,317
I'm just scared.

328
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:51,442
This monster takes over my body
every time I let my guard down.

329
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:53,650
It doesn't matter
how hard I fight,

330
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,567
or how loud I scream.

331
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,817
In fact, I feel like
it just gets stronger

332
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,608
the more I struggle against it.

333
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:04,358
There's nothing I can
do to make it stop.

334
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:05,733
So what's the plan?

335
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:08,733
You're just gonna mope
inside this bubble forever?

336
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:10,817
I thought you would understand.

337
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,608
Well, I don't, Seth.
So try explaining.

338
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:17,733
You know what it's like
to lose control of yourself.

339
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:22,400
If anyone should get what that
means for me, then it's you.

340
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:26,400
[MELIE] It means you're
gonna have to struggle.

341
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:28,692
Just like everyone else does.

342
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,525
Doc got turned into a helpless
infant and he didn't give up.

343
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,900
I've been randomly losing
my mind for years now

344
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,525
and I'm not giving up.

345
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:39,358
We all have things we
have to push through.

346
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:41,025
Why won't you try?

347
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:43,775
[SETH] You know what it's
like to lose control.

348
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:46,025
Now imagine if every
time it happened,

349
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:49,733
you destroyed everything
and everyone around you.

350
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:51,067
If you knew that your curse

351
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,775
could make you kill
Boobrie, or Doc, or me,

352
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:58,983
would you really still
let us get close to you?

353
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,817
Would you risk it?

354
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:08,150
You'd leave? Right?

355
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,858
Look, here's the deal,

356
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:18,608
this thing is a monster
and I can't control it.

357
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:21,608
Any more than you can
control your curse.

358
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,150
If I'm wrong, tell me.

359
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:28,067
Have you ever been
able to fight it off?

360
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,358
[MELIE]
No.

361
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,192
[MELIE]
I can't beat it.

362
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,358
[MELIE]
But... you have.

363
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,817
[MELIE]
You've snapped me out of a fit

364
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,317
more than once now, Seth.

365
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,067
My curse never
seemed to scare you,

366
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,900
or to damage the
trust you put in me.

367
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,817
I still don't know how
I even earned that trust.

368
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,983
You've always acted
as if my infection

369
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,608
was this insignificant thing.

370
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:04,567
You treated it like
it was just a quirk,

371
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,858
a part of my personality.

372
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,525
'Cause of you,

373
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,900
that's actually how I've
begun to see it myself.

374
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,567
[MELIE]
Look, Seth,

375
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,358
I know our situations
are different, but...

376
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:27,858
...just try.

377
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:31,400
I'm sure that you can find
a way to beat this thing.

378
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,942
I'm too weak, Melie.

379
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,275
[SETH]
Well, on my own at least.

380
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:48,233
So, yeah. I'm glad that
I have you around.

381
00:20:48,317 --> 00:20:50,067
Do you mean--?

382
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,650
[SETH] I have no idea
how this thing works,

383
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:56,192
but the more I talk to you,
the more it seems to calm down.

384
00:20:56,275 --> 00:21:00,108
It doesn't feel so scary now.

385
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,233
I thought that this
was something

386
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:03,817
I would have to take
care of by myself,

387
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,067
but I was wrong.

388
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,400
I-I do need help.

389
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:10,858
I don't wanna leave
you behind again,

390
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:14,817
but I couldn't live with myself
if I hurt you somehow.

391
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,192
Which leaves me one option.

392
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:20,025
I swear, I'm gonna learn
to control this thing.

393
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:22,025
No doubt.

394
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:24,442
Good news.

395
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:26,358
[SETH chuckles]

396
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:28,858
What's so funny?
I missed the joke.

397
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:30,400
I just had to get stabbed.

398
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:32,108
Huh? To do what?

399
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:34,442
To convince you to
be my friend again.

400
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:38,358
When did I ever stop
being your--? Oh.

401
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:40,817
That's right. You were so
dang worried you forgot!

402
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,400
I guess so. Huh.

403
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:44,817
I'm glad we can start
talkin' casually again.

404
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,275
I missed ya.

405
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:48,692
[MELIE] Hold on.
I'm still mad at you, Seth!

406
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,233
[SETH]
So you were mad!

407
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:52,692
[MELIE] No! That just
slipped out. I wasn't--!

408
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:56,483
Agh... C'mon. Gimme a break.

409
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:58,358
[SETH]
Melie.

410
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,483
[MELIE]
Huh?

411
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:01,942
[SETH]
Thank you.

412
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:03,525
[MELIE chuckles]

413
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:13,483
[MYR]
Ah. She woke up.

414
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:16,525
As for him, he seems a bit
less wilted than before.

415
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:18,400
[OCOHO]
So what's that mean?

416
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:19,983
Will he be okay?

417
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:22,900
Yeah, he's decided to keep
pushing forward with our help.

418
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:24,608
Well, that's a relief.

419
00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:27,942
Although it seems he plans
to stay here with Myr.

420
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:30,817
He said he wanted to spend
some time training with him.

421
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,317
[OCOHO, DOC]
With him?

422
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,858
[chuckles]

423
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:11,067
[NARRATOR] Determined
to find a way to control

424
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,775
the chaotic power within him,
Seth begins a training regimen

425
00:24:14,858 --> 00:24:16,900
unlike any he's been
through before,

426
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:19,233
under the tutelage
of Myr and Jill.

427
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:22,108
After learning the true
nature of Fantasia,

428
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:25,025
and how to open his senses
to the world around him,

429
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:29,442
Seth confronts the dark power
that Piodon placed inside him.

430
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:31,067
Next time on <i>Radiant</i> ,

431
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,775
"The Palace of Schemes."
