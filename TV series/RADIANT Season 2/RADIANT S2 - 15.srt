1
00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:12,817
[NARRATOR] The invasion
of Cyfandir has begun.

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,317
Determined to bring
the sorcerers

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,150
of Caislean Merlin to heel,

4
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:19,858
the Inquisition armada, armed
with an anti-magic weapon,

5
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:22,233
has moved to take the city.

6
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:24,858
Queen Boudica sallied
forth with her knights

7
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,692
and attacked the invaders
with the strength of the kings

8
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:29,567
who came before her.

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,650
The devastating battle to
come will shake this land

10
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,775
as it has never
been shaken before.

11
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:38,650
[SANTORI]
The queen has heard our message

12
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:41,025
and given us a prompt response.

13
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,317
[laughs]

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,358
Men! Draw your weapons!

15
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:48,317
[INQUISITION SOLDIERS]
Glory to Bome!

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,358
Make ready. Cannon and
catapult crews! Fire!

17
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:58,442
Do not forget! Merlin didn't
give us this land to share.

18
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,650
We'll not let our
country be divided.

19
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,983
Cyfandir belongs to us!

20
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:06,567
[SOLDIERS cheer]

21
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,483
[ORDERIC]
Fire!

22
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:21,983
[INQUISITION SOLDIER C]
Massive shot incoming!

23
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,817
Huh?

24
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,192
Ah!

25
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:30,483
What's going on here?

26
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:34,775
[INQUISITION SOLDIER D]
Watch out!

27
00:01:34,858 --> 00:01:37,608
So the sorcerers have
anti-gravity rounds.

28
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:41,275
Ah. How I wish I could
float in the sky.

29
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:46,108
The enemy fleet is beginning
to advance on our position.

30
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:47,858
[KNIGHT-SORCERER G]
Inquisition attack incoming!

31
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,233
Please get back, Your Majesty!

32
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:51,358
[BOUDICA]
There's no need.

33
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:54,775
Knights, clear a path!

34
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:56,233
Taran!

35
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:59,150
Lightning.

36
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:02,525
Let your judgment crash down
on these insolent fools!

37
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:04,233
Mellt!

38
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,942
[INQUISITION SOLDIERS gasping]

39
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:23,400
[INQUISITION SOLDIERS scream]

40
00:02:23,483 --> 00:02:24,900
[laughs]

41
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:27,858
The queen struck them all down
in a mere blink of an eye.

42
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:33,900
[SOLDIERS cheering]

43
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:39,150
This battle has
been far too easy.

44
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,942
There's no way this is all
the Inquisition's capable of.

45
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:43,442
[BARELL]
This is our chance!

46
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:46,233
The enemy commanders
are wide open!

47
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:47,775
Follow me!

48
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:50,025
We'll wipe the fiends out in
the name of the great Merlin!

49
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:53,025
[KNIGHT-SORCERERS] In the name
of the great Merlin, we fight!

50
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,192
[BARELL] What the--?
Our spells had no effect!

51
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:00,692
They don't appear to be trying
to defend themselves either.

52
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:03,525
It matters not!
Continue the charge!

53
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,692
[KNIGHT-SORCERERS screaming]

54
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,358
[grunts] Sciath!

55
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:23,192
[screams]

56
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:24,400
What's going on?

57
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:26,525
Why did his shield
spell go down?

58
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:29,358
It looked like that knight
ran out of Fantasia!

59
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,192
That's right. Just as I thought.

60
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:34,108
I don't know how, but...

61
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:36,233
That strange machine
of theirs,

62
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:39,108
it's removing Fantasia
from the air!

63
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,483
No.

64
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:53,233
[groaning]

65
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,275
Why is the forest dying?
What have these humans done now?

66
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:03,067
They'll never stop.

67
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,775
They'll kill everything!

68
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,858
[NARRATOR] "Led to the Abyss
by a Melody of Death."

69
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,817
[KNIGHT-SORCERER D]
Uh! Lord Barell has fallen!

70
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,192
We'll have to finish what
he started. Let's move out.

71
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:56,150
[KNIGHT-SORCERERS]
Sir!

72
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:59,775
No! Wait! We mustn't
get too close to them.

73
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,275
They have the means
to negate our magic!

74
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:03,442
[SANTORI laughing]

75
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:05,567
[KNIGHT-SORCERERS groan]

76
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,150
He wiped out that whole group
with a single strike.

77
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,067
A Thaumaturge got them.

78
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,733
But our knights have
superior range,

79
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:14,025
why couldn't they land
the first blow?

80
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,525
I don't know, but we need
to take out their leaders.

81
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:18,942
Let's attack as one
and overwhelm them.

82
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:21,608
[OCOHO]
No! You can't do that!

83
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:23,608
It doesn't matter how
many soldiers you send,

84
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:25,358
they'll only meet defeat.

85
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:27,775
The enemy's made some
kind of Fantasia vacuum

86
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:29,858
to protect their leaders
from our spells.

87
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:31,150
How could you know that?

88
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:33,067
Why should we
believe this story?

89
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,525
I can feel it! It's the
only explanation that--

90
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:38,650
We must stop the Inquisition's
advance no matter the cost.

91
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,608
We've no time to indulge
your "feelings."

92
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,608
Please, milady.

93
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,942
[GUENOLINE]
Be silent!

94
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,025
[ORDERIC]
That's the reject

95
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:46,942
from the ordination
ceremony, right?

96
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,150
Ignore her.

97
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:51,192
She just wants to be
the center of attention.

98
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,400
Right. I'll look
into it for you.

99
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,525
[ALL] By Merlin,
we'll defend this land!

100
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:10,192
[KNIGHT-SORCERER F]
Look out! He's gaining on us!

101
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:12,858
[KNIGHT-SORCERERS]
May Merlin grant us his protec--

102
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:17,108
[OCOHO] They'll wipe us
out at this rate.

103
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:18,692
This is bad.

104
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:22,192
I have to do something about
that machine of theirs.

105
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,025
[OCOHO]
Hm?

106
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,733
Is that Lord de Gulis?

107
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:28,817
It is. And he's with
Mordred and Sagramore?

108
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,942
Why are they charging
off by themselves?

109
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:32,775
Just how stupid can they be?

110
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:35,817
That heroic ineptitude's
gonna get them killed!

111
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,650
They're so fast.

112
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:43,067
All right, Draccoon,
I need to take over.

113
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,483
Gysoni!

114
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:51,358
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile,

115
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:54,025
Seth, who had succeeded
in sneaking into the castle

116
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,983
during the ordination ceremony,

117
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,025
had just learned
the terrifying reason

118
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:00,525
why Diabal was in hiding.

119
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:03,567
Piodon used Diabal
as a child-soldier

120
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,067
before turning him over
to the Inquisition

121
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,817
and their merciless torturers.

122
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,775
[SETH]
I just don't understand.

123
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,983
Why would Piodon throw
you away like that?

124
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,025
[DIABAL]
I had outlived my use.

125
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:19,483
Wasn't worth keeping once
I started asking questions.

126
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:22,900
I get why you're so afraid,

127
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:24,733
but now that you've escaped
from the Inquisition,

128
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:26,358
you could go anywhere, right?

129
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:28,233
Why trap yourself down here?

130
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:30,733
[DIABAL] I wasn't able
to escape on my own.

131
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:33,900
Triton paid the price
for my freedom.

132
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:36,608
And Piodon could
access my senses,

133
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:39,817
so I decided to blind myself.

134
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,067
As for why I stayed here,
the castle walls are enchanted.

135
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,983
No outside magic is able
to penetrate them.

136
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:51,108
So as long as I stay,
not even Piodon can find me.

137
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:52,400
[SETH]
I get it now.

138
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:54,400
You helped those
creeps make Spectres

139
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:57,608
because they said it would
keep this place safe.

140
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:59,483
The Spectres kill people!

141
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,942
Do you have any idea how
much suffering you've...?

142
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:04,358
[DIABAL] Don't talk to
me about suffering!

143
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:07,525
Have you ever been tortured
within an inch of your life?!

144
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:09,442
Have you ever been
thrust straight into hell

145
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:12,650
by the only person you
thought you could trust?!

146
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:16,483
[SETH]
No. I haven't.

147
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,567
I'm sorry, Diabal.

148
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,900
I can't even begin to imagine
what you've been through.

149
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:25,025
What he did to you was awful.

150
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:28,608
But that said... even if
our roles were reversed,

151
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:32,275
you wouldn't catch me hiding
or acting like a monster,

152
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:35,192
attacking innocent people
to save myself.

153
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,567
Why did you even come here?

154
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,442
[SETH]
Diabal,

155
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:43,650
with your permission, I'd like
to trace back your memories.

156
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:45,192
I'm not sure,

157
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:48,983
but I think this'll help us
to learn what we are.

158
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:01,692
Is this...?

159
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:05,442
We're in the Sidh
now, aren't we?

160
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:07,983
So it isn't just a
legend after all.

161
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,483
Turns out the stories were true.

162
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,983
I have to ask.
How did you do this?

163
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:15,317
I've been training since
the last time we met.

164
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,358
[DIABAL]
Oh. I see.

165
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:20,608
But, Seth, can I really
see my past here?

166
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:22,817
Because if that's possible,

167
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,233
then I might be able
to confirm my theory.

168
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:26,608
[SETH]
Yeah.

169
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,358
But that's pretty
much up to you now.

170
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,025
Okay.

171
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:34,983
[DIABAL]
No! Get it away!

172
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,442
I can't go through that again!

173
00:10:39,108 --> 00:10:41,900
[SETH] He has a lot that
he doesn't wanna remember.

174
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:44,150
Can't I do anything for him?

175
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,775
Maybe my friend can help.

176
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:48,942
He's the one who taught
me about this place.

177
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:51,942
Hey! Hey! Myr!

178
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,775
Are ya busy?

179
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:58,025
Weird. I wonder what's wrong.
He usually answers right away.

180
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:00,150
[OCOHO]
Seth! Seth!

181
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,650
Is that you, Ocoho?
What's goin' on?

182
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,067
[OCOHO] There's trouble!
Where are you right now?

183
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,817
Inside the castle with Diabal.
But I'm actually kinda busy--

184
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,775
[OCOHO]
It's war!

185
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:11,525
The kingdom. We're at war!

186
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:12,775
War against who?

187
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:15,275
[OCOHO] The Inquisition
sent an invasion fleet.

188
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:17,983
We're holding them off
for now, but just barely.

189
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:20,650
I doubt we'll last much longer.

190
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,817
The enemy has us
outnumbered two to one,

191
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,692
and they have Thaumaturges!

192
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:25,983
[SETH]
Seriously?

193
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:28,817
For real! They mentioned
a horned sorcerer.

194
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,233
Sounds like they want
to arrest you.

195
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:33,817
[OCOHO yells]

196
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,442
[SETH]
Is everything okay?

197
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:36,858
I'm all right for now.

198
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:40,192
But we need all the help
we can get. Come quickly!

199
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:44,025
But where exactly?
Can you hear me, Ocoho?

200
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:47,442
Crap! We need to
get moving, okay?

201
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:52,858
[SETH]
You heard what she said, right?

202
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:54,067
If the Inquisition wins,

203
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,650
you can kiss your
hiding place goodbye.

204
00:11:56,733 --> 00:12:00,650
[DIABAL]
The Inquisition has come here?

205
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:05,942
Piodon. He'll be with
them. I'm sure of it.

206
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,192
You can't plan to spend the
rest of your life in hiding.

207
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,483
There're two of us.

208
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:12,692
If he's here,
then fight him with me.

209
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,150
This is your chance
to stop living in fear.

210
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,733
We're brothers, aren't we?

211
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:19,025
Let's help each other
through this.

212
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:27,650
A rock?

213
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:30,608
[DIABAL] Place that stone
in the enemy camp.

214
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:33,150
It'll summon another spectre.

215
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:34,650
[SETH]
Wait. Really?

216
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,067
[DIABAL]
Yes.

217
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,567
I'll get a new projector
running as quickly as I can.

218
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,692
That's all I can do
for you. Sorry.

219
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,358
I appreciate this.

220
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:46,858
No matter what happens,
I'll come back for you.

221
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:50,817
That's a promise, understand?
I'll come back when it's safe!

222
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,775
[SETH]
Cyfandir's at war now?

223
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:09,775
It happened so suddenly.

224
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,608
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

225
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:22,108
Huh?

226
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,608
Boobrie? What happened?

227
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:28,150
[SETH]
Wait a sec.

228
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:30,900
Where's Melie? And why aren't
you with her right now?

229
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:33,442
Don't tell me something
happened to her!

230
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:46,233
Turn right up here.

231
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:47,442
[gasps]

232
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,900
[LISELOTTE]
This is the girl?

233
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:53,067
[DRAGUNOV] Yes. She's
a friend of the target.

234
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,317
'Kay.

235
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,942
--[MELIE] I--
--Not a word.

236
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:59,150
Keep your mouth shut and
do as you're instructed.

237
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:00,567
Heed this warning.

238
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,400
If you try to deceive us,
or make a break for it,

239
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:06,858
Lizelotte will not hesitate
to cut you down.

240
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:10,150
The only reason you're
alive at the moment

241
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:12,192
is that we plan to
use you to locate

242
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:15,025
your criminal associate
with the horns.

243
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,775
[MELIE]
I know Seth isn't a criminal,

244
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:23,525
so what does the Inquisition
really want with him?

245
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:25,025
[MELIE gasps]

246
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:27,692
[LISELOTTE]
In other words, you're bait.

247
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:29,775
Let's just hope that
little familiar of yours

248
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:32,150
brings him back here.

249
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:34,567
[SETH]
Melie!

250
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,442
Melie!

251
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:39,525
Melie!

252
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:40,942
[SETH gasps]

253
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,567
[DRAGUNOV] You were easier
to find than expected.

254
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:55,858
What the heck do
you want with me?

255
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:58,192
[DRAGUNOV] I'm to capture
the horned sorcerer.

256
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:00,983
Yeah? How d'ya even know
I'm the right one?

257
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:06,067
[SETH] Wait a sec, I saw
you back in Rumble Town.

258
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,567
The name's Dragunov.

259
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,608
Well, my name is Seth.
Not that you would care.

260
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:13,025
Why do I get the feeling that
you know where Melie is?

261
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:14,775
--[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]
--Huh?

262
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:17,067
Because I'm using
her as a hostage.

263
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,983
You seem like one to put your
friends above yourself.

264
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:23,150
[SETH] Bet you think that's
a weakness! Where's Melie?

265
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,733
I'm takin' her back!

266
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,775
[SETH] Hey! You coulda
killed me with that thing!

267
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:30,358
You dodged my shot.

268
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:33,067
It seems that you have the
reflexes of a wild animal.

269
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,525
[SETH]
That s'posed to be a compliment?

270
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:36,108
More of a lamentation.

271
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:38,108
[SETH]
I don't like your tone, jerk.

272
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:39,858
Listen, you're tellin'
me where Melie is,

273
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:41,233
one way or another!

274
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:42,400
[gasps]

275
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,192
Uh-oh.

276
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,775
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

277
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,692
[DRAGUNOV] Is this the
recklessness you fought with

278
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:49,150
in Rumble Town?

279
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:51,608
I have something I would like
to talk to you about.

280
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:53,025
And what's that?

281
00:15:53,108 --> 00:15:55,108
I'll start with
a simple question.

282
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:56,650
Huh?

283
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:02,775
[LISELOTTE] Why do I have
to stay here and guard you?

284
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:04,567
I hate this plan.

285
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,358
Dragunov better not
run off on his own

286
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:08,442
and do something stupid.

287
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:11,108
[MELIE] Are you the ones
who started this war?

288
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,525
No one said you
could speak, girl.

289
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:17,733
I haven't done anything, so how
can you justify arresting me?

290
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:20,983
If anybody's gonna be answering
questions, it's you.

291
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,608
Why don't you start by telling
me who you people are

292
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,317
and what it is
that you're after.

293
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,650
Nothing sinister.

294
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:29,233
We're only trying to find
out where Radiant is.

295
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:30,650
[LISELOTTE]
Radiant, huh?

296
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:33,733
Even the name of that
awful place is tainted.

297
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:35,317
What would you do there?

298
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,650
We'll get rid of
the Nemesis for good.

299
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,233
Once they're gone,

300
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,650
people won't have any reason to
discriminate against sorcerers.

301
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:44,067
[laughs]

302
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,817
You're not being
serious, are you?

303
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,442
Seth won't give up. Not ever.

304
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:50,817
Well, that makes him
a dangerous individual.

305
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,108
This explains
everything, honestly.

306
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:56,733
It's no wonder the general's
so intent on catching him.

307
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,525
You fought Konrad,
even though you knew

308
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:06,025
that doing so would
endanger the citizens--

309
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,817
that you might do
more harm than good.

310
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,192
[SETH]
Say what?

311
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:12,108
Doing nothing would've done
more harm than good.

312
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:14,525
That macho guy was pure evil!

313
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:17,192
[DRAGUNOV] He was, but steps
had already been taken

314
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:19,317
to stop him through
legitimate means.

315
