00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,400
[NARRATOR] After infiltrating
Caislean Merlin on orders

2
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:14,650
to capture Seth
and his companions,

3
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:18,150
Dragunov and Liselotte received
word from General Torque.

4
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:20,692
They were to attend
a clandestine meeting,

5
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:22,692
deep in the forest.

6
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:25,483
Waiting to greet them were
a group of merchant barons

7
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,817
led by Doussant himself.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,525
The truth of the conspiracy
brewing in this land

9
00:00:30,608 --> 00:00:33,650
will soon be revealed.

10
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,150
[LISELOTTE]
We finally got into the city

11
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:36,900
only to be ordered out of it.

12
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:39,400
Strange.

13
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:41,525
And I know they're
trying to be discreet,

14
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,733
but this seems like overkill.

15
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:46,983
[DRAGUNOV] These people are
either overly cautious

16
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:49,692
or up to something
truly nefarious.

17
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:53,733
Regardless, General Torque
ordered us to meet with them.

18
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:56,025
You sound reluctant, Dragunov.

19
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:58,317
I'd almost use the same word
to describe how you looked

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,150
when the general said
you were being promoted.

21
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,567
You seemed none too enthused.

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,608
I can assure you
that I was pleased.

23
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:08,942
I just don't express joy
as outwardly as most.

24
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:16,150
Ah. I'm glad you
managed to find us.

25
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:19,150
Forgive the rustic
nature of the venue.

26
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,400
I am Baron Doussant,

27
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:22,983
and you are Captains
Liselotte and Dragunov

28
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:25,150
of the Thaumaturges, yes?

29
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:02,442
[NARRATOR]
"Your Decision."

30
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:07,233
Welcome, Captain Liselotte.

31
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,775
We're always honored to speak
with the Inquisition,

32
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:13,150
but especially when they send
an emissary of your repute.

33
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,692
This goes for you as well,
Captain Dragunov.

34
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:17,692
That's enough flattery.

35
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:19,983
Why don't you state
your business?

36
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:23,692
You've the attention
of two Thaumaturges,

37
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:26,942
so you'd best have something
to say that's worth our time.

38
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:28,150
[chuckles]

39
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:30,483
Then allow me to get
directly to the point.

40
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:33,442
I invited you here to
discuss the Harmonizium.

41
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:35,275
[LISELOTTE]
And what might that be?

42
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:36,775
[DOUSSANT]
A ground-breaking device

43
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:40,942
capable of nullifying Fantasia.

44
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:43,692
The knight-sorcerers are
normally quite powerful.

45
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:46,650
But if we stripped them of
the power to use magic,

46
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:49,733
they would be quake
before the might of Bome.

47
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:51,817
What are you suggesting?

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,817
The stage is set for
an armed intervention.

49
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,525
You're asking us to
invade the continent?

50
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:00,025
This country's ruled
by the infected.

51
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:01,608
Which, from where I'm standing,

52
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:05,150
seems to make its very existence
an insult to the Inquisition.

53
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:07,233
Am I wrong in assuming
that General Torque

54
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:10,775
would like to finish the work
your Patrem Inquisitor began?

55
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:12,483
Perhaps he would.

56
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,358
With a successful campaign here,

57
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:17,275
we could restore our
damaged reputation.

58
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,692
Yes, indeed.

59
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:20,567
That little incident
at Rumble Town

60
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,358
must've hurt the
Inquisition quite a bit.

61
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:25,900
It did.

62
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,942
And I'm sure you'll exploit that
as you would anything else.

63
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:32,775
Listen, this is my humble
offer to General Torque.

64
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:34,775
This land is ripe
for the taking.

65
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,150
War could secure a wealth
of new resources for us

66
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,983
and a restoration
of dignity for you.

67
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,358
We can iron out
the details later.

68
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:47,067
Let us forge an alliance
to reshape this world.

69
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,608
You certainly are a smooth
talker, Baron Doussant.

70
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,817
Is that so?

71
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,608
Has something I've said
come off as insincere?

72
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,775
You say you want new resources.

73
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:00,983
I'd like you to be
more specific.

74
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,108
Dragunov the Lynx Eye,

75
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:04,775
I'm beginning to see
why you were brought

76
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:07,317
into General Torque's
inner circle.

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,733
Out of respect for your
piercing insight,

78
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:12,400
I'll speak the truth in full.

79
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:16,025
The true objective of this
merchant baron entente

80
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,858
is to make sorcerers hated,

81
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,567
remove them from any
place of authority,

82
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,025
and divest them of their rights

83
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:24,567
so they might be used
as our slaves.

84
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,858
[gasps]

85
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:34,775
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Ocoho,
who had learned that someone

86
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:36,900
was taking advantage
of her curse

87
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:40,650
and using her to summon Spectral
Nemeses without her knowledge,

88
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,775
went to confront
her chief suspect

89
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:45,567
and childhood friend, Mordred.

90
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:53,775
[SETH] A little while back I saw
you with Mordred in the stables.

91
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:57,025
To be honest, I thought he
was kissing you at the time,

92
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:59,400
but then your eyes went hollow.

93
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:02,692
[MORDRED]
What's up?

94
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:08,650
Oh. Hey, Ocoho.
Seems kinda late for a visit.

95
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,108
Is there something
the matter, or what?

96
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:15,025
Why don't you tell me?

97
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:18,442
Sure, come in.

98
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:30,192
What's wrong with you?
We're comrades.

99
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:32,150
Every day we fight for Cyfandir.

100
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,567
Every day we risk our lives
to protect the people here.

101
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,733
[MORDRED]
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:37,067
You've betrayed us.

103
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,233
Your country and
your fellow knights.

104
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:42,067
That's not true.
Please, just hear me out.

105
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,817
We're on the same
side, I promise.

106
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,108
Be quiet!

107
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:46,942
Foreigners are trying
to invade our country!

108
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,275
And you expect me to believe

109
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,650
those Spectral Nemeses
are protecting us somehow?

110
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,275
[MORDRED] We only use
them against people

111
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,817
who've betrayed Cyfandir.

112
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,983
Don't give me that crap!
Spectres hurt everyone!

113
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:59,358
They don't check your loyalty
before crushing you.

114
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:01,900
[MORDRED] We're doing this
to secure Merlin's legacy.

115
00:07:01,983 --> 00:07:03,650
Please just trust me.

116
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,567
I did trust you, Mordred!

117
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,692
More than anybody else.
That's why... I knew it was you.

118
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:11,567
You're the only person I told,

119
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,233
so no one else could've
used me like that.

120
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,483
Now fess up. Tell the truth.

121
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:20,567
Why did you force me to plant
those stones for you? Why?

122
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,525
I promise I only did it
to protect you, Ocoho.

123
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:27,192
Don't lie to me.
I'm done playing the fool.

124
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:29,192
[MORDRED]
I'm telling the truth.

125
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:32,650
The Faithful of the Hermit
wanted to use you more directly.

126
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:34,483
They wanted to make
you their assassin.

127
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,525
Their assassin? Against who?

128
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:39,358
[coughs]

129
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:42,483
The same people we
use the Spectres on.

130
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,525
Farmers who trade
with foreigners.

131
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:47,275
Knight-sorcerers who've
turned against Merlin.

132
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:49,692
The Faithful of the Hermit
have a long list of people

133
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:51,858
they'd like to see dead.

134
00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:53,525
But you're important to me,

135
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:55,942
so I couldn't let them
use you like that.

136
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:59,483
I convinced them to have you
summon the Spectres instead.

137
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,233
Like that's better.

138
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:03,150
And even if it is the truth,

139
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,317
I still can't believe
a thing you say.

140
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:11,192
[OCOHO]
I have to tell the queen.

141
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:13,942
She likes me. If I tell her,
she'll believe me.

142
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,108
I'm sure of it.

143
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:18,067
I wouldn't recommend
that if I were you.

144
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,317
To become a Faithful
of the Hermit,

145
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,400
a defender of the great
Merlin's legacy,

146
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:27,108
one must first swear fealty
to the queen herself.

147
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:29,817
You understand what
that means, right?

148
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,942
Please help me, Merlin.

149
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:46,483
You're the founder
of Caislean Merlin.

150
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,442
The wise guardian
of all of Cyfandir.

151
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:52,650
So please, help me
save your land.

152
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:56,025
Lend me your strength.
And your wisdom as well.

153
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:57,775
[MYR]
You know that's a rock, right?

154
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:00,233
Rocks aren't especially wise.

155
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:01,733
[OCOHO gasps]

156
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:04,233
Ah! Hey, Myr.

157
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:06,900
I know you like to pop up out of
nowhere and mess with people,

158
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:08,942
but I'm trying to pray
to Merlin right now.

159
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:11,067
Sounds pretty important.

160
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,608
So did he get turned into
a big hunk of unmoving stone

161
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:15,025
or was he always like this?

162
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:16,442
[OCOHO]
This isn't actually him.

163
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:18,817
It's obviously just
a statue that was made

164
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,483
to represent Merlin.

165
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,442
Yeah, I really didn't feel
like talking to it

167
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:27,150
but this pretty much
confirms my doubts.

00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,692
Back me up, Seth, what do
you think about this rock?

169
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:31,400
Huh?

170
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:34,567
You were in there with him?
What were you guys doing?

171
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,358
After all the time
in the forest,

172
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,150
I don't really like sleeping
in beds anymore.

173
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,900
So tired.

174
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:43,108
So how did your talk
with Marmot go?

175
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,650
You don't have to say.

176
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:52,150
We were childhood friends.

177
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,817
I remember the first time
we saw the knight-sorcerers

178
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,025
flying above us
on their dragons.

179
00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,817
They looked so cool.

180
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,358
We decided then and there
that when we grew up,

181
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:05,900
we'd become knights just like
them and protect our country.

182
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:10,400
All these years, we've worked
hard to reach our goal.

183
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:13,900
But one of the friends that
I was chasing that dream with

184
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:17,525
used the trust I put
in him against me.

185
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:19,817
And he says he did it
on orders from the queen

186
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,817
I'd hoped to serve.

187
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,900
The Ordination
Ceremony's so close.

188
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:28,317
What am I supposed to believe?

189
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,317
I feel so lost.

190
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,692
And my feet sorta carried
me here on their own.

191
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:37,067
I guess I just wonder what
Merlin would've done.

192
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,817
I'll tell you one thing.

193
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,108
That Merlin guy,

194
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:43,067
he wouldn't walk around
asking rocks for help.

195
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,733
Fair point.

196
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,608
To be honest, I'm not sure

197
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:51,525
if I'm actually fit
to defend Cyfandir.

198
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:52,483

that army of Nemeses.

Most people would've
chickened out, but not you.

You didn't get any.

You fought to protect
the people. And you won.

206

Maybe you'll become a knight.
Maybe you won't.

Either way, you've done
something to be proud of.

You can handle this. It's okay.
