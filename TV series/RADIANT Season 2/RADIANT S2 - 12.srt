00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:12,067
[NARRATOR] Seth stumbled
into a hidden chamber

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,733
in Caislean Merlin's keep.

3
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:16,067
There, he was trapped
alongside a Nemesis

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,483
within a device that projected
them both as Spectres.

5
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,525
Seth succumbed to
the monster's poison,

6
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:22,942
and then went berserk,

7
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:26,067
but was nonetheless bested
by Diabal and his allies.

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,650
After a rescue from Myr,

9
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:30,775
Seth began to train with
him in Caillte Forest.

10
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:32,900
By opening his
senses to Fantasia

11
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:34,817
and letting it connect
him to the world,

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,650
Seth conquered his
inner darkness

13
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,942
and learned to
create with magic.

14
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,900
Meanwhile, the citizens have
enjoyed a brief respite

15
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:43,650
from the Spectral Nemesis menace

16
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:47,983
as they prepare for the
Knight Ordination Ceremony.

17
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:51,233
However, this peace is
bound to be shattered.

18
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,942
For unbeknownst to the people,

19
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:56,442
a great conspiracy is
afoot in the capital.

20
00:00:56,525 --> 00:01:01,233
Cyfandir will soon add a dark
new chapter to its history.

Yes. What's the deal?

training this whole time?

If he's healed up, then yeah.

He's a wild one,

to doing something,

he always gives it his all.

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,733
[LORD DE GULIS]
Hello there. Good evening.

159
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:14,108
It's great to meet you all.

160
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:15,608
Anyway!

161
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:17,733
I understand that you only
arrived in the capital recently.

162
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:20,150
It must be quite
confusing. Fear not.

163
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,608
This shining knight's about to
show you every nook and cranny.

164
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:24,025
[MELIE growls]

165
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:26,733
I've got somewhere
to be, so move it.

166
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:27,733
[LORD DE GULIS]
My cheek.

167
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:29,900
My poor cheek--
Oh! How it hurts!

168
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:32,150
And yet my beloved has placed
her hand upon my face.

169
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:34,275
Such bliss! May it bruise
into a mark of love!

170
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,358
[TOWNSWOMAN A]
That's our charming knight!

171
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:38,233
Even when he's getting
rejected, he's fun.

172
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,775
Damn. There are too many people.

173
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:42,650
You and Mr. Boobrie
need to go on ahead.

174
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:45,108
You're small enough that he
can fly you over this crowd.

175
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,733
What? No way! Come up
with another plan.

176
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:48,983
Hey, Boobrie.

177
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:50,150
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

178
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:52,442
This is a one-time offer, okay?

179
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:54,733
If you can track down
Ocoho and Brangoire,

180
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:57,150
I'll give you the
beating of a lifetime.

181
00:08:57,233 --> 00:09:03,150
[DOC yelling]

182
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,150
Pull up! If you
keep slippin' down,

183
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:08,192
I'm gonna get a face
full of gravel, Boobrie!

184
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:11,483
Why'd you have to
bring me with you?!

185
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:23,858
[BRANGOIRE]
By Merlin!

186
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:26,733
I will ensure that you come
to regret what you've done!

187
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,192
[DOC yelling]

[DOC]
You stupid demon bird.

190
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:34,317
[BRANGOIRE]
Who are you?

191
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,567
Uh? [gasps]

192
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,692
Do you plan to stand in my way?

193
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,942
Oh! Nope! You do what you want!

194
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:41,442
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

195
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,108
Hey! Stop that!

196
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:46,442
Get away from me,
you little nuisance! [grunts]

197
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:48,108
Have at you, traitor!

198
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,317
What is this, some kind
of entrapment spell?

199
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,608
Worked it out, did you?

200
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,733
Now tell me, what
does your group want?

201
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:00,442
Why are you creating Spectres?

202
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:03,358
You used your spell
on the wrong person.

203
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:04,733
What are you saying?

204
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:07,150
Open your eyes!
Don't let her fool you!

205
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,942
She's the one who's been
causing the Spectres to appear!

206
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,858
She's betrayed us!

207

[ALL gasp]

208
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:16,692
Wait, Seth?

209
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:34,067
Wait a second. Where did
you even come from?

210
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,900
Ya know, Seth, this may
well be the first time

211
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:37,983
I've been sincerely
happy to see ya!

212
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:40,108
This isn't really the best
time to chat, you guys.

213
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:42,025
Now get up!

214
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,108
[SETH] What the heck's
going on with her?

215
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:47,692
Doesn't look like
she's gonna hold back.

216

[DOC yelps]

217
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:58,400
It's me, Ocoho.
I'm your friend, remember?

218
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:04,233
Crap, she's seriously
tryin' to kill us!

219
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:06,275
Hey! Lemme in there, big guy!
Make some room!

220
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:08,858
Let me out of here
so I can fight!

221

[SETH]
That's enough!

224
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:28,817
Talk to us, Ocoho.

225
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,233
Why are you acting
all crazy right now?

226
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:39,233
[SETH] Those eyes.
I've seen them before.

227
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:40,525
[BRANGOIRE]
It's no use.

228
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:41,817
If she won't surrender,
then I will---

229
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,025
Just hold on!

230
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:44,567
We still don't know
the entire story yet.

231
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,525
I know more than enough!
That traitor has planted a stone

232
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,567
that will make a Spectral
Nemesis appear!

233

[DOC gasps]

236
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,317
[BRANGOIRE]
I finally caught her red-handed,

237
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,233
but you got in the way! [growls]

238
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:02,775
In the name of great Merlin,
I won't let her escape!

239
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:07,692
[DOC] So Ocoho was
gonna make a Spectre?

[DOC gasps]

been playing us all

entire time? No way.

Look, Melie.

244
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:17,900
We need to catch her
before Lord Brangoire!

00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:19,108
Huh?

246

normal self right now!

[MELIE]
What does that mean?

248
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:25,108
Do you think she's
being controlled?

249
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:26,567
I've got no idea.

250
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,983
[MELIE]
Great.

251
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:29,108
It doesn't matter.

252
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:30,525
You just keep track
of Lord Brangoire.

253
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:31,608
I'll take care of the rest!

254
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:32,983
You don't honestly
think that you can

255
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:34,817
get ahead of us on foot, do you?

256
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,025
Stop acting stupid
and get on the broom.

[FARMER D]
Look there.

00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:03,108
Flying just above the
road to the castle.

265
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:04,817
It looks like...

266
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:08,733
That's the Dullahan,
there's no doubting it!

267
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:11,108
Its head isn't attached
to its shoulders, you see?

268
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:13,983
What could the Headless Fairy
be doing on my land?

--We better run for it!
--Oh, no.

270
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,483
Wherever the
Dullahan is sighted,

271
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,942
a Spectral Nemesis
appears not long after!

272
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:21,442
Oh, no!

273
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:23,483
Merlin's angry with us for
taking gold from a foreigner--

274
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,858
He's sent his harbinger of
vengeance to punish us!

275
00:13:25,942 --> 00:13:29,233
I knew I should've turned
that merchant baron away!

276
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:43,567
[SETH]
This is Caillte Forest, so...

00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,900
Aha!

278
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:54,317
There. I gotcha!

279
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,192
Ocoho, why are you acting
so weird right now?

280
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,525
You've never been this quiet,

281
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:01,858
and you've never been
so friggin' murdery!

Damn it. Stop fighting me!
Just calm down, will ya?

283
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:11,442
Oh. Uh. That was
easier than expected.

284

[BRANGOIRE] Well done, boy!
Don't let her go!

You've been caught
in the act, traitor.

286

I finally have the proof
I need to expose you

here, too, Melie?

your arm around my neck?

Come on, guys.
You're really scaring me now.

296
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:40,733
What's going on here?
Talk to me, I'm freaking out!

297
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,983
Do you seriously
think I'm a traitor?

298
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:48,317
Well, that isn't true.

299
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,192
I would never turn against
my country, I promise!

300
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:53,525
[BRANGOIRE] You lie.
I just watched you try to

301
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:56,608
plant a stone that
would've seeded a Spectre.

302
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:57,858
[OCOHO]
I don't know what you saw,

303
00:14:57,942 --> 00:14:59,442
but I would never do that!

304
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,192
What do you make of all this?

305
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,817
I got nothin'.

306
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,317
Although I feel like
Ocoho's telling the truth.

307
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,525
[BRANGOIRE] Don't be fooled.
I've been watching her for days.

308
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:11,983
I know that she's guilty!

309
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:15,358
[gasps] Sounds like you've
suspected her for some time.

310
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:16,567
I was more or less certain

311
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,983
that she was at
least up to something.

312
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:22,317
The girl has always been
willful and disobedient.

313
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,400
And when the queen spoke to us
about the Spectral Nemeses,

314
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:29,192
I saw her react strangely.

315
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:30,942
Now, put out your arms.

316
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:33,775
Huh? I'm telling
the truth, I swear!

317
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:36,108
You wanna be sure you
get this right, don't ya?

318
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:37,525
Well, then let her
explain herself.

319
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:38,692
Why do you defend someone

320
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:40,817
who attacked you
both without remorse?

321
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,858
[SETH] 'Cause things aren't
always what they seem.

322
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,525
I was suspicious of you before.

323
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:45,900
What? Why would you be?

324
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:47,900
[SETH] When I got back
from the forest today,

325
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:49,608
I saw you following Ocoho.

326
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:53,192
You were acting super creepy,
so I kept an eye on you.

327
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:55,317
I thought you might be
with the conspirators.

328
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,650
[MELIE] Hold on. If you were
back in town that early,

329
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,108
then you should've let us know!

330
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,608
[SETH]
Oh, yeah, I know. Sorry.

331
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,067
[OCOHO]
If you saw me burying

332
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,733
some kind of
Spectre-summoning stone,

333
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:07,900
then that must be what I did.

334
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,900
Yeah? Okay.

335
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,775
I'm gonna show you something.

336
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:15,275
It should explain how
this happened, 'kay?

337
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:16,775
[BOTH gasp]

338
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:18,650
You see this mark?

339
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,525
Whenever someone presses on it,

340
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:23,817
I'm forced to do
whatever they tell me to.

341
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,067
And afterwards, I lose
all memory of what happened.

342
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,192
That sounds like a pretty
terrible infection to have.

343
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,442
[OCOHO]
It is.

344
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,108
I'm a little bit confused.

345
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:37,358
[MELIE] She's saying someone
used her to do all this.

346
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:38,775
Damn it.

347
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:44,192
[OCOHO gasps]

348
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:47,108
Use this blade to
take your own life.

349
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,442
--[MELIE gasps]
--No, don't!

350
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,025
Now stop.

351
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:57,400
What happened? Am I--?

352
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,942
[BRANGOIRE]
It seems she told the truth.

353
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:02,900
Hey, Ocoho. Is there anyone
else that you've told?

354
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:04,358
Because if you have, then...

355
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:06,108
[OCOHO]
There isn't.

356
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,942
[BRANGOIRE] You see,
that's the law in this nation.

357
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:12,525
Everyone must keep their
curse secret if they can.

358
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:14,692
So if we figure out who
knows about her mark,

359
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:17,567
that'll tell us who's really
behind these Spectre attacks.

360
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,942
I told ya, Lord Brangoire,

361
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,858
it wasn't actually
Ocoho after all!

362
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:26,567
[BRANGOIRE] Ocoho.
Return to the castle for now.

363
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,192
Stick to your usual routine

364
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,817
until I can figure out
who's at fault here.

365
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,942
Wait, does this mean
you're letting me go?

366
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:34,525
I don't have much of a choice.

367
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:36,692
The culprits can't know
that I'm onto them.

368
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:39,025
[MELIE] Kinda seems like
you wanna use her as bait.

369
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,983
I'll do what it takes
to stop the traitors.

370
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:43,358
For the record, Ocoho.

371
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:46,317
I intend to keep the
secret of your infection.

372
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,317
[MELIE, SETH sigh]

373
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,817
[BRANGOIRE]
That said.

374
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,400
Someone who can be so
easily turned into a puppet

375
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:57,067
by the enemies of the crown
has no place in the order.

376
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,317
Know that I'll oppose
your ordination.

377
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,692
[SETH gasps]

378
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,317
I'm sorry, Ocoho.

379
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,692
Let us know if there's
anything we can do to help you.

380
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:15,858
Yeah, like givin' that guy
a swift kick in the ass.

381
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:18,567
[SETH]
So, what should we do?

382
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,150
[OCOHO]
I need to talk to Mordred.

383
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:22,983
[SETH, MELIE gasp]

384
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,233
He's always helped me

385
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:26,733
and defended me
when I screwed up.

386
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:29,025
There's something I need
to find out from him.

387
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,150
Uh. I don't get where
this is coming from.

388
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:34,942
But I think I might.

389
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:36,275
A little while back,

390
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:39,192
I saw you with him
in the stables.

391
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:43,650
To be honest, I thought he was
kissing you at the time. Heh.

392
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,733
But then your eyes went hollow.

393
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:48,858
They looked just like
they did earlier tonight.

394
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,233
How could you leave a
helpless kid like me alone

395
00:18:56,317 --> 00:18:57,733
in a dangerous place like that?

396
00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:59,692
You weren't alone,
you had Boobrie with you!

397
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:01,775
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirping]

398
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:04,108
I know that I've caused
a lot of trouble for you guys

399
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:05,275
and I'm sorry.

400
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:06,858
Nah, don't worry about it.

401
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:08,400
Me and Seth make
lots of trouble.

402
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:11,525
It's true. Chaos does
follow them everywhere.

403
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,275
So about this stone...

404
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:15,692
There's a whole lot of
Fantasia packed into it.

405
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:17,400
[DOC]
I guess there would have to be

406
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:20,692
for it to create one of those
enormous projections.

407
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:22,275
[SETH]
It's really weird though.

408
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:26,317
The imprint on this Fantasia is
pretty much the same as mine.

409
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,858
[DOC, MELIE]
Huh?

410
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:29,317
Diabal.

411
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,067
[MELIE]
Don't think I know that name.

412
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,067
He's the guy I fought
beneath the castle.

413
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,025
He's just like me.
I need to find him again.

414
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:38,358
[BOTH]
Hm?

415
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:40,692
But there's no way to get
past the castle guards.

416
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:42,317
Actually, there is a way.

417
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,858
Seth could wait until the day
of the Ordination Ceremony

418
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:46,317
and sneak in then.

419
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
[OTHERS]
Huh?

420
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:48,983
With all the public
events going on,

421
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,817
the guards'll be
spread pretty thin.

422
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,525
That works out for me.

423
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,025
Yeah, it ought to.

424
00:19:54,108 --> 00:19:56,817
I used to sneak into the castle
that way when I was a kid.

425
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,150
Me and my best friends, too.

426
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:03,567
I'll track down Mordred
and make him talk.

427
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,192
[SETH] Hey, Ocoho,
I've got faith in you.

428
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:11,067
If Mold-raid tries to touch
your neck, you'll beat him down.

429
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,942
He only got you before because
you weren't expecting it.

430
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:17,567
That curse doesn't define you.
You're a top knight-candidate.

431
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,317
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

432
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
If you need any help,

433
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:23,983
then just say the word
and we'll come!

[NARRATOR]
Dragunov and Liselotte

436
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:41,233
successfully infiltrated
Caislean Merlin.

437
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:43,358
But now, having
secretly received

438
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,358
new orders from General Torque,

439
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:49,233
they are on their way
to a remote location.

440
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:50,733
[LISELOTTE]
We finally got into the city

441
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,567
only to be ordered out of it.

442
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,025
Strange.

443
00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:57,150
And I know they're
trying to be discreet,

444
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:59,358
but this seems like overkill.

445
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,650
[DRAGUNOV] These people
are either overly cautious

446
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:05,358
or up to something
truly nefarious.

447
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:09,442
Regardless, General Torque
ordered us to meet with them.

448
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,733
You sound reluctant, Dragunov.

449
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,442
I'd almost use the
same word to describe

450
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:14,858
how you looked when
the General said

451
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,858
that you were being promoted.

452
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,275
You seemed none too enthused.

453
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,358
I can assure you
that I was pleased.

454
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:24,192
I just don't express joy
as outwardly as most.

455
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:25,525
You say that,

456
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:27,192
but the smile you gave when
the general ordered us

457
00:21:27,275 --> 00:21:31,442
to look for that horned sorcerer
tells me a different tale.

458
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:33,483
This is where you tell me
whatever you're hiding

459
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,317
and then assure me that
when the time comes,

460
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,442
I can trust that you will follow
the orders you've been given.

461
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:40,983
[DRAGUNOV sighs]

00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,733
[DRAGUNOV]
All right, fine. I'll confess.

00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:48,608
But please promise that you'll
keep this between the two of us.

464
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:51,775
I do have an ulterior motive.

465
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:55,233
I see this mission as my chance
to get closer to someone.

466
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:56,942
How's it going so far?

00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,608
Wait, you...

It seems that we've arrived.

469
00:22:18,942 --> 00:22:22,192
Welcome, friends, I hope you
didn't have trouble finding us.

470
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:25,192
Forgive the rustic
nature of the venue.

471
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:26,483
I am Baron Doussant,

472
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:29,025
and you are Captains
Liselotte and Dragunov

473
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:31,150
of the Thaumaturges, yes?

474
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:12,317
[NARRATOR] Ocoho interrogates
her close friend Mordred.

475
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,442
Why did he use her as he did?

476
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,358
What is his is true ambition?

477
00:24:16,442 --> 00:24:17,983
Who are the
"Faithful of the Hermit"

478
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:20,400
scheming in the bowels
of the capital?

479
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:21,983
Who can she trust?

480
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:24,192
On the day of the
Ordination Ceremony,

481
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:26,317
Ocoho gives the
queen some advice

482
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,067
in the hopes of bringing
the truth to light.

483
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,692
Next time on <i>Radiant</i> ,

484
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:32,608
"Your Decision."
