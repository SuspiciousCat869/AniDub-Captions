1
00:00:10,025 --> 00:00:12,692
[NARRATOR] Seth tried to sneak
into the Castle Archives,

2
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:16,192
but was noticed and forced to
flee into a secret passage.

3
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:20,775
There, a terrified man trapped
him with a mysterious device.

4
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:23,817
Elsewhere, the knight-sorcerers
prepared to confront

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,650
a pair of Spectral Nemeses that
had appeared in the countryside.

6
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,775
They move out to
defeat the monsters,

7
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:31,150
but as they draw near,

8
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,775
Ocoho and Melie are
shocked by what they see.

9
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:38,442
One of these so-called Nemeses
looks exactly like Seth.

10
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,942
[gasps]

11
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:48,775
[MELIE]
Ah!

12
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:49,817
[BOTH]
That's Seth!

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,525
Huh?!

14
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:56,567
[SETH grunting]

15
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:37,942
[NARRATOR]
"The Spectre Battle."

16
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,025
[FARMERS chattering]

17
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:47,400
[FARMER A]
Look. It froze in mid-air!

18
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:49,483
The great Merlin must
be protecting us!

19
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:50,983
This is our chance to flee.

20
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,650
Hold on. What's that over there?

21
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,067
[FARMER A gasps]

22
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,400
[FARMER B]
The knight-sorcerers are here!

23
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,692
So there really are two
of them this time.

24
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:02,192
We'll kill the abnormal first.

25
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:04,025
Defense Squad,
you set up a perimeter

26
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:05,983
and bind it with Cyfyngu.

27
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,525
The rest of you
prepare yourselves

28
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:09,317
to launch an all-out offensive.

29
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,025
With any luck, we'll
bring this one down

30
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,358
before the other can react,

31
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,567
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Sir!

32
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,900
Now, time to harmonize
our minds with Gys--

33
00:03:15,983 --> 00:03:17,358
[OCOHO]
Wait!

34
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:18,942
Don't attack it, sir!

35
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:22,067
This Spectre isn't
really an enemy!

36
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,525
[BRANGOIRE]
That's nonsense!

37
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:25,067
[OCOHO] I know this sounds
crazy, but we know that guy!

38
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,942
[MELIE] We need to wait and
figure out what's going on!

39
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:28,775
[BRANGOIRE]
Silence!

40
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:32,233
First of all, I'm in command, so
I give the orders, understood?

41
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:34,358
Second of--uhh... Well, ya see.

42
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:36,858
There's a whole list
of reasons, really.

43
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:38,692
This is just unacceptable!

44
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:40,358
I'm begging you, sir.
Please listen--

45
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:43,108
[BRANGOIRE] Enough! I'm
relieving both of you of duty!

46
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,608
Return to the castle.
You'll be dealt with later.

47
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,192
Why won't you hear us out?

48
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:49,775
Time to begin.
Everyone harmonize!

49
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:50,817
Gysoni!

50
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,442
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Gysoni!

51
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:55,983
You have to stop.

52
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:59,608
I know how it looks,
but that's a human being!

53
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:15,692
[SETH]
Poison's spreading...

54
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:20,608
This keeps up...
and I'm done for.

55
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:33,067
[SETH] I have... to get
out of here somehow.

56
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:40,733
[SETH]
It only reacts to movement.

57
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:42,900
So I guess...

58
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,233
[chuckles]

59
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:46,650
[SETH]
Hey, boneface!

60
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,817
You with the pointy wiener arms.

61
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,733
Ya scared, or what?

62
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:52,858
Come finish what you started.

63
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,567
[ALL gasp]

64
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,900
[KNIGHT-SORCERER A] One of the
Spectres attacked the other!

65
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,233
It got Seth.

66
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:16,983
[SETH] My finishing move.
Tentacle Lock!

67
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,192
[chuckles]

68
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,983
[SETH]
I barely have any feeling left.

69
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:29,400
I gotta get out of here fast.

70
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:33,275
That tube up there,
it isn't being projected.

71
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:36,233
That must mean it's out
of the spell's range.

72
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:39,233
So if I can jump high enough...

73
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:44,567
[SETH]
I'm falling. I'm too weak.

74
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,233
No! I'm not gonna let
myself die down here!

75
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:49,817
[SETH yells]

76
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:06,692
[DIABAL]
He escaped!

77
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:09,150
No. We have to finish him!

78
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:12,108
[SHADOW A] What are you
so afraid of, Diabal?

79
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:14,775
He's already on
death's doorstep.

80
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:21,692
[SETH]
I can't die. Not yet.

81
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:26,900
[gasps]

82
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:32,067
[BRANGOIRE]
The Spectres disappeared.

83
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,067
[KNIGHT-SORCERER B]
Yeah, but how?

84
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,817
None of us attacked them.

85
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,983
[KNIGHT-SORCERER C]
It's a miracle, it must be.

86
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:40,650
We were rescued by
the great Merlin himself!

87
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,858
Now listen here! We still
need to remain vigilant!

88
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:45,942
For all we know,
those Spectral Nemeses

89
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:47,400
could return at any moment!

90
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:49,442
I want the Defense Squad
and the vanguard

91
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:51,858
to stay here with me in
case that should happen.

92
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:53,400
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Yes, sir!

93
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:55,858
The rest of you should return
to the castle and stand by.

94
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:56,983
[KNIGHT-SORCERER D]
Lord Brangoire!

95
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,275
What now?

96
00:06:58,358 --> 00:06:59,858
[KNIGHT-SORCERER D]
A few of our comrades

97
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:02,067
were knocked off their mounts
while fighting the Spectrals!

98
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,483
Huh?

99
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,150
They vanished into thin air.

100
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:08,233
It's as if they'd never
been there to begin with.

101
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:10,858
Uh. Hey, is something wrong?

102
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:12,775
Seth and I used
to travel together.

103
00:07:12,858 --> 00:07:14,150
Yeah?

104
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,858
And I think we developed
some kind of Fantasia bond.

105
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:20,192
But I never noticed until just
now when I felt it break.

106
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:21,567
Huh?

107
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:30,692
There are two men laid
out in that clearing.

108
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:32,275
[LISELOTTE]
Knight-sorcerers.

109
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:33,817
[DRAGUNOV]
Yes.

110
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,400
They must've fallen during the
battle with that apparition.

111
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:38,108
Then they're probably dead.

112
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:39,233
Don't you think we should focus

113
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:41,858
on tracking down
the horned sorcerer?

114
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:54,775
[DRAGUNOV] As I thought.
They're still alive.

115
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:57,150
Someone caught them
and set them down here.

116
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:58,733
Who would do that?

117
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:00,567
[DRAGUNOV]
Shh...

118
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,775
A bandage-covered sorcerer.

119
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:10,983
Like the one who was
seen in Rumble Town.

120
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,150
The very same.

121
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,900
One of the horned boy's allies?

122
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:16,192
Yes, almost certainly.

123
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:30,442
[DRAGUNOV, LISELOTTE]
O Patrem Inquisitor

124
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:32,900
bringer of miracles.

125
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:35,525
May your judgement
cleave through the wicked.

126
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:38,858
May your piercing justice
negate all distance.

127
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:45,442
[GRIMM] Two Thaumaturges.
This will be less than pleasant.

128
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:06,775
[GRIMM]
These blades are relentless.

129
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:09,650
If this tree were not here
to protect Grimm's back,

130
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:13,067
they would surely
cut Grimm down.

131
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,650
If the other one were
to unleash his miracle,

132
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:18,400
Grimm would have no choice
but to go on the offensive.

133
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:21,275
But for some reason,
he seems hesitant.

134
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:27,358
What're you waiting for,
Dragunov? Hurry up and shoot!

135
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,442
[DRAGUNOV] We're to capture
the horned sorcerer's allies

136
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:32,400
dead or alive, but I was
told that this man

137
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:35,650
saved many lives in Rumble Town.

138
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:36,942
You won't escape from us,

139
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:38,942
but surrender and
we'll spare you!

140
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:40,608
Huh?

141
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:42,025
[GRIMM]
Nube!

142
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:44,608
[gasps]

143
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,733
Don't let the shadows
get too close.

144
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:56,067
There's a chance that the
sorcerer's hiding inside one,

145
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,317
waiting for the time to strike.

146
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,025
He disappeared.

147
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:07,608
Smart. He left some
distractions and fled.

148
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:08,400
There he is!

149
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,483
[gasps]

150
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,025
[GRIMM] A man of his skill
should've been able

151
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:15,275
to hit Grimm.

152
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:17,567
Why would he miss on purpose?

153
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:22,233
[DRAGUNOV]
Don't be stupid. Surrender.

154
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:25,608
[GRIMM] So he can teleport to
wherever his arrows land.

155
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:30,192
[GRIMM]
No choice.

156
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:32,775
Grimm will have to
make some sacrifices.

157
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,233
[LISELOTTE gasps]

158
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,692
I see that you finally
decided to shoot at him.

159
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:54,525
I did.

160
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,692
Well, you waited
too long to do so.

161
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:59,233
Now who knows
where he's fled to.

162
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:16,067
[GRIMM groaning]

163
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,442
[GRIMM]
So much blood.

164
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:28,358
So much precious blood.

165
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:41,275
[GRIMM]
Leogon!

166
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:44,733
You are never to lay a hand
on Grimm. Understand?

167
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:49,025
[LEOGON] Of course. I am never
to lay a hand on Master Grimm.

168
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,025
[GRIMM] That's right.
There are no exceptions to this.

169
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:55,067
No exceptions.
I understand, Master.

170
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,858
But, so you know,

171
00:11:56,942 --> 00:12:01,525
I was only trying to be as
faithful a servant as possible.

172
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:04,108
I saw that you
were hurting, so...

173
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:06,858
...I thought I'd help
by removing the stick

174
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:08,733
in your shoulder.

175
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:17,608
[GRIMM] Grimm does not
get hurt. You know that.

176
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:20,483
Retrieve the blood
from the floor at once.

177
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:24,275
Don't give it time to coagulate.

178
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:27,900
Once you have it all,
collect it in one of these.

179
00:12:27,983 --> 00:12:31,067
Don't spill a single
drop. If you do...

180
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,650
...then Master Grimm
will become very angry.

181
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,192
[GRIMM]
That's right.

182
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:40,275
When you're done with that,
prepare a large amount of food.

183
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:41,525
Why do we need it for?

184
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:44,900
Will I be entertaining
more visitors for you?

185
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:46,400
[GRIMM]
No.

186
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:48,650
Grimm was forced to seal
the other side of the portal

187
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,192
he came through,

188
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:54,025
so to get back to Cyfandir,
he'll have to go the long way.

189
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,025
[GRIMM] First, Grimm must
traverse the Crossroads,

190
00:12:58,108 --> 00:12:59,983
stopping at Cape Valky.

191
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:02,233
Then Grimm will head
up Lower Cyfandir

192
00:13:02,317 --> 00:13:04,442
and fly over Triskelion Bae.

193
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:05,942
[LEOGON]
Uh, Master.

194
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,567
May I go to the surface
with you this time?

195
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,150
[GRIMM]
Never.

196
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:13,733
[GRIMM]
Stop that. Smile.

197
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,275
[GRIMM]
Yes. That's better.

198
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:20,608
It's your duty to
stay right here.

199
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:23,275
[LEOGON] To entertain Master
Grimm's guests, yes.

200
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:25,733
And to look after you-know-who.

201
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:27,233
[GRIMM]
Fail to do so

202
00:13:27,317 --> 00:13:30,233
and there will be no
cause to keep you alive.

203
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:36,817
[GRIMM] Tend to your lip
when you finish your work.

204
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,317
[LEOGON]
Uh. Oh. Thank you, Master!

205
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:44,692
[GRIMM]
Good luck, Seth.

206
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:47,942
Grimm cannot save you from
your current predicament.

207
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:50,983
Nor from the Thaumaturges
that pursue you.

208
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,483
[SHADOW B]
He's drawn his last breath.

209
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,608
[SHADOW A]
The poison finally took him.

210
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:05,108
I wonder though,
just who was this boy?

211
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,650
And how did he find
his way in here?

212
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:19,442
[SETH] It's strange. I can't
feel anything now.

213
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,733
So then, am I about to die?

214
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,733
But I haven't found Radiant yet,

215
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:27,067
and I haven't changed
the world at all.

216
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,983
If this is how I die,

217
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:31,525
what was the point of
everything I've done?

218
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:35,442
[SETH]
I was bullied. Tied up.

219
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,567
They thought I was a monster.

220
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,942
They wanted to burn me.

221
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,983
But Alma saved me.

222
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:44,733
She's the reason
I made it this far.

223
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,942
[SETH] We stayed in Pompo
Hills for a while.

224
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:51,317
That's where I battled
my first Nemesis.

225
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,483
It beat me to a pulp.

226
00:14:56,275 --> 00:15:00,567
[SETH] A band of sorcerers
showed up just in time to help,

227
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,358
then betrayed me.

228
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:07,900
[SETH]
But still, I got up.

229
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:11,775
Because I wanted to prove that
sorcerers weren't all bad.

230
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:20,067
[SETH] The townsfolk saw things
a little differently after that.

231
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,817
And I did, too.

232
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:27,192
[SETH] So when Alma
told me about Radiant,

233
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:29,608
I left Pompo Hills behind.

234
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,858
[SETH] And was immediately
captured by the Inquisition.

235
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:41,025
[SETH] But that's how
I met Doc and Melie.

236
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,233
So I'm glad it happened.

237
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:48,692
[SETH]
We escaped and fled to Artemis.

238
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:52,942
But Master Lord Majesty was
part king and part loan shark.

239
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:58,900
[SETH] We got into a whole
lot of trouble there.

240
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:04,775
[SETH]
Still, they were good times.

241
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:09,733
And thanks to Yaga's training,
I got way stronger.

242
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:15,900
After that, we accepted
a job in Rumble Town.

243
00:16:15,983 --> 00:16:20,150
That's where we met Taj
and the rest of his family.

244
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:29,192
[SETH]
Then the riots began.

245
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:37,858
[SETH]
I fought Konrad and I beat him.

246
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,525
[SETH] Hameline's Nemeses
knocked me down

247
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:58,567
from the clocktower,

248
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,608
but instead of falling,
I ended up inside,

249
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:04,733
with a man who claimed
to be my brother.

250
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,733
[SETH] Once I made it back up,
I fought Hameline.

251
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,692
[SETH] She wasn't what they
called her any more than I was.

252
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:29,275
I finally got through to her.

253
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:32,608
But then the Inquisiton came.

254
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:36,900
She fought to buy me
time, and she was--

255
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:45,858
[SETH] When she fell,
I was consumed with rage.

256
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:50,400
I wasted her sacrifice.

257
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,608
And after I was beaten,

258
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:58,358
despite my promise to Alma,
I became a monster.

259
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:13,233
[SETH] I haven't felt like
myself since it happened.

260
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:17,567
Terrified that I'd end up
hurting someone, I ran.

261
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,567
Left my friends far behind.

262
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:23,567
[SETH]
But...

263
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,525
[SETH]
...that backfired.

264
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,108
I ended up hurting Melie anyway.

265
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,650
[SETH] I wanted to make
things right with her.

266
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:51,233
But after the first time we
talked, I kinda gave up.

267
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:55,358
And now that I'm here,
I'll never get to.

268
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:56,942
[gasps]

269
00:18:57,025 --> 00:18:59,400
[SETH]
What's this?

270
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:03,150
A black eye? Is it a
part of me, too, or--?

271
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:09,817
[SETH]
Hey! What have you done?

272
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,442
Let me outta here now!

273
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,817
Are you the thing that
took control of me

274
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,567
when I fought the Thaumaturges?

275
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,608
No. Not again.

276
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,608
You can't. Please!

277
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:24,358
Help me. Somebody help me!

278
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:26,983
[MYR]
Hm?

279
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:29,942
[gasps]

280
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:32,942
That was Seth.

281
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,317
[MELIE]
I'm sure of it.

282
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,108
I heard Seth cry out
for help just now.

283
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:41,442
But no else noticed.
Was it just in my head?

284
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,317
Did you hear that, too?

285
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,150
Yeah.

286
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,400
Well then, let's hurry back!

287
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:47,317
Pretty sure it came
from the castle!

288
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,650
Got it!

289
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:51,275
[MELIE]
Seth.

290
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,150
[SHADOW A] Let's toss his
corpse into the water.

291
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,567
The current is strong.

292
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,942
It will carry him all
the way to Mor Niwlog.

293
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:08,108
[SHADOW B] Wait. Parts of
his skin are turning black.

294
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:10,317
[SHADOW A] Ah. It's probably
from the Nemesis poison.

295
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,608
No! Get away!

296
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:16,275
I'm serious! We need to get
ready to defend ourselves!

297
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:35,442
[SETH snarling]

298
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:40,775
[SHADOW A]
What the--?

299
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:43,858
Where did that tremendous
surge of power come from?

300
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,858
Stay back! Get away from me!

301
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:04,692
[yells]

302
00:21:04,775 --> 00:21:06,942
Help! Take him down!

303
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:08,317
[SETH yells]

304
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:12,233
[SHADOW B]
Glaw!

305
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,650
[SHADOW B]
Sciath!

306
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:22,817
[SHADOW A]
Cónra!

307
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:27,108
[SHADOW A]
We'll finish him together.

308
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:28,233
[SHADOW B]
Right!

309
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:29,650
[SHADOWS]
Glaw!

310
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:37,025
Don't stop firing!

311
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:38,817
We can't give him any openings!

312
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,733
[SHADOW A]
Calm yourself, Diabal.

313
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,733
There's no chance
he survived that.

314
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:45,442
The boy was just struck
with enough force

315
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:47,733
to tear apart a small army.

316
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:48,775
[growls]

317
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:49,942
[BOTH gasp]

318
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,358
Begone from this place.

319
00:22:04,608 --> 00:22:08,233
[MYR] I told him the castle
was a place to be avoided.

320
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:10,275
Excellent. He came to meet me.

321
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:11,400
[chuckles]

322
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:19,400
[MYR]
Hmm...

323
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:25,400
[MYR]
This is quite serious.

324
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:26,817
I'm sorry, my friend,

325
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,650
but I fear your wounds are
beyond my power to treat.

326
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:34,233
Hmm... Though I do know
someone who can help you.

327
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:36,733
Let's hope she's cooled down.

328
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:11,650
[NARRATOR] As Melie and
Ocoho follow Seth's trail,

329
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:14,025
they're forced to enter
Caillte's Forest,

330
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:17,233
from which it is said
that none can escape.

331
00:24:17,317 --> 00:24:20,817
In this mystical place where
time and space are distorted,

332
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,567
Seth is deep in slumber.

333
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,608
His poisoned body's
only hope of recovery

334
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:29,067
is the beautiful sylvan
who Myr calls his wife.

335
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,650
Next time on <i>Radiant</i> ,

336
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:33,608
"Seth in the Forest of Time."
