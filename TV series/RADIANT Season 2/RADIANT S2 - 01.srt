1
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:27,525
There it is. The Spectral
Nemesis we're after.

2
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:30,108
Stay in formation no
matter what happens!

3
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,567
And keep your distance from
the castle, all of you!

4
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,817
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

5
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,942
All right, let's begin
this battle together.

6
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:37,233
Gysoni!

7
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:38,942
[SOLDIERS]
Gysoni!

8
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:50,525
[NARRATOR] The city of
the knight-sorcerers,

9
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:52,775
Caislean Merlin.

10
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:56,317
The city has been besieged as
of late by mysterious monsters

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,525
known as Spectral Nemeses.

12
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:02,525
These Nemeses appear not
from eggs, but from thin air.

13
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:04,983
Some of the most ancient
secrets of magic

14
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:06,942
are said to be kept
in this city.

15
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,942
And it's where Seth's next
adventure will begin.

16
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,442
[NARRATOR]
"Toward a New Adventure"

17
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:51,733
[NARRATOR]
Seth defeated Konrad

18
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:54,150
and thwarted his schemes
for Rumble Town,

19
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,525
saving countless lives
and setting the town

20
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:58,733
on a course toward tolerance.

21
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:00,733
This was a good deed to be sure,

22
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:03,692
but it brought him
no closer to his goal.

23
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:06,775
Seth seeks to solve
the mystery of Radiant,

24
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:08,483
the source of all Nemeses,

25
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:11,275
and cause of much
human conflict.

26
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,525
As Seth continues his quest
for the secrets of Radiant,

27
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:18,108
he will also learn of the
secrets within himself.

28
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:28,358
[stomach growls]

29
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,775
[sighs]

30
00:03:29,858 --> 00:03:32,150
It's Caislean Merlin or bust.

31
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,317
Yaga said I might find out
about Radiant there,

32
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,067
and that's the only
lead I've got.

33
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,400
I'll hop in here, find what I
need, and hop right back out!

34
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:46,108
Sure is nice to be home
after all this time.

35
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,983
[thud]

36
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,692
[ALMA]
So, you're back.

37
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:52,317
Uh. Yeah.

38
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,358
[DON BOSSMAN, JIJI gasp]

39
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,858
Huh?!

40
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:57,650
[DON BOSSMAN] Man, the air
really does start to get stale

41
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:00,858
in there after a while,
doesn't it, Jiji?

42
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,108
What's it gonna
take for you guys

43
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:03,900
to learn your friggin' lesson?

44
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:07,108
Hey! Great to see ya,
kid! It's been a while!

45
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:10,317
Be careful, Alma!
We're under attack!

46
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,150
Those are my assistants you
just punched, ya stupid dolt!

47
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,817
[SETH]
Why would you hire them?!

48
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,108
Maybe this is how they
show affection here, Jiji!

49
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,525
[DON BOSSMAN crying]

50
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,317
[DON BOSSMAN]
Lady Alma told us we needed

51
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,817
to hide from the locals,

52
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,858
so we sealed ourselves in those
barrels and stayed quiet.

53
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:28,942
How could he just attack
us out of nowhere?

54
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,858
On the plus side,
you were great hiders.

55
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:32,358
[SETH]
Hey!

56
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:35,483
Will someone please explain
to me what's goin' on here?

57
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,150
[DON BOSSMAN laughs]

58
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:40,275
Sorry if our sudden appearance
gave you a scare.

59
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,608
Yeah. Whatever. Why
are you here though?

60
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:44,400
Before we answer any
questions you have,

61
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,192
why don't we start over?

62
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:50,483
Let's hit him with intro
formation number 12, Jiji!

63
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,317
We are known as
the Bravery Duet!

64
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,483
Damn it, Jiji!

65
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,275
I said we were doing
formation number 12!

66
00:04:57,358 --> 00:04:59,525
So why are you doing
formation 21?

67
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:01,442
You screwed it up
like you always do!

68
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:03,608
Now we're a laughingstock
'cause of you!

69
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:05,400
So you're a duet now, huh?

70
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:07,900
What happened to the other
clowns you ran with?

71
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:10,358
Well, long story short,

72
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:13,733
we got separated after
we fled from Artemis.

73
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,733
I wonder what they're
up to right now.

74
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,317
[SETH]
Huh?

75
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,817
In case this still isn't clear,
these two're allowed to be here,

76
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,817
they work for me.

77
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,650
Huh?!

78
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:25,817
Did you forget about how

79
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,983
they robbed all those
villagers before?

80
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:31,233
And I even caught them stealing
treasure from Artemis, too!

81
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:32,150
[ALMA]
I know.

82
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,858
[SETH]
Then why let them stay?

83
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:36,275
[laughing]

84
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:38,525
How 'bout I fill you in?

85
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:40,775
After Jiji and I
escaped Artemis,

86
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:43,525
we tried to lay low
on a deserted island.

87
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:47,317
We were hoping to give our
wounds time to heal there.

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,733
But it was infested
by the Nemesis!

89
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,442
Huh. 'Kay.

90
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:53,317
[DON BOSSMAN] We'd lost our
weapons, our brooms,

91
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,567
our underpants!

92
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,692
It seemed that was
the end for us!

93
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:59,192
But then Lady Alma
appeared out of nowhere

94
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,983
and gallantly saved
our sorry lives.

95
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,733
Yeah? Did you seriously
do that, Alma?

96
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:07,275
I happened across 'em
as I flew to work.

97
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:10,525
Then shouldn't you have given
them back to Artemis after?

98
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:13,775
Yeah, and at first I tried
to do exactly that.

99
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:16,608
I sent word, but no one
ever came to collect them.

100
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:18,650
So I gave them a chance.

101
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:23,567
Nobody's born human, right?
It takes work to become one.

102
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,942
I wasn't about to kill them

103
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:27,233
just because they'd committed
a few petty crimes.

104
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:28,817
That'd be cruel.

105
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,692
I get it.

106
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:34,400
And you've served her
ever since, right?

107
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:35,358
Actually, no!

108
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,483
We tried to give her the slip

109
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,275
as soon as she took
her eyes off us!

110
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:40,442
Huh?!

111
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,233
[DON BOSSMAN] But then she
unleashed her magic on us

112
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:44,150
at full blast.

113
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,358
[ALMA] I've got no mercy
for ungrateful punks

114
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:48,442
who bite the hand
that feeds them.

115
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:49,983
[SETH chuckles nervously]

116
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:51,442
[DON BOSSMAN]
But that's not all.

117
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,942
Suddenly, a Source
Nemesis appeared!

118
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,650
[SETH]
Oh!

119
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,192
[DON BOSSMAN]
We were defenseless.

120
00:06:57,275 --> 00:07:00,608
But Lady Alma faced that Nemesis
with the bravitude of a lion

121
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:02,733
and struck the monster down!

122
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:06,525
In that moment, I had an
epiphany. A revelation!

123
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:08,317
This sorcerer had the spirit

124
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,025
I'd been trying to embody
my entire life.

125
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:14,733
The woman I saw before me was
the incarnation of courage,

126
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:17,275
self-sacrifice, and humility!

127
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:20,108
"Lady" Alma is an
understatement.

128
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:22,858
She's a goddess!

129
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,275
Yeah!

130
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:26,358
So that's why I've put my wicked
old ways behind me now!

131
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:29,400
As soon as she finished killing
that Nemesis, I bowed!

132
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,233
I got on my hands and
knees and begged her

133
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,817
to let us be her assistants.

134
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,108
And then...

135
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:35,358
[SETH]
Huh?

136
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:38,025
I can't even understand
a word you are saying!

137
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:39,608
Why don't you stop
with the sob-show

138
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,608
and go make me some dinner, Don?

139
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:42,942
[DON BOSSMAN]
As you command!

140
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:45,400
[footsteps]

141
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:47,150
What a pain.

142
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:51,525
Nice work, Alma. You've really
turned those guys around.

143
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:54,817
They're not good people yet,
they're just weirdly loyal.

144
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,567
If I quit Nemesis hunting and
became an organ trafficker,

145
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,233
I bet they'd start
kidnapping drunks for me.

146
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:03,233
I guess they'll learn more
with you then they would

147
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,067
if they were stuck in jail.

148
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,483
[ALMA]
Maybe so.

149
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,650
At any rate, they've been
standing by their promise

150
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:09,900
to assist me.

151
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,067
They do the work
of five men apiece.

152
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,192
[SETH]
You're kidding!

153
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:14,483
[ALMA]
I'm not.

154
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,317
There's no reason to worry
about them, though.

155
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,775
They're a couple of buffoons,

156
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:19,567
but they've decided
we're a family.

157
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,650
It's cute.

158
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,442
[SETH]
Oh, yeah. Speaking of family.

159
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:23,650
[ALMA]
Hm?

160
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,608
When all that stuff
happened in Rumble Town,

161
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,025
I met this weird guy.

162
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:29,400
What do you mean by "weird"?

163
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:32,942
[SETH] Well, he said that
he was my older brother.

164
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:35,692
And could he prove it?

165
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:37,150
Or did this stranger expect you

166
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,358
to take his claims
at face value?

167
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:41,400
He had horns, the same as I do.

168
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:43,983
The curse of growing horns
isn't actually as rare

169
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,692
as you seem to believe.

170
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,317
That may be, but he also
looked a lot like me.

171
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,858
And when I was in trouble
at Rumble Town,

172
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:51,483
I sensed him somehow.

173
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,858
I felt him do something
to help me fight.

174
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:55,733
You felt him do what?

175
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:57,983
[SETH] I think he cracked
open something inside me,

176
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:00,192
just enough to keep me alive.

177
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:02,442
And after the fight, I saw him.

178
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,192
Like in a dream.

179
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,025
[ALMA]
Seth, you felt him do something

180
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:10,858
during your fight
in Rumble Town?

181
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:12,567
Well, as strange as it sounds,

182
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,817
despite being a great
distance away from you,

183
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,817
I think I felt it, too.

184
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,983
And it felt wrong.

185
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:23,192
It was a sensation I don't
wanna feel again.

186
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:26,233
I don't have any more memory
of that time than you do,

187
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:29,317
but what if it wasn't a
Nemesis who infected you?

188
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,858
What if that seal is meant
to protect you from him?

189
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,317
I don't understand why you
would think that though.

190
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,733
[ALMA]
If he really was trustworthy,

191
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:41,567
I think he would've turned
up for a visit by now.

192
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,942
As I recall, you felt like
you "turned into a monster"

193
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,567
and then "went berserk."

194
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,358
If he helped to
make that happen,

195
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,650
then I consider
this man a threat.

196
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,275
Huh?

197
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,442
[ALMA]
Hiya!

198
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:56,108
Get it together,
ya gullible dork.

199
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:58,858
Ya can't go around listening
to every weirdo you run into,

200
00:09:58,942 --> 00:09:59,692
understand?

201
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,067
It wasn't like that,

202
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,192
I really did feel some kind
of bond with this guy.

203
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:05,775
Sounds like the work of
an overactive imagination.

204
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:07,233
The story might've
been more believable

205
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,733
if you'd written
yourself some notes.

206
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,358
Aw, c'mon, Alma!

207
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,900
You need to listen now, okay?

208
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:16,317
You're going to be confronted
with a lot of strange things.

209
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,983
Don't let them confuse you.

210
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,775
Believe only what you've
seen and known yourself,

211
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:22,067
what you've learned.

212
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,942
If you get careless,
you will die, understand?

213
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,025
Yeah. I get it.

214
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:30,067
[DON BOSSMAN]
Oh, Lady Alma! Dinner is served!

215
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,608
Feel free to head
up there, Seth.

216
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:34,108
I bet you're even
hungrier than I am.

217
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:35,817
Yup! Don't gotta tell me twice!

218
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,358
[SETH laughs]

219
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:38,983
[DON BOSSMAN]
What do you think, kiddo?

220
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:40,817
Looks pretty tasty, right?

221
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,275
[ALMA]
His brother?

222
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:44,942
I have a bad feeling about this.

223
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:17,692
[DRAGUNOV]
Damn blizzard.

224
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:19,983
I still can't tell
if I'm close yet.

225
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:23,150
Why was I summoned
to such a place?

226
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,608
If they intended to punish me

227
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:27,150
for allowing Konrad
to act as he did,

228
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:31,317
wouldn't they have sent me
back to my own country?

229
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,358
Konrad. He had a poisoned mind.

230
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:38,150
I knew he was dangerous
from the beginning.

231
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,067
If I'd stood against him then,

232
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,858
could I have averted
that horrible tragedy?

233
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,317
Good show!

234
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,192
But stay vigilant;
there may be more hiding.

235
00:11:58,275 --> 00:12:00,775
I assure each of you that
these pesky Nemeses

236
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:03,317
have made fools of us
for the final time.

237
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,775
Report, sir!

238
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,192
We've been told the Nemeses
have fled to District 13!

239
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:09,233
Then it's that much
easier to capture them!

240
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:11,108
Or it would be if we
had the means to!

241
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:12,275
Look over there, Captain.

242
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:14,108
I think I see something
coming towards us!

243
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,150
Is that so?

244
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,442
Why don't you take a look at it

245
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:18,817
with that Goat Eye of
yours, Vice-Captain?

246
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,358
With respect, it isn't called
a "Goat Eye," Captain.

247
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,858
Oh, I remember now. It's
called a dormouse eye, right?

248
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:27,442
Can we please not do this?

249
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:29,067
Was it a mushroom eye?

250
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,733
I don't even know why that
would occur to you, sir.

251
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,233
Whatever! Who even cares?

252
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:35,775
Just tell me what you see
with that stupid eye of yours!

253
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:38,900
So you know, it's
called the "Lynx Eye."

254
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:43,067
Hmm... It looks like a soldier.

255
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,400
Judging from his uniform,

256
00:12:44,483 --> 00:12:47,733
I'd say he's a soldier
assigned to the prison.

257
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:49,150
Open fire!

258
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,358
But why?

259
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:52,650
He's obviously a Nemesis
in disguise! Do it!

260
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:55,858
'Kay. Well, just in case,
let's see if he can talk.

261
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,108
Hey! What's the matter?

262
00:12:58,192 --> 00:12:59,775
There's been a
terrorist-led revolt

263
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:01,608
in the prison at District 13!

264
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:02,817
[ALL gasp]

265
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,233
[KONRAD] The terrorists
are holding a number

266
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,275
of innocent citizens hostage.

267
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:08,775
They're planning to execute
them one by one!

268
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:10,483
[CAPTAIN A]
Executing hostages?

269
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:13,775
Who stages a rebellion
at a time like this? Why?

270
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:17,150
[KONRAD] There are malcontents
lurking all over the place!

271
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,150
It hurts to say this...

272
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:22,733
...but Major Oxumare himself
was fighting at their side!

273
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:24,900
What? The major, a turn coat?

274
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:26,442
That can't be true.

275
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:28,775
Actually, it's starting
to make sense.

276
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:31,067
I heard a report that
he was overly friendly

277
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,942
with the immigrants and
sorcerers at the prison.

278
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:36,567
[KONRAD] He spoke with the
sorcerer children constantly,

279
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,775
and let no one else
near them, sir.

280
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:40,233
Devious traitor.

281
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:43,775
Captain, let my squad
handle this revolt.

282
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:46,817
We will free the hostages and
find out what's going on.

283
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,067
You cannot let him do that!

284
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:52,608
[CAPTAIN A]
Speak, soldier! Why not?

285
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:56,025
[KONRAD]
Because it's far too dangerous!

286
00:13:56,108 --> 00:13:57,233
The reason being,

287
00:13:57,317 --> 00:13:59,108
they've somehow gotten
all of those Nemeses

288
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:00,608
to fight at their side!

289
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:01,483
What?

290
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:02,608
Are you saying that terrorists

291
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:04,692
are using Nemeses
as weapons now?

292
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:06,025
[KONRAD]
I am, sir!

293
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:08,358
I can't be sure,
but I believe the major

294
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:11,150
used that last sorcerer
child to do it.

295
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,400
[CAPTAIN A]
How conniving!

296
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:15,650
Dispatch all our troops
to District 13 at once!

297
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,400
[DRAGUNOV]
Hold on, Captain!

298
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:19,483
This story has been
growing more far-fetched

299
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,483
with every addition.

300
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:21,317
How would terror--

[SOLDIER A, CAPTAIN A gasp]

00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,442
[CITIZENS screaming]

303
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:26,900
[CITIZEN A]
The chains!

304
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,608
[CAPTAIN A] The whole
island's falling off balance!

305
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:31,733
We still have time
to save Rumble Town!

306
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:34,067
But the only way is to destroy
the last anchor-point

307
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,983
on Northeast Street
and sink District 13.

308
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,900
Is he insane?

309
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:40,692
[KONRAD]
This is our only chance.

310
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:44,442
Sacrifice a part of this
town or lose all of it!

311
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:47,317
In that case, let's move out
and start evacuating people.

312
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,108
There's no time for that!
We have to act now!

313
00:14:50,192 --> 00:14:51,692
I completely agree, sir!

314
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:53,567
Not only could the town
fall any second,

315
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,442
this is also our best chance
to wipe out those Nemeses!

316
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:58,108
But, Captain,
there are civilians.

317
00:14:58,192 --> 00:15:00,358
No, if I waste any more
time listening to you,

318
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,692
it'll be too late, you fool
of a vice-captain!

319
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:06,317
Go! Cannon crews open fire
on those damn chains!

320
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,858
Take that district down!

[CITIZENS screaming]

00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:27,942
[KONRAD laughing]

323
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:40,025
[DRAGUNOV] Why am I always
just a spectator?

324
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:42,400
I knew he was corrupt,
and yet...

325
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,942
...I did nothing to stop him.

326
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:53,483
[DRAGUNOV]
This can't be right.

327
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:56,400
I've been walking three days
just to reach a dead end?

328
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:57,983
[LISELOTTE]
Dragunov!

329
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:22,775
I've heard a rumor or two about
a holy site of the Inquisition

330
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,525
hidden in a remote
mountain pass.

331
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:30,983
So then, is this where
my execution will be?

332
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:32,775
That's quite the honor.

333
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,067
[gasps]

334
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:52,150
Hold on a moment. Is that the
Father of the Inquisitors?

335
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:54,150
[TORQUE]
Indeed.

336
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:55,983
This is the oldest
known depiction

337
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,817
of the Patrem Inquisitor.

338
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,567
And to my knowledge,
the most accurate.

339
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,817
Captain Dragunov,

340
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,400
I bid thee welcome to
the Sanctum of Faith.

341
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,900
[DRAGUNOV]
Thank you, General.

342
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:12,483
I didn't realize that this
place actually existed.

343
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:13,900
[TORQUE]
That's for the best.

344
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,275
If its existence were known,

345
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:18,942
there'd be many who
would seek to defile it.

346
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:22,067
Since the Incident at Rumble
Town became public knowledge,

347
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,150
trust in the Inquisition
has plummeted.

348
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:29,483
I knew there'd be consequences
when I exposed Konrad,

349
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:32,692
but I needed to prevent the
past from repeating itself.

350
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:36,275
My intention wasn't to sully
the Inquisition's honor.

351
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:37,983
[TORQUE]
That's enough.

352
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:43,067
If my intention was to rebuke
you, I wouldn't do it here.

353
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,692
I would've summoned you back
to our headquarters in Bome.

354
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,608
Rise. I see no reason
to punish you.

355
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:54,775
The Inquisition
has been weakened,

356
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:57,275
and our many foes
are growing bold.

357
00:17:57,358 --> 00:17:59,817
The foul Domitors have
come out of hiding.

358
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,942
The witch-knights of Cyfandir
parade their strength.

359
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:06,817
And the merchant barons
of the west plan to expand.

360
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,817
We must hold back
these many threats

361
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,233
while governing a populace
that's lost its faith in us.

362
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:15,983
My Thaumaturges are working
to secure our position

363
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:18,775
and prove that we can
still protect the people.

364
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:21,025
When maintaining this
delicate balance,

365
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:23,317
difficult choices often arise.

366
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,567
Choices I am burdened to make.

367
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,108
For example, I've decided
that the Captain Dragunov

368
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,608
who quietly guarded the
islands of Pompo Hills...

369
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:35,275
...is dead.

370
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:36,358
From this day forth,

371
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:39,358
you're Captain Dragunov
the Thaumaturge.

372
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,358
By the end of this incident,

373
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:46,025
your perceptiveness proved
to be a double-edged sword.

374
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:47,983
But if not for your
watchful eye,

375
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,942
Konrad might've concealed
the truth yet again.

376
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:54,025
Sir, I'm unworthy
of your praise.

377
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:55,525
I didn't stop him.

378
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,817
I didn't even attempt to--
I just reported what I knew.

379
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,525
That is because you
know your limits.

380
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:04,233
Unlike that fool Von Teppes.

381
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:05,942
He overestimated his strength

382
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:09,525
and was struck down before
he could use his miracle.

383
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:13,650
You have good judgment,
which is why I recommended you.

384
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:16,775
You're the same man that
I used to serve under.

385
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:20,817
A dedicated soldier who sees
that which slips past the rest.

386
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,567
I think that your astute
insights'll bolster our strength

387
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,817
in ways that you're too
humble to acknowledge.

388
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,942
[DRAGUNOV] I was fully prepared
to be executed, but this...

389
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:33,442
This I never saw coming.

390
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:35,067
Follow me.

391
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:38,650
[TORQUE]
The sorcerers with whom

392
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:41,567
we Thaumaturges
fight are powerful.

393
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,817
[TORQUE]
Before our order's founding,

394
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
the people of Pharenos
were subjugated

395
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:50,733
by powerful sorcerers.

396
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:52,567
Their oppression persisted,

397
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,025
until one man stood up and
flew the flag of rebellion.

398
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:59,733
That man, the son
of a simple farmer,

399
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:02,692
fought the sorcerers back with
nothing but a common pitchfork

400
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:05,733
and the strength of his will.

401
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:08,983
There are those who think
this story is but a legend

402
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:12,192
but I assure you, it is true.

403
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:15,650
Is that the Patrem Inquisitor's
pitchfork, General?

404
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:19,317
[TORQUE] Yes. It is one
of our sacred relics.

405
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:24,483
There's no magic in it,
nor was it designed for warfare.

406
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:25,942
It was made to pitch hay.

407
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,317
But in his hands,

408
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,025
it brought down men with
the strength of false gods.

409
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:32,942
Such a feat would
require a miracle.

410
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,692
Precisely so.

411
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,817
The strength of his will

412
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,733
gave him the power
to perform miracles.

413
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:40,733
But how'd he do it?

414
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:43,317
I'll tell you that when
the time is right.

415
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,775
You came a long way to get here.
For now, you need to rest.

416
00:20:47,858 --> 00:20:49,942
We will perform the
revelation ceremony

417
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:52,233
and declare you a
Thaumaturge later.

418
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,858
Yes, sir.

419
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:57,692
You and Captain Liselotte will
leave together at dawn tomorrow.

420
00:20:57,775 --> 00:21:01,483
With her, you'll begin your
first mission as a Thaumaturge.

421
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,942
You are to find that horned
sorcerer and his companions.

422
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:06,775
Huh?

423
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:09,233
[DRAGUNOV]
The boy who defeated Konrad.

424
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:12,233
And then went on to
stop the Domitor.

425
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:15,567
For the Inquisition to be this
determined to capture him,

426
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,525
he must be truly special.

427
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:25,025
You're the only
Inquisitor I trust

428
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:26,942
who's seen all their faces.

429
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:29,067
You can count on me, sir.

430
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,608
Their faces are imprinted
clearly in my mind.

431
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,358
Caislean Merlin
in Cyfandir, eh?

432
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:40,942
That's supposed to
be the ancient city

433
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:43,317
where magic was first
created, right?

434
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,025
Well, that's what
people say at least.

435
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:47,483
Seems like Yaga's
grasping at straws to me.

436
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,775
Say, unless I'm misremembering,

437
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:52,650
that country's protected by
flying knight-sorcerers,

438
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:54,275
which must mean
it's pretty difficult

439
00:21:54,358 --> 00:21:56,942
to pull off a decent
heist out there.

440
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,567
[DON BOSSMAN]
So, Lady Alma,

441
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,567
you sure ya don't
wanna go with him?

442
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,983
Why should I go?

443
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:07,025
I've got my own business
to attend to right here.

444
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:08,275
[DON BOSSMAN]
Yes, ma'am!

445
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:10,192
As for Seth, the time
when I could tell him

446
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:12,525
what to do with
his life is over.

447
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:14,692
Is this what people
call a mother's love?

448
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:16,442
[ALMA]
Like hell it is!

449
00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:31,275
Now that's a sight!

450
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:35,567
We've reached it.
The continent of Cyfandir.

451
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:13,108
[NARRATOR] Seth finally sets
foot in Cyfandir. Alone.

452
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:14,275
Almost immediately,

453
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:16,775
he encounters a party
of merchant barons

454
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:19,233
who wish to exploit the
continent's resources

455
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:20,775
for themselves.

456
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:23,858
After an awkward encounter
and a brief chase,

457
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:27,733
Seth escapes the barons
with the help of an old ally.

458
00:24:27,817 --> 00:24:29,567
