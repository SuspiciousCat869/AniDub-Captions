1
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:12,775
[SETH]
Jill could sense that Fantasia

2
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:15,608
was about to disappear
from the forest.

3
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:16,817
And knowing that,

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,733
she gathered up every
last bit she had

5
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:22,317
and used it to keep
her children safe.

6
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:28,317
They're still really little,
so they need lots of protection.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,442
Are you okay?

8
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:32,275
[MYR]
I owe you my gratitude, Seth.

9
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:35,400
Oh. I didn't do much.
Doc's the one who found them.

10
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:40,692
[MYR] You gave me a chance to
see my children one last time.

11
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:42,983
Despite Jill's sacrifice,

12
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:45,983
this cocoon has been
drained of Fantasia.

13
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:47,358
It'll run out soon.

14
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:49,025
Sounds to me like
all you need to do

15
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:50,442
is make them a new cocoon.

16
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,817
[MYR]
No. That isn't possible.

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,067
It took me and Jill hundreds
of years to make this one.

18
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,483
Yeah, but this forest exists
outside of normal time, right?

19
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:01,525
That was back when
the forest was alive

20
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:03,317
and brimming with Fantasia.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,567
If Jill were still here,

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,983
the two of us might've
been able to restore it,

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,108
but without her,
there's no hope.

24
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:10,400
Don't talk like that.

25
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:13,775
You can do anything, Myr.
You're the last fairy!

26
00:01:13,858 --> 00:01:18,233
I'm weaker than my forbears
because I'm half human.

27
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,942
[NARRATOR]
"The Future Is With You."

28
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,692
[SETH]
What? You're half human?

29
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:00,067
[MYR]
Mhm.

30
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,483
My father was a real
mischievous trickster type.

31
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:07,733
He liked to transform himself
and woo women of your species.

32
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:10,650
You can imagine how
surprised he must've been

33
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,650
when one of those women
ended up pregnant.

34
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:16,733
I don't much care to get
into the details, but yes.

35
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:19,733
When my people decided to merge
with the greater world,

36
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:23,108
I wanted nothing more than
to disappear with them.

37
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:26,650
But hard as I tried,
I couldn't follow them.

38
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:29,858
My human half tethered
me to this body.

39
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:33,650
I wandered this land by myself
for what felt like an eternity.

40
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,275
Crippled by loneliness,

41
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:39,150
yearning for a way
to rejoin my people.

42
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,067
And when that failed,
I searched for

43
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,608
the beings responsible
for my people's fate.

44
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:46,692
I attacked the
humans relentlessly.

45
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:51,150
Then I met Jill, and I
wasn't alone anymore.

46
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,733
She showed me a
gentler way of life.

47
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:54,858
Before too long,

48
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:57,900
I lost interest in
fighting the humans.

49
00:03:57,983 --> 00:04:00,525
I forgot about rejoining
my people, too.

50
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:04,900
Instead, Jill and I decided
to start a family.

51
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:08,233
Jill didn't like that I
rejected my human side.

52
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:11,275
She convinced me to start
visiting the castle area.

53
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:14,858
There, I heard the humans gossip
about my past appearances.

54
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:18,442
Their tales ranged from
ridiculous to idiotic.

55
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,400
But weren't the stories
based on things that you did?

56
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:22,692
Yeah.

57
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:23,983
A long time ago,

58
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:26,192
I encountered a rather
combative group of humans

59
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:28,400
trying to head into the forest.

60
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:31,733
I threw them all out
without much trouble.

61
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:34,858
I soon discovered they were
chasing another group of humans,

62
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,858
and that group decided I must've
shown up to protect them.

63
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:40,858
Years later, some humans
tried to buy the land

64
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:42,525
from me with gold.

65
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:46,442
I told them that the land didn't
belong to me or anyone else.

66
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:49,275
It wasn't mine to give or share.

67
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:50,608
Over the generations,

68
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:53,817
those stories turned into
the "Legend of Merlin."

69
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,817
A wise old sorcerer king
riding a stag,

70
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,608
spouting crap like, "I shall
not let this land be divided!"

71
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:04,275
or, "This is our country.
It doesn't belong to them!"

72
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:06,942
So are all the heroic
stories they tell

73
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,858
about you just
misunderstandings?

74
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,483
Yeah, pretty much
without exception.

75
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:14,483
The humans got everything wrong,
right down to my name.

76
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,358
It's always been Myrddin!

77
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:19,233
[ARTO] Even his hallowed
name was misremembered!

78
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:20,525
[LANDLAKE]
I suppose we'll have to swear

79
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:23,108
on Myrddin's name henceforth!

80
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:24,900
Here's the thing,
I can make mountains

81
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:27,733
or even deadwood trees
grow from the earth,

82
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:30,275
but it'll take life to
sustain these little ones,

83
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:32,900
and I lack the magic
to create life.

84
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:34,358
[SETH]
Hmm.

85
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:36,483
Jill put me in a bubble
just like that one,

86
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,525
treated me like her child.

87
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:41,567
Well, if that kept me alive,
could it work the other way?

88
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,900
[MYR]
Huh?

89
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:44,525
Just what are you suggesting?

90
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:46,817
That we could have a
human carry them to term?

91
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,692
[SETH]
Yeah. Does that sound weird?

92
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:50,733
Honestly, I think it
could work, Seth.

93
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,067
Since Myr is half human,

94
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,942
that means his children
are all one-fourth human,

95
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:56,275
so they would probably
adjust pretty easily.

96
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:58,192
You can't really believe--

97
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,733
Actually, you make a good point.

98
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:05,150
However, the young ones will
need a great deal of Fantasia,

99
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:07,150
which the human'll
have to gather.

100
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,858
So basically, you just need

101
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:12,275
a really powerful sorcerer
to volunteer, right?

102
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:15,608
[MYR] She would need to take
this cocoon into her body.

103
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:17,858
Finding a sorcerer who
would be able to manage

104
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,567
such a task could be impossible.

105
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,192
Don't worry, Myr. I know
someone who can do it.

106
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:27,150
[BOUDICA]
Yes.

107
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,150
And I want you to know, Myrddin,

108
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:31,900
I would consider it
a great honor.

109
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,733
[BOTH yelling]

110
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:43,900
I sense the passion
of a kindred spirit

111
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:45,483
in every stroke of your blade!

112
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,192
I hope you don't think you can
charm me over to your side.

113
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:51,733
We shall continue this later.
Well fought, sir. Ha!

114
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,192
Come back here!

115
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:55,275
That would defeat the purpose
of leaving, so I shan't.

116
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:56,692
Namely because I can't!

117
00:06:56,775 --> 00:07:00,358
I must answer a call
of nature at once!

118
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:01,692
You could come back after.

119
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:03,650
[KNIGHT SORCERER B]
Lord de Gulis, we found you.

120
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,233
You're wanted on
suspicion of conspiracy.

121
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:07,942
We're to escort you
back to the castle.

122
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:11,775
[sighs] Oh, great Merlin.
What will become of us?

123
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:14,817
What is in store
for Cyfandir next?

124
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:17,525
[GOUDEAU]
Things seem to have calmed down.

125
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:20,275
Both sides have withdrawn
from the field.

126
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,025
[GARVICE] Did you know
what would happen, sir?

127
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,900
Because of your Lynx Eye?

128
00:07:23,983 --> 00:07:25,358
I didn't.

129
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:27,983
When the monster brought its
anger to bear on our ship,

130
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:30,858
I was utterly convinced
that we were all done for.

131
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:31,775
[BOTH gasp]

132
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:33,025
That being said,

133
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:35,067
if we had turned tail
and then been killed,

134
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,400
our story would've
been much less noble.

135
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:39,400
Seriously, Captain?

136
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:40,983
It's time we headed out.

137
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:43,400
Inquisition ships won't
be safe in these skies

138
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:44,858
for too much longer.

139
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:47,400
Right. Understood.
Where should we go?

140
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:48,942
[DRAGUNOV]
To Bome, of course.

141
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:51,358
With all due respect,
are you sure that we can?

142
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:53,775
We drew blades against
our comrades in battle.

143
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:57,400
Do you think we can justify
such an overt mutiny?

144
00:07:57,483 --> 00:08:00,233
I'm sure I'll be able
to take care of it.

145
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:01,775
On a somewhat related note,

146
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:04,817
our squad is going to be
rather busy for a while.

147
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,483
[GOUDEAU] Well, we weren't
expecting a holiday.

148
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:10,317
If anyone wants out,
this is the time to say so.

149
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,858
I'm with you, sir.

150
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:15,442
Same. Count me in, Captain!
Until I've drawn my last breath.

151
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:20,358
[DRAGUNOV] Regardless of
the justification offered,

152
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:23,733
attempting to enslave the
infected is plainly wrong.

153
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,567
I need to speak
with General Torque

154
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,983
and glean his intentions.

155
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:46,567
So you're a Thaumaturge. Huh.

156
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,108
We'll have to take
special measures

157
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:51,108

158

[LISELOTTE]
This is humiliating.

159
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:55,317
But nothing fazes the general.

160
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,608
He'll know exactly what to do

161
00:08:56,692 --> 00:08:58,900
when he learns of
my predicament.

162
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,817
[BOUDICA]
It has been three days now

163
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,358
since the Inquisition
interrupted

164
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:11,233
our Knight Ordination Ceremony
by sending an invasion force

165
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,983
to launch an unprovoked
attack on our country.

166
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:16,942
We've lost a great deal
of verdant land

167
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,858
and a great many
heroic soldiers.

168
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:24,233
But we drove back the foe
and our country will recover.

169
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:30,233
For now, let us mourn our dead
and tend to our many wounds.

170
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:33,608
But this time next year,
and in the years to come after,

171
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:35,775
we shall celebrate this day.

172
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:39,233
The day that Cyfandir
delivered a stern rebuke

173
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:40,817
to the self-righteous
Inquisitors

174
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,108
who were foolish enough to think

175
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:44,233
that they could put
us into chains!

176
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,025
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
All hail the queen!

177
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:47,775
Long may she reign!

178
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:49,858
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

179
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:52,525
All that said, we were
ill-prepared for battle

180
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:55,900
and came far too close
to defeat as a result.

181
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:58,442
If not for the timely aid
of several outsiders

182
00:09:58,525 --> 00:09:59,733
to the kingdom,

183
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:02,525
as well as the intervention
of Merlin himself,

184
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:03,942
we would've lost the war

185
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:07,442
and Cyfandir would be on
its knees as I speak.

186
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:09,483
Our enemy had a cunning plan.

187
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,733
They planted the seeds
of doubt in our hearts,

188
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:13,942
twisted the pride of
our lords into a tool

189
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:17,525
and used it to trick them into
attacking their own people.

190
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:20,608
But this was only made possible

191
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:23,275
by a myriad of failures
and mistakes.

192
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:24,317
I was a fool.

193
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,900
If I had asked for counsel

194
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:28,900
or gone out to speak
with my people,

195
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:32,233
I could've discovered this
conspiracy far sooner.

196
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:35,400
And if not for the custom
of keeping our curses hidden,

197
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:37,483
the villains who plotted
to burn our kingdom

198
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,400
at the pyre of profit
would've been missing

199
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:42,692
an essential piece
of their plan.

bring our secrets to the light!

That sounds fine in theory,

I have no choice but
to do as they tell me.

But I feel comfortable
telling you

that he's short of
stature, bearded,

and a stalwart
defender of Cyfandir,

Shut your mouths!

First of all, this line
of discussion

273
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:28,817
is highly disrespectful
to the queen!

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,733
And second of all!
Well, you know...

[TOWNSPERSON O]
Huh? Speak up, we can't hear ya!

[BRANGOIRE]
Oh, yes.

277

Your Majesty, there's a request
I would like to make.

278
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:40,650
Go right ahead.

279
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,067
[BRANGOIRE]
I wish to retract my statement

280
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,442
from before the
ordination ceremony.

281
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:46,067
[BOUDICA]
Hm?

282
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,483
[BRANGOIRE]
I believe candidate Ocoho

283
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,150
would make an excellent knight.

284
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:50,983
Huh?

285
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:52,650
I think I understand,

286
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:56,067
but have the lords of Cyfandir
not chosen their heirs already?

287
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,900
[BRANGOIRE]
I chose to defer until now.

288
00:13:57,983 --> 00:14:02,483
Whoa. Wait. What are you saying?
You wanna make me your heir?

289
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,525
I'm rather surprised that
you would ask for this,

290
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:06,317
Lord Brangoire.

291
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,108
The answer is no.

292
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,567
Please, my Queen.

293
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,900
It was Ocoho who exposed the
Spectral Nemesis conspiracy!

294
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:15,775
She fought a merchant
baron, a traitor,

295
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:18,358
and a ship full of foes,
and sent them all running!

296
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,233
She's overcome the
limits of her infection

297
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,567
and proven to be
a capable warrior!

298
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,525
I've been training
knight candidates for years

299
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:26,983
and Ocoho's Gysoni is
by far the strongest

300
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,400
I've ever seen!

301
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:30,775
That's true, but she also
defied your orders

302
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:34,025
during multiple battles against
Spectral Nemeses, right?

303
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:36,233
[BRANGOIRE] Yes, but only
to help our farmers.

304
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:38,900
She also slapped her
queen in the face once.

305
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:41,483
[BRANGOIRE] Only to help you
regain your conviction.

306
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,233
And at the Ordination Ceremony,

307
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:46,150
she all-but convinced my
most loyal knight to rebel.

308
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,400
Only to protect her people!

309
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:51,692
I've made my decision,
and nothing you say can sway it.

310
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:52,942
It could be hundreds of years

311
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,525
before we see an heir
with such talent again!

312
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:57,400
Stop, Lord Brangoire.

313
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:58,900

Fair warning: If I find out that
someone hurt the princess,

469
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,942
I'll murder them.

470
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:02,275
And then I'll murder you
for letting them touch her!

471
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,400
So don't let it get
to that point!

472
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:06,400
Okay, well, you'd better
take care of the queen

473
00:22:06,483 --> 00:22:08,150
and those babies in her belly!

474
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:09,192
They're like my siblings,

475
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:11,275
so if you're not
careful with them...

476
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:12,775
...I'll smack your
beard nipples!

477
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:14,150
I feel like they
could've just said

478
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,733
that they're counting
on each other.

[MYR]
They may be like your siblings,

481
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:24,025
but remember that they
actually are my children.

482
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:26,983
So go and don't worry
about a thing.

483
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:29,108
I'll be watching over them.

00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,400
She's acting the way
you used to, Seth.

491
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:55,567
Huh?

492
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,650
Feel like I might've
been a little worse.

493
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:58,983
Yeah.

494
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:01,567
But I'd say you've matured
quite a bit since then.

495
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,442
[SETH]
So have you.

496
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:05,733
[MELIE]
Well, we've overcome a lot.

497
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,692
And that's what
makes people grow.

498
00:23:07,775 --> 00:23:10,150
I'm really glad you followed
me out here, Melie.

499
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,275
If I had been on my own,

500
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:13,400
I would've lost all
control of myself.

501
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:14,733
For the record,

502
00:23:14,817 --> 00:23:17,025
I didn't come to Cyfandir
just for you, you know.

503
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:20,650
I'm well aware of that.
But still, thanks a bunch.

504
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,275
I'm happy to help.

505

And I'll be counting on you
to help me out, too.

Good evening.

[OCOHO, SETH scream]

508
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:30,567
[SETH] Don't pop up outta thin
air like that, it's creepy!

509
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,025
Oh, uh. Here.

510
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:34,900
[GRIMM]
Ah, Magosia's memory stone.

511
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:36,317
Thank you.

512
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,192
[SETH] I'd say no prob,
but it was kinda tough to get,

513
00:23:38,275 --> 00:23:39,400
so you still owe me.

514
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:42,358
I want one personal
detail--spill it.

[GRIMM]
Grimm will consider it.

Ya know what sucks?

517
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:48,400
The archive didn't have
any books about Radiant.

518
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:50,400
It was all a big waste of time.

519
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:51,733
It wasn't all a waste.

520
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:53,192
What about that
amazing new friend

521

you got out of it named Ocoho?

Oh, yeah.

00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:58,983
All right, people! Time to
get this adventure started!

'Course I do!

Listen, guys, my goal is to see
as much of the world as I can.

let's track down Radiant.

Can't I just relax
at home for a bit?

Never!
