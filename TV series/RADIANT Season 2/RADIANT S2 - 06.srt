Seth went to the Luchorpan

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,733
to speak with his
estranged friends,

3
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:16,900
but he couldn't find the words
to regain Melie's trust.

00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:20,650
The pair parted ways without
resolving their differences.

5
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:23,983
Seth then met with the
knight-sorcerer candidate Ocoho.

6
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,233
He agreed to help her train

in return for books
from the castle library.

8

contain clues about Radiant.

It's good to hear from you.

This is the second time you've
reached out since you took off.

I'm glad to see you're
still alive somehow.

The last time you called me,

27
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:42,483
you said you'd convinced
the merchant barons

28

that you were a spy and
attacked them with magic

before fighting a
"Spectral" Nemesis

30

half the size of a mountain.

31
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,858
So what've you done since?

32
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:52,317
Crash into the castle?
Destroy an ecosystem?

33
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,650
Of course not, I know
how to behave myself.

34

[ALMA]
Oh, do you now?

35
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:58,067
I guess it must be a coincidence

36
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,400
that chaos follows you
everywhere you go.

[SETH]
Ah, gimme a break!

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,150
I've been good lately.

39
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,900
Just training with Ocoho.
She's wearing me out.

40
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:08,025
Feels like I've got
cavities in my arms.

41
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:11,358
Ugh. Listen to yourself, Seth,
it's like you've forgotten

42
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:14,025
why you went to Caislean
Merlin in the first place.

43
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:15,108
Huh?

44
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:16,942
You should be
investigating Radiant.

45
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:18,817
If you've been developing
cavities anywhere,

46
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,525
I'm gonna have to assume it's
in that thick skull of yours.

47
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:24,233
[SETH] I am investigating
Radiant. Relax.

48
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:25,692
Whenever I'm not
training with Ocoho,

49
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:27,150
I'm looking through the
books she brought me

50
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,483
from the library.

51
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:29,858
It's a lot to go through.

52
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:31,900
I haven't even found
a single lead yet.

53
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:34,442
[sighs] If Radiant's
location were in a book,

54
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,442
it wouldn't be much
of a quest you're on.

55
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:38,900
In that case,

56
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:41,358
I guess I'mma have to sneak
into the Castle Archives.

57
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:43,608
[ALMA] If you think that'll
help, then give it a try.

58
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:45,858
Just make sure you don't
get caught, all right?

59
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:48,733
[SETH] Don't worry about it!
I've got a foolproof plan!

00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:50,275
Do you now?

61
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:53,150
Why do I worry that your
idea of a "foolproof plan"

62
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,650
is to walk in there
with your hood up

63
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,025
and hope that nobody
cares enough to stop you?

[SETH chuckles]

65

[ALMA]
Have you seen Melie?

Yeah. Pretty often.
Like every day.

knight candidate guys

been seeing her,

from a safe distance.

her from the bushes?

ya put it like that,

but what am I s'pposed
to say to her?

By the way, I was wondering.

84
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:39,317
Have you and I ever been
to Caislean Merlin before?

85
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,192
[ALMA] No. Not that
I can recall anyway.

86
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,858
Why do you ask?

87
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:45,817
It's because of the castle.

88
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,525
It feels familiar.
Like I've been there.

this stone passage.

And ever since I got
to Caislean Merlin,

00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:57,400
these weird memories
that I didn't even

00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:52,192
[SAGRAMORE] Right, well, being
a knight-sorcerer candidate

160
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:53,942
means you have to work hard.

161
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,442
[OCOHO]
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

162
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:59,150
Ocoho, it seems like
you've been slacking

163
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:01,317
ever since the queen
complimented you.

164
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,858
You're kidding, right?

165
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,775
Well, if that's how ya
feel, come and test me.

166
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:07,067
Bring it.

167
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,108
[OCOHO]
Careful what you ask for.

168
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:10,317
[OCOHO yells]

169
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,983
[SAGRAMORE]
Is that all you've got?

170
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:20,650
So this is the archive entrance.

171
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,275
A good day to you, my lords.

172
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:23,900
[KNIGHT-SCHOLAR A]
And to you.

173
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:27,150
I haven't seen the old guy
look up from that scroll once.

174
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,692
He won't notice me if
I'm dressed like this.

175
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:31,275
Hm?

176
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:33,275
Now's my chance.

177
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:35,025
[DOORMAN A]
A good day to you, my lords.

178
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,358
Good day.

179
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,025
A good day to you, my lord.

180
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:39,858
Right back at'cha.

181
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:43,358
Wait a moment, please.

182
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,775
Are you completely certain
that you have permission

183
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,317
to access the archives?

184
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,817
Your name isn't appearing
on my scroll.

185
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,692
Oh, yeah? Well, that's
certainly strange.

186
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:53,400
There must've been
some kind of mistake.

187
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:54,275
[SETH]
Crap!

188
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:55,692
I gotta think of an excuse fast,

189
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:57,233
or I'm gonna get
thrown into jail!

190
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:59,317
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
Think of something!

191
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,733
Like, anything!

192
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:02,650
[screams]

193
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,442
What are you doing
to my poor list?

194
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:08,567
Intruder! Someone stop him!

195
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,817
There's an intruder in here?

196
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,108
Let's capture him!

197
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:14,567
[SETH]
Alma was right!

198
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,400
[KNIGHT-SCHOLAR D]
He came through this way!

199
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,150
[SETH] Wish these guys
would just give up.

200
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:20,358
Huh?

201
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:23,400
Wait a second. I've seen
this passage before.

202
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,275
[SETH] That's the symbol
from my dreams.

203
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:31,775
[KNIGHT-SCHOLAR D] There he is!
We've got him cornered!

204
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:33,192
[ALL gasp]

205
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:35,983
[KNIGHT-SCHOLAR E]
He vanished.

206
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,442
[KNIGHT-SCHOLAR C]
No. That's impossible!

207
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:40,567
[KNIGHT-SCHOLAR D] He must
be nearby. Keep searching!

208
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,233
[KNIGHT-SCHOLAR C]
Where's he hiding?

209
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:49,442
[sighs]

210
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,108
Now what are the odds of that?

211
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,442
I suddenly passed
through the wall

212
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:55,483
after I drew that weird
symbol I saw in my dream.

213
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:01,608
My armor's just getting
in the way here.

214
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:07,733
[SETH] So this castle has
a secret passage in it.

215
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,608
I wonder where it might lead.

216
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:14,275
[SETH]
Hm?

217
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:20,442
[SETH] That's cool. It looks
like I'm inside the walls.

218
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:21,900
There could be
passages like this one

219
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,108
running through
the whole castle.

220
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:26,525
So this might get me
into the archives.

221
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,567
[SETH] How's all of this
hidden inside the castle?

222
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:51,400
[SETH] Something tells
me it's been a while

223
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:53,567
since they've cleaned down here.

224
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,317
Okay, this place is starting
to creep me out a little bit.

225
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:11,525
Uh.

226
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,858
Who could that be?

227
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:25,400
That's the Nemesis from before.
Except only way smaller.

228
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:26,858
[DIABAL]
Who's there?

229
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:28,692
Not good.

230
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:29,900
[DIABAL]
Canfod!

231
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,483
[DIABAL]
A young man.

232
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:38,067
Average physique.
No obvious weaponry.

233
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:41,900
[SETH]
He's inspecting me.

234
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:45,692
[DIABAL] A small stone in
his left pocket, and...

235
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:48,192
[DIABAL gasps]

236
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:51,358
[DIABAL]
Horns? No. This can't be!

237
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:53,275
I should've been safe in here.

238
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:54,525
This isn't fair!

239
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,025
Where did I go wrong?
How did he find me?

240
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:58,817
Whoa. It's okay!

241
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,567
[DIABAL]
Stay back!

242
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,358
I guess hiding here from
the world wasn't enough.

243
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,567
I won't let you take me!
I would rather die!

244
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,942
[SETH]
Hey, calm it down!

245
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,775
I think you're mistaking
me for someone else.

246
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:10,275
I'm not after anyone.

247
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:12,650
I just happened to find
this passage by accident!

248
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:14,942
[DIABAL] Save your breath,
I know you're lying!

249
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:17,733
Those horns of yours are
all the proof I need to see!

250
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:21,067
I don't know how you managed
to find me down here...

251
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,358
...but I won't let you
capture me alive, Piodon!

252
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:25,358
What? Piodon?

253
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:28,025
[DIABAL]
Maybe I should call for backup.

254
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:31,692
I could try, but even
if I do, he's too strong!

255
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,108
Wait a sec. You just
called me Piodon, right?

256
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:37,233
So, do you know who he is?

257
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,650
[DIABAL] No. The process
has already begun.

258
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,358
I have no choice!

259
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:49,775
What is this?

260
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:52,025
Did you just cage me in here?

261
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:55,150
[SETH]
Hey! Hang on a minute!

262
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:57,525
I'm not your enemy, I swear!
Just talk to me, please!

263
00:13:57,608 --> 00:14:00,733
Why's there a Nemesis in here?
What is this place for?

264
00:14:00,817 --> 00:14:02,983
C'mon, man, don't just leave!

265
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:18,400
[FARMERS chattering]

266
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,817
Oh, no.

267
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
It's a Spectre! Look out!

268
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:23,108
[FARMER B]
Everyone run!

269
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:25,192
Get away from the fields!

270
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,317
[FURGONDE screams]

271
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,900
[FURGONDE]
It's a giant ghost!

272
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:32,442
If it sees us, we're done for!
What do you think we should do?

273
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:35,067
'Twas I who discovered it,
so the naming rights are mine.

274
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,650
I shall christen
it "Spectrolom"!

275
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:39,983
Wow. It is quite big.

276
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:42,817
But I'm sure we can catch it
for my collection somehow.

277
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,233
No! That's the worst
idea ever! Let's run!

278
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,858
Hush. We're perfectly
safe where we are.

279
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:51,567
And furthermore, this could
be what we've waited for.

280
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,108
The catalyst of a true crisis.

281
00:14:57,442 --> 00:14:58,733
[LISELOTTE]
Look at that.

282
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:01,525
One of the Spectral Nemeses
we've heard about.

283
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:03,817
So, what do we do?

284
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,692
I'm not sure why you're
asking for my input on this.

285
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,317
You have seniority here.

286
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,817
We're of equal status now.

287
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,942
Besides, I've trusted
your judgment

288
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:14,692
ever since I served with you.

289
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:18,150
You were always on the mark.

290
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:19,983
[DRAGUNOV]
I do what I can.

291
00:15:23,858 --> 00:15:25,525
The heck am I looking at?

292
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:28,567
Is that me standing there?

293
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,358
I get it now. This must be
where the Spectrals come from.

294
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:34,733
Whatever's within the
barrier gets projected.

295
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:38,442
[FARMERS shouting]

296
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:41,358
[FARMER C] The house!
My kids are still in there!

297
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,442
This is bad.

298
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,150
If I take so much
as a single step,

299
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,733
then I could end up
crushing dozens of people.

300
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:49,400
For the time being,
I need to stay still.

301
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,233
I can find a way out of
this mess, I always do.

302
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:55,192
[FARMER B] Look up there!
It's another Spectral Nemesis!

303
00:15:58,775 --> 00:15:59,942
[gasps]

304
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:10,192
It poisoned me.

305
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:17,483
[FARMER A] Look out!
The first one's falling!

306
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:18,900
Run!

307
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:26,608
[horn blares]

308

[BRANGOIRE] This is an
emergency! Move it!

309
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:30,483
We've had a Spectral
Nemesis sighting

310
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,775
12 leagues east of Sylverive!

311
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,233
We're deploying in two
minutes, ready or not!

312
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:37,442
Each of you will fly
out of this stable!

313

Either on your dragons
or at the end of my boot!

314
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:43,192
[OCOHO] You're kidding me. We're
really deploying right now?

315
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:44,567
I'm in big trouble.

316
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,067
Seth still has Lulu's armor
and he's disappeared!

317
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,233
Don't guess you could tell
me where he went, Draccoon.

318
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:52,275
[BRANGOIRE]
Mordred!

319
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:55,317
Why have you brought a pack
of novices into my stable?

320
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,733
[MORDRED] They're here to
observe the operation, my lord.

321
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,317
And since it's an emergency,

322
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,233
they can also provide us
with a little support.

323
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:03,567
I won't allow it.

324
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,400
[MORDRED] This was an order
from the queen, sir.

325
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,525
Then I welcome their presence!

326
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:09,400
Where's Sagramore gone?

327
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:12,358
I don't know, but I'm sure
he'll be here any minute.

328
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:13,650
"Any minute," eh?

329
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,358
First the Lord de
Gulis disappears

330
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,150
and now Sagramore's gone?

331
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:20,317
Those Spectral Nemeses aren't
gonna give us a minute!

332
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,067
Nemeses?

333
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,233
Our guards at the watchtower
reportedly saw

334
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:26,233
two specimens at the same spot.

335
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:28,983
As if dealing with one
weren't hard enough.

336
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:31,358
[BRANGOIRE] The only
knights who've defeated

337
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:33,692
a Spectral Nemesis
are you, Sagramore,

338
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:34,942
and the Lord de Gulis.

339
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:37,608
We needed all three of
you here for this fight.

340
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:40,567
We've lost far too many of our
comrades to these monsters.

341
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,400
Ordained knights and
candidates alike.

342
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:47,025
I cannot assign you a new
partner. It's too dangerous.

343
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,692
[OCOHO]
If Mordred needs a partner...

344
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:51,608
...then I volunteer.

345
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,233
[BRANGOIRE]
Who are you?

346
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,192
I'm Ocoho and I've served under
you for the last three years!

347
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:07,442
How do you not know that?

348
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:08,233
Right.

349
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:09,317
You're the pain in my butt

350
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,358
that the queen's
taken a liking to.

351
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:14,983
Ocoho, I appreciate you,
but... don't do this.

352
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:16,983
I have to--we're
short on fighters!

353
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,900
If we can't beat these
Spectral Nemeses,

354
00:18:18,983 --> 00:18:21,317
who knows how many civilians
they'll end up killing?

355
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,358
I've been training with you
and Sagramore all this time!

356
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:25,692
I know, but you--

357
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:29,358
[BRANGOIRE] Hmm. It's true
that this is a bad idea.

358
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,692
But Sagramore isn't here,
and she volunteered.

359
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:34,858
She's going with you, Mordred.

360
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:38,650
On your mounts, all of
you. It's time to fly!

361
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,233
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Yes, sir!

362
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:45,025
Hey, is everything all
right with you, Mordred?

363
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:48,108
Uh. Yeah. I'm just fine.

364
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:50,150
Say, would you mind taking
charge of the trainees

365
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,400
for a couple of minutes?

366
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:53,483
I still need to get my
dragon ready for battle,

367
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,400
so I'll catch up
with you in a bit.

368
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:57,067
'Kay.

369
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,233
[TRAINEE whispering]

370
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:04,317
'Kay. Let's go. Does
everyone have their brooms?

371
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,650
[TRAINEES]
Yeah!

372
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:08,567
I know we're throwing you
into this kinda fast.

373
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,650
Just stay safe and do your best
not to fall too far behind us!

374
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,150
[TRAINEES]
Yes, ma'am!

375
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:24,942
[FARMER C]
Hm?

376
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:31,442
[FARMER E] I don't understand.
Wasn't it falling?

377
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:32,442
[FARMER C]
Yeah, but it stopped.

378
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:33,608
[FARMER F]
We've been saved!

379
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:36,108
[FARMER G]
The great Merlin has blessed us!

380
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,983
[SETH grunting]

381
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,858
[SETH]
I'm starting to go numb.

382
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:49,817
Before too long, my body's
gonna give out on me.

383
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,525
What's wrong with you?

384
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:57,108
Why don't you attack me again
and finish what you started?

385
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:05,275
[SETH]
Does it only react to movement?

386
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:10,525
[SETH] I'm slipping.
At this rate, I'll--

387
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:13,275
No. I can't let myself fall.

388
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:15,192
I have to hang on!

389
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:19,317
[GRIMM]
Look at that.

390
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,775
You truly do have a talent

391
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:23,525
for getting yourself
into trouble, Seth.

392
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:25,108
This is most unfortunate.

393
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:28,650
And there's nothing Grimm
can do to help you directly.

394
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:32,358
But Grimm can free you
to defend yourself

395
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:34,775
without fear of harming someone.

396
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,942
That projection must
be bound to an object.

397
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:39,942
If it's destroyed,
the spell will break.

398
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,900
So what do you intend to do
once we've arrived at the scene?

399
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,858
I merely aim to fulfill
my duty as an Inquisitor.

400
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:51,442
Which means saving as
many lives as I can.

401
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:53,192
The Inquisition has
no power here,

402
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:54,567
so our best chance of catching

403
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,025
that horned sorcerer
and his friends

404
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:58,275
is to keep a low profile
till we've found them.

405
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:01,483
Staging a mass rescue could
put that in jeopardy.

406
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:04,400
What you're suggesting right now

407
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:07,483
does everything short of going
directly against our orders.

408
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,525
I'd do it even if it
went against them.

409
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:10,900
[LISELOTTE]
Hmph.

410
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,233
You really haven't
changed a bit.

411
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:21,525
Those are dragons.

412
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:24,108
These must be the
knight-sorcerers.

413
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:25,358
[gasps]

414
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:46,275
So that's a Spectral Nemesis.

415
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:48,317
It's kinda shaped
like a human being.

416
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,025
Oh, wow!

417
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,400
These Spectrals always
look pretty strange,

418
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:54,858
but I've never seen
one like this before.

419
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:55,733
Wild.

420
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:56,983
Are you ready, Draccoon?

421
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,067
Let's show the world
how hard we've trained.

422
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,942
All the blood, sweat,
and tears we've shed

423
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:03,817
will be worth it once we've
defeated these Nemeses!

424
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:07,192
Once I knock these
Spectrals into orbit,

425
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:10,192
even Lord Brangoire will
have to acknowledge me!

426
00:22:18,442 --> 00:22:20,275
[MELIE]
Ah!

427
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:21,400
[BOTH]
That's Seth!

428
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:22,525
[BOTH gasp]

429
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:12,233
[NARRATOR] A so-called Spectral
Nemesis which looks like Seth

430
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,233
towers over homesteads
and terrified farmers,

431
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:18,650
while the motives of the man
who created it remain unknown.

432
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:21,317
Then, a badly poisoned
Seth blacks out.

433
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,608
While he finds his psyche

434
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:24,608
relegated to the realm
of consciousness,

435
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:26,983
his body is at the mercy
of the dark power

436
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:28,775
which lurks inside him.

437
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:30,358
Next time on <i>Radiant</i> ,

438
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:32,358
