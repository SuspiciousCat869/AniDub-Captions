My sympathies.

You've been through
quite the ordeal.

[FARMER A]
Who the heck are you people?

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,108
We are but humble travelers
whose hearts were touched

5
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:25,483
upon seeing your
great misfortune.

6
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,650
I know it isn't much,

7
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:30,442
but I hope this gift can
help you rebuild.

really nothin' you can do?

11
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,983
[NURSE A]
I'm afraid not.

12
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:41,358
Melie! No!

13
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:44,275
Hey, Ocoho!
You're finally awake, huh?

14
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:45,775
Uh.

15
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:47,192
I thought you were dying!

16
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:49,775
What's with the flowers?
And what's he crying about?

17
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:51,817
If you don't let go, I will die!

18
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,233
The flowers are
from Lord de Gulis--

19
00:02:53,317 --> 00:02:55,108
he keeps sending more
and more every day!

20
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:57,150
And they've set off my

so go ahead and choke me!

[MISTER BOOBRIE chirping]

24
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:05,067
Never scare me like
that again, okay?

25
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:09,400
[MELIE] So you're saying that
you cast that Gysoni spell?

26
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:12,608
I sure did. I'm
completely exhausted.

27
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,108
All the other candidates
seem to think

28
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:15,983
that Lord Brangoire saw
what was happening

29
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:17,525
and changed tactics.

30
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:19,692
So ya know, people are
definitely debating

31
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:21,983
whether or not they should
kick you out of the order.

32
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,483
Ah! Why would they?

33
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:25,150
There's a whole list of reasons.

34
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:26,608
You broke formation yet again,

35
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:29,483
let a kid ride your dragon,
and passed out on the job.

36
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,192
I don't have to be a
knight myself to tell ya

37
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:33,442
that kinda stuff's
against the rules.

38
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:35,858
Crap. You've gotta be kidding.

39
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:38,358
I only did that to
save those farmers.

40
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:39,608
Are you okay?

41
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:41,400
Yeah, regardless of
how this turns out,

42
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:43,608
I'm glad we did what
we did back there.

43
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:45,150
I wanna be the kinda
knight-sorcerer

44
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,442
who protects people
no matter what.

45
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:49,858
[MORDRED] And you still
can be, so don't worry.

46
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:52,858
[OCOHO]
Huh? Mordred! Sagramore!

47
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,483
Hey.

48
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,442
[MORDRED] I'm glad to see
that you've recovered.

49
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:59,067
You can rejoin us tomorrow
if you feel up to it.

50
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,233
[OCOHO]
Yeah?

51
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,358
What convinced them
not to kick me out?

52
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,650
I think the higher-ups
were planning to,

53
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:07,233
but Mordred talked to
them on your behalf.

54
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:10,942
Oh, gee. That's twice you've
done that for me now.

55
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:12,817
[MORDRED]
Yeah, well...

56
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,400
I don't wanna lose you, Ocoho.

57
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:16,275
Huh?

58
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,233
I'm saying that as your comrade.

59
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:20,275
Because you're such
an excellent knight.

60
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:22,942
Our missions would be tougher
if you weren't around.

61
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:25,025
I get it.

62
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:27,733
[MORDRED] We said we'd all
become knights together, right?

63
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:30,358
Well, if you get
terminated then, uh--

64
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:31,650
[SAGRAMORE] You won't
become a knight at all.

65
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,442
You'll have to take up
farming or something.

66
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:35,567
[MORDRED] C'mon, this is
s'posed to be a pep talk.

68
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:40,442
It's fine. The ceremony's
coming up, right?

[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

[MISTER BOOBRIE chirping]

71
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:49,567
So all this work's to
get the town ready

72
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,817
for the Ordination Ceremony?

73
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,608
That's right. It's a big deal.

74
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,317
Knight-sorcerer lords gather
from all over the continent

75
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,983
to participate in it.

76
00:04:57,067 --> 00:05:00,358
I see. There are so many
infected in this country.

77
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:02,192
It's almost feels like Artemis.

78
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,150
Cyfandir's a lot bigger
than Artemis,

79
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:07,233
but still, about an eighth of
our population can use Fantasia.

80
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:08,483
[MELIE, DOC]
That's so many!

81
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:10,942
Do you people try
to get infected?

82
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:14,192
As a matter of fact,
we used to.

83
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:17,442
There was an old tradition
involving captive Nemeses.

84
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:21,192
In short, the firstborn son of
every family had to touch one.

85
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:23,608
[MELIE]
But that's so cruel.

86
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,442
[SAGRAMORE] It was abolished
for that reason.

87
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,567
Somewhere around
two generations ago.

88
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,608
[DOC] So what's this
ordination ceremony about?

89
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:32,400
[SAGRAMORE] We graduating
candidates are presented

90
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:33,983
to the lords of the land

91
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,400
so the worthy can be adopted
into their families.

92
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:38,733
Thanks, Sagramore,

93
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:40,775
we really weren't feeling
enough pressure before.

94
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:42,442
You know it'll be fine.

95
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:44,608
There aren't anywhere near
as many knight candidates

96
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,317
as there used to be,
so at the last few ceremonies,

97
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,150
every young knight
presented was accepted

98
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,817
into one of the great families.

99
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,817
[DOC] Which means
they're full knights,

100
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,942
and the next
generation of nobles.

101
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:58,067
This year, it's our turn
to stand before the lords.

102
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,650
You got it.

We're about to join the ranks of
Cyfandir's greatest defenders.

to be functional now.

[SHADOW B]
Perfect timing.

109
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:24,733
One of ours noticed a
group of merchant barons

110
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:28,483
encroaching on our
territory yet again.

111
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,817
The locals took gold from them.

112
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,108
By Merlin, we'll let
no one sell our land

113
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,817
to these foreign vultures.

114
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,275
I want a Spectral Nemesis
in their backyard tomorrow.

115
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:40,108
The farmers do
fear our Spectres,

116
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,483
but that fear hasn't
stopped them

117
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,900
from trading with outsiders yet.

118
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:46,692
[SHADOW B] Regardless,
they will know punishment.

There is no place in Cyfandir
for those who turn their backs

120

on the great Merlin's will.

00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:54,317
[SHADOW A]
And that's what they've done.

122
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,775
Our guardian, the great Merlin,

123
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:58,775
vowed that he would never
share this precious land,

124
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:01,942
or allow it to be divided.

125
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:04,983
And we are sworn to
protect his legacy.

126
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,317
[SHADOW B]
Yes.

As the Faithful of the Hermit,
this is our duty.

yourself before you enter here!

[SHADOW C]
Sorry about that.

130
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:21,858
I assume we've decided to
project another Spectre?

131
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:26,192
If so, I should be able to send
out the Dullahan tonight.

132
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:28,525
Were you able to find
the boy with horns?

133
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:31,233
[SHADOW C] No. Haven't picked
up any trace of him.

134
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,858
He must've run away.

135
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:36,692
No. I can still feel
his presence.

136
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:39,442
I know he's somewhere close.

137
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,942
But I'm sensing
something strange, too.

138
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,775
It almost feels as if
he's slipped into

139
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:46,650
some kind of rift in time.

call it for today.

Hmm.

Hey, quick question.

154
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:51,442
Did you have to train a long
time to learn how to grow trees?

155
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:52,650
With spells, I mean.

156
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,150
[MYR] No, my body has
always been attuned

157
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,275
to the natural world, so
learning how to affect it

158
00:08:56,358 --> 00:08:59,108
didn't take much time at all.

159
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:02,650
I would say that I had a pretty
significant head start on you.

160
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,067
[SETH] Okay, but I can use
Fantasia with my bare hands

161
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,067
just like you.

162
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,650
What makes this so different?

163
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:10,358
[MYR] What makes it different
is that you're just a human.

164
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:13,108
[SETH] Wait a sec.
Are you saying you aren't?

165
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:15,775
Well then, what would
you call yourself?

166
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:17,483
Are you the same as those guys?

167
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,692
[MYR]
Of course not!

168
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,983
Those creatures are
long gone, by the way,

169
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,983
but each left an imprint
in the Fantasia

170
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,900
that permeates this forest.

171
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:27,942
Only those who've opened
their senses can see them.

172
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,733
I have started to see
way more of them

173
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:31,692
since we played
that game of tag.

174
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,150
Well, that's that.

175
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:35,317
Pretty sure this means I've
mastered the salmon sense

176
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,358
you told me about.

177
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,358
It's shaman sense,
you cocky dunce!

178
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:40,275
And I wouldn't be
too proud of myself.

179
00:09:40,358 --> 00:09:42,233
Ocoho could sense the
creatures immediately.

180
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:44,900
She even made them
visible to her friends.

181
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:46,192
Huh?!

182
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,025
[MYR]
She's a gifted sorcerer.

183
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:51,442
One with the ability to tune her
senses to those of others.

184
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,650
Although she might
not realize it yet.

185
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,650
Wow. Sounds pretty impressive.

186
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:01,025
Hold on. You still haven't
answered me, Myr.

187
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:04,692
If you're not a human being
like me, then what are you?

188
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:16,858
An imp! Duh!

189
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:19,483
Why'd you have to yell it
in my ear like that, Myr?

190
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:22,483
Because apparently, you couldn't
hear me the first time!

191
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:23,817
Don't you remember?

192
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,067
You saw my real
body in the Sidh.

193
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,358
Huh? What do you mean?

194
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:31,275
Behold! Ah!

195
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,858
Ah! Your head popped
off your body!

196
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:40,275
This is my real body.

197
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:43,150
As you can see, it comes
complete with two arms and legs.

198
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:45,692
As well as parts that
I'd rather you didn't see.

199
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:47,067
Well, then what's that body?

200
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,442
I made it myself.

201
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,025
Just like your bracelet,
it was crafted

202
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,358
from a combination of special
wood and my own hair.

203
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:57,400
So, fairies and imps and
stuff, they actually exist?

204
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:59,608
[MYR]
Well, they certainly used to,

205
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,775
but unfortunately,
I'm the last of my kind.

206
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:03,942
[SETH]
Huh?

207
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:06,192
You mean all the rest are gone?

208
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,858
[MYR]
Fairies, pixies, imps.

209
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,567
These are all just names for
the "Little People." Smallfolk!

210
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,525
[SETH]
What are Little People?

211
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:24,525
[MYR] A race of beings that
had the power to shape-shift.

212
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:28,150
All of us could use Fantasia.
We consumed it actually.

213
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:29,483
I still do.

214
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,775
[SETH]
You consume Fantasia?

215
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,025
Do you suck it up?

216
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:35,567
[MYR] It's more like I
submerge myself in it.

217
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,775
Back in the day, we'd all
swim through Fantasia

218
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,525
like fish in a great river.

219
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:41,525
Oh. That makes me think.

220
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:43,067
Sometimes when I cast spells,

221
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,317
I feel like I'm submerged
in Fantasia!

222
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,608
So could that mean...
that I'm a fairy, too?

223
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:51,733
[MYR laughing]

224
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:54,192
No, of course you're not
a fairy, ya idiot.

225
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:56,733
Jill and I know how
to recognize our own.

226
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,733
For one thing, you
don't have wings.

227
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:01,692
What do you mean?
I don't see any wings on you.

228
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,650
Well, I'm still just a
child by imp standards,

229
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:05,942
so I have plenty of time
to grow them in.

230
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,900
How old are you anyway?

231
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:09,817
If we're only counting the
human years that have passed,

232
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,775
then I'm 853.

233
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:13,817
Whoa! You're 853?!

234
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,775
Wait, so does that mean
you've been around longer

235
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:16,983
than the whole country?

236
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:18,400
That I have!

237
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:20,733
As a matter of fact, I was
born long before humans

238
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:22,608
had even set foot on this land.

239
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:26,317
Oh. In that case, you must've
known Merlin, right?

240
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,192
The legendary sorcerer?

241
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:30,817
Legend? That's a load
of poppycock!

242
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,067
I'll have you know that the real
Merlin wasn't even a sorcerer!

243
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,942
No?

244
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:36,567
I'll say something else, too.

245
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,358
Merlin never wanted this
country to turn out this way.

246
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:43,025
These humans cut and
build wherever they go

247
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:45,483
with no regard to
what was before.

248
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:49,275
They reduced our great
forest to what it is now.

249
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:52,525
And before long, they may
try to destroy what's left.

250
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,108
Lemme guess.

251
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:56,817
Is the shrinking of the forest
the reason your people died out?

252
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,483
That's only half the story.

253
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:02,483
Primordial forests are
sources of Fantasia.

254
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:06,400
So, as humans chopped them
down, it became sparser.

255
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:07,900
In response to this,

256
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:10,733
my ancestors started
creating small trinkets.

257
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:13,692
Mostly little gems that would
collect and preserve

258
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:17,358
the dwindling supply of Fantasia
that came their way.

259
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:18,983
Then humans got ahold of them

260
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,358
and used them to
make something else.

261
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:24,442
Tools to help sate their greed.

262
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:25,942
This would've brought on a slow,

263
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:28,525
suffocating death
for the pixies,

264
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,942
but rather than go
completely extinct,

265
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:34,233
they chose to end their lives
as conscious individuals

266
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:37,692
and fuse with the larger world.

267
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,942
So your people's
fate is our fault.

268
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:42,317
You're the last imp
because of us.

269
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,775
[MYR grunts]

270
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,483
Come with me.

271
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,942
There's something
I wanna show you.

272
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,983
[MYR] When my people
became one with the world,

273
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:10,983
a sylvan named
Yggdrazil was blessed

274
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,192
with much of their
consciousness.

275
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:14,983
Jill here is his daughter.

276
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,275
She's the love of
my life, a goddess,

277
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:20,400
and the best wife
I could've asked for.

278
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:22,900
So, what did you wanna show me?

279
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:24,400
Look there and you'll see.

280
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:25,608
[SETH]
Huh?

281
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,442
[SETH gasps]

282
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:31,483
We tried for years without luck,

283
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:34,025
and then it suddenly
happened for us.

284
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:35,233
You're saying the Little People

285
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:37,442
are gonna be born back
into the world soon?

286
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:38,983
Yeah.

287
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:41,733
Although they still have to
gestate for another few years.

288
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,108
Till they can fend
for themselves,

289
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:45,275
I'm not going anywhere.

290
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:47,108
And my need to stay
close to this forest

291
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:51,108
is actually one of the reasons
I agreed to train you.

292
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:53,108
Before I can tell you
more than that,

293
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,608
I'll need to see you defeat that
dark power within your core.

294
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:57,733
Can you do it?

295
00:14:57,817 --> 00:14:58,983
[gasps]

296
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,442
Of course!

297
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,608
[MYR]
Listen up.

298
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:14,775
In ancient times, when the world
overflowed with Fantasia,

299
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:17,442
humans could wield it
without any conduit or tool,

300
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,108
just as you and I do.

301
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:21,025
Has anyone ever told you?

302
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:24,192
The word "Fantasia" is from
the ancient language.

303
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:27,983
And it means... "imagination."

304
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,150
[gasps]

305
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:40,150
[screams]

306
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,358
[grunting]

307
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:51,108
[SETH]
You've got this.

308
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:54,108
Just imagine yourself
making it work.

309
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:57,483
[MYR]
Don't forget,

310
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:01,067
a link with Fantasia is
also a link to the world.

311
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:07,275
What's that supposed to mean?
And how does it help me?

312
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:15,817
[screams]

313
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:23,567
You have a link to the
world! Just feel it.

314
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,858
You can trust that bond
to anchor your soul.

315
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:41,692
[SETH] I'm losing feeling
in my whole body.

316
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:45,317
I can think of only
terrible things.

317
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,775
This darkness...
This hatred is crushing me.

318
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:54,900
I'm gonna turn into a monster
that does nothing but destroy.

319
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:56,400
Again.

320
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:35,942
[inaudible]

321
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:11,233
[DOC] Ya usually act
stupidly cheerful,

322
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:13,775
so what's gotten
into you lately?

323
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:15,358
Sorry, Doc.

324
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:18,983
[MELIE] Look, Seth, I know our
situations are different, but...

325
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:24,108
Just try. I'm sure that you can
find a way to beat this thing.

326
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:25,525
[SETH]
Melie.

327
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,025
[SETH gasps]

328
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:35,025
Go, Seth. Let nothing stop you.

329
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:36,983
Change the world.

330
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:55,567
[ALMA] Swear you won't
become a monster.

331
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,150
I won't let you down, Alma.

332
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:15,692
[MYR]
Nicely done, kid!

333
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:18,025
You let your link to the world
pierce through the darkness

334
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:20,817
and subdued that
pesky freeloader.

335
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,108
So then, I'm safe
to be around now?

336
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:25,525
[MYR]
Mh-hm!

337
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:27,400
[chuckles]

338
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:30,233
[SEHT]
Yeah!

339
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:32,358
I did it! I did it!

340
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:34,608
And also, look here.

341
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:35,817
[SETH gasps]

342
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,442
[SETH chuckles]

343
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:39,483
[MYR] Instead of using
Fantasia to destroy,

344
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:41,442
you created something.

345
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,817
It's not much, but it's a start.

346
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,525
This thing's like living proof.
I can do more than destroy.

347
00:19:57,858 --> 00:19:59,817
[MYR]
So, what'll you do now?

348
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,108
[SETH] What I came to
do in the first place.

349
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:04,275
I'll look for leads
about Radiant.

350
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:05,817
Fair enough.

351
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,817
Listen, Seth, we were
honestly hoping

352
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,775
you could help get the world
ready for our kids' arrival.

353
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:15,317
Basically, I'd like you to
destroy with Fantasia less

354
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,483
and create with it a lot more.

355
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:21,317
That's the only way the world
of pixies can be reborn.

356
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,900
I get it.

357
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:26,442
The more stuff I can grow, the
easier a time your kids'll have.

358
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,817
I know it's a big
ask, so thanks.

359
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,733
[SETH] Hey. Didn't I heal
inside a bubble like that?

360
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:34,025
Indeed you did.

361
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,942
In that case, I kinda
feel like your kids

362
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,692
are my little siblings.

363
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:38,733
[BOTH chuckle]

364
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:40,483
You can look at it like that.

365
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:43,650
Everything's related in nature,
if you think about it.

366
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:45,608
Yeah, it really is.

367
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:47,858
Thanks for everything, Myr.

368
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:50,025
Because of you,
I've learned a lot.

369
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:53,567
I'm wanna use Fantasia the right
way as much as I can now.

370
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,150
Yeah. And I won't stop there.

371
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,858
I'mma find Radiant
and figure out a way

372
00:20:57,942 --> 00:21:00,317
to end Nemesis attacks for good.

373
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,858
That'll make your kids'
lives even easier!

374
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:04,108
What a goal.

375
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:06,567
That would certainly be
worth celebrating, Seth.

376
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,650
Huh?

377
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:11,233
[SETH] Your big brother's
headin' out for now.

378
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:13,067
Wish me luck, okay?

379
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,233
Ah! Get your hands off
them, you dirty human!

380
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:21,067
Oh! Look, Jill! They're moving!

381
00:21:22,317 --> 00:21:24,442
It's almost like they know
we're waiting for them.

382
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:25,775
Of course they know.

383
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:28,358
And I'm sure they're just
as eager to come out.

384
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:30,483
They look pretty excited!

385
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:35,317
[SETH]
Thanks a million, Jill.

386
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,150
For saving my life.

387
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,067
[JILL]
Interesting.

388
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,067
So you can communicate
through the Sidh now.

389
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,400
Impressive.

390
00:21:45,483 --> 00:21:47,608
[SETH] I'm heading out,
but I won't leave Cyfandir

391
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:49,817
without coming back to see you.

392
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,775
I'll catch ya later,
all right, Myr?

393
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:54,150
Thanks again for all
the good lessons!

394
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,442
We haven't been alone
in quite some time now.

395
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:02,442
[MYR]
Mhm.

396
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:03,567
[JILL giggles]

397
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,108
Oh! I just thought
of a great new song!

398
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:10,567
♪ Oh, my darling Jill,
goddess of these woods. ♪

399
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,317
♪ Please give me a taste
of your lovely goods. ♪

400
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,400
[JILL]
Oh, Myr. So naughty!

401
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:28,317
So everything in this
world is connected.

402
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,525
Got it.

403
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,983
[SETH]
I'll be back soon, guys!

404
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:34,942
I'm on my way!

405
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:11,317
[NARRATOR]
The castle bustles as the day

406
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,067
of the Ordination
Ceremony draws near.

407
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,525
Lord Brangoire follows
Ocoho into a country field.

408
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:19,025
Convinced that she's behind

409
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:22,983
the recent Spectral Nemesis
appearances, he attacks her.

410
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:26,483
It seems that Ocoho will fight
back and escalate the conflict,

411
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:29,067
but Seth shows up to intervene.

412
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,567
Next time on <i>Radiant</i> ,

413
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,400
"The Truth Is Like a Curse."
