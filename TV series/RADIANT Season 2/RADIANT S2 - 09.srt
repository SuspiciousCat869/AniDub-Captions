While his wounded body slept,

Seth reconciled with Melie
in a realm called the Sidh.

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,192
Once he's healed, Seth wishes to
stay with Myr in Caillte Forest

4
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:22,650
to train and learn how
to control his rampages.

[DOC] Do ya really think
following a mushroom

7
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:31,275
is a good idea?

8
00:00:31,358 --> 00:00:32,275
[OCOHO]
Don't worry!

9
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:33,650
Myr promised that
this little guy

10
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:34,983
would lead us out of the forest.

11
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,400
We'll be fine.

12
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:37,942
[DOC]
If you say so.

13
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:39,525
I just don't understand why Seth

14
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:42,775
would wanna stay in
this crazy forest anyway.

15
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:45,358
Seth decided that this is
what's best right now.

16
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:46,942
So all we can do
is believe in him

17
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:48,983
and hope his training
with Myr goes okay.

[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,317
Yeah, I agree.

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,317
But listen, judging from
what Seth told us,

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,983
the Spectral Nemeses
we've been fighting

22
00:00:57,067 --> 00:01:00,067
are just projections being sent
from beneath the castle.

23
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,608
Plus, Seth told her
the guy behind it

24
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:04,108
has a whole lotta scars
and couple'a ghost friends.

25

If that doesn't give
you the creeps,

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,692
then I don't know what will.

27
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,233
When we get back, we can
tell the knights about this.

28
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:11,317
We can't! Absolutely not!

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,275
What, so we're just
supposed to keep quiet

30
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:15,275
and let them get away
with everything?

No, of course not.

32
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:18,525
But for a conspiracy
this elaborate

33
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:20,983
to be kept under
wraps for so long,

34
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,942
the people pulling the
strings would need to have

My queen!

Do you happen to know what it is

50
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,483
that holds all the people
of our nation together?

51
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,608
It's the trust we have
for one another.

52
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:40,150
[BRANGOIRE]
Of course.

53
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:43,150
The people trust in the knights,
the knights in their queen,

54
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:47,567
and I place my trust in you,
all of my precious subjects.

55
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,817
These Specters are beginning to
threaten the trust we've built.

56
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,108
If this sacred bond we
all share is betrayed,

57
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:57,150
it will give people like
the merchant barons

58
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:00,192
the chance to steal
our land away from us.

59
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:01,483
[OCOHO]
Betrayed?

60
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,025
[BRANGOIRE]
Absolutely.

61
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:06,275
We've mobilized our forces to
prepare for any eventuality.

62
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:10,150
Very well. However,
the people have doubts.

63
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:14,025
Some have begun to question
your strength as a leader.

64
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:15,692
There were complaints
about your conduct

65
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:17,442
in our most recent battle.

66
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:20,608
The word "disgraceful"
came up at least once.

67
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:22,442
Your attack was delayed.

68
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:26,567
And the Spectres disappeared.
To where, you have no idea.

69
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,233
Well, that was because
of two insubordinates

70
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:31,400
who refused to obey my orders.

71
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:33,317
As I've been informed.

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
So what happened?

73
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,192
Why did you choose
to break formation

74
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,108
and attempt to prevent
an attack on Spectres

75
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:40,233
you'd been ordered to slay?

76
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,692
[MORDRED] Your Highness,
may I have a word?

77
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:52,025
[BOUDICA] I will allow
it this time, Mordred.

78
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:54,692
It's my opinion that Ocoho's
intervention is the reason

79
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,650
we're alive right now.

80
00:04:57,858 --> 00:04:59,317
[MORDRED] The Spectres
started fighting each other

81
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,525
right after Ocoho
stopped our attack.

82
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:03,942
If we'd been allowed
to continue our charge,

83
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:06,733
I think most of us would've
been crushed between them.

84
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:08,567
Is that why you stopped them?

85
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,025
I'm sorry. I don't know
what I was thinking.

86
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:15,358
Yes, well, at any rate,
it would seem that the person

87
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:17,942
I actually need to reprimand
is Lord Brangoire,

88

somersault to your grace.

Wait a second.

This is Lord de Gulis, first
knight to defeat a Spectre?

Listen, Gulis,

109
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:09,400
I need you to take command
of the knight candidates for me.

110
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:12,608
Of course! Just leave everything
to me, my beautiful queen!

111
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:15,275
You know that I, Gulis,
would leap into a fiery inferno

112
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,775
or even thorny roses
for Your Majesty.

pierced my heart.

Take this rose, I beg you.

That'll be all. Everyone
is dismissed and may go.

There's no need to be coy.

129
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,150
[MELIE] ...hole to die in,
you creepy old goat.

130
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:57,483
Not only did you
disobey orders,

131
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:00,233
you also entered Caillte Forest.

132
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:04,192
I didn't think you were the type
to go and break the rules.

133
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:07,983
This kind of behavior is
unbecoming of a future knight.

134
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:12,275
However, it is super becoming
of a badass rebel.

135
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:13,483
You go, girl.

136
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,900
I'm seriously proud
of you, ya know that?

137
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:18,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

138
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:21,275
You should know that I fully
support all your efforts.

139
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,233
You remind me of myself
before I became queen.

140
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:25,067
[OCOHO]
Oh, yeah?

141
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,192
Wow. That's such an honor!

142
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:29,442
Just be very careful
from now on.

143
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:32,400
There are many actions that
men are always praised for,

144
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:34,233
but when a woman
behaves the same way,

145
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:36,567
she'll be labeled
as impertinent.

146
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,108
[BOUDICA] They may hold
me in the highest regard,

147
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,567
but the knights are
still a society of men.

148
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,692
And many of them do not
look upon you favorably.

149
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:47,400
Listen very carefully.

150
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:50,442
You would do well to try and
lay low until your ordination.

151
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:51,025
Got it?

152

O-Oh. Okay!

But enough of that!

155
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,317
What was the forest like?
Was it gorgeous?

156
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,692
You just have to tell me!

157
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:01,817
[OCOHO] Uh. Well, it was...
it was pretty weird.

How was it "weird"?

159
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,067
Oh. Um.

160
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,192
For one thing, there were
walking mushrooms.

161
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:08,983
[BOUDICA]
Really? What else was there?

162
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,358
--[OCOHO] What else?
--[BOUDICA] Uh-huh.

163
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,817
[OCOHO] We did see a lot of
different colored birds

164
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
that I'd never seen before.

165
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:15,692
[BOUDICA]
Oh!

166
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:21,192
[SETH]
Where am I?

167
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,733
I feel like this would
be a good time

168
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:27,192
for you to pop him out of there.

169
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:28,817
He might drown if you leave him.

170
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,525
You think so? Humans really
are fragile creatures.

171
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,317
What is this?! Are you
tryin' to kill me?!

172
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
My, what an awful thank you!

173
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:44,608
For your information,
you would've died ages ago

174
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,400
if I hadn't placed you in there.

175
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:48,233
Jill kept you immersed
in that sap

176
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:51,942
so that your body could
completely heal itself.

177
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:53,733
I didn't know that's
what it was for.

178
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:56,525
Here ya go. Put some
clothes on, would ya?

179
00:08:57,608 --> 00:08:59,317
My body feels like
it just woke up

180
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,692
from the longest nap
I've ever had.

181
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,858
Of course it does.

182
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,983
In your human time,
I'd say it's been...

183
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:06,983
...about two years, probably.

184
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,400
What?! Two years?!

185
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:10,983
[JILL] I think it's been
closer to three, honey.

186
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:11,858
My mistake.

187
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,400
I always lose track of the time

188
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:15,442
when I'm with my
sweet morning glory.

189
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,358
Oh, Myr! You sweet talker!

190
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:18,942
Would you cut that out already?!

191
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,650
Good grief! This can't be right!
What happened to everyone else?

192
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:25,317
[MYR] Who knows? I haven't
seen 'em for a while now.

193
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,942
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!
I'm gonna be dead meat!

194
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,400
If I've actually gone three
years without calling Alma,

195
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:31,608
she's gonna murder me!

196
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:33,442
This can't be happening.

197
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:38,442
Stop panicking and listen
to me. You'll be fine.

198
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:39,692
Time moves differently here--

199
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:42,942
it's not as boring as it
is in the world of man.

200
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:46,525
Time moves differently in here?
But what does that mean?

201
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,108
Think of it this way.

202
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:50,775
If you imagine that human time
is moving along a straight line,

203
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:54,775
time within Caillte Forest is
like a circle stuck to the line.

204
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:56,983
This place has its own
unique flow of time

205
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:59,192
that's unrelated to
the outside world.

206
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,275
No matter how many
years you spend here,

207
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:02,775
if you want it to happen,

208
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:05,442
you can choose to leave
the forest at a point in time

209
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:07,692
just after you entered.

210
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,942
So when you said it's
been two or three years

211
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,025
since I got here...

212
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:12,483
[MYR]
We told you the length of time

213
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:15,192
that had passed within the
forest, not outside it.

214
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:18,525
Get it? You can leave at
any point in time you please.

215
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:22,275
I don't really
understand it, but I guess!

216
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:24,608
This means I can train
as much as I want, that right?

217
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,233
You wish to stay here and train?

218
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:29,400
Why exactly do you think it
important that you do so?

219
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:30,983
Well, uh,

220
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:33,567
I've gotta learn how to control
this dangerous power of mine.

221
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,900
It's important 'cause I can't
hurt my friends ever again.

222
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:38,942
[MYR]
Mh-hm.

223
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:42,608
Okay.

224
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:44,817
Well, it really isn't
any of my business,

225
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,567
but feel free to
train on your own.

226
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,650
Hey! Would you please
hold on for a second?

227
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,358
You have to be the
one to train me!

228
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,608
You use Fantasia with your
bare hands like I do,

229
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,442
so it makes perfect sense!

230
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:56,275
[MYR]
Hm?

231
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:58,858
[SETH] Please, Myr!
Help me become stronger!

232
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:01,525
Teach me how to control
Fantasia like you do!

233
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:05,483
Well, you may be ignorant,
but at least you're determined.

234
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:08,650
If you really want me to train
you that badly, then, uh,

235
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:10,067
yeah, sure.

236
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,150
Prove your worth by
trying to catch me.

237
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:16,608
Hah! I don't think you
have it in you though!

238
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:19,150
Heh! Really?

239
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:32,692
[MYR] It's not only time
that's different here.

240
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,817
Space can also expand
and contract.

241
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,567
Be sure to look closely,
listen carefully,

242
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,817
and feel the very
world around you.

243
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,983
If you can't manage that, you'll
never be able to catch me.

244
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,650
Most of that sounds
like gibberish to me,

245
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:48,067
but if you wanna play
tag, I'm down.

246
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:52,942
You gotta be kidding!

247
00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:00,025
[yells]

248
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:04,275
[SETH]
Ow.

249
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,150
[MYR] You really aren't
paying attention.

250
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:09,150
You think that everything in
this forest is your enemy.

251
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,525
Oh, yeah?

252
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:12,567
The land you walk on every day

253
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,483
and the wind that blows
through your hair.

254
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,442
It's important that you
open up your senses

255
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:18,983
to the things around you
and become one with the world,

256
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:21,567
instead of acting
like its enemy.

257
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,525
I just don't understand
what you mean by that.

258
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:31,775
[SETH yells]

259
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:33,108
[MYR chuckles]

260
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:35,942
That was pretty good for
your first time. Not bad.

261
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:38,442
But the moment you fully opened
your senses to the world,

262
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,525
you closed them off again.

263
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:41,692
Huh?

264
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:54,358
I was wondering, Myr.

265
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:55,733
[MYR]
Mh-hm?

266
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,733
What made you decide to
help him with his training?

267
00:12:57,817 --> 00:13:00,900
You remember that boy Yaga?
He asked me to do it.

268
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:03,608
And he's a member of the
Thirteen Sorcerer Coven.

269
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:06,400
So that's the only reason
you're doing all of this?

270
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:09,567
I think you might just be
planning something else.

271
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:14,192
[gasps] You can't run away!

272
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:15,858
[MYR]
Hey, Seth! Put your pants on!

273
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:17,525
We're gonna go one more lap!

274
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:19,275
[SETH]
Ah, come on! Already?

275
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:20,650
[MYR]
Now don't drag your feet.

276
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,317
[sighs]

277
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:03,192
It feels like he's picked
up the pace today!

278
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:10,817
I managed to dodge it!

279
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,858
But what was that feeling?

280
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:21,483
[SETH]
It happened again.

281
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:24,067
I was able to feel them
coming somehow.

282
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:26,567
[SETH]
Water.

283
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,150
[SETH]
Wind.

284
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,567
What could that be?

285
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,108
Is it Myr?

286
00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:44,983
I can sense it.

287
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,650
Huh?

288
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:54,692
[chuckles]

289
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:57,733
I finally caught you.

290
00:14:57,817 --> 00:14:59,317
Thanks a bunch for the help!

291
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,608
Good work.

292
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,192
It would seem that you've
learned how to sense

293
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:04,317
and work with the
world around you.

294
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,817
And now that I've caught
you, you'll teach me

295
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,525
how I can control Fantasia
like you do, right?

296
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,858
I don't remember
agreeing to do that.

297
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,400
[SETH]
Huh?

298
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:15,067
It feels as though you humans
never learn anything at all.

299
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,358
You don't actually understand

300
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:18,817
a bit of what you
just did, now do you?

301
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,525
What are you talking about?

302
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:22,025
Listen carefully.

303
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:25,150
You must think of Fantasia
like it's the air we breathe.

304
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,108
If all you ever do is gather
a whole bunch of it

305
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,942
and then force it back out
all at once... it's a fart.

306
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:32,317
[SETH yells]

307
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,608
A fart?

308
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:35,233
So communicating with nature

309
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:38,025
and sensing your
surroundings is essential.

310
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:39,775
You were only able
to catch me earlier

311
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:42,317
because you opened your
senses up to the Fantasia

312
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,858
that fills this space and then
became one with all of it.

313
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:48,025
You mean I was sensing Fantasia.

314
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:50,983
Thanks to the sap that Jill used
to heal those wounds of yours,

315
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:53,108
there is now a tiny
part of this forest

316
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:54,775
residing within your body.

317
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:57,608
Because of that, you now have
the ability to sense this place

318
00:15:57,692 --> 00:16:02,067
and its Fantasia as if it was
an extension of your very being.

319
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,733
[SETH]
That must be why.

320
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:05,275
When you're in harmony
with the world,

321
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:08,775
you can use Fantasia
to do things like this.

322
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:12,275
Uh! Wait a sec!

323
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:13,317
What're you doing, Myr?

324
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,733
[SETH screaming]

325
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,608
You can use it not just to
destroy, but also to create.

326
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:31,150
It's about more than just
making a bunch of noise

327
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:32,608
and spitting fire.

328
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,942
Used wisely, magic has
boundless potential.

329
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:37,608
[SETH]
Amazing.

330
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:39,400
[MYR]
But for a case like yours,

331
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:42,525
merely harmonizing with
Fantasia won't be enough.

332
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:46,442
You'll have to defeat that
which dwells within you first.

333
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:49,442
You mean the thing inside me
that makes me lose control?

334
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:52,317
Well, it's more like that
thing is a freeloader

335
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,942
living inside you and taking
over when things get tricky.

336
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:59,233
Then what can I do about it?

337
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:04,358
[MYR] Gather as much
Fantasia as you can.

338
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:06,233
Push yourself to your limits.

339
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,567
Once you do that, he'll have
to make an appearance.

340
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:15,400
He's coming now.

341
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:18,983
Be sure you're prepared to throw
everything you have at him!

342
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:28,567
[yells]

343
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:34,233
[screams]

344
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:36,525
Stay strong and don't let go.

345
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:38,192
Keep holding onto
the link you share

346
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,025
with the rest of the world.

347
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:44,067
I'm trying my hardest,
but it's just too strong.

348
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,858
[screams]

349
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:51,858
[yells]

350
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:01,025
[MYR]
Hmph.

351
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:09,317
Ah, man, my head.

352
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,942
You lost control
and attacked me,

353
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:12,942
so I reflexively kicked
you into the sky

354
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,275
and punched you into a tree.

355
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:18,400
[SETH]
I get it. The plan didn't work.

356
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:19,650
[MYR]
Tell me, what did you feel

357
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,983
when the freeloader
took control?

358
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,525
Could you see your surroundings?

359
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:25,817
[SETH]
Yeah.

360
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,150
I could, but I definitely
felt cut off

361
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:31,233
from the Fantasia of
the forest around me.

362
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:35,192
And also, I don't feel
anything from it.

363
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:37,858
The freeloader's pretty
much just a void.

364
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:40,150
Aren't you able to feel it
fighting you as you struggle

365
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:42,192
to keep control of your body?

366
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:43,650
[SETH]
No.

367
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:47,275
I don't know how to explain
the feeling, but I'll try.

368
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:48,983
The freeloader is like
a hole in the wall

369
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,150
that's built up around me.

370
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:53,692
And from time to time,
it feels like someone

371
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:56,942
is watching me
through that hole.

372
00:18:57,025 --> 00:18:59,692
Let's try this one
more time, okay, Seth?

373
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:01,275
If we succeed,
you could find out

374
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:03,817
who's on the other
side of that hole.

375
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:07,650
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, the mysterious man

376
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:11,650
known as Diabal and his comrades
were still searching for Seth.

377
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,233
What they feared most was
that the puppet master

378
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:16,317
pulling the strings
would find them.

379
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,400
The man named Piodon.

380
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:20,733
[SHADOW A]
It's no use.

381
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:23,067
We can't find the location
of the boy with horns.

382
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,358
[SHADOW B] We had the other
members help us search,

383
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:27,775
but they had no more
luck than we did.

384
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:30,192
With all the knight-sorcerers
you call your comrades,

385
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:33,233
you'd think that you could
organize a proper manhunt.

386
00:19:33,317 --> 00:19:34,567
[SHADOW A]
Diabal,

387
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,567
you could've easily used
your power to stop the boy

388
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,192
when he first snuck in.

389
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:42,317
[SHADOW B] Exactly.
It's your fault he escaped.

390
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,400
No, Piodon might've
found me if I'd used it.

391
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:48,483
[SHADOW A] Piodon. He's the
one you're hiding from?

392
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,067
The one who wounded you?

393
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,608
That's right.

394
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,525
As long as I can stay hidden
within this castle's barrier,

395
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:56,608
he can never track me down.

396
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:57,775
[SHADOW B]
So that's why you want

397
00:19:57,858 --> 00:19:59,983
to protect the castle so much.

398
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:03,567
Seeing as our job is to guard
this land from foreign enemies,

399
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,442
we're glad you
share our interests.

400
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:09,983
[SHADOW A]
Back to the boy with horns.

401
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:13,442
Do you think his appearance
here was Piodon's doing?

402
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:16,317
I'm not sure. But it
doesn't actually matter.

403
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,025
I'm completely certain Piodon's
using the boy to gain something.

404
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:22,067
That's just the way he works.

405
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,317
And if the boy should fail
to meet his expectations,

406
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,983
he'll be broken.

407
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:29,942
Just like I was.

408
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:37,692
You're doing well, Seth.

409
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:39,983
Before the show gets started,
I'll enter the Sidh

410
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,608
so I can obsesrve
what's happening to you

411
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:43,608
there in that plane.

412
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:50,483
[MYR]
Now.

413
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:53,525
It's time to take control
of this freeloader.

414
00:20:58,692 --> 00:20:59,942
[SETH yells]

415
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,567
[MYR]
I can see it clearly.

416
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,900
It's stretching its feelers
out in every direction,

417
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:09,858
all to try and control the orb
that's surrounding you.

418
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:11,525
If it manages to do that,

419
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:14,567
you'll lose all
control over yourself.

420
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,108
But I still can't tell exactly
what this thing is.

421
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,775
[SETH]
Myr! What's happening?

422
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:27,442
Is something wrong?

423
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:29,150
I can see what you mean now.

424
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,358
Seems like you were
right about this, Seth.

425
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:33,858
This thing of yours is nothing
more than a peephole.

426
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,442
If the strength of
your will weakens

427
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:37,858
and you lose the
orb's protection,

428
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:40,858
I think it intends to make
you some kind of offering.

429
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:41,900
[SETH]
What do you mean?

430
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:43,983
Who would I even be
an offering for?

431
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:45,650
I'm not sure yet.

432
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:48,442
It's something that's
looking for you.

433
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:50,317
And your freeloader
is trying its best

434
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,275
to help that something
find you here.

435
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:56,400
Agh. This is getting to be
more than I can handle.

436
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,192
That's enough for now.

437
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,983
[MYR]
So I was right.

438
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:10,650
When it can't see through the
peephole, it decides to leave.

439
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:12,150
I need to know, Seth.

440
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:13,983
If this is from your "brother,"

441
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:17,150
why would he put something
like this inside of you?

442
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:20,858
Do you really think his
objective was to save your life?

443
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:10,608
[NARRATOR]
Lord de Gulis leads

444
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:13,067
the knight-sorcerer
candidates to battle.

445
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,317
He defeats a Nemesis
with a single blow,

446
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,442
and upon learning that
another is nearby,

447
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:21,067
challenges Lord Brangoire
to slay it before he can.

448
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,442
Ocoho and Melie lag behind,
which means they're alone

449
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:28,650
when they see the fallen Nemesis
split into numerous small ones.

450
