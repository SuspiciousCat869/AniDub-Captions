00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:12,525
[NARRATOR] Thanks to a
mischievous eccentric named Myr,

2
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:16,150
Seth met Ocoho, a
knight-sorcerer candidate.

3
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:18,483
But as they battled
a Spectral Nemesis,

4
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:21,567
Seth tried to protect Ocoho
from a powerful blow

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,358
and was knocked off
her dragon's back.

6
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:25,358
Oh, no!

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,483
Seth!

8
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:29,442
Someone just severed contact!

9
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:32,150
First reserve unit,
take their place at once!

10
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,775
[KNIGHT-SORCERER A]
Out of the way, Ocoho!

11
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:36,567
Wait, listen! My pilot
got knocked off our mount!

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,942
[KNIGHT-SORCERER A] You broke
out of the Gysoni spell,

13
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:40,400
so right now, you're
getting in the way!

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,650
Well, then...

15
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:23,525
[NARRATOR]
"The Bringer of Calamity."

16
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:28,400
[FARMER A]
Uh! Just look at that thing.

17
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:30,858
[FARMER'S WIFE A] Let's go.
We need to get further back!

18
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,233
[FARMER A] But we can't
just leave the fields

19
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:33,400
to be destroyed.

20
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:35,317
[FARMER'S SON A]
Hey, Dad, look over there!

21
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,817
[SETH screaming]

22
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,650
[ALL gasp]

23
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,067
[sighs] Wow.
That was a close one.

24
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,483
My left arm has lost the
ability to gather Fantasia.

25
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:57,858
Must be 'cause that's
where Torque hit me.

26
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:02,400
But on the plus side, my right
hand seems to be working fine.

27
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,983
[FARMER'S SON A] Cool!
That knight-sorcerer has horns!

28
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:07,525
There's no way they'd let
a sorcerer with horns

29
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:08,775
become a knight.

30
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:11,317
[SETH] Hey! Why haven't
you people run away yet?

31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,233
Didn't you notice
a giant Nemesis?

32
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:15,025
[FARMER A]
Yeah, it's pretty hard to miss!

33
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:16,233
We were workin' the fields

34
00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:18,567
when that thing popped
up outta nowhere.

35
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,275
Hang on.

36
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:22,233
Did any of you see something
fall from the sky

37
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:24,067
before all this happened?

38
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,192
We didn't see nothin' like that.

39
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:27,900
One second everythin'
was normal,

40
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:31,483
and the next, that big sucker
was towerin' over our heads!

41
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,567
This just gets weirder.

42
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,567
Well, anyway, it's dangerous
here, so you need to run!

43
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,817
[OCOHO]
Seth!

44
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:42,400
[SETH]
Hey, Ocoho!

45
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:45,317
You're still alive!
That's so good to see!

46
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,442
'Course I am! Gah!

47
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,400
[OCOHO laughs]

48
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:49,650
Let go of me, Ocoho!

49
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,567
I give, I give, I give,
I give, I give! Gah!

50
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,900
Why did you try to block that
Nemesis with your bare hands?

51
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:56,275
It would've been fine,

52
00:03:56,358 --> 00:03:58,942
except I couldn't get
my magic to work right!

53
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:01,275
Well, then you should've
just had Draccoon dodge it!

54
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:03,233
That's what I gave
you the reins for!

55
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:05,900
I told you, I don't know how
to ride a friggin' dragon!

56
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:07,483
[ALL gasp]

57
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:10,692
What was that? Maybe an
attack from the Nemesis?

58
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:13,108
Don't think so. Look up high.

59
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,775
All of their assaults are going
straight through its body.

60
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:25,150
It has to be weakened
before Mordred and Sagramore

61
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:26,775
can finish it off.

62
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:33,858
No. All that grain
was ready for harvest.

63
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:35,233
It was ready.

64
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,442
I told you this would happen!

65
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:37,733
You brought this upon us

66
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:39,733
when you decided to
deal with that foreigner!

67
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:41,608
Look, what's done is done.

68
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:44,858
There were omens. You saw
the Dullahan, right, Dad?

69
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:46,233
This is 'cause of the curse.

70
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:48,358
The curse!

71
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:50,233
"Dullahan"?

72
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:52,983
Hey, Seth, we need to
get out of here fast.

73
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:54,483
More attacks'll be hitting soon.

74
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:55,733
[SETH gasps]

75
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,983
Huh?

76
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:03,650
Seth, wait!

77
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:08,733
I can't move with this on!

78
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:12,108
Repulse!

79
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:16,692
[gasps]

80
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:21,942
[SETH]
Thanks, Ocoho!

81
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:23,733
That shield is crazy awesome!

82
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:25,358
Hey, what're you doing?

83
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:27,942
Shouldn't you have at least
created a Dome of Protection?

84
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:29,858
[SETH]
Uhh... dunno what that is.

85
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:31,400
But are you saying that
there's a way to protect

86
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:34,275
the farmer's land
from all those attacks?

87
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:37,400
Maybe, but I haven't
been ordered to.

88
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:40,400
Ordered to? And why
should that matter?

89
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,983
Were your fellow knights
ordered to destroy this farm?

90
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,775
Of course they weren't,
you know that.

91
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:46,317
But we have to bring
down the Nemesis--

92
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,233
it's our sworn duty!

93
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:51,108
And you think that means you can
blast whatever's in your way?

94
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:54,067
I thought you were doing
this to protect the people.

95
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,775
If you guys destroy this farm,
you're as bad as the Nemesis.

96
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:07,567
It isn't always enough just
to save people's lives.

97
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,067
If they lose their
farm right now,

98
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,192
those people will
probably starve.

99
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:13,900
I'mma stop that.

100
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:16,150
You gonna help me, or what?

101
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,358
Okay, you've convinced me.

102
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,775
[OCOHO] But protecting an area
this large, that's tough.

103
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,025
I'll need some backup.

104
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:27,942
How do you mean?

105
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:30,650
[OCOHO] I can create a
Protective Dome myself.

106
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:33,692
The thing is, its size will
depend on how much Fantasia

107
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:36,525
I can put into it, and we
can gather more together.

108
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:37,983
'Kay, got it.

109
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,067
Here we go.

110
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,775
Cromen!

111
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:50,192
[KNIGHT-SORCERER A]
What's going on?

112
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:51,650
[KNIGHT-SORCERER C] All our
Fantasia's getting sucked

113
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,150
towards the ground!

114
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,567
[OCOHO] It feels as if
there's a sea of Fantasia

115
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,108
flowing through him.

116
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:04,608
It's like he's drawing it in
through every pore of his skin.

117
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,400
Who the heck is this guy?

118
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:10,733
[MORDRED] Lord Brangoire!
Our Gysoni link is going to--!

[gasps]

120
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:16,317
[MORDRED]
Seems that dome is consuming

121
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,067
all the Fantasia nearby.

122
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,442
[SAGRAMORE]
Mordred, look!

123
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:21,775
The Nemesis is disappearing!

124
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,483
Let's attack it while we can.

125
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:24,817
All right.

00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:38,483
[SETH chuckles]

129
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:40,692
Think your chrome dome worked.

130
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:43,150
[OCOHO]
Huh?

131
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:46,442
But I've never seen a
Nemesis like that before.

132
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:53,983
[FARMER C]
The place is a mess.

133
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:56,983
Things could've been worse,
but this still isn't good.

134
00:07:57,067 --> 00:08:00,233
A big chunk of our harvest
is unsellable now.

[BRANGOIRE]
Thanks to your diligent efforts,

136
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:10,483
we have successfully vanquished
yet another Spectral Nemesis.

137
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:11,983
[SETH]
Whoa!

138
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:13,525
[BRANGOIRE]
Excellent work.

139
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:18,192
I have no doubt that you'll
become fine knight-sorcerers.

140
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:21,817
Well, two of you will.
Care to guess which?

141
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,317
Mordred and Sagramore!

142
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,483
The only candidates here
who followed my orders.

143
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:29,400
All the rest of you are
just useless maggots!

144
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:33,067
I never called off the attack,
so why did you break formation?

145
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,442
Do you think that's how
real knight-sorcerers fight?

146
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:40,317
[KNIGHT-SORCERER B] Um, with
all due respect, Lord Brangoire,

147
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,650
we stopped fighting because
there wasn't enough Fantasia

148
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,525
to keep the confinement
spell going.

149
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,067
What do you mean?

150
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,317
[KNIGHT-SORCERER B] Well, Ocoho
cast that spell from below,

151
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,317
and then all the
Fantasia was gone.

152
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,150
[KNIGHT-SORCERER D] Yeah,
that's how it happened, sir.

153
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:55,858
Damn you! Why'd you cast
a spell from the ground?

154
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:58,608
I didn't even give you
permission to be on the ground!

155
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:00,358
Explain yourself, Ocoho!

156
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:03,108
Um, sorry, sir, but I'm Ocoho.

[clears throat]

159
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,567
Doesn't matter!

160
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,275
Let's set the record straight!

161
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:10,817
How many times do
I have to tell you

162
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,025
that on your own,
you're nothing?!

163
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:15,608
Your personal ambitions
are just rust on the chain

164
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:17,025
your comrades have formed!

165
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:17,900
But, sir, I--

166
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,150
[BRANGOIRE]
No more excuses!

167
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,067
I don't care about your
talents, your abilities,

168
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,733
or your family line.

169
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:24,400
If you wanna be
in the spotlight,

170
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:26,567
go become a bard, or a juggler!

171
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,942
Or join up with those
buffoons at Artemis!

172
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:32,108
But don't waste the
time of the Order!

173
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:35,025
Have you lost sight of
the great Merlin's teachings?

174
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,400
Gysoni allows us all to
fight together in harmony!

175
00:09:38,483 --> 00:09:39,817
Don't forget that!

176
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,983
[BOUDICA] Lord Brangoire,
you haven't changed a bit.

177
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:44,233
Don't interrupt!

178
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:48,442
Oh. My apologies, Your Majesty!

179
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,275
[giggles]

180
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:05,442
Our wise sovereign, Her Majesty
Queen Boudica, is here!

181
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,275
[BRANGOIRE]
Knights! Bow to your queen!

182
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,608
You don't have to kneel.

183
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:13,358
But since you're
going to anyway,

184
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:16,317
I think you'd better get
down on both your knees.

185
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,025
[BRANGOIRE]
Oh. O-Of course.

186
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:19,567
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

187
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,775
She's a giant. Could
that be her infection?

188
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:25,900
[BRANGOIRE]
My queen, I wasn't expecting you

189
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:27,692
to honor us with
your presence here.

190
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:28,942
If I'd known you were coming,

191
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:30,483
I would've waited
before reprimanding--

192
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,150
That's quite all right.

193
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,900
I came here on a whim,
so you couldn't have known.

194
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:39,150
Although I wish you had taken
more care with your positioning.

195
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:43,067
From where you're kneeling now,
you can see up my skirt.

196
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,275
[gasps]

197
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:46,525
[BRANGOIRE]
I'm so sorry! Please forgive me!

198
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,442
It's fine.

199
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:52,442
I came out here because I wanted
to see a Spectral Nemesis.

200
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:55,358
They have caused my people
to suffer, have they not?

201
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:56,692
[FARMER B]
Yes, my queen.

202
00:10:56,775 --> 00:11:00,733
When my people are in pain,
I feel it as my own.

203
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:04,983
Please forgive me for my failure
to protect you from this threat.

204
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:08,400
Aw. No need to blame
yourself, Your Majesty.

205
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:11,150
I 'preciate your kindness
and your concern.

206
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:14,275
This was rough for us, 'n our
fields'll need time to recover.

207
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:16,150
But thanks to those brave
knights of yours,

208
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:18,567
we've got somethin'
to rebuild from.

209
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,608
I'm so glad to hear that.

210
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:23,775
However, I think your head
should be a bit lower.

211
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:26,775
[FARMER B yelping]

212
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:29,108
Um. Please, my queen.

213
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:31,942
Your people are afraid of more
than them Spectral Nemeses.

214
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,692
Who gave you permission
to address the queen directly?

215
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:36,400
I'm giving it now.

216
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:37,608
Majesty.

217
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:40,567
Your head, Brangoire.
Do remember.

218
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,233
[BRANGOIRE yelps]

219
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:46,067
As I was saying, the people's
anguish is my own.

220
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,317
Now tell me, good farmer,

221
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,817
what is it that so
frightens my subjects?

222
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,400
[FARMER B]
Well, um.

223
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:55,817
Whenever night falls, we see it.
The Dullahan stalks these hills!

224
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,150
The Dullahan?

225
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,858
[FARMER B]
It's a mighty scary spirit

226
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:01,192
that carries its head
in its arms, you see.

227
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:02,608
And believe it or not,

228
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:04,358
it started showing
up in this area

229
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:07,150
about the same time as
the Spectral Nemeses.

230
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,108
How horrifying.

231
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:11,108
And is there anything
else you can tell me

232
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:14,067
about this ghostly entity?

233
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,567
There is.

234
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,150
The Dullahan has also been
called the Bringer of Calamity.

235
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:22,233
Of calamity. I see.

236
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:24,817
[FARMER B]
My queen,

237
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,817
between the Spectral Nemeses
and the Dullahan, it's too much!

238
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,858
I don't understand what
honest farmers like us

239
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:32,650
could've done to deserve
such misfortune.

240
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,608
Noble subjects,
I ask you to listen.

241
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:44,692
Thanks to King Prasutag, my late
husband, who I still mourn,

242
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:47,067
the destructive war that
had plagued this fair land

243
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,192
was brought to an end.

244
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:53,400
We had finally attained peace.
I truly hoped it would last.

245
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:56,192
But regrettably,
it's proved fleeting.

246
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,400
Unknown forces have brought
conflict to Cyfandir once again.

247
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:03,442
The Spectral Nemeses
and the Dullahan.

248
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:05,442
I cannot yet say
what these things

249
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:08,358
will come to mean
for our country.

250
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:11,150
However, when the
earthly spirits awaken,

251
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,275
we must pay them heed.

252
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:15,442
The ghost of Merlin is agitated.

253
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:18,525
I can feel it in my bones.

254
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:20,358
We're his successors.

255
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:23,150
Knowing that, we must
ask ourselves daily

256
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:26,067
if we deserve to
inherit his gifts.

257
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,150
We must strive to be
worthy of the kingdom

258
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:30,233
he left us to protect.

259
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:33,775
We must struggle to comprehend
his brilliant words,

260
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,692
and then to live by them.

261
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:39,358
To defend Cyfandir every
bit as fiercely as he did.

262
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:41,567
But not just the land.

263
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,733
We must also protect all
of the lives within it.

264
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:49,317
The lives that depend on it.

265
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,525
Ocoho, as Lord Brangoire said,

266
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:56,358
your choice to break from
the group and act as you did

267
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:59,025
could've had grave consequences.

268
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:01,358
But your goal was noble,

269
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:04,400
which makes this deed
worthy of Merlin's legacy.

270
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:06,525
My queen.

271
00:14:06,608 --> 00:14:08,608
Let's hope these farmers
will make good use

272
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:10,233
of the land you saved.

273
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:13,400
I'm sure they'll work
their hardest to do so.

274
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:15,775
And in time, I believe
they'll be able to make it

275
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:18,108
even more fertile than before.

276
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,317
Do you agree?

277
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,733
[FARMER B]
Uh, yes! Most definitely!

278
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:23,900
[giggles]

279
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:28,192
[BOUDICA] Now, I must return
to my many royal duties.

280
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:31,483
Forgive me, Lord Brangoire,
I'll intrude no longer.

281
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:34,650
Let me just say that you and
your soldiers all fought well.

282
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,692
I was thoroughly impressed.

283
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:37,692
[BRANGOIRE]
Ah!

284
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:39,775
Thank you very much, my queen!

285
00:14:39,858 --> 00:14:45,150
[BOUDICA] Lord Brangoire... you
mustn't lift your face, right?

286
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,525
[giggles]

287
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:48,275
[BRANGOIRE] Oh, no!
My apologies! I did it again!

288
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:50,567
I'm terribly sorry.
It was an accident!

289
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,233
Sure it was.

290
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:54,233
I wish all of you good health.

291
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:58,150
And I pray that the great Merlin
will grant you his protection.

292
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:02,067
Her Majesty the queen
is now departing!

293
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:10,275
The queen's as beautiful
as she is kind-hearted!

294
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:11,692
She smells amazing!

295
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:13,650
I wish it was my
face she'd touched.

296
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:15,900
I'm never washing
this cheek again.

297
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,150
Hey! Shape up!

298
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,275
Stop ogling the queen,
get back on your steeds,

299
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:21,108
and fly back to the castle now!

300
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,317
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Right, sir!

301
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,692
'Bout time we left. I'm hungry.

302
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:26,650
[OCOHO]
Seth!

303
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:30,775
Were you watching all that
happen? Did you see?

304
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:32,942
That was the queen herself!
And she knew my name!

305
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:35,525
I was there when she said it!
I'm very happy for you.

306
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:37,817
Lemme go, ya maniac!

307
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,400
Yay! She said that I was
worthy of Merlin's legacy!

308
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:42,108
That means I'm gonna be
a knight for sure, right?

309
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,275
[laughs]

310
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:45,608
Although Lord Brangoire
was pretty angry.

311
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:48,525
Eh, who caree? He's always
grumbling about somethin'.

312
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:50,150
And the queen
herself praised me.

313
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:52,733
She practically ordained
me right there!

314
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:54,483
Draccoon, we'll celebrate

315
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:57,483
with a double serving
of fruit tonight!

316
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,650
No! Make it triple!

317
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:01,442
[DRACCOON wailing]

318
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,025
What kinda noise is that?

319
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:04,692
You ready to head back now?

320
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:07,525
I've got a whole buncha things
I'd like to ask you about.

321
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:09,733
But before that,
let's just celebrate!

322
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:11,400
Sure.

323
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:13,233
Huh?

324
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:14,817
[OCOHO]
Seth.

325
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,483
[SETH] Uh, I just remembered.
I've got a nearby errand to run.

326
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,733
Sorry. You go on without me.

327
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:22,525
[OCOHO]
Really? Okay, see ya later!

328
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:23,942
[SETH]
Sounds good.

329
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,733
How's it goin', Grimm?

330
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:35,275
Ya come for any
reason in particular?

331
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:38,733
[GRIMM]
Hm. So you spotted Grimm out.

332
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:41,692
Well, ya weren't exactly
hiding, now were ya?

333
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:43,233
Ya got the giant hat,

334
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,442
you're covered in bandages,
and you're standing in a field

335
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:47,650
with your arms stickin'
out like this.

336
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:49,483
[GRIMM]
And yet you alone saw Grimm.

337
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:50,692
Yeah, that's true.

338
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:52,608
It's almost as if you're
invisible to anybody

339
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:54,983
who isn't out looking for you.

340
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,942
[GRIMM] In a field,
Grimm poses as a scarecrow.

341
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:00,400
In a graveyard,
Grimm becomes a corpse.

342
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:01,567
And on the road,

343
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,525
Grimm personifies
a sickly old traveler.

344
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,692
Would you like to know why
Grimm takes on such guises?

345
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,608
Yeah.

346
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:10,942
[GRIMM]
People are wont to ignore

347
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:14,817
that which offers nothing
and poses no threat.

348
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,358
Even when they see
such things plainly,

349
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:20,317
if they can't assess their
value, they move on.

350
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,192
This works well for Grimm.

351
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,150
Grimm is best able
to achieve his goals

352
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:28,150
by keeping a safe
distance from the world.

353
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:31,317
Do you believe that to be
your circumstance as well?

354
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:36,900
[GRIMM]
You don't need to be like Grimm.

355
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:39,650
Caislean Merlin's keep
is well-protected,

356
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:41,942
yet you've secured
access already,

357
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:44,900
and put yourself into an
advantageous position.

358
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:46,983
Sure, but what
should I do next?

359
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,733
There might be some
information on Radiant

360
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,733
stored in the Castle Archives,

361
00:17:50,817 --> 00:17:53,942
but I can't get into them
unless I join those knights.

362
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:57,233
[GRIMM]
Hm. The archive, you say?

363
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:59,025
Yeah, what about it?

364
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:01,567
[GRIMM]
Grimm would ask a favor of you.

365
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,775
What'cha need? You've helped
me a bunch. I owe you.

366
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:07,733
If there's anything
I can do, just ask.

367
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:09,567
[GRIMM] There's an object
inside that castle

368
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,775
of which Grimm has need.

369
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,900
Hm? Wait, so you want me
to go and steal it for you?

370
00:18:14,983 --> 00:18:17,192
I'm grateful and all,
but that's a little too far.

371
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:21,983
[GRIMM] Just borrow it. Grimm
only needs it for a short time.

372
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,442
It's a stone like this.

373
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:25,358
[SETH]
What is that?

374
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:27,442
[GRIMM]
It's called a memory stone.

375
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,067
Some sorcerers are in the habit

376
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,067
of carrying stones like
these at all times.

377
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,692
They allow their
bearers to record

378
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:37,067
any and all events that
they experience.

379
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,358
[SETH]
Oh... It's pretty.

380
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:42,025
[GRIMM]
When you go to the archive,

381
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:44,567
look for a place called
the Anmatheque.

382
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,233
The... Anma-what?

383
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:48,025
[GRIMM] It's a collection
of memory stones

384
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:50,900
owned by historically
important sorcerers.

385
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:52,692
Within it, is a stone
that belonged

386
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:55,567
to a female sorcerer
named Magosia.

387
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,900
Can you find it
and smuggle it out?

388
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:00,067
I'm not sure about this, Grimm.

389
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,483
You know your way around here,

390
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:04,233
wouldn't it be easier for
you to get it yourself?

391
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:07,317
[GRIMM] Grimm cannot move
beyond the castle gate.

392
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,650
[SETH]
No kidding. Why not?

393
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,442
[GRIMM] Because of reasons
that are Grimm's alone.

394
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,275
So mysterious.

395
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:17,900
What exactly do you need to use
that memory stone for anyway?

396
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:19,150
[GRIMM]
Something important.

397
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:20,442
[SETH]
The heck does that mean?

398
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:22,775
[GRIMM] It means something
of great import.

399
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:26,025
Okay, fine! Ugh!
Keep your dumb secrets.

400
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:28,275
And I'll do my best
to help you out,

401
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:29,858
but it might take a while.

402
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:32,525
I don't have any idea how I'm
gonna get into the archive yet.

403
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,525
[GRIMM]
Hm. You may get caught.

404
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:36,192
Say what?

405
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,817
[GRIMM] Espionage might
not be your strong suit.

406
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,900
Maybe you should
recruit an ally.

407
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:43,817
Consider the female trapper
you used to travel with.

408
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,150
Or perhaps the boy
with the man's soul.

409
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:50,067
Melie and Doc are
both great, but...

410
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,650
[GRIMM]
Incidentally,

411
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,817
I'm surprised that you aren't
traveling with them right now.

412
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,733
If Grimm is not mistaken,

413
00:19:56,817 --> 00:20:00,317
they've already arrived in
Caislean Merlin, have they not?

414
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,817
[SETH]
You know everything, don't you?

415
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,358
I did see them in
the city earlier,

416
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:07,900
but they acted strange
when I said hi.

417
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:09,775
[GRIMM]
These things are subjective.

418
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:11,567
Grimm thinks you rather strange.

419
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,192
That's not the kinda
strange I'm talkin' about!

420
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:16,233
They were just
different, ya know?

421
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:19,858
It felt like there was this
distance between us.

422
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:22,150
I guess they must
be angry with me

423
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:25,483
for heading off to Cyfandir
without telling them first.

424
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:26,900
[GRIMM]
That could be.

425
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:29,900
Did you leave without telling
them anything at all?

426
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:33,858
Kind of. We didn't talk,
but I left behind a letter.

427
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,192
[GRIMM]
Grimm finds it reasonable

428
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,567
that such a drastic act

429
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,442
would lead to a
misunderstanding between you.

430
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:42,692
[SETH]
What do you think I should do?

431
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,233
[GRIMM]
Grimm cannot advise you in this.

432
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:47,733
If Grimm knew how to
avoid misunderstandings,

433
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:50,692
Grimm wouldn't be
the cause of so many.

434
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:53,150
[SETH] Yeah, you're the
last person I should ask.

435
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,525
[GRIMM] But honestly,
is this the kind of matter

436
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:58,358
that you should trust
to outside advice?

437
00:20:58,442 --> 00:20:59,858
[SETH]
Prob'ly not.

438
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:02,567
I need to figure this thing
out all on my own, don't I?

439
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,067
I'll talk to 'em.

440
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,233
[GRIMM]
There's an affordable inn

441
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:07,442
called the Luchorpan
in the city.

442
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:09,442
You should check for
your friends there.

443
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,817
Everywhere else is overpriced.

444
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,525
Good to know.
Thanks a bunch, Grimm.

445
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,358
I'll go check it out later.

446
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,317
I've gotta ask.

447
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,983
Where are you getting
all this information

448
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:23,025
you have on Caislean Merlin?

449
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:24,858
You knew about the
castle, the forest,

450
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:27,067
even which inn to try.

451
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,483
[GRIMM]
Have a guess?

452
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:29,567
[SETH]
I'm wondering if maybe

453
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,900
you served as a
knight-sorcerer once.

454
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:32,983
[GRIMM]
I did not.

455
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:34,900
Of course that's all you'll say.

456
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:37,942
When are you finally gonna
tell me who you are, man?

457
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:40,483
[GRIMM]
Grimm is Grimm.

458
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:41,942
Well, once I bring ya this rock,

459
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:45,442
ya gotta show me what
your face looks like, 'kay?

460
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:47,067
Do we have a deal?

461
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:50,483
[SETH]
No! He disappeared again?

462
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:53,692
For a guy that's always
up in my business,

463
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:55,775
Grimm sure is secretive.

464
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:56,775
[sighs]

465
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,942
Okay.

466
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:03,108
There's a cheap inn
called the Luchorpan.

467
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:04,900
Bet Doc would like that.

468
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:13,483
[FARMER D humming]

469
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:17,150
Man, I don't feel sotally
tober right now.

470
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:18,483
This was fun.

471
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,275
Hm? What is it?

472
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:22,608
See that? A light!

473
00:22:22,692 --> 00:22:24,275
Oh, yeah.

474
00:22:27,983 --> 00:22:31,150
We've gotta run.
It's the Dullahan!

475
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:33,567
[FARMERS screaming]

476
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:11,233
[NARRATOR] After his
conversation with Grimm,

477
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:15,275
Seth decides to try and
reconnect with Melie and Doc.

478
00:24:15,358 --> 00:24:17,608
But when he visits the
place they're staying,

479
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:19,525
Seth is still unable
to comprehend

480
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:21,942
the reason behind
Melie's coldness.

481
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:23,900
Melie had trusted
and relied on Seth,

482
00:24:23,983 --> 00:24:25,817
believing he would do the same.

483
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,983
Instead, he left.

484
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,567
Next time on <i>Radiant</i> ,

485
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,817
