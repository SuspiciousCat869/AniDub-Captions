[NARRATOR] Seth bade Alma
and the others farewell

2
00:00:11,983 --> 00:00:13,608
and flew to Cyfandir.

3
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:16,733
There he encountered,
fought, and narrowly escaped

4
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:20,233
from the merchant barons
with the help of Grimm.

00:00:20,317 --> 00:00:22,150
Caislean Merlin
has been defended

00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:25,275
by the knight-sorcerers
since ancient times.

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,442
In this mystical city
where sorcerers

8
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:29,442
and humans live side by side,

9
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,858
Seth is surprised to find
the cherished friends

10
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:34,483
he had left behind in Artemis.

11
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,775
They say that Merlin
lived near here.

Hold on. Why are Melie
and Doc out here?

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,650
They didn't come to
find me, did they?

14
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:41,692
Where should we go?

15
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,192
Somewhere cheap.

16
00:00:55,192 --> 00:00:57,483
Melie! N' Doc!

17
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:01,567

18
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,275

[NARRATOR]
"The City of Knights."

20
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:54,233
[NARRATOR] In times long past,
the great sorcerer Merlin

21
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:58,108
erected five colossal
menhirs, standing stones,

22
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:00,900
in order to protect the people.

23
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:03,650
The castle of Caislean
Merlin sits in the center

24
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:08,567
of these stones, and that
is Seth's destination.

25
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,400
[SETH] Hey, lady.
What'cha got on Radiant?

26
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,775
Radiant, huh?

27
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,025
Yeah! Right!

28
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:17,400
Sure, would you like me
to find a map for you?

29
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:18,900
Ah!

30
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:21,025
I was joking. We don't
have anything on it.

31
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:22,608
Aww. Really?

32
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:24,317
'Cause I heard that
back in the day,

33
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,317
the knight-sorcerers were
all about searching

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,567
for Radiant's location!

35
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,233
[CLERK A]
I've heard the same,

36
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:32,067
but that was a terribly
long time ago.

37
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,775
No one's seriously
looked for Radiant

38
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:36,608
since Merlin tried it
with his knight-sorcerers.

39
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:39,192
[SETH]
Man, but you're my only lead!

40
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:41,442
Yes, well, these days,
our forces are occupied

41
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:42,858
with fighting the Nemesis.

42
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:45,400
I don't suppose you came
out here to submit yourself

43
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:47,150
for knight-sorcerer training.

44
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:48,692
Training for what?

45
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:51,192
The knights-sorcerers receive
countless applications

46
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:53,150
from ambitious sorcerers
just like you

47
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,858
who wish to join their
illustrious ranks.

48
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:58,067
A few will be selected
to train as candidates,

49
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,150
and a few of those will
one day be recognized

50
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,150
as true knight-sorcerers.

51
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,733
Ah.

52
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:05,358
Go ahead.
Applications over there.

53
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:07,358
But that isn't what
I came here to do.

54
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:09,442
I just need help
finding Radiant, 'kay?

55
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:10,942
C'mon, miss, can't ya
think of anything

56
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:13,358
that might turn out
to be a decent clue?

57
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:15,900
Let's see.

58
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:18,858
There may be some pertinent
records in the Castle Archives.

59
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:20,858
Huh? Seriously?

60
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:23,025
Now we're talkin!
Lemme go check 'em out!

61
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,858
[CLERK A]
Oh, I'm sorry.

62
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:27,108
Priceless historical
documents are kept there,

63
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:30,275
so only authorized personnel
are permitted to enter.

64
00:04:30,358 --> 00:04:31,692
Aw, that sucks.

65
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:33,317
Well, how the heck am
I supposed to become

66
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,525
authorized personnel?

67
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,692
Honestly?

68
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:38,692
Without any references,

69
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:41,650
your only chance would be to
apply for employment here.

70
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:44,108
Let's see what positions
we have open.

71
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:45,567
We need a secretary.

72
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,567
You think you can handle
the entrance exam?

73
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,025
Nope! Not a chance!

74
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:50,733
Well, we're also
looking for a guard

75
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:52,108
or a new stable-hand.

76
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,650
Those jobs wouldn't get you
into the archive though.

77
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:56,442
Most of these jobs won't.

78
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:58,525
The knight-sorcerers
have archive access

79
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,150
and they're taking applications.

80
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,358
Fine, I'll do it!

81
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,525
Being a knight might
be kinda fun anyway.

That was kinda quick.

Knight-sorcerers need to
help the people feel safe.

With your infection,
you can't do that.

will always scare people.

has to see my horns?

Yeah. This one...

By the way, Doc,

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,817
you said that Seth went to a
place called Caislean Merlin,

105
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,358
but I was wondering if you
could tell us what it's like.

106
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:16,650
You're some kinda know-it-all
researcher, right? So tell us.

107
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:22,025
Sure. It's the capital of a
faraway land known as Cyfandir.

108
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:25,567
A long time ago, a sorcerer
named Merlin saved the people

109
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,067
who lived there and united
them under his leadership,

110
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,692
founding a powerful new nation.

111
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:32,233
Because he's so popular there,

112
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:34,192
the place has very
little prejudice.

113
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:37,400
It's a haven for sorcerers,
kinda like Artemis.

114
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:40,442
Wow. You have such a
wealth of knowledge.

Well, when you're
in my line of work,

116
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:44,483
it pays to know what's
what in the world.

117
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:46,067
It can't pay that well

your neck in debt, would you?

I'm not the one who
racked up all that debt!

Cyfandir is an ancient land
with a complex history.

00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,692
Lulu's such a flake sometimes.

319
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:00,983
She could've at least told me

320
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:03,817
she was gonna send a
rookie in her place today.

321
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,400
Hey, look, can I tell
you something?

322
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,192
Sure, start with your name.

323
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:10,275
[SETH]
Huh? Oh, uh, right.

324
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:12,442
My name's Seth.

325
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:14,275
It's nice to meet you, Seth.

326
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:18,358
You can call me Ocoho.
I'm a knight-sorcerer candidate.

327
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:21,400
And here we have my
Racoon Dragon, Draccoon.

328
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:23,650
[DRACCOON purrs]

329
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:26,067
Congrats on getting
into the order.

330
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,317
We'll all be counting on you
to help us defeat the Nemesis.

331
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,233
What? Did a Nemesis
show up here?

332
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:35,150
Aw, man. Lulu didn't tell you
anything about this, did she?

333
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,025
Ya heard the horn blow, right?

334
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:39,525
That's basically what
calls us to battle.

335
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:41,567
So that's what that was.

336
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,317
But okay. We just need to take
down that pesky Nemesis.

337
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,692
You got it.

338
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,983
I'll do the fighting though,
you just steer Draccoon.

339
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:49,775
Uh.

340
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:51,358
Huh?

341
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,442
Yeah, I've never even ridden
on one of these things before,

342
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:55,650
so I don't think I'm
ready to drive one yet.

343
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,192
Seriously?

344
00:17:57,275 --> 00:18:00,025
I'm really good on a broom.
Though my last two crashed...

345
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:02,317
Well then, how good
can you be, Seth?

346
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,192
Wait, just what were you doing
with my saddle in the stables?

347
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:09,442
Uh, I got thrown in at
random by a strange old man

348
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:10,942
who wears underwear
in his beard.

349
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:13,400
When your beard is as full
as mine, it needs it.

350
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,817
Myr got me again?

351
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,358
I guess you know him?

352
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:20,150
There's no one in the castle
who doesn't know that weirdo.

353
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:23,108
The guy's constantly
screwing with us.

354
00:18:23,192 --> 00:18:25,608
Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me.

355
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:28,942
At this rate, I'm never
gonna get ordained.

356
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,150
[MORDRED]
Ocoho, are you all right?

357
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:32,608
How goes it, Mordred?

358
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:35,692
I'm great. Focusing
on concentrating.

359
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:37,108
Gotcha. Just try to be ready

360
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:39,275
so you can act when
we're given orders.

361
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:41,400
Of course! Don't you
worry about me.

362
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:43,775
I'll definitely do
my duty this time!

363
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:45,567
That's the spirit!

364
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,108
Whoa.

365
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:50,025
This one's even bigger than the
one we fought the last time.

366
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,650
The heck is that?
It's the size of an entire city!

367
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:58,233
It's what we're calling
a Spectral Nemesis.

368
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:01,567
A Spectral Nemesis?
Are they not like regular ones?

369
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,025
For one thing, almost none
of our attacks affect them.

370
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,900
You do know why
that is, don't you?

371
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:09,692
The Nemesis can only be hurt
by attacks that use Fantasia.

372
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,858
Those are the attacks that
haven't been working.

373
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,108
Oh, crap.

374
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,275
[OCOHO] No one had ever
seen a Spectral Nemesis

375
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:17,317
until pretty recently,
but lately,

376
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,692
they've become more common
than regular Nemeses.

377
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:22,192
If they can't be
hurt with magic,

378
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:23,567
then how do we beat them?

379
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,942
We'll be okay.

380
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:26,317
We have Mordred and Sagramore,

381
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,233
and their attacks
still work just fine.

382
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:31,442
Your teammates are named Marmot
and Sakura? That's weird.

383
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:35,400
Ugh! Their names are Mordred
and Sagramore, okay?

384
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:37,525
They're knight candidates,
the same as me.

385
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:39,983
[SETH]
Huh? Oh!

386
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:43,817
I saw them ride through town!
They're really popular.

387
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,858
And strong.

388
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:49,233
But I know I'm good
enough to match them.

389
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:50,567
[BRANGOIRE] I want all
of you knight candidates

390
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,942
to listen up now!

391
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,900
As you can see,
we're up against

392
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,608
another one of those
repugnant Spectral Nemeses.

393
00:19:57,692 --> 00:20:00,567
I have two pieces of advice
for each of you.

394
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,608
First of all, you need
to sharpen your senses

395
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:05,775
while keeping the great
Merlin's teachings in mind!

396
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:07,942
And second of all-- Hmm.

397
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:09,692
Well, second, you need to, uh...

398
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,942
Look sharp. Keep your chins up.
You'll be fine. Don't-Don't...

399
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,483
Can ya tell us the
second part again?!

400
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:15,400
That's just how
Lord Brangoire is.

401
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:17,108
It's best if you don't
comment about it.

402
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:19,192
Oh, my bad.

403
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:22,900
Now then, we're gonna launch
our attack in four stages!

404
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:26,150
Stage one: You seven will form
a circle around the beast

405
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,108
and cast a confinement spell.

406
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:29,692
Do not let it break!

407
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:31,150
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Sir!

408
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,900
[BRANGOIRE] In stage two,
you six will fire a salvo

409
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,192
of offensive spells at the
monster's head to disorient it!

410
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:38,233
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Sir!

411
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:39,567
[BRANGOIRE]
Then in stage three,

412
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,233
Mordred and Sagramore will
move in at close range

413
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:44,025
and deal the killing blow!

414
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:44,858
Yes, sir!

415
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,983
We won't let you down.

416
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:49,942
After that, we'll move
to stage four. Hmm...

417
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:51,733
Which should really
speak for itself.

418
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:55,400
All right, let's do this!
Everybody, pull your hoods up!

419
00:20:58,608 --> 00:20:59,983
Take the reins, okay?

420
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:01,358
'Kay.

421
00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:04,233
Here we go. All together!

422
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:06,108
Gysoni!

423
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:07,650
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Gysoni!

424
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:16,150
What're those flames
above your head?

425
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,650
It's Gysoni.

426
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,275
Is that a spell? What's it do?

427
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,858
It lets us attune our
minds to Lord Brangoire,

428
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,608
even from a distance.

429
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:26,192
We effectively merge our minds
into one consciousness,

430
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:28,192
which lets us channel
far more Fantasia

431
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:29,858
than any of us could on our own.

432
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:33,275
Whoa. Do you think I could
learn that spell someday?

433
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,858
Sure. But just shut up for now.
I don't wanna miss the signal.

434
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,025
Okay, I'll be quiet.

435
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:40,442
[KNIGHTS-SORCERERS]
Cyfyngu!

436
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,858
[laughs]

437
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:50,817
Huh? Hang on.
Nothing's happening.

438
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,358
Nothing has to happen.

439
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:54,400
It hasn't moved yet,
but we're using this spell

440
00:21:54,483 --> 00:21:56,608
to hold it in place
in case it tries.

441
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,400
Guess that kinda makes sense.

442
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,733
What's goin' on?

443
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:01,483
This thing's being swarmed
with dragons right now,

444
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,567
and it doesn't seem
to care a bit!

445
00:22:04,608 --> 00:22:05,733
Well, that's--

446
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:06,983
[SETH] There aren't any
pieces of egg shell

447
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:08,358
on the ground either.

448
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:09,858
Plus, it's all glowy
and see-through.

449
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:11,108
Wait, none of this adds up!

450
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:13,317
I need you to stop
talking right now!

451
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,483
I have a hard time
using Gysoni as it is.

452
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,025
If you don't cut it out,

453
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:19,192
I'm gonna lose contact with
Lord Brangoire and the others.

454
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:20,108
[gasps]

455
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:21,733
[SETH]
Ocoho! Look out!

456
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:22,817
What's up?

457
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,525
Get down!

458
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:25,817
Repulse!

459
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,233
It didn't work!

460
00:22:29,317 --> 00:22:32,150
Huh? Oh, no! He's falling!

461
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:34,275
Seth!

462
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:11,025
[NARRATOR]
Lacking the ability to affect

463
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:13,317
the Spectral Nemesis
with their magic,

464
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,275
the knight-sorcerers are
completely at its mercy.

465
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:18,942
While helping Seth protect
the farmers below,

466
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:22,567
Ocoho learns of the immense
power that he can channel.

467
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,317
Then, Ocoho is denounced
before Queen Boudica

468
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,858
for ignoring orders.

469
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:28,567
How will she be judged?
