00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,541
I was crazy about it,
used to do it with everyone--

162
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,083
my dad, mom, the guys;
basically everyone I saw...

163
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,333
You could say it's
a family tradition.

164
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,291
[OGAMI] I see...

165
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,416
I can tell you care for
your family a great deal...

166
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,458
And your parents...

167
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,333
I bet they're
the same way too.

168
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,541
No baby pictures...

169
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,250
That's a bit on the weird
side, don't you think...?

170
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,875
Too rambunctious, I bet...

171
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,208
Your folks couldn't get you
to stay still could they?

172
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:21,958
Oh...

173
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,708
No, I was adopted...

174
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,083
So the pictures start
after my parents found me.

175
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,500
[GOTOKU] Ogami?

176
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,000
Do you have a minute?

177
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,291
To talk?

178
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,666
[GOTOKU] We raised Sakura...

179
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,958
But she's not our
biological daughter.

180
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,208
[GOTOKU] Years ago...

181
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,708
We found her lying
on our doorstep...

182
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,083
It was a pitiful sight; there
was blood all over her.

183
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,166
[OGAMI] Blood?

184
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,500
[GOTOKU] That's right...

185
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,625
Luckily though, she wasn't hurt.

186
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,250
Though from the amount
of blood splattered

187
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,041
everywhere you wouldn't have
thought so at first glance.

188
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,500
She endured
something that night...

189
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,250
It was clear the
poor child experienced

190
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,125
something unspeakably bad...

191
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,125
I think it shaped who she is...

192
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,750
It was the trigger that
compelled Sakura

193
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,958
to fear the death of others
as strongly as she does.

194
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,291
[GOTOKU] We've been dreading
this day since the beginning.

195
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,458
We knew the time would come

196
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,625
when Sakura would
face tragedy again...

197
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,916
And now it's here...
the poor thing...

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,125
We only wanted
to make her happy...

199
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,333
But I suppose that kind of
life isn't possible for her.

200
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,666
The truth is that I
don't understand

201
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,541
the kind of powers you people
have and I don't care to...

202
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,666
The only thing I care
about is Sakura...

203
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,875
Promise me you
will do everything

204
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,625
in your power to keep
her safe...! Please!

205
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,875
[YUKI] Something on
your mind, Number Five?

206
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,625
Ah, you know, I was
just thinking about Hitomi.

207
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,458
[YUKI] Right, you two were
always pretty close, huh?

208
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,833
We all were.

209
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,166
[YUKI] He always left me alone

210
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,291
and told me to do
whatever I wanted.

211
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,416
[HACHIOJI]
Don't you think that's

212
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,166
because he trusted
your judgment, Yuki?

213
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,541
[YUKI] I don't know. Maybe.

214
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,166
With him you
never knew...

215
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,208
He kept things to
himself so much...

216
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,750
He was hard to read.

217
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,666
[YUKI] Yeah,
that's for sure...

218
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,083
Did he ever, like,
open up to you?

219
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,583
Yeah, once...

220
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,000
When I was much younger...

221
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,375
I lost my family in an accident.

222
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,708
Being the only
member of my line

223
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,333
to survive was
pretty hard on me...

224
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,250
I went through a
bit of a wild stage...

225
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,541
When I met Hitomi he said

226
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,416
something to me
I'll never forget.

227
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
[YUKI] Oh yeah?

228
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,916
"If you've got the
time to run wild,

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,333
then you should do
something else... Sleep."

230
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,625
[YUKI] Why sleep?

231
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,291
Apparently he'd been
working himself

232
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,500
so hard that he hadn't had a
chance to rest in a while...

233
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,375
So when he heard my behavior
was cutting into my sleep...

234
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,666
He just couldn't let it stand.

235
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,958
That sure woke me up...

236
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,708
Hitmoi made me realize I was
letting my grief destroy me.

237
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,125
Yeah, that sounds
like oh one, all right.

238
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,708
[YUKI] It's almost hard to
believe how much he's changed.

239
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,333
[HACHIOJI] Yeah, I know.

240
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:29,000
Uh-oh... I didn't mean
to fall asleep.

241
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,583
[SAKURA] I hate that
I've caused so much trouble.

242
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,125
My house is as safe
as it's gonna get.

243
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,166
[SAKURA] I'm such an idiot...!

244
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,333
There had to be a
better way than this!

245
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,458
Please stop it...

246
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,333
You're just killing
your brain cells.

247
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,500
Eavesdropping?

248
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,083
You're supposed
to be this 'rarebreed',

249
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,875
it's disappointing to see
you bent out of shape

250
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,208
like a normal person.

251
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,666
Well... I am a
normal person.

252
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,833
It's ridiculous...

253
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,833
You feeling guilty
over this mess...

254
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,333
The whole thing started
after I went Lost...

255
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,208
It's bad enough I feel
like an idiot because of it.

256
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,750
But now I have to
sit back and watch you

257
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,666
beat yourself up
over nothing, too?

258
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,500
Please...

259
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,208
Just mind your own business.

260
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,875
If you let yourself
get discouraged by this...

261
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,833
You're gonna make all the
people who believe in you

262
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,833
feel like they've been
backing the wrong horse.

263
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,375
[KIZAKURA 1] Kid knows
what he's talking about;

264
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,458
you should listen to him.

265
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,041
Yeah, don't worry.

266
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,166
We may look rough right now but
we've been through a lot worse!

267
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,166
Don't ever feel guilty

268
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,500
for bringing your
friends home...

269
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,250
Especially when they're
being chased by bad guys;

270
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,083
that's what we're here for!

271
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,416
You guys...

272
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,541
If that bastard
ever shows up here again,

273
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,208
he'll regret it!

274
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,541
Forgive us...

275
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,500
We're the ones who should
be apologizing, Sakura,

276
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,375
we failed to protect you when
you needed our help the most.

277
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,000
We're just relieved things
didn't turn out worse for you.

278
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,041
[SAKURA] Ugh!

279
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,125
I can't let them
see how upset I am.

280
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,208
It'll just make
them worry about me!

281
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,583
Guys...!

282
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,541
I'm just mad that I let
him get the better of me...!

283
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,791
He's just a
scrawny little nobody

284
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,291
and somehow he managed
to beat me anyway...!

285
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,916
Daisuke...! We need to
get back to our training!

286
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,500
Sounds good to me!

287
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,916
[YUKI] We used to be
like that once, remember?

288
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,291
I sure do...

289
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,625
And I remember Hitomi
at the center of it.

290
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,333
[YUKI] Wish we could
all be together...

291
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,208
like we were
in the old days.

292
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,125
Who says that
we won't?

293
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,458
What are you saying, Hachioji,

294
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,333
you haven't given
up on Hitomi yet?

295
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,583
I just can't...

296
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,416
There must be a reason
he's acting like this.

297
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,375
[YUKI] Yeah...

298
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,583
Oh one is behaving

299
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,708
like a completely
different person now...

300
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,833
But he was a good
Breaker once.

301
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,416
I think you're right.

302
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,041
[TOKI] Oh, what
a big load of crap!

303
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,458
Personally,
I couldn't give a damn

304
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,041
why the guy's being such a dick.

305
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,291
[KANDA] There you are.

306
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,458
[TOKI] I'm pissed...

307
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,125
And I'm not gonna
stop till I've decked

308
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,375
that bastard right
upside his face...

309
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,208
If something did
happen to the jackass

310
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,708
maybe a good ole kick
to the head will undo it!

311
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,750
Right now, we've
all got work to do...

312
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,541
I think the best plan
is for us to split up

313
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,208
and search for
the Prime Minister...

314
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,375
Get out there and do
some good Code Breakers!

315
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,750
[YUKI] Yeah!

316
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,833
[SAKURA]
Wow, this place is empty.

317
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,208
[OGAMI] Yeah,
Eden usually takes care

318
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,000
of anything that's
been left behind.

319
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,500
Honestly...
I don't think anything

320
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,541
was left here to begin with.

321
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,750
[phone rings]

322
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,541
What is it, Yuki?

323
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,875
I see...

324
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,791
There's no leads here either...

325
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,375
Yeah, alright. Thanks.

326
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,083
Be honest...

327
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,250
You must have some idea why
he abducted the Prime Minister.

328
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,041
You knew him
better than anyone...

329
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,791
Surely some kind of
motivation comes to mind.

330
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,500
Damn it, Ogami...

331
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,958
It's obvious that the
two of you were close--

332
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,833
[OGAMI] Sorry, but that's
none of your business.

333
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,041
[SAKURA] Ogami!

334
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,958
Where did he go?

335
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,166
Let's go...!

336
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:36,750
Strike him out!

337
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:37,875
Step up, batter!

338
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,500
[knock]

339
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,666
[MALE TEACHER] Come in.

340
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,750
[MALE TEACHER] Welcome...

341
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,583
Sit down, Miss Kanda.

342
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,125
[MALE TEACHER]
So you're saying...

343
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,208
the rarebreed's power is
greater than we ever imagined.

344
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,333
I'd like to know why

345
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,916
you didn't inform
me of this sooner...

346
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,250
Miss Sakura being a rarebreed

347
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,750
is something
I should've known about.

348
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,000
We had to take into

349
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,000
account that you used
to work for Hitomi ...

350
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,791
Unfortunately,
we couldn't run the risk

351
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,166
of the info being leaked.

352
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,500
[MALE TEACHER]
Fact is, we weren't sure

353
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,708
who could be trusted...

354
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,916
Our contacts were giving
us bad information.

355
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,041
We were told that Ogami

356
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,000
was attempting to
neutralize Sakura...

357
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,291
But we didn't really feel
the need to intervene...

358
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,458
There's no chance
Ogami could've hurt her...

359
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,208
Since she's a
rarebreed we backed off

360
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,625
and let everything
play itself out.

361
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,375
[KANDA] You suspected me, that's
what you're saying, isn't it?

362
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,625
Yes, part of our mandate was

363
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,583
to supervise your
activities, Kanda...

364
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,000
To ensure you weren't
communicating with Hitomi.

365
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,166
We thought he might try

366
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,875
to make contact with
you at some point...

367
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,166
apparently that
was a miscalculation.

368
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,583
[KANDA] So we're clear...

369
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,250
I'm Rei Ogami's agent
and that's all I am...

370
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,291
I am not involved with Hitomi!

371
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,166
Then you shouldn't have

372
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,041
any problem getting rid of him.

373
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,333
Trust me...

374
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,000
When we find him,
he'll be dealt with.

375
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,958
[HEIKE] There are two
versions of the world...

376
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,625
The Prime Minister's
and Hitomi's.

377
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,333
So that's it then.

378
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,250
[HEIKE] I think
I understand... Ace.

379
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,125
[HEIKE] Have you come up

380
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,375
with any promising
leads on Hitmoi?

381
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,416
[HACHIOJI] It's no use.

382
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,958
I don't think
we'll find anything.

383
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,500
[HEIKE] Looks like
killing the police chief

384
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,458
and that yakuza bunch is working
against us now, doesn't it?

385
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,833
[HACHIOJI] Yeah, maybe so...

386
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,416
Are you investigating at
the Prime Minister's house?

387
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,208
Yes, of course I am.

388
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,958
Heike.

389
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,166
All things considered,

390
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,500
you were pretty negligent,
don't you think?

391
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,833
[HEIKE] How do you mean?

392
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,125
[HACHIOJI] You had
to know that by getting

393
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,125
all the Code Breakers
together in one place,

394
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,375
you'd be leaving the area around
the Prime Minister shorthanded.

395
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,875
[HEIKE] Well, I wasn't
the one who ordered you

396
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,541
to go there, after all.

397
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,375
[HACHIOJI] I'm not
so sure about that.

398
00:18:56,458 --> 00:19:00,666
But even so, you're definitely
the one who called in Yuki.

399
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,416
If you have something
to say I wish you'd say it.

400
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,458
I'm impressed...

401
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,958
But then again, you always have
been the sharp one, haven't you?

402
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,583
Well, it has been
a pleasure... but...

403
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,000
You bastard!

404
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,416
Well, well.

405
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,750
Looks like
it's finally begun.

406
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:25,916
What?

407
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Hitomi's made his next move...

408
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,625
The plan's underway.

409
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:57,041
[YUKI] Oh no! This is bad!

410
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,916
[HEIKE] Truly magnificent.

411
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,916
The shadow special ability.

412
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,541
A dark and all-powerful
guardian angel...

413
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,625
The only one among us who can
defend against so many attacks!

414
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,083
Such a rarity.

415
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,250
What is this,
Heike...?! Tell me!

416
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,541
[HEIKE] But I already did...

417
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,750
Hitomi's master plan
is finally underway...

418
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,208
And with that, dear Hachioji...

419
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,666
I'm overdue in bidding
you a fond farewell.

420
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,875
Stop this!

421
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,333
You may have a
special gift for protection,

422
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,958
my dear, but
nothing in the world

423
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,000
is powerful enough to
deflect my own specialty!

424
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,291
[YUKI] Five!!!

425
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:40,458
[sirens]

426
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,916
Is that... a fire?

427
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,208
Where are you...?

428
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,500
Like it or not,
I do worry about you.

429
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,416
[SAKURA] What are
you doing here?

430
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,875
[HEIKE] Ogami needs you...

431
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,541
He asked me to help him
track you down, Sakura.

432
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,125
Really? Thank goodness!

433
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,250
He's extremely worried,

434
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,791
now that we know
Hitomi's after you.

435
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,708
Please... I think it'd
be best if you follow me.

436
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,583
[SAKURA] He's really in here?

437
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,916
[HEIKE] Yes, this
is a secret base.

438
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,166
[SAKURA] Oh, wow,

439
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,875
I'm in some kinda secret
Code Breaker hideout...?

440
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,958
Not to nerd-out,
but this is really cool!

441
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,666
Sure is a bit
dark, though...

442
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,750
Are there any lights
we can turn on, maybe?

443
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,708
It's the Prime Minister!

444
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,166
What in the world's
going on here, Heike?!

445
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,666
[HEIKE] I brought the
rarebreed, as promised.

446
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,041
No need to thank me, Ace.

447
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,625
All I ask is that you
hold up your end

448
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,291
of the bargain, as discussed.

449
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,875
Heike, this is crazy!

450
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,875
Tell me you're not dealing
with this maniac...!

451
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:57,875
What is this?!

452
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,208
Oh, I've decided
the Code Breakers

453
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,583
really aren't right for me...

454
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,666
We call that
shifting loyalties...

455
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,958
Delivering you here was
the price of my admission.

456
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,333
Be a good little hostage
and you wont get hurt...

457
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,166
Do I make myself clear?

458
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:46,166
[SAKURA] The desperation
of anger... a cold light...

459
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,791
And the darkest of
resolutions laid bare...

460
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,208
Next time, Code
Breaker episode nine...

461
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,541
'Stopped time'...

462
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,875
A blue flame lights
the darkness of betrayal.
