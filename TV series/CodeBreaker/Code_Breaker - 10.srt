00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,250
and nearly drove the Code
Breakers to extinction...

158
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,166
Looks like he's resurfaced.

159
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,333
Are you ready to
face him again?

160
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,041
Hell, yes, I am.

161
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,625
[HITOMI] Go time.
Let's do this, people.

162
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,166
Understood.

163
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,750
[TOKI] Just look both ways 'fore
crossing the street, Ogami.

164
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,083
[HITOMI] There are targets
in every room on this floor;

165
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,208
it's vital we synchronize.

166
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,250
You're in the
Dead Zone... Sorry.

167
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,625
[HITOMI] Show yourself... Now.

168
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,250
[ROGUE SUPERNATURAL] Someone
knows how to make an entrance.

169
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,916
[HITOMI] I'm not
trying to impress you.

170
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,458
[ROGUE SUPERNATURAL]
Well! It's Eden's lapdog!

171
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,750
[HITOMI] Good, you remember
me... Saves some time.

172
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,208
[ROGUE SUPERNATURAL]
You've come to avenge

173
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,125
your piss-ant lil' clubhouse
pals from back when?

174
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,125
What are you gonna do, right?
Eden's got you by the balls...

175
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,541
[OGAMI] Code One!

176
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,250
[ROGUE SUPERNATURAL] Ah.
Rounded up some new ones, I see.

177
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,125
How 'bout this
time you spare 'em

178
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,416
and all of you hop
over to my side?

179
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,791
[HACHIOJI] Do what?

180
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,500
[ROGUE SUPERNATURAL]
Let me break this down for ya:

181
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,000
Work for Eden and what's
there to show for it...?

182
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,083
Join me and it's a
whole other ball game.

183
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,916
Money. Freedom.

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,958
Hell, take out bad guys if
you want. It's up to you.

185
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,166
You're a moron... Heh.

186
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,708
Huh?

187
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,000
Dude, you hearin' yourself...?
Only reason you're offering

188
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,958
is 'cause your back's
against the wall...

189
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,666
We answer to something
larger than ourselves.

190
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,083
[ROGUE SUPERNATURAL] Really?

191
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,333
[TOKI] Yeah... It's called
having a purpose in life.

192
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:59,458
[HITOMI] That purpose is to
combat evil. Vermin like you...

193
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,083
Understand something right
here and now, my friend...

194
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:06,041
If we wanted to use the powers
given to us for personal gain...

195
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,750
There's no one who could stop us
from taking over the world...

196
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,208
But... That'd make us no
better than scum like you.

197
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,708
[ROGUE SUPERNATURAL]
To hell with all of you!

198
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:28,375
Ha! So... Who's next...?
I'll burn every last one of you!

199
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,666
[HITOMI] You might be
overestimating yourself a bit.

200
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,791
You're a formidable foe...
But... Your time has come.

201
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,666
[ROGUE SUPERNATURAL] Screw you!

202
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:48,000
What the... My body... I...

203
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,666
[HITOMI] Thanks for
making it easy;

204
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,166
the slightest touch
was all I needed

205
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,375
to transmit the necessary
electrical signals

206
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,166
to your nervous system.
The rest, I'll let you handle.

207
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,833
Maybe take this opportunity
to reevaluate your choices.

208
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,833
Not that it'll do any good.

209
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,833
[TOKI] Man, that was
a job and half, huh?

210
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,541
You okay...?
Is anyone hurt?

211
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,916
Uh... Kinda looks like your
hand's seen better days, chief.

212
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,916
What, this...? Eh, better me
than one of you guys.

213
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,458
[HACHIOJI] Here.
At least wash it off...

214
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,083
It'll get infected.

215
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,833
Ah... Thank you.

216
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,416
[YUKI] Okay, I'm just gonna say
what we're all thinkin'...

217
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,291
It was totally awesome
how you took that guy out.

218
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,666
Hey, whaddya want...?
It's my job.

219
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,916
[YUKI] Well, yeah...
Technically, I guess...

220
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,041
[HITOMI] Technically, it's what
we're all supposed to do...

221
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,458
Which means you're gonna
need to step up your game.

222
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,083
[YUKI] I don't think I
could be that badass.

223
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,666
[HITOMI] I recommend
taking a page from Six...

224
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,625
Where you going?

225
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,083
Something wrong...?
I thought we were done.

226
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,833
Good work, kid...
I'm proud of ya.

227
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:17,958
[HITOMI] This. Right here.
It's the ultimate team.

228
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:23,375
I won't ever have to watch
any of them die. Ever.

229
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:28,000
Rest, my brothers.
We've got it figured out.

230
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,666
[BOY 10F] Bring it on! Come on,
you can run faster than that!

231
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,916
[BOY 10G] Watch me!

232
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,791
[OGAMI] You're laughing.
What's that all about?

233
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,333
[HITOMI] I'm in a good mood.

234
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,000
C'mon, Rei.
Don't you get it?

235
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,416
I hardly ever know
what you're thinking.

236
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,833
I don't see why this
should be any different...

237
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,291
Oh... And would you stop
calling me by my first name?

238
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,708
No one else does.

239
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,750
[HITOMI] Sorry, kid:
till you can best me,

240
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:56,291
you'll just have to deal
with it. Sucks to be you.

241
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,000
[HITOMI] What am I looking at?

242
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,166
[HEIKE] I have to confess I
didn't think the prognosis

243
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,916
would be so grim...
It appears as though

244
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,625
a widening gap
between Lost periods

245
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,291
deprives us of the time
needed to recharge,

246
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,666
resulting ultimately in...
well, what we've seen.

247
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,250
We're kept in the dark, but...

248
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,916
this happens enough for
Eden to have a name for it.

249
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,666
What is "Code: End"?

250
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,833
[HEIKE] The higher ups are
nothing if not succinct.

251
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,333
And they... They've
known this was a risk

252
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,291
virtually from the beginning?

253
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,458
Seems so, yes.

254
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,333
So, all this time...
they lied...

255
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,541
[HITOMI] This can't be real...

256
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,291
I've worked too goddamn
hard for this to be real.

257
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:51,625
The whole point was
to save lives... But...

258
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,458
Whatever I do...
We die like animals

259
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,208
in service to people who
think we're expendable!

260
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:02,250
My team... My friends...
I can't let them do this!

261
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,333
[OGAMI] Hey. Why all the
cloak and dagger stuff?

262
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,833
What's going on?

263
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,500
This doesn't
seem like you.

264
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
[HITOMI] They'll finish it soon.

265
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:19,083
[OGAMI] What, the Sky Tower?
Sure, I guess.

266
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,416
[HITOMI] Imagine all the people
who'll look out from the top

267
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,625
once they open it to tourists.
Families. Couples.

268
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,166
[OGAMI] Yeah.

269
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,375
Okay, so while I'm
trying to imagine that...

270
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,083
You'll wanna take a look
at these, I think...

271
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,375
The specs about tomorrow's job.

272
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,708
Always on the clock, huh?

273
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,833
[HITOMI] Ogami... what if...

274
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,291
[OGAMI] What?

275
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,541
What if we...
disappeared?

276
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:05,500
[HITOMI] Forget it.
Talking out of my ass.

277
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:09,291
[HITOMI] Please... Like
he could extricate himself...

278
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,333
Code Breakers are
his whole world...

279
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,000
Even if he did run,
Eden would find him...

280
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,541
Besides, what am I supposed to
do? Tell him about Code End?

281
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,750
That'd be cruel--like handing
him a death sentence.

282
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,708
[HITOMI] Maybe the
illusion of a normal life

283
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,708
is the best it'll get.

284
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,125
It's not like they'll
get a better offer.

285
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,208
As far as the world's concerned,
they're less than ghosts.

286
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,208
Bad enough they die unsung;

287
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,458
no reason they have
to live in fear.

288
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,500
[HITOMI] This isn't
a choice for them;

289
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,708
but it is for the
people in charge.

290
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,416
Sorry to be all weird...
Thanks for coming.

291
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,416
[OGAMI] And I came because...?

292
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,791
Have to be prepared...
I had to know

293
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,375
you were ready for tomorrow.

294
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,916
'Kay...

295
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:17,125
[HITOMI] I am Code One.
The pack leader. The Ace.

296
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:21,750
I have to do it.
They need me.

297
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,500
[OGAMI] Talk to me.

298
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,666
[KANDA] Sir!
It's Hitomi...

299
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,625
I don't even know
how to say this--

300
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,166
[OGAMI] What's wrong?

301
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,625
[KANDA] Last night... Hitomi
attacked the Prime Minister...

302
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,166
He killed the entire
security detail and fled...

303
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,250
No one knows where he is.

304
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,041
[ADVISOR 1A] This is
most unfortunate...

305
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,083
His Excellency is
uninjured, at least...

306
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,458
But the situation is
a very grave one...

307
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
Very grave indeed...

308
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,458
Code Breaker One...
is hereby divested

309
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,291
of the title, and his
commission is rescinded...

310
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:05,125
Men... Hitomi is now
considered an extreme threat.

311
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,875
[OGAMI] You lied
to me, you bastard...

312
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:12,416
You promised you'd
be there for us.

313
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,416
How could you do this?

314
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,875
[SAKURA] Why does he
hate the Prime Minister...?

315
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:28,458
It doesn't make any sense...
They were on the same side...

316
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,916
What really happened...?
I have to know.

317
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,250
Alrighty, folks... Let's get
this coming out party under way!

318
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,791
Biting the hand that feeds
him... How very like him.

319
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,791
[HITOMI] Hello, citizens of
Japan. Thanks for tuning in.

320
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,875
As you can probably surmise
from the countdown

321
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,750
there on the big screen,
your illustrious Prime Minster

322
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,916
has less than an hour to live.

323
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,916
Matter of fact, same goes
for a sizable chunk of you.

324
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,958
Soon, fifty thousand people
will be under smoldering rubble.

325
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,125
There is nowhere
you can run.

326
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,000
Hitomi!

327
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:48,541
[SAKURA] Disaster strikes.
Panic spreads. Death draws near.

328
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:53,208
Next time, "Code: Breaker"
episode 11, "50,000 Hostages."

329
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:56,750
A showdown of epic
proportions is about to unfold.
