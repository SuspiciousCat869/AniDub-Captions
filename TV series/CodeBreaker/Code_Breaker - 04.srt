1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,833
[PUPPET A] This meeting
of the Code Breaker

2
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,458
Supreme High Council, 'Eden,'
is now officially in session.

3
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,041
[PUPPET A] Your talents are
quite a bit more impressive

4
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,458
than our normal
recruits to this position,

5
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,791
and as such you have
been granted dispensation

6
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,666
for the work you do...

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,208
You're one of the elite
few Code Breakers...

8
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:37,875
Rei Ogami. Code number six.

9
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,208
[PUPPET A] Despite being the
most recently named

10
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,583
Code Breaker, you have executed
your duties efficiently,

11
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,666
and become an
exemplary assassin,

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,333
the equal of your
five counterparts.

13
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,541
[PUPPET A] We look forward
to seeing more from you.

14
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,125
[OGAMI] That's enough
ego stroking.

15
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,958
Just tell me what
you want from me.

16
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,666
[PUPPET B] I want you
to watch your tongue,

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,666
lest I rip it out, dog!

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,750
[PUPPET A] Now, now,
let's not insult him...

19
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,625
Even if his behavior
might warrant it.

20
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,333
[PUPPET A] Shigeru
Tabata... Politician...

21
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,416
We want
you to eliminate him.

22
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,041
This guy...

23
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,166
He's the one involved
with Hitomi, right?

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,708
[PUPPET B] That's why we keep
little dogs like you around,

25
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,750
to find these things out.

26
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,166
[PUPPET B] You bastard!

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,125
I don't appreciate
your tone, my friend...

28
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,958
And just so we're
crystal clear...

29
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,208
I'm not a dog to
be ordered around.

30
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,333
I work for me, not for you.

31
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,125
[OGAMI] I'm the one who
decides whether or not

32
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,500
I accept these missions.

33
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,708
If you call me a
dog one more time...

34
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,625
I'll make you regret it.

35
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,666
[SAKURA] Here I am,
home again...

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,708
With no idea how I got here.

37
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,625
[GOTOKU] Sakura...

38
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,083
We need to get
some things straight.

39
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,000
[MOTHER YUKI] Yes we do...

40
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,750
This is not once, but twice,

41
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,250
we've found you
sleeping on the porch...

42
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,208
That's no way to behave!

43
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,166
[SAKURA] I know...

44
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,875
And I'm very sorry.

45
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,458
[GOTOKU] So tell
us what happened...

46
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,416
We're your parents,
we deserve to know.

47
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,458
[MOTHER YUKI] That's right!

48
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,041
Well... Truth is.

49
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,583
[SAKURA] I've joined
the mountaineering club.

50
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,875
Part of my training
is learning how

51
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,666
to sleep outside at night so
I can tolerate the elements!

52
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,625
Oh, well...
That's such a relief!

53
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,666
What a lovely way for
you to spend your time...

54
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,250
You must train hard...
Very hard.

55
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,875
[SAKURA] I'm off...
See you later!

56
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,041
[GOTOKU] I raised the girl,
for goodness sake,

57
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,833
and I know when she's lying.

58
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,208
[GOTOKU] There's something
she's not telling us.

59
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,125
[MOTHER YUKI]
Agreed... Then again...

60
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:28,583
When Sakura lies, it tends
to be for someone else's sake.

61
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,000
[MOTHER YUKI] So at least...

62
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,750
Whatever she's doing,
I'm sure it's for a good reason.

63
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's let it slide...
Have a little faith.

64
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,875
[SAKURA] I hate lying to
my parents. Sorry, guys.

65
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,875
[SAKURA] Who's that?

66
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,583
[TOKI] Good morning...
You're Sakura, right?

67
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,041
Yes, I am... And you?

68
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,458
[TOKI] I'm Toki...

69
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,375
Ogami couldn't make it today,
so he sent me instead.

70
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,291
Oh. Is he okay?

71
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,500
[TOKI] He pissed some important
people off last night...

72
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,541
So he's sorta in the dog house.

73
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,625
[SAKURA] Who did he piss
off...? His overseers?

74
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,333
[TOKI] Yep... He doesn't
like to call them that though.

75
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,375
[SAKURA] Then you're
one, too... Aren't you?

76
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,833
[TOKI] You're damn right,

77
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,125
Toki's Code Breaker number
four, the best of them all!

78
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,875
Ogami's Code six, he's
the bottom of the barrel...

79
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,916
So I have to look out for
him a bit, kinda like a mentor.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,666
I see... So...

81
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,000
Where is he right now?

82
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,833
Well he got an
earful last night...

83
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,458
so he's probably off
crying like a baby.

84
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,958
Ogami...? Is crying?

85
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,416
[sobs]

86
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,250
[snorts with laughter]

87
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,000
[TOKI] Uh... What's so funny?

88
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,208
[SAKURA] It's
nothing... Nothing at all.

89
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,291
[SAKURA] So tell
me something, Toki.

90
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,541
Exactly how well do you
and Ogami know each other?

91
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,833
[TOKI] Oh, I'd say
I know him pretty well...

92
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,750
we're practically best friends.

93
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,958
[SAKURA] Really?

94
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,166
[TOKI] Yep... So if
you're itching to find

95
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,416
out something about
my ol' buddy Ogami...

96
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,458
[TOKI] I'll tell ya
whatever you wanna know.

97
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,541
[SAKURA] That's perfect...!

98
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,750
If you two are
friends you can help me

99
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,333
talk some sense into him...!

100
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,875
I want him to
realize this is wrong

101
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,416
and stop what he's doing.

102
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,291
Is this a joke?

103
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,541
Right, I forgot...

104
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,583
You're cut from the same
cloth, why would you help?

105
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,583
Hey... You shouldn't
judge a book by its cover.

106
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,583
Come on... Give me the
skinny; I'm dying to hear.

107
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,625
Really?

108
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,583
Yeah... But
let's go somewhere.

109
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,000
[SAKURA] We can talk anywhere,

110
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,375
is it really necessary for us
to go all the way out here?

111
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,666
[TOKI] As a matter
of fact, it is,

112
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,875
I need to talk to
you about Ogami, too.

113
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,250
[SAKURA] What about?

114
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,708
[TOKI] Actually, it involves
you directly, Sakura.

115
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,083
[SAKURA] Please tell me.

116
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,458
[TOKI] Well... You'll
have to keep it top secret.

117
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,958
You okay, Toki...?
What's wrong?

118
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,083
Ogami!

119
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,458
Hey! What was that?!
Calm down.

120
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,833
Don't listen to
anything this liar says!

121
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,250
Come on, man...

122
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,500
That's not cool...

123
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,875
It's certainly no way
to greet an old friend.

124
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,791
What's this about...?
I thought you two were close!

125
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,041
[OGAMI] Is that
what he told you?

126
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:04,916
[SAKURA] Yeah...

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,208
Oh, we're close.

128
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,166
Say, how many times
have I kicked your ass?

129
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,541
Hey... Play nice now...

130
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,791
My old friend.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,333
[SAKURA] Stop it, right now...!
Both of you!

132
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,083
What the hell
do you want, Toki?

133
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,375
Good to
see you too, Ogami,

134
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,958
I hope you're doing well...

135
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,250
Look, we need to have a
lil' pow-wow 'bout tonight...

136
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,750
After your outburst, the bosses

137
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,500
are worried about
you handling it alone.

138
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,875
So they sent me...

139
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,833
Because apparently the
little baby needs a sitter.

140
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,625
You're in luck,
you get to spend

141
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,916
some quality time
with your pal, Toki...

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,291
I thought I'd drop
by this morning

143
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,791
just to give you
a friendly reminder

144
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,041
I outrank you,

145
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,041
so keep your mouth shut
and do what I say...

146
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,500
It'll be just like old
times, won't it buddy?

147
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,041
Thanks for the pep talk,

148
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,875
but if you should find yourself
in a tight spot out there...

149
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,083
Lost in a critical moment...

150
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,125
Don't go looking to me for help.

151
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,458
[TOKI] You're a
pain the ass, Ogami.

152
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,791
It takes one to know one.

153
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,750
[TOKI] We can settle things

154
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,708
right here, right
now Code Six...!

155
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,250
Unless you're scared.

156
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,416
Sounds like fun!

157
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,791
Though I think
you're gonna regret it!

158
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,875
Oh, bite me!

159
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,375
Die!

160
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,500
Just stop...!
Both of you!

161
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,166
[SAKURA] Before you let
your fists do the talking,

162
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,541
you need to calm down and think!

163
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,833
Right... Thanks, Sakura...
But you're hurting us.

164
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,333
Oh... I'm sorry... Oops.

165
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,250
Man, you
gotta grip! Holy cow!

166
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,416
[SAKURA] Well...
It's your own fault!

167
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,416
Acting like a couple
of moronic thugs!

168
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,416
You're somethin'
else, you know that?

169
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,625
[SAKURA] Unbelievable.

170
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,916
His eyes are identical
to Fujiwara's.

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,666
[TOKI] What, you never seen a
solid nine before or something?

172
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,583
You'd think I'd be
used to this by now.

173
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,458
Yeah right, don't
flatter yourself, Toki...

174
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,750
It's just that I noticed your
eyes are two different colors.

175
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,708
[TOKI] Well, that's not the
only cool thing about me.

176
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,583
[TOKI] I'll catch
you later, Ogami...

177
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,500
Bring your 'A-game'!

178
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,333
[SAKURA] Hey hold on,
wait for me...!

179
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,750
Tell me about Toki...

180
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,625
I want know more
about the two of you.

181
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,458
Just don't believe
anything he says...

182
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,916
All you need to know is
that he's a pathological liar.

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,875
You really don't
like this guy...

184
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,000
There must be a reason.

185
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,416
By the way...

186
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,625
I heard what he
said about the job

187
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,250
you're gonna be
working on together...

188
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,583
Tell me the truth...

189
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,791
Are you really planning
on killing more people?

190
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,041
Oh yeah...

191
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,875
And what did you mean
when you said 'Lost?'...

192
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,541
You said if Toki got 'Lost'
you weren't gonna help him.

193
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,500
Good morning, Sakura...

194
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,708
You look ravishing
today as always.

195
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,708
[HEIKE] You're such a delight.

196
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,166
Please, sit...

197
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,083
There's nothing like sipping
tea with a dear friend...

198
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,041
So what do you say...?

199
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,500
Care to join me?

200
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,416
[MALE STUDENT A
'Weirdo's' having tea again.

201
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,750
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
Shh... He'll hear you.

202
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,375
[SAKURA] Good morning
to you, Heike.

203
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,708
That does sound nice...

204
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,916
But my class is about to start.

205
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,500
And I'm running behind,

206
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,958
so unfortunately I'll
have to decline this time.

207
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,708
Such a pity...

208
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,416
Disappointed though I am,
I do understand.

209
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,875
[MALE TEACHER 2A] This
information will definitely be

210
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,041
on the next test,
so make sure you learn it.

211
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,041
[SAKURA] Next time
we have a break

212
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,208
I'm getting some
answers outta him.

213
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,916
[MALE TEACHER 2A]
All right, Aoyama...

214
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,250
Read the next one please.

215
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,458
[MALE TEACHER 2A] Miss Sakura...

216
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,541
What's wrong?

217
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,083
[SAKURA] Sorry...

218
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,916
I hate to do this, but suddenly
I'm not feeling very well...

219
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,291
I think I should make a
trip to the nurse's office.

220
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,625
[MALE TEACHER 2A]
Hey, wait... Sakurakoji!

221
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,041
[SAKURA] Toki!

222
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,125
[TOKI] Yo, princess...!
What's up?!

223
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,750
No, you answer me...!
What are you doing here?

224
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,833
Aww... What,
did you miss me...?

225
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,041
I was in the neighborhood

226
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,458
and thought I might
check out your school.

227
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,041
Yeah right.

228
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,041
If this jerkwad's here for any
reason it's just to piss me off.

229
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,291
Now, now...

230
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,041
Aren't you supposed to
be in remedial class...?

231
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,125
Ugh... what a naughty boy.

232
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,291
There you two go again.

233
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,291
[KANDA] That uniform
you're wearing

234
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,125
doesn't belong on
these grounds...

235
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,125
So why are you on my campus?

236
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,750
[TOKI] Becaaaaause!

237
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,250
You see...
I'm here to take a tour...

238
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,208
You look really
nice today, ma'am.

239
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,708
You sweet boy...

240
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,583
It's such a pleasure
to have you here!

241
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,041
[OGAMI] Oh,
you're so full of it.

242
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,416
What...?

243
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,750
You really think
I would lie to a teacher...?

244
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,291
Please...

245
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,500
I'm as honest as they come,
and if you don't believe me...

246
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,083
just call my school and ask 'em.

247
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,291
But... There's no way...

248
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,208
That... That seal.

249
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,375
It's the emblem of the
best school there is.

250
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,958
They have the highest graduate
placement in the nation.

251
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,291
It's where the smartest students

252
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,791
from the most prestigious
families go to learn.

253
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,875
Heisei Gakuin High School!

254
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,833
Yep... That's the one.

255
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,833
How'd you get in?
Are you smart?

256
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:15,583
I guess...

257
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,208
I picked it because it was

258
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,000
the closest school
to my house... So...

259
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,291
[KANDA] This is Toki, he's
from Heisei Gakuin High School

260
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,416
and he's come to
pay our class a visit!

261
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
 All right...

262
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,833
Everyone be nice
and let's learn a lot!

263
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,166
[STUDENTS] Kay.

264
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,208
[FEMALE STUDENT B]
Oh, wow... He is totally hot!

265
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,333
[FEMALE STUDENT C]
And he went to Hesiei,

266
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,541
which means
he's a genius!

267
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,625
[SAKURA] Well...

268
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,708
As long as he's
seriously here to learn,

269
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,000
I suppose it's okay.

270
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,541
[MALE STUDENT B] When is
it gonna be lunch time?!

271
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,750
[MALE STUDENT C]
Yeah, I'm starving!

272
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,458
[SAKURA] Ogami...
I made you lunch.

273
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,500
Come outside with me,

274
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,416
we have some things
to talk about.

275
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,541
[FEMALE STUDENT B] Look!
Can you believe it?

276
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,291
Sakura made Ogami lunch.

277
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,708
[AOBA] Yeah... You get it girl.

278
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,083
[OGAMI] No thanks.

279
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,958
[SAKURA] But... Hey!

280
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,125
Ogami, wait...!

281
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,000
Toki, you care to join me?

282
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,541
[SAKURA] Come on, let's go.

283
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,500
Uh... Thanks for the offer,
but I've got some stuff to do.

284
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,791
It wasn't a request...
Come with me now!

285
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,083
All right.

286
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,083
[MALE STUDENT A] Whoa,
something's definitely

287
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,125
up with them!

288
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,000
[FEMALE STUDENT B] No kidding!

289
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,958
It's like a crazy love triangle!

290
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,666
[SAKURA] Ogami has
the worst manners.

291
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,958
I can't believe he just ran off.

292
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,375
I'm sorry if I was rude.

293
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,166
You had something to
do and I derailed you.

294
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,583
[TOKI] Eh, it's no big deal...

295
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,750
I just came to
check up on someone.

296
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,708
[TOKI] So, Sakura, what's up...

297
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,083
What'd you wanna talk about?

298
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,750
[SAKURA] Uh... Well.

299
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,000
Given who you are
and what you do,

300
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,000
it's probably a
complete waste of my time,

301
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,250
but it's the point
I touched on earlier...

302
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,208
Is there any way you can stop
him from killing people...?

303
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,666
I mean, I know it's
his job, but still.

304
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,375
I'm not asking him
to quit for my sake...

305
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,041
I know it hurts him too...

306
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,583
And yet he doesn't stop.

307
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,500
[TOKI] Code Breakers never do.

308
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,416
There's a bigger objective.

309
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,875
The missions we take on
are a means to an end...

310
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,375
The common denominator
for each of us is personal,

311
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,583
but it almost always involves
getting our hands dirty,

312
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,416
Objective...?
Like what?

313
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,000
[TOKI] It depends.

314
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,041
Maybe protecting someone...

315
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,916
Who knows?

316
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,291
It makes me so jealous
that you're into Ogami...

317
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,500
Why him? Tell me Sakura.

318
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,666
Have you ever been
touched like this?

319
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,541
[SAKURA] Next time that
won't be a kick to the head...

320
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,750
It'll be a kick
somewhere else! Perv.

321
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,916
Aww... man...
Hey, this is no fair...

322
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,791
Sissy grabbed them,
why can't I?!

323
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,791
[SAKURA] Sissy, but... Wait...!

324
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,666
So then you really are
Fujiwara's brother, aren't you?!

325
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,375
I knew the eyes meant something!

326
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,166
[TOKI] Well, well...

327
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,583
Look who decided to show up,

328
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,416
I guess I'm not the only
one who wants to eat her lunch.

329
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,250
[SAKURA] Ogami!

330
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,291
[OGAMI] Don't get me wrong.

331
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,208
I'm only here
cause she's an idiot

332
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,500
and she's easily fooled
by snakes like you.

333
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,583
Hey, that's not nice...!
You jerk!

334
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,375
[OGAMI] Come on...

335
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,625
You're coming with me.

336
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,708
[SAKURA] I don't like
being called an idiot!

337
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,041
[OGAMI] So... You
said you wanted to talk...

338
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,333
Let's talk.

339
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,375
[SAKURA] It's about you

340
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,625
and the rest of
the Code Breakers!

341
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,250
[HEIKE] A special friendship...

342
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,791
Camaraderie that goes
beyond the sexes...

343
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,916
I can see that you're
concerned about Ogami.

344
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,291
How considerate of you.

345
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,541
Oh, dear...

346
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,041
You're so upset...
Just look at your face...

347
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,958
Sorry to disappoint you...

348
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,333
It's very clear you wish
I was someplace else.

349
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,250
[SAKURA] Huh...?
No, please... It's not that!

350
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,000
[SAKURA] Oh no, you too?

351
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,583
[NENENE] One... Two...
They're both here!

352
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,833
[NENENE] I've missed
you two so much...!

353
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,208
Lefty, Righty, Lefty, Righty,

354
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,375
[SAKURA] That's enough.
This is getting ridiculous.

355
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,250
[OGAMI] I guess
talking's not in the cards

356
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,250
for us today, is it?

357
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,375
[SAKURA]
Uggh!

358
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,375
[NENENE] Sakura. What's
the matter with you?

359
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,458
[SAKURA] Uh...
Nothing... Nothing at all!

360
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,750
[NENENE] Oh... Hi, Ogami...

361
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,166
Lefty and Righty are all mine

362
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,833
and there's nothing
you can do about it

363
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,875
so why don't you just back off!

364
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,625
[SAKURA] What's the use...?

365
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,500
I might as well just
give in... Oh yeah...

366
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,041
I almost forgot, Nenene...!

367
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,500
I have a little
surprise for you.

368
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,458
Your brother's here!

369
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,750
Wait, what?

370
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,250
See...? Here he--

371
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,125
He just disappeared.

372
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,458
[NENENE] But Sakura...

373
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,166
I don't know what
you're talking about.

374
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,208
I mean, for one thing,
I don't have any brothers.

375
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,500
Guess I'll see ya
tonight... Friend.

376
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,500
[OGAMI] I told you
not to follow me.

377
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,708
Yeah, well I don't care...

378
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:02,791
I'm keeping my eye on you

379
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,833
to make sure you
don't kill anyone.

380
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,500
[SAKURA] What's the story
with Toki and Nenene...?

381
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't understand.

382
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,541
[OGAMI] As far as
society is concerned,

383
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,166
Code: Breakers don't exist.

384
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,000
Their identities are
unknown to everyone...

385
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,083
And whatever shred of life
they previously had is erased.

386
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,166
Erased?

387
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,125
Even if Toki
did have a family...

388
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,666
That is his past now...
It's gone for good...

389
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,291
And he can
never get it back.

390
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,333
I see.

391
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,583
Hey, this is no fair...

392
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,583
Sissy grabbed them,
why can't I?!

393
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,000
I just came to
check up on someone.

394
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,250
[Uh... Thanks for the offer,
but I've got some stuff to do.

395
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,916
Poor guy.

396
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,291
[SAKURA] Hi, Toki.

397
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,666
[TOKI] Well, hey...
What a surprise...

398
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,291
Didn't know you
were bringing her.

399
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,916
Listen... I know
you're a Fujiwara.

400
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,833
Please...
Get real... I'm not.

401
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,750
[TOKI] Come on...

402
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,083
What, you really thought
I was her brother...?

403
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,958
I guess Ogami made
an ass out of you again.

404
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,791
[SAKURA] You're lying
to me right now.

405
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:01,916
You are a Fujiwara...

406
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,583
And Nenene's your older sister!

407
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,375
I know
it's the truth...

408
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,625
And earlier, when you said

409
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:11,666
'to protect someone' you
were talking about her.

410
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,333
That's why you're
a Code Breaker...

411
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,708
You do it so you can look
out for your big sister.

412
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,791
No way.
That's not why I do this!

413
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,208
You're dead wrong,

414
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,750
I'm a Code Breaker because
I'm a champion of justice!

415
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,541
Toki!

416
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,708
\The truth is...

417
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,916
Those are the only
things I wanna protect.

418
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,666
You're just trying
to make me angry!

419
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,833
[TOKI] Now then.

420
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,291
Time to teach evil
a lesson... You in?

421
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,500
Wait. We are not done!

422
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,208
What did you just do?

423
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,875
Well, alarms make a
lot of noise, don't they...?

424
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,750
So... I went ahead and
shut down the security system.

425
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:01,541
[SAKURA] What?

426
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,250
[TOKI] For my next trick.

427
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,458
[SAKURA] How'd you do that?!

428
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,083
It's his special power...

429
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,583
Toki can use magnetism to
manipulate any metal around him.

430
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,125
Oh, right...!
At the park...

431
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,875
I was wondering
what that was!

432
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,000
Wha...?

433
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:34,833
[SAKURA] Hold on...!

434
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:35,958
What are you
planning to do here?!

435
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,125
[TOKI] I already told you...

436
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,625
We're here to teach
evil a thing or two!

437
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,500
[SAKURA] Come on...!

438
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,041
You can't be serious about this!

439
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,000
Looks like we've got
quite the turn out tonight.

440
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,541
[SAKURA] You
broke their gate...!

441
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,458
What, do you expect them to
just sit back and let you in?!

442
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,166
[OGAMI] Sakura, I think
it's time for you to go home.

443
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,000
[SAKURA] No way!

444
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,333
He's right...

445
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,083
Things are about
to get biblical!

446
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:54,916
Toki!

447
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,291
Stop...! Right there...

448
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,791
Who are you?!

449
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,958
Listen up: I'll take care
of the targets, all right...?

450
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,458
You just stay outta my way.

451
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,833
This should be good...

452
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,083
Just don't slow me down
while you're messing it up.

453
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,375
[BOTH] Cocky jack ass.

454
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,083
Oh no...

455
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,708
They're here...

456
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,500
The Code Breakers...
I'll take care of them.

457
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,166
Take em' out!

458
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:30,958
Well, well...

459
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,458
You boys play for
keeps, don't you...?

460
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,791
You'll find two can
play that game.

461
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,166
What the hell...?
The bullets!

462
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,541
How is something
like that possible?

463
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,875
They're so powerful!

464
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,083
[TOKI] I'm afraid
you're gonna need

465
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,166
more than bullets to
take me down, fellas.

466
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,208
No...! Toki!

467
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,916
You want 'em back.

468
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,375
[SAKURA] Stop it!

469
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,875
Hey...! They were
trying to kill us, remember?!

470
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:01,916
Yeah, but-

471
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,458
Back off.

472
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,500
[SAKURA] What in the
world is happening to them?

473
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,875
I'll be damned.

474
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,166
Wouldja look at that.

475
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,500
[MAD DOCTOR A] You three kids
look like you've seen a ghost.

476
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,791
They sure do...

477
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,333
It's about time they
learned that Code Breakers

478
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,875
aren't the only ones
with special abilities.

479
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,833
[SAKURA] So these
guys have powers too?!

480
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,875
[OGAMI] They received
funding from the government

481
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,416
to conduct research on special
abilities in this facility.

482
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,333
[SAKURA] Seriously?

483
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,291
[TOKI] This looks like a waste
of taxpayer money to me!

484
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:44,375
[SAKURA] Next time...

485
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,083
"Code: Breaker" episode five...

486
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,333
"Banquet of Wishes."

487
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,583
[SAKURA] I can't let
you do this, Ogami...

488
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,500
But I can't let you die, either!
