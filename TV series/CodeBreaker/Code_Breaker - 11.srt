1
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,166
[RADIO FEMALE 11A] There has
been another explosion...

2
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,791
This time in Kinschicho...

3
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,791
What's up...?
Any word from Ogami?

4
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,666
[KANDA] No, nothing yet.

5
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,625
[TOKI] You have any luck?

6
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,958
[YUKI] No sign of Hitomi;
Eden's "intel" was bunk.

7
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,208
[RADIO FEMALE 11A]
So far, there have been

8
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,208
dozens of bombings
throughout Japan.

9
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,416
Authorities have asked those
who are outside to avoid

10
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,375
crowded areas and return
to your homes immediately.

11
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,583
Just how many bombs did
that bastard plant?!

12
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,458
We need to find out
where he's stashed them

13
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,708
so the bomb squad can
disarm as many as they can.

14
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,833
[YUKI] Oh, no...
He's got them everywhere.

15
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,125
There's no possible way
we can stop them all.

16
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,333
Bombs have been placed in
over fifteen hundred areas.

17
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,916
Even if the locations
were known,

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,291
they couldn't defuse
them all in an hour.

19
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,000
Then it's done... Now the
people have no choice but

20
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:30,375
to sit in terror and wait for
their inevitable destruction.

21
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,791
Yes, you're
absolutely right...

22
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,750
And to yearn desperately
for someone to save them.

23
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,500
[DAISUKE] Boss, we
got word there was

24
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,625
a blast at the
Kudaki building!

25
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,333
[KIZAKURA 11-2] The Kusugi
is alright, though!

26
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,833
[GOTOKU] Have you gotten through
to Sakura's cell phone yet?

27
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:49,583
[KIZAKURA 8E] We've called her
over a dozen times, but no luck.

28
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,000
[KIZAKURA 8D] Sir, your
daughter's cell phone

29
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,375
GPS data just came in!

30
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,458
[GOTOKU] Sky tower?

31
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,375
[GOTOKU] Bomb locations?

32
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,791
Oh, no, don't tell me Sakura...

33
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,458
Daisuke, I need
you to contact

34
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,208
the bosses across the
country... Immediately!

35
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:14,125
[TOKI] Another one. Who the
hell is sending these things?

36
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,000
[SECRET SERVICE 11A] Track
down the signal's source...!

37
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,625
That's right, both the
map and the images...!

38
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,541
Tokyo tower, the Saporro
TV Tower, Sky Tower...

39
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,458
Yeah. Any place that
can transmit a signal

40
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,833
to a wide area. And don't
forget the relay stations!

41
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:29,833
[SECRET SERVICE 11B]
Hey, look...

42
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,500
Isn't this from Sky Tower?

43
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,000
[SECRET SERVICE 11A] Huh?

44
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,125
[SECRET SERVICE 11B] I've been
up there for an inspection

45
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,208
and the roof had a
spot just like this.

46
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,208
That's Sky Tower for sure.

47
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,541
Yeah, roger that... Toki...

48
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,208
It's possible the Prime
Minister is at Sky Tower.

49
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,750
You're kidding me?

50
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,083
We've been ordered to head there
and attempt to recover him.

51
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,500
[TOKI] I don't know
who the hell this is,

52
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,541
but it looks like
they're for real.

53
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,875
If he's there, then so
are Hitomi and Heike...

54
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,208
Get me over there so I
can kick their asses...!

55
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,250
Let's give a shout to Ogami
and let him know the plan.

56
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,333
[KANDA] Right.

57
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,208
Stupid jerk...!
It's just like the guy

58
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,416
to go running off
when we need him!

59
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,250
Hey... Are you okay?

60
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,083
[YUKI] Number four...
You go on ahead without me...

61
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,708
I'm gonna take care
of these bombs.

62
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,708
[TOKI] Whoa. What?

63
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,291
[KANDA] Wait!

64
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,541
[YUKI] Yeah, I know... There's a
whole mess of them out there,

65
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,750
and not enough time to
disable them individually, sure.

66
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:28,500
But I can't sit back and do
nothing... I just can't...

67
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,083
Too many people
are gonna get hurt.

68
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,625
Well, alright...
Sure you're good?

69
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,500
Oh, don't you
worry about me...

70
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,041
You're not the only
one who kicks ass.

71
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:45,666
[YUKI] Now then. Time to
get this show on the road.

72
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,750
Well, well, well.

73
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,666
[HITOMI] What are
you up to in here?

74
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,916
Ah... I see... You're checking
to make sure there are

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,583
no intruders, are you...?
That is very helpful, Heike.

76
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,916
It's an honor to be at
your service... old friend.

77
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,125
[HITOMI] Man, this takes me
back... All the time we spent

78
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,750
fighting side by side to make
sure evil took its lumps

79
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,541
so the rest of the world
could sleep soundly.

80
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,333
Those were the days.

81
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:27,708
Heike?

82
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,541
Yes, Hitomi?

83
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,333
Thank you for this.

84
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,375
[HITOMI] It's Rei.

85
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,416
[HEIKE] Don't worry,
I'll take care of him.

86
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,541
[HITOMI] No... There's
no need for that.

87
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,666
[HEIKE] Are you sure you
want to bother with it?

88
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,833
[HITOMI] Yeah... The
last time I faced him,

89
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,833
he was just coming
out of being Lost...

90
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,833
I wouldn't mind seeing what
he's actually capable of.

91
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,458
You haven't changed much,
have you, Ace?

92
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,250
In that case, it would be
wise to secure the perimeter

93
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:58,000
so no one interferes...
Mustn't deny your tete-a-tete.

94
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,208
[SAKURA] Ogami!

95
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,541
[OGAMI] Are you all right?
Did they hurt you?

96
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,875
[HITOMI] I have to say,
I'm impressed.

97
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,250
How'd you manage
to sniff us out?

98
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,291
Just walked around
for a little while...

99
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,041
I even went down
to the riverbed...

100
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,541
I went to all the places
we've spent time together...

101
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,416
Didn't expect to
find you here...

102
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,875
But then I remembered something.

103
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,916
I thought of that day you
talked about how many people

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,583
would come here to
look down from the top

105
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,916
once it was finished.
Families. Couples.

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,750
But nobody's here now.

107
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,250
[HITOMI] Yeah... Ironic, isn't
it? I would have preferred

108
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,791
to come here under
peaceful circumstances.

109
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,375
Hitomi, you have to
stop these bombs,

110
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,375
or more people are going to die!

111
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,083
Aren't you planning
to contact Toki

112
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,833
and the other Code Breakers?

113
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,000
[OGAMI] My phone broke
when I was fighting Heike.

114
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,291
Well, in that case, I suppose
you and I can have

115
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,583
a chat without anybody
interrupting us, now can't we?

116
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,708
All I want to talk about
is stopping these bombs.

117
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,041
[OGAMI] Murder is never okay,

118
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,083
even if it is to protect
people with special abilities.

119
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,666
Hitomi, what you're doing is
wrong, and I won't allow it.

120
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,375
[HITOMI] It's funny, Rei.
You almost sound

121
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,083
like a champion of justice.

122
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,916
No, that's not me... I've
done as much evil as you,

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,416
maybe more... but for good.

124
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,375
Sorry, I can't tell you
how to stop the bombs.

125
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,250
Well then...
Since you won't talk,

126
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,125
I guess I have no choice
but to beat it out of you!

127
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,583
An eye for an eye...
A tooth for a tooth...

128
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,916
And evil for evil!

129
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,125
You're too slow.

130
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,416
No! Stop!

131
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,708
He never learns... Ogami.

132
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,875
Is that all you've got?

133
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,208
[HITOMI] You avoid the shock
by grounding the charge

134
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,041
with the katana;
interesting. And then,

135
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,083
with the conductive
powers of your flame,

136
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,583
you subvert the
attack by releasing

137
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,958
the electricity into the
floor beneath your feet.

138
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,500
That really is
smart thinking...

139
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,791
But unfortunately, you won't
be able to beat me like that.

140
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,125
[HITOMI] When you're attacked
from multiple directions

141
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,791
at the same time... your flames
can't redirect all of it.

142
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,791
Not another one!

143
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,916
[SAKURA] Ogami!

144
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,166
The ropes... If only
we could--that's it!

145
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,958
Puppy, I need your help, okay?

146
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,000
Keep going,
you're almost there!

147
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,666
Yes! That's my boy!

148
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,250
[SAKURA] Crap!
That's no good!

149
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,666
Oh, no, Puppy!
I won't let him stop me.

150
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,458
[SAKURA] I'll do it myself!

151
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,333
You're hanging in there...
I certainly hope you're not

152
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,708
counting on me going Lost,
'cause you'll be disappointed.

153
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,708
'Fraid there's no chance
of that happening...

154
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,916
You, on the other hand, could
go there any moment now...

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,125
I can see you struggling.

156
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,166
Although, I'd say it's
much more likely you'll be

157
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,625
electrocuted before you need
to worry about any of that.

158
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,000
[SAKURA] Ogami!

159
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,166
Hey... If you don't
feel like dying today,

160
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,166
you could always
just give up.

161
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,166
[HITOMI] Surrender right
now or meet your end.

162
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,416
I'll never kneel
down before you!

163
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:26,000
[HITOMI] Tell me, why are
you fighting so hard?

164
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,416
Why swear your undying
allegiance to the Code Breakers?

165
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,250
To the Prime Minister?

166
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,000
[OGAMI] What about you?

167
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,458
What in the hell drove you to
try and assassinate the man?

168
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,750
I see... So that's
the story they've been

169
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,708
circulating about me, is it?

170
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,000
[OGAMI] You deny it?

171
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,375
[HITOMI] I went there to
discuss things with him.

172
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,166
[HITOMI] He wasn't
interested in talking.

173
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,958
He rejected me...
Refused to see reason.

174
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,708
And when he saw I wasn't
going to back down...

175
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,750
[HITOMI] He sicked
his agents on me.

176
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,541
A whole slew of them.

177
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,666
[HITOMI] He left me no choice;
if I had any hope of getting

178
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,625
out of there alive,
I had to kill them all.

179
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,625
[SAKURA] Wait... So you were
only trying to defend yourself?

180
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,208
[HITOMI] Yes, and anyone who
says otherwise is lying...

181
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,291
Eden did everything they
could to make me the villain

182
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,875
so they could expel me
from the Code Breakers.

183
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,291
But why would
they want that?

184
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,291
Because what I demanded
of them was something

185
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:30,041
Eden could not accept
under any circumstances.

186
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,166
I asked that Code Breakers
live out in the open

187
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,416
as part of society...
This would mean that

188
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,291
the clandestine nature of Eden's
activities would be exposed...

189
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,083
If the world suddenly knew of
our existence, that might cause

190
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:45,166
people to panic... The results
for Eden would be disastrous.

191
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,875
[HITOMI] I was
forced to disappear

192
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,625
and live in the shadows.

193
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,916
[HITOMI] The only way
I could change Eden

194
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,666
was to apply pressure
from the outside.

195
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,000
[SAKURA] Still, none
of that excuses

196
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,000
the terrible things
you've done.

197
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,291
My course of action
is what it is...

198
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,333
But I could see no other
way to accomplish my goal.

199
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,583
[HITOMI] Besides,
I'm not only doing this

200
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,333
out of consideration
for the Code Breakers.

201
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,833
[YUKIHINA] I'm moving in.

202
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,875
We'll have the government's
special little children

203
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,333
under our wing in a sec.

204
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,125
[HITOMI] The powers that be have
been isolating kids like us.

205
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,416
Using them as research
subjects. Those with

206
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,583
the highest capabilities were
recruited as Code Breakers...

207
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,625
But that just meant they
were dogs of the State,

208
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,166
blunt instruments of
men in high places.

209
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,291
As long as they're in the
claws of the government,

210
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:59,000
a child born with special
abilities has no freedom.

211
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,125
It's not just Code
Breakers like you, Rei,

212
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,541
and Toki that
I'm trying to save...

213
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,791
But every single
boy and girl out there

214
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,041
who'll ever be
born different.

215
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,916
Look, your heart's clearly
in the right place,

216
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,291
I believe that... And if you
wanna help children like Chisa

217
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,541
escape that fate,
I'm with you all the way...

218
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,541
But if you think this is
the way to help people

219
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:23,375
unlucky enough to be born
different... You're wrong!

220
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,125
[SAKURA] Hitomi!

221
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,708
This isn't the way
and you know it!

222
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,458
[HITOMI] Right or wrong,
I'm afraid this is

223
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,750
the only alternative
Eden has left me with.

224
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,916
The blood from today's
tragedy is on their hands.

225
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,541
It grieves me deeply that
they've pushed it this far.

226
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,583
Listen, maybe I don't
understand the depth

227
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,583
of what you're feeling about
everything that's happened.

228
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,500
But I know that no one should
suffer for another's sins...

229
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:58,083
How can you let so many
innocent people die?!

230
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,458
We're owed for the sacrifices
we've made to them!

231
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,250
What's the matter
with you, Ryo?

232
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,833
[RYO] A man was
flying through the sky.

233
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,625
[YUKI] Next one!

234
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,750
I'll take out as many
of them as I can.

235
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,958
[phone rings]

236
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,458
Yeah, Yuki here.
Wait, he's what?!

237
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,375
[TOKI] Elevators
are still working.

238
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,250
[KANDA] If Hitomi's sending
electrical signals across Japan,

239
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,458
then he's definitely
in the control room.

240
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:41,583
[TOKI] Yeah, that's a safe bet.
All right, let's do this thing.

241
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,583
[KANDA] Heike!

242
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,541
[HEIKE] My dear friends, what
brings you to the Sky Tower?

243
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,166
Ha! I'm here to
kick Hitomi's ass

244
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,125
and stop these bombs
from going off!

245
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,750
[HEIKE] If you have a
problem with Hitomi,

246
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,958
you'll have to deal
with me first.

247
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,708
So it's true... You really
have turned traitor on us.

248
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
How disappointing.

249
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,333
[HEIKE] Call me whatever you
like, I'm just doing my job.

250
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,833
[TOKI] Blowing up innocent
people with bombs

251
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,375
is your job now?

252
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,833
[TOKI] You know, the truth
is, I always thought

253
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,333
you were a bit of a
fruitcake... Still...

254
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,500
When it came to being a Code
Breaker I could tell you really

255
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:22,708
took pride in it and that made
me look up to you... But...

256
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,875
[Toki cries]

257
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,416
You okay?

258
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,416
I'm touched...
Really, I had no idea

259
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,041
you felt so passionately
about me, Toki...

260
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,833
But there's nothing I can do,
I'm afraid... I'm sorry, I...

261
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:40,166
[Toki's crying
turns into laughter]

262
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,208
Hey, do you know what
this means...?!

263
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,208
It means that after I
kick your sorry ass

264
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,916
from here to next week,
I get to be Number Two!

265
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,041
Sorry, what?

266
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,791
Thanks for getting me
promoted, buddy!

267
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,416
It was incredibly
thoughtful of you!

268
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,041
But I gotta admit this
is more than just work!

269
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,708
It's pleasure, too...
An eye for an eye!

270
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,666
Tooth for a tooth, and the
hammer of justice for evil!

271
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,083
Alright...!
It's showtime!

272
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:09,083
Damn it, you two! It doesn't
have to be like this!

273
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,416
[HEIKE] How about a
straight flush?!

274
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,250
[TOKI] What the hell?

275
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,791
[HEIKE] Now then, Toki...
I think it's about time

276
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,500
I put you out
of your misery.

277
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,250
[TOKI] Let's see
you try, you bastard!

278
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,000
You've got quite
the potty mouth...

279
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:36,291
Perhaps you need a spanking...
Heike's ten-mirror-flower!

280
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,791
Each and every Heike you see
before you is a carbon copy

281
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,041
of the original... Do you
understand what that means?

282
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,375
You're going down, friend!

283
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,625
[HEIKE] Come now,
don't run away.

284
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,166
Damn it!

285
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,583
[HEIKE] What's the matter, Toki?
I thought you were going to

286
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:58,041
supplant me and take my
place as Code number two!

287
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,250
[TOKI] Shut up! After
I kick the living shit

288
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,791
out of your glittery
look-alike asses,

289
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm coming after
the genuine article!

290
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,000
[HEIKE] Oh?

291
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,041
If you think I'm worried about

292
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,875
seven years' bad
luck, you're wrong!

293
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,666
[HEIKE] You've always been
inferior to me. Always will.

294
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,000
[HEIKE] Well done. But...

295
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,916
When compared to the
speed of light, Toki...

296
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,125
You're still too slow!

297
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,416
This is unbelievable...

298
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,708
Toki's magnetism versus
Heike's light power.

299
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,208
It's not fair to make them pay a
debt they didn't know existed.

300
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,125
So...? Since when
has life been fair?

301
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,166
No... You're dead
wrong, Hitomi...

302
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,041
If you could hear yourself
speak, you know that!

303
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,875
Back away! None of
you are safe here!

304
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,625
[KIZAKURA 8E]
Guys, I found the bomb!

305
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,416
[KIZAKURA 8D] Good work.

306
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,458
[KIZAKURA 8E] You think
Miss Sakura's okay?

307
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,375
All we can do now is hope
she manages on her own.

308
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,708
[POLICEMAN 11A] You two,
stop right there!

309
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,958
[KIZAKURA 8D] We found
a bomb, officer...

310
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,750
There's no telling when
it's going to go off...

311
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,375
You're in danger,
too, so get back.

312
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,375
[KIZAKURA 8D] Wow... Cops are
getting their hands dirty, too.

313
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,666
[POLICEMAN 11A]
Why risk your lives?

314
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,833
'Cause right now,
our young lady Sakura

315
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,791
is out there somewhere
giving it her all...

316
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,416
So we're gonna do everything
we can on our end to help her.

317
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,000
[POLICEMAN 11B]
It isn't safe here...

318
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,333
We'd like you all to move
to the park off 3rd!

319
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,250
[POLICEMAN 11A]
There's no way we're leaving.

320
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:47,250
Risking our lives to keep people
safe is what we do every day.

321
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,125
Please, just stay back...

322
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,666
We're evacuating this street...
Where's the bomb squad?

323
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,583
It's no use... There
are too many bombs

324
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,333
and not enough
men to cover it.

325
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,166
We don't have very much
time left, goddamn it!

326
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,958
There are many who
risk their lives

327
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,875
in the name of
keeping the peace...

328
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,875
But if their sacrifice is made
trying to protect the unworthy,

329
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,875
in the end, they're nothing
more than idealistic fools.

330
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,916
Why? Why do you believe they're
not worthy of protection?

331
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,666
I'm sad to see you don't
know the answer to that.

332
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,083
[HEIKE] Quick...
If you don't hurry up,

333
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,708
the bombs will go off and the
Prime Minister will die!

334
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,833
I'm afraid at this pace,
you'll never make it

335
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,541
in time to save him, Toki.

336
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,291
Why don't you shut
your mouth, asshole?!

337
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,125
I don't understand, why are you
trying so hard to rescue him...?

338
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,458
Is it really just because
you're a Code Breaker?

339
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,541
How about you mind your
own goddamn business?!

340
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,541
Suck on this, d-bag!

341
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,541
I have to say, you seem
a bit off your game...

342
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,000
I hope you're not starting
to doubt yourself.

343
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,000
Just shut up, you stupid,
twinkling bastards!

344
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,541
[OGAMI] Is that really all
you've got to say...?

345
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,375
All the people
you've protected...

346
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,875
All the people you laid
it on the line for...

347
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,625
They're nothing but fools
to you? And that's it?

348
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,791
Yes, that's it... And I'll
put them out of their misery.

349
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,708
Well, I can't accept that!

350
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,625
If you think I'll
let this happen...

351
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,250
You've got another think
coming, old friend!

352
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,916
You're using quite a bit
of your special ability...

353
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,375
You trying to guarantee
you'll go Lost?

354
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,625
You've made a valiant effort,
but you're almost out of time.

355
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,833
So... Shall we end this?

356
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:40,875
A royal straight flush
ought to do the trick. Now!

357
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,916
Take this!

358
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,875
[HACHIOJI] If I were you,
I'd stop right there.

359
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,750
Somebody's been busy
lately... haven't they?

360
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,000
'Fraid that's all
over now, though.

361
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,125
'Cause if you think I'm
letting you get by me,

362
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,000
you're out of your mind.

363
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,541
How in the hell are
you still alive?

364
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,916
Hell is what I clawed
my way out of to be here.

365
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,500
[OGAMI] Next time...
Code Breaker, Episode 12...

366
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:50,541
"Devils... God and Man...
Sakura Watching Over"...

367
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:54,708
I am here to bring an end to all
of this, Hitomi... You're done!
