Because he was the last to join,

00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,208
[MOTHER YUKI hmmms]

162
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,583
[MOTHER YUKI] Okay...
I'll leave you alone, then.

163
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,041
[SAKURA sighs]

164
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,250
[SAKURA gasps]

165
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,291
[MOTHER YUKI] I forgot,
dinner'll be served

166
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,916
in the banquet hall
in just a bit.

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,166
[SAKURA] Uh...
That sounds perfect...

168
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,375
Thank you!

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,833
[yawn]

170
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,291
So...

171
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,083
I got word from Eden
that Ogami was Lost...

172
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,458
And the moment I heard
I came running here

173
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,250
so I could give
him some back up.

174
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,583
[HEIKE] That's very brave,

175
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,375
and very stupid considering
you're Lost, too...

176
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,666
So, has Eden been made
aware of your condition...?

177
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,083
Have you told them yet?

178
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,250
Well...

179
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,708
From the look
on your face,

180
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,875
it's clear you've decided
not to tell them, you fool!

181
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,416
Hey!

182
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Who said you could put
stickers on me, dumbass?!

183
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,291
[YUKI] Don't be a jerk.

184
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,583
It'll help you get better.

185
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,416
[TOKI] What's wrong with you?!

186
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,833
You two sure do seem
to get along well.

187
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:13,833
[MOTHER YUKI] So...

188
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,166
I hope you brought
your appetites,

189
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,750
because boy do we have
a feast prepared tonight!

190
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,750
[KIZAKURA] Let's eat...!

191
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,958
We thank you for this food!

192
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:31,916
[laughter and chatting]

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,833
Are you all right...?

194
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,541
Is something the matter?

195
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,291
No... I'm fine.

196
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,041
Forgive me for asking,

197
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,000
but why did you become
a Code Breaker?

198
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,041
I see...

199
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,750
That's what you're
wondering about.

200
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,416
Tell me, what is
Ogami's take on it?

201
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,958
He thinks he has
to wipe out evil.

202
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,416
Is that a fact?

203
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,000
Burn to nothing.

204
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,791
But I know it's not
good for him...

205
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,458
Not at all.

206
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:14,708
Hey, Sakura...!
Do you want a drink?

207
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,958
[SAKURA] Toki,
what are you doing?

208
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,500
Underage drinking
is illegal!

209
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,208
S'not booze, dork face...

210
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,458
Ugh... Gimme a break!

211
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,166
[SAKURA] You're
clearly drunk!

212
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,083
Yeah...

213
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,416
It happens when I get Lost...

214
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,208
I just can't hold my juice.

215
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,541
[SAKURA]
Wait, juice?

216
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,791
Toki...

217
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,708
You lose points
for this, big time.

218
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,541
Oh yeah?

219
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,250
I'm not scared of you...!

220
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,875
And you know why?

221
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,458
'Cause you don't
have any eyebrows!

222
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,083
Seriously, who could
be scared of that?!

223
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,333
[HEIKE] Look...

224
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,000
If you insist on acting
like a wayward infant

225
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,416
I'm going to discipline
you like a wayward infant.

226
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,791
[TOKI] Unless you
want to get peed on,

227
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,041
back the hell off!

228
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,916
[YUKI] Thanks for
bringing Number Six here,

229
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,916
it was really nice of you.

230
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,666
No, it's my
pleasure, really...

231
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,958
After everything
he's done

232
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,708
for my classmates and me
it's the least I can do...

233
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,375
Plus...

234
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,041
These stubborn idiots
need help now more than ever...

235
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,958
I couldn't turn my back on them.

236
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,583
[NYANMARU] The others are
too worn out to fight...!

237
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,833
So Nyanmaru will fight for them!

238
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,666
Nyanmaru?

239
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,375
[TOKI screams]

240
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,750
Let go, doo-doo face!

241
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,458
I mean it, get me down
from here right this minute!

242
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,541
Oh damn it, I think
I just peed my pants, again!

243
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:23,958
[KANDA] I can't
thank you enough

244
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,375
for letting
everyone stay here...

245
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,625
You saved the day.

246
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,791
Please...

247
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,125
I just wish there
was more I could do...

248
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,125
I'm happy that
I could help.

249
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,958
Nyanmaru...
I will protect you.

250
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,708
[HEIKE] What a haunting sky...

251
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,750
Not ideal for my reading.

252
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,833
[TOKI] Out here keeping
everyone safe, are we?

253
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,291
[HEIKE] Yes well,
it's a dirty job

254
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,750
but somebody has to do it.

255
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,333
[TOKI scoffs]

256
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,375
Toki...

257
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,208
I've spent time
thinking about it...

258
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,000
And I believe I know
what they were up to today.

259
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,333
From my vantage point,

260
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,583
it seemed clear they were
split into two groups.

261
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,708
One team that
focused on Ogami...

262
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,708
And another team that
went after Miss Sakurakoji.

263
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,125
Did you ever stop
to wonder why

264
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,541
Hitomi would set up an
operation like that?

265
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,083
[TOKI] Are you suggesting
Sakura was the target?

266
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,541
The girl is a rarebreed,
is she not...?

267
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,916
It doesn't seem surprising

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,750
to me that he'd show
interest in her... But.

269
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,500
If his primary objective
was to kidnap her,

270
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,083
it seems to me there
are far easier ways

271
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,458
to go about it...

272
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,875
I can't fathom why he would try

273
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,875
to take her with Ogami
standing right by her side...

274
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,041
It just doesn't make sense

275
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,916
for him to divide
his forces like that...

276
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,458
Why not hold off and
grab her when she's alone?

277
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,916
Yeah...

278
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,416
The only good
thing that came of it

279
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,125
is that idiot was
forced to go Lost.

280
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,125
[HEIKE] You're absolutely
right... That's true.

281
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,791
[HEIKE] Could there have been

282
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,708
another motive I'm not seeing?

283
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,250
Where am I?

284
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,250
[KANDA] I'm glad
to see you awake.

285
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,916
[OGAMI] Kanda...
Is this Sakura's house?

286
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,083
[KANDA] Yes...
It is.

287
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,291
[KANDA] I am so sorry, sir...

288
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,625
If there was anything
I could've done

289
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,250
to stop those men
from attacking you...

290
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,208
Please don't apologize...

291
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,625
It's my fault,
I was careless.

292
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,625
[KANDA] Sir...

293
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,791
Those men, they
were definitely

294
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,333
the agents that
went missing on us...

295
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,916
And more than that...

296
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,208
Yeah...

297
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,875
I know, they were controlled
by special powers.

298
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,625
You really
think it's him?

299
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,208
No question...

300
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,708
We're dealing with the
former Code Breaker...

301
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,625
Code Number One... Hitomi.

302
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:59,875
[phone rings]

303
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,041
What's up?

304
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,333
[MAN] Code Number Five...

305
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,375
Head to Sakura Sakurakoji's
house immediately.

306
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,875
Why...? I don't understand,

307
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,125
I thought Yuki and
Toki were already there?

308
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,541
[MAN] Toki is Lost
and Number Three

309
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:14,583
can't manage on
his own... Acknowledge.

310
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,000
Copy that.

311
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,083
[HACHIOJI] What the
hell are those guys doing?

312
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,166
Either I missed a
meeting or something's up.

313
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,625
[GOTOKU]
Beautiful blade, isn't it?

314
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,166
[GOTOKU] You certainly look like
you're feeling better now...

315
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,958
I'm glad to see it.

316
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,375
Your interest in
this isn't casual, is it?

317
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:57,958
[GOTOKU] My guess...

318
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,416
You've seen your share of death.

319
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,541
It's there in your eyes...

320
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,625
Your dark past

321
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,500
and the bad things
you've witnessed.

322
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,500
You've lost the anxiety
and dread that comes

323
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,916
from taking another
person's life...

324
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,416
And I'm guessing
you've also lost sight

325
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,791
of what it means to be alive.

326
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,708
[GOTOKU] Sakura's the
light of my life...

327
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,333
If anything were
to happen to her...

328
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,416
It'd come at a great
cost... You understand?

329
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,333
[GOTOKU] My men!

330
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,125
It's you!

331
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,708
No! Sakura!

332
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,166
I'll protect you, Nyanmaru!

333
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,291
Be more careful please...

334
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,291
You wouldn't wanna hurt

335
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,333
the young lady,
now would you...?

336
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,583
Also...

337
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,041
Please tell me that's
not the best you can do.

338
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,791
You shut up!

339
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,666
Oh well...
Night night, kitty cat

340
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,541
Yuki!

341
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,791
[HITOMI] You walked
right into going Lost...

342
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,250
As your mentor, I must say,

343
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,833
I'm very disappointed.

344
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,041
Ogami!

345
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,333
[KANDA] Stop...! Right now...

346
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,375
Let her go...! I mean it!

347
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,791
Do you seriously
think you can stop me?

348
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,791
Hitomi... Please.

349
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,625
[HITOMI] I'm impressed.

350
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,708
Your swordsmanship's
gotten much stronger...

351
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,125
As your teacher,
I feel proud... But...

352
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,166
You're still
no match for me...

353
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,666
so back off... If you obey...?

354
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,125
Then you'll live.

355
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:42,958
[HEIKE] You wanna dance?

356
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,625
Wow... Well, well...

357
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,625
The gang's back together again.

358
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:02,958
What do you know about that,

359
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,250
it's almost like old times!

360
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,291
Hey...! You're still
recovering, man...

361
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,333
Keep back.

362
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,791
No way, this kill
is all mine.

363
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,416
Why are you
doing this, Hitomi?

364
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,333
What do you hope to gain?

365
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,458
Just revenge.

366
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:27,000
That's all.
Revenge against Eden.

367
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,666
[OGAMI] You've changed...

368
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,708
You hated the idea of revenge...

369
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,083
You called it a
tool of darkness.

370
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,333
[SAKURA] Are he
and Ogami friends?

371
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,583
[OGAMI] But since you
chose the path of evil...

372
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,708
I have no choice but this!

373
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,875
[HITOMI] It's sad to see

374
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,625
you've turned into
a dog for Eden...

375
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,625
Such a tragedy.

376
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,958
[OGAMI] It's not about Eden!

377
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,500
I'm doing this for myself
and for no other reason!

378
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,500
[HITOMI] Dogs like you don't get

379
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,208
to make their own choices!

380
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,541
Oh no!

381
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,625
Now it's my turn, asshole!

382
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,916
[TOKI] What, you're not
gonna take your hands

383
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,500
out of your pockets, douche?!

384
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,166
I'll take them out

385
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,875
when I have a good reason to.

386
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,166
Ah.

387
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,708
Ogami.

388
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:34,833
[HITOMI] How fun...

389
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,916
I take it your Lost
period is up then.

390
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,333
Look...

391
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,541
I don't know what kinda grudge

392
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,791
you've got against Eden
and I don't care...

393
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,750
But whatever it is you're
up to, I won't let it happen.

394
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,750
You haven't
changed a bit...

395
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,541
You and your extremes...
So silly.

396
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,333
[OGAMI] An eye for an eye.

397
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:57,083
A tooth for a tooth.
And evil for evil!

398
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,250
[HITOMI] Nice try...

399
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,500
But your powers
just don't measure up.

400

[SAKURA] Ogami...! Toki!

401
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,000
Now, then.

402
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,583
[HITOMI] Surely you don't think

403
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,833
you can actually beat me.

404
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:25,625
Well, I suppose there's

405
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,416
only one way to find out.

There's no way
we're gonna let you

walk away with the girl.

[HITOMI] Ah, there's a
name that takes me back...

Code Number One.

414

There's a reason
I held that rank.

415
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,708
I think it's about time
I showed you why.

416

[HACHIOJI] Whoa...
When did he get that strong?!

Excellent job, young lady!

for you, I'm running late...

We'll pick up where we
left off another time...
