1
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:26,291
Watch those lunges. Your point
needs to strike home. Here.

2
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,083
Finally!

3
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,458
[HITOMI] Congratulations, you
improved your form just enough

4
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,625
to distract yourself
into getting skewered.

5
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,791
Well done. Bravo.

6
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,541
Gee, thanks...
So encouraging.

7
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,291
Encouraging is for
sissies, don't ya think?

8
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,375
Now get up... Rei.

9
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,333
[HITOMI] He's Lost.
This shouldn't be possible.

10
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:15,333
An eye for an eye... Tooth for
a tooth. And evil for evil.

11
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:19,208
You're full of surprises,
aren't you? Just look at you.

12
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:24,416
Determined to beat me
whatever the cost. Well...

13
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,958
[SAKURA] Ogami!

14
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:29,208
[HITOMI] It pains me to do this,
but I'm not letting you win.

15
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,250
[HITOMI] What?!

16
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,541
He absorbed his power?!
How'd he do that?

17
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,458
Try absorbing this,
you bastard!

18
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,041
[TOKI] Oh, no!

19
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,375
[HITOMI] Your flame can't deal
with this much electricity...

20
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,458
You'll have to take the
whole thing at once!

21
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,875
No, Hitomi!

22
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,458
Die!

23
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,791
Sakura!

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,916
Hey, freak! Get the hell
out of there already!

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,416
Damn it, Number One...
Stop it!

26
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,291
Oh, my god...

27
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,041
He absorbed
the whole thing.

28
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:20,791
Exquisitely done. Bravo,
Number Six... Magnificent.

29
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:25,166
[SAKURA] What's going on?
I don't understand.

30
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,000
Those eyes... He's not
himself anymore!

31
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,291
Oh, no... This isn't over!

32
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,333
No one stands in my way!

33
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,541
Hitomi!

34
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,791
I will fulfill my vision.

35
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,041
Don't do it!

36
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,291
You cannot stop me!

37
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,458
This world will be changed!

38
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,541
Incredible.
He's become a god.

39
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,208
Burn to nothing.

40
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,416
[KANDA] Hitomi!

41
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
[HACHIOJI] No, please!

42
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,541
God. Is he dead?

43
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,541
[SAKURA] Ogami!

44
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,250
[YUKI] Number six!

45
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,916
[HEIKE] Well done, my friend.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,208
You've reached the
pinnacle of your art.

47
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,958
[KANDA]
Hitomi. Look at me!

48
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,333
[HITOMI] Kanda...

49
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,791
[SAKURA]
Wake up! Come on!

50
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,541
Don't you even think
about doing this to me!

51
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,750
[HITOMI] So I screwed up, huh?

52
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,250
Wait! You shouldn't
be moving!

53
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,875
[HITOMI] Get away from me.

54
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,500
[SAKURA] Hey!
What's happening?!

55
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,458
Ah... We have
arrived at Code End.

56
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,375
[TOKI] Wha--? He's there?!

57
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,458
[KANDA] Oh, no...

58
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,083
[HACHIOJI] Hitomi...

59
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,791
Heh...
So you knew...

60
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,166
about Code End...
all this time, huh?

61
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,875
Oh, man...

62
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,916
His powers have
turned on him.

63
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,333
[HITOMI] Safe to say I don't
have long. I've pretty much been

64
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,750
on borrowed time since Eden
had me in the crosshairs...

65
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,708
I was so scared.

66
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:58,541
Not so much of dying, but of
being all alone when I went...

67
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,583
And I knew... that our
brothers felt the same terror;

68
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,458
that it filled their
last moments on earth.

69
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,333
Listen to me rant...
It's not like I can expect

70
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:15,083
you all to understand...
And it's my fault you don't.

71
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,000
I wish I could've changed
things for you guys;

72
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,875
found a way to reform Eden...
But when I realized

73
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:26,416
my Code End was just around
the corner, I panicked.

74
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,875
I couldn't... I couldn't focus.
And I hated Eden so much...

75
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,500
All... All I wanted...

76
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:39,333
was to carve out a better world
for people like us, without...

77
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,875
This fear... This horrible
feeling that life just marches

78
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:47,625
on without you... I didn't
want this to be our destiny.

79
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,291
We deserved better.
Anyone would.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,875
[HITOMI]
But it all fell apart.

81
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:01,458
[HITOMI] No...
I have one last card to play.

82
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,875
This isn't over... Just yet.

83
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,333
Enough already! Please!

84
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,208
I can see to it
the Prime Minister

85
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,041
pays for what he's done!

86
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,916
It's all over, Hitomi.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The man must atone for the
deaths of my fallen brothers...

88
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:19,000
It's justice! As long as
I breathe... evil must...

89
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,708
Stop! It's over--!

90
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,666
He deserves to die
and you know it!

91
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,500
Who's gonna do it if not us?!

92
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,833
And what did all those
people deserve?!

93
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,458
Are we worth it?
Is payback worth it?!

94
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:39,458
You don't care who dies,
do you? Is that justice?!

95
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,833
What happened to
protecting the helpless?

96
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,708
How is it okay to just use
them to make a point...?!

97
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,375
I believed in you...!
I wanted to be like you!

98
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,750
[OGAMI] You bastard!

99
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,833
You were our compass,
don't you understand?!

100
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:01,375
We followed you to make
sense of ourselves!

101
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:08,208
I had to... I had no choice.
I owed it to you as your leader.

102
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,916
He took this burden on
himself for their sakes...

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,666
Like they were all...

104
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,000
[SAKURA] ...his children.

105
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,000
[OGAMI] No!

106
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,666
[HITOMI] Kanda isn't the
only one whose job it is

107
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,958
to keep us in check. Other Code
Breakers watch from the wings.

108
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,416
[HITOMI] I didn't want to
involve you in my plan,

109
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,000
because if I so much as
contacted you... There was

110
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,958
a chance Eden would blame
you too. I had to do it alone.

111
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,500
[HACHIOJI] Hitomi!

112
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,041
Oh, god...!

113
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,583
Hang on!

114
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,708
[HITOMI] How 'bout that...
Loyal to the end,

115
00:07:55,791 --> 00:08:00,666
even when I try to keep you at
bay... Even after all this...

116
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,208
[TOKI] Tell us what to do.

117
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,833
[HITOMI] Just like
old times, huh...?

118
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,875
Hey, Yuki... Always the first
one to come running at any sign

119
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:17,125
of trouble, aren't you? You
sure set a good example, kid.

120
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,791
Number one...

121
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:24,458
[HITOMI] Toki... I'm glad you
protected Kanda from me...

122
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:28,291
I was wrong to do what I did.
It was heartless.

123
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,416
It's okay.

124
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,875
I'm so sorry... Kanda...

125
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:41,375
[HITOMI] Hachioji... I'm amazed
you fought Yukihina and lived...

126
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,875
And I'm glad...
But it's too bad

127
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,291
we couldn't get the
children out in time...

128
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,541
[HACHIOJI] I didn't...

129
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:51,583
[HITOMI] No, it's okay;
it wasn't your fault.

130
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,333
Heike... I want
you to know that

131
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,250
I trusted you every
step of the way.

132
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,333
Hell, even when you were acting
suspicious, I figured you still

133
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:04,333
had my best interests at heart,
so I just went with it...

134
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,041
The time we spent
together as Code Breakers

135
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,041
were some of the happiest
moments of my life.

136
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,500
Had to go and give you the
transmit point, didn't I...?

137
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,791
Everything seemed so tightly
wrapped up till then...

138
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,583
But you got me.

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,875
[HITOMI] I just wish I could've
met all of you sooner.

140
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,000
We could've worked together
to improve our lot.

141
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:30,666
God knows I couldn't
do it on my own.

142
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,625
Ogami... your powers
are astonishing.

143
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,708
But... your point
didn't strike home.

144
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,250
You gotta watch
those lunges, kiddo...

145
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,166
Don't get distracted
by your own power.

146
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,166
It's about follow-through.
Finish what you started.

147
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,500
Don't talk to me... What the
hell is wrong with you?!

148
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,125
You think I care about you
after what you've done?!

149
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,791
I didn't fight you out of
respect! You understand?!

150
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,875
I beat your ass because
you betrayed us!

151
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,458
And look at you now!
Lying there like a broken animal

152
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:06,208
begging for death...
Screw you! You're the Ace!

153
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,375
You were supposed to have
our back no matter what!

154
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:13,416
I didn't want to do this!
I wanted you to be right!

155
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,250
How is anything supposed to
change for us with you dead?!

156
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,875
I don't know... But
I saw this through

157
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,791
as far as I could, and that's
something, at least...

158
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,875
If that's as good a deal
as I get, I'll take it.

159
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:35,333
Maybe it's up to you...
Maybe you ought to be the one...

160
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,375
I mean... you're
the hero here...

161
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,583
If anyone can bring
us into the light...

162
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:43,208
it's the guy who saved
the world from me.

163
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:49,458
You and Toki... Yuki...
Heike... and Hachioji...

164
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:53,958
Why not join hands and step
into the light together?

165
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:57,666
It would be beautiful...
Do that...

166
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,666
Take your place in the world
proudly... For me... For them.

167
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,750
That won't be possible.

168
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,208
Take it from me, my friend:
ten years from now,

169
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:15,083
no one will remember your
name... You're just small-time.

170
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,708
Come forward now
and all they'll do

171
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,666
is turn the code breakers
into boogeymen.

172
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,083
So, yes. I think we're
finished here, are we not?

173
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,000
[SAKURA] How can
you say such a thing?!

174
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,041
All of this could have been
avoided if you'd only listened

175
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:31,041
to him! He came to you in
confidence as their leader!

176
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,041
What he wanted for them
was what you should want

177
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,416
for the people you're
supposed to lead!

178
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Don't get all high-handed,
love. I'm not obligated

179
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:41,458
to let a freak of nature bombard
me with his existential dilemma.

180
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:46,083
But, you... You groomed him
into his role. You chose him...

181
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,875
And now I regret having done
so. If I'd had any inkling

182
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,333
it would pan out like this,
I'd have had him put down.

183
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:59,416
But, live and learn... I'll be
far more cautious in future.

184
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,625
With the next batch.

185
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,333
You... monster!!

186
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,333
Oh, no.

187
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,708
Stop this!

188
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,333
I'm finished watching
you destroy innocent lives,

189
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,375
you twisted son of
a bitch! I'm done!

190
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:23,208
You will pay! You...

191
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:28,500
...will pay!!

192
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,166
It's alright...
Just let it go.

193
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,125
You've done enough... Let us
handle it from here on...

194
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:53,583
No more... No more
blood on your hands.

195
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:58,500
I don't want to see you go
out like that... Please.

196
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:03,833
Trust us. You've taught
us well. And we're here.

197
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,125
You're not alone... Your death
will not have been for nothing.

198
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:20,291
You're right. Thank you, Ogami.
I'm so damn proud of you.

199
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:24,125
It's been an honor to
watch you grow up.

200
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,333
You have fulfilled
your role admirably...

201
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,291
We are in your debt... Ace.

202
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,875
[PRIME MINISTER]
I thought he'd never go...

203
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,291
A black sheep to
the very end, eh?

204
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,333
Shut the hell up!

205
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:15,458
[SAKURA] Surely he didn't
have to end up like this.

206
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,666
[OGAMI] How else should a man
end up who does what he did...?

207
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,333
He had this coming.

208
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,875
[SAKURA] Shut up!

209
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,541
He was scared; he wasn't
in his right mind!

210
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:31,416
It doesn't matter anymore!
He's dead. End of story.

211
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,791
Oh, Ogami...

212
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:43,291
I hear the crazy son of a
bitch took a slug to the head.

213
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,791
Justice is served.

214
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,000
[WOMAN 13A] Well,
it just goes to show you

215
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,166
that we're all in
very good hands.

216
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,041
[CHILD 13A] Police do not get
enough credit. Seriously.

217
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,208
[PRIME MINISTER]
Outstanding work, m'boy.

218
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,208
I had a job to do
and I did it.

219
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,208
Don't be so modest...
Come now...

220
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,875
Your supposed betrayal
was a fulcrum point.

221
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,875
You played the poor
man like a fiddle.

222
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,041
[HEIKE] If you insist.

223
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,416
[PRIME MINISTER]
You used Hachioji and Yuki

224
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,166
to marvelous effect as well.
The children were kept

225
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,083
in our hands; this country's
illustrious Prime Minister

226
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,458
was spared-- all in all,
a good day's work.

227
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:22,000
Hm. Oh, don't worry...
I'd be a fool to think

228
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,875
you didn't have ulterior
motives behind all this.

229
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,458
The extent of Six's power
could only manifest

230
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,458
when his back
was against a wall.

231
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,375
If Hitomi had succeeded
in bringing Ogami

232
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,958
to his cause, we'd have
been in quite a pickle.

233
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,375
But you made sure
they were at odds.

234
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:41,333
Now one is no longer a problem
and the other is, well...

235
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,500
[PRIME MINISTER] Kudos,
Heike... I'm impressed.

236
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,875
You are too kind.

237
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,166
[PRIME MINISTER] Your
skirmish with Hitomi

238
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,541
was a particularly
brilliant piece of theatre.

239
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,875
I don't know if I'd
call it that, sir.

240
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,416
So... Number Six... What do
you think of his power?

241
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,458
Is it mature enough yet to make
a play against the Seekee?

242
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,916
[SEEKEE] Really? Hitomi is gone?
Nothing stopping them from

243
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,958
making the girl a collar around
his neck anymore, then.

244
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,500
[SEEKEE] Lucky her.

245
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,166
Rei's power made a good
show its first time out,

246
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,583
but we'd be the
epitome of naive

247
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,458
to presume we
can maintain control.

248
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,250
[PRIME MINISTER] Bah. We've got
the rarebreed under our thumb,

249
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,041
lest you forget.
She's our secret weapon

250
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,708
should his fire ever
need extinguishing.

251
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,791
I see... How pragmatic
of you, sir.

252
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,416
[PRIME MINISTER]
Our plan owes everything

253
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,916
to the juxtaposition
of those two.

254
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,541
They are the reason Hitomi was
given the opportunity to become

255
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:45,541
a Code Breaker, let alone
lead them, in the first place.

256
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,166
His powers drew Ogami's out;
Sakura's kept them in check.

257
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,416
In the end, it unfolded like
an elegant game of chess.

258
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,916
Exactly as planned.

259
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,458
Congratulations.

260
00:16:56,541 --> 00:17:00,125
Indeed...! Now our pawns are
lined up against the Seekee...

261
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,625
Fire shall be fought
with fire... Yes? Heh.

262
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,250
Heh... Yes, sir.

263
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,041
Still, all bets are off...
Hitomi did come

264
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,208
uncomfortably close
there for a bit...

265
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,708
When push comes to shove...
The Seekee might prevail...

266
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,041
There's just never
a moment's peace.

267
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,000
That's right, never a
moment's peace...

268
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,708
Says the man who
egged Hitomi on.

269
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,375
I was well protected,
right...? Come...

270
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,125
Why shouldn't I take
risks when I have

271
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,666
someone of your caliber in
my pocket? Nothing ven--

272
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,250
[DRIVER 13A] What happened?!

273
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,750
Guess I spoke too soon...
Sneaky bastard...

274
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,166
[HEIKE] Hitomi...

275
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,208
Where is he?

276
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,333
[puppy whimpers]

277
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,666
[YUKI] I know.
Kinda sucks, right?

278
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,375
[SAKURA] What are you doing?

279
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,583
He's gone... I'm sorry.

280
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,708
[YUKI] Cheer up, though--
I'm still around.

281
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,208
If you're, like, ever in
trouble or something...

282
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,125
All you gotta do is call.

283
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,166
Uh... Thanks,
I appreciate that.

284
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,791
[YUKI] Later!

285
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,166
[HACHIOJI] Yeah, the cat boy's
never been strong on goodbyes.

286
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,625
[SAKURA] What do you mean?

287
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,333
[HACHIOJI] The gig's over.
They only pulled us together

288
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,000
for the Hitomi thing...
Now that it's put to bed,

289
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,833
we're back to working solo.
That's how it goes.

290
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,833
So yeah, anyway...
Thank you. For everything...

291
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,416
Your mom can cook.

292
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,708
Well...
You're always welcome.

293
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,083
Hey there; look at that...
So you do smile.

294
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:58,875
Wow... Now that I see it,
your smile is really beautiful.

295
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,500
Shut the hell up!

296
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,958
Uh... I mean,
see you 'round!

297
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,291
Y'know, I think I like her.

298
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,583
So I suppose... everyone will
go their separate ways now.

299
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,750
[SAKURA] Don't give me that...
Good riddance, I say.

300
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,833
[SAKURA] Nothing but trouble...

301
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,750
[TOKI] Whoa. Somebody looks
like they need a pick-me-up.

302
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,291
[SAKURA] There... There was
something in my eye!

303
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,416
Least they said
goodbye, ya know?

304
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,333
So, does this mean
you're not leaving?

305
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,666
Oh, no... You and I
have unfinished bus--

306
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,416
Knock it off...
You're an ass.

307
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,791
That was uncalled for...
I was gonna tell you

308
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,000
where you might find Ogami,
but I guess you don't care.

309
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,625
Out with it, now...!
Please, I have to know...!

310
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,875
He and I left too much
hanging between us...

311
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,458
I can't just let him
go off on his own!

312
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,125
[TOKI] Damn...
Guy's got all the luck.

313
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:19,125
Really? He's already
back in the field?

314
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,666
Yeah... Can't believe
I'm the first one

315
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,041
you're hearing this from...
Such a douche.

316
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,875
What, he's just gonna leave you
to wonder if he's even okay...?

317
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,875
I mean, give me
a break... Ugh...

318
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,750
How hard is it to say
goodbye? Seriously.

319
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,583
[TOKI] Whoa... What the...?
What are you doing?

320
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:40,708
Driver! Stop the bus, please!
I need to get off this instant!

321
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,833
Bye, Sakura...
Best of luck.

322
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,875
Mom...! Look up!

323
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,541
Ogami.

324
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,916
Snooze, ya lose!

325
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,500
[GIRL 13B] Whatever!
In your dreams!

326
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,458
Wow! This is so neat!

327
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,000
Well done...

328
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,416
[SAKURA] Ogami...
Code Breakers go unnoticed

329
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,708
by the bulk of
humanity, yes, but...

330
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:40,000
You leave no less a
mark because of it...

331
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,458
You've made a
difference in my life...

332
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:48,333
In some secret way, you thrive
in all of us... You exist...

333
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,833
No matter how well you keep
to the shadows or walk between

334
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:56,458
the raindrops, none of you is a
ghost; none of you is alone...

335
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,791
Even Hitomi, and the fallen
comrades he mourned,

336
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:04,041
live in the hearts of
those you've saved.

337
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,791
And we thank you.

338
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:23,291
An eye for an eye...
tooth for a tooth...

339
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,416
And evil for evil.
