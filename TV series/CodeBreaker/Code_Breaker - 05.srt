00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,125
my little sister...

165
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,041
She needed help, but...

166
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,333
I... couldn't do anything...

167
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,333
I couldn't do anything
and now I can't hear her!

168
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,625
[BOY] Get them back...

169
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:40,333
Kill them all...
for my brother's sake.

170
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,333
[GIRL]
They murdered her, I know it...

171
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,250
They deserve to die
for what they've done.

172
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,958
Please kill them!

173
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,750
[MAD DOCTOR B] No!
Think about what you're doing!

174
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,166
We're not so different,
you and I!

175
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,708
This is unbearable.

176
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,958
[TOKI] An eye for an eye...
a tooth for a tooth.

177
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,166
And the hammer
of justice for all evil.

178
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,583
He deserved it.

179
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,125
Thank you... Thank you...

180
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,875
Oh no...! Hey...!

181
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,625
Wake up...!
Don't do this! Come on!

182
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,916
[SAKURA] Why did this happen?

183
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:42,208
[MAD DOCTOR A] No!!
Please! Don't do this!

184
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,000
Burn to nothing.

185
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,208
Thank you... sir.

186
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,541
[OGAMI] Don't thank me...

187
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,041
My own evil simply
cancelled his out...

188
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,250
It can neither soothe your grief
nor restore what you've lost...

189
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:07,250
Evil is evil. Dead is dead.

190
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,250
I don't care... Thank you.

191
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,083
[TABATA] Damn you...!
You hypocrites!

192
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,291
No...! Stay away!

193
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,250
Wait!

194
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,166
Leave it...
I told you.

195
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,875
No...! Enough lives have
been lost here tonight!

196
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,916
Answer me this...
What makes someone a hero...?

197
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Other than their talent.

198
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,333
Why do we put
them on a pedestal?

199
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,458
[SAKURA] This is no time for--!

200
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,541
Give it some thought.

201
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,000
They do what others can't...

202
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:49,375
Sacrifice their humanity
on the altar of justice.

203
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,375
Besides...

204
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,250
It's not like you're
gonna reach him

205
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,375
with the state
you're in...

206
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,625
You're not even
convinced Ogami's wrong.

207
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,708
Yes I am!

208
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,291
...cut my little
brother up because...

209
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,458
...Get them back...
Kill them all...

210
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,458
Thank you... sir.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,416
You presume to judge me...!
You know nothing!

212
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,166
My pain is
my justification...!

213
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,458
Same as yours!

214
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,791
[CHISA] Daddy?

215
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,416
Daddy... What's happening...?

216
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,208
Why are all these people here?

217
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,666
Chisa!

218
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,833
[SAKURA] Is
that his... daughter?

219
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,291
It's okay...

220
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,583
We're all heros; just like
in your little book, right?

221
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,041
Oh wow...!

222
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,875
You're Fireball man,
aren't you...?

223
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,500
I've been waiting to
meet you for so long!

224
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,833
[CHISA] Daddy said you'd
make the bad parts inside me

225
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,083
into a molten lava core

226
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,166
just like you've got,
and he was right!

227
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,916
You're the
best hero ever...!

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,458
Thank you...! And don't
worry, I'll be good!

229
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,041
Maybe I can even
be your sidekick

230
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,875
and we can fight together!

231
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,333
[SAKURA] I don't believe it...

232
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,666
Tabata was doing all this

233
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,083
to find a cure
for his little girl...

234
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,791
[TOKI] Well I suppose
it's obvious why you jumped

235
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,541
at the chance to spearhead
this little project...

236
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,666
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
a bit surprised by this...

237
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,916
And touched.

238
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,791
Still, though...
Seriously...?

239
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,041
I mean, sure:

240
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,458
I can see it from your
point of view, but...

241
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,916
killing all those children...?

242
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,250
[TABATA] Shut up!

243
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,333
What was I supposed to
do--just let her die...?!

244
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,500
She's been on the
transplant list for a year!

245
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,166
We don't have
the luxury of time!

246
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,833
And how many
daughters did you kill

247
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,458
so your daughter
could live?

248
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,250
That's pretty
messed up.

249
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,625
How dare you...!

250
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,333
You have no right to talk...!

251
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,250
How many lives have fallen
to you and your kind, huh...?

252
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,791
Government sanctioned
murderers, that's what you are!

253
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,208
That's right...!
A glorified death squad!

254
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,625
At least these children died
with their innocence intact,

255
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,708
and not following your path...!

256
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,625
Here their deaths
served a purpose...

257
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:43,833
Here they could save a life

258
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,875
instead of ending
countless others!

259
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,541
Tell me what
I've done is evil...!

260
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,041
Tell me I should've
killed my little girl!

261
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,500
Chisa's my everything.

262
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,791
She's all that I have...
Yes, I'm a murderer--fine...!

263
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,500
And for my daughter's
sake I would gladly--

264
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,791
[OGAMI] Murder
countless other children.

265
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,250
I can sympathize
with a monster

266
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,583
and still wipe him
out of existence.

267
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:10,041
[TABATA] We're all monsters
in the end, aren't we?

268
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,500
I guess so.

269
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,625
Shut up and
listen to me...

270
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,875
I met a boy tonight
so full of hate...

271
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,541
So twisted he wanted
someone else to suffer...

272
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,125
Is that what it takes to save
your daughter's life...?

273
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,166
Spreading that kind of misery?!

274
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,583
You son of a bitch...

275
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,458
Who do you think you are?!

276
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:40,166
You had no right...!
You had no right!

277
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,750
Get them back...

278
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,416
You had no right!

279
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,083
[SAKURA cries] No one does...

280
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,625
That boy was alive
moments ago...

281
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:00,916
His heart was beating,
his eyes, questioning...

282
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,041
And I... I watched
as the flame went out...

283
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,833
I saw the life ebb
from his little body.

284
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:09,833
It's a terrible thing

285
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,916
to watch someone
die like that...

286
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,625
Especially someone so young...

287
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:18,291
But I'll tell you
something, Mr. Tabata...

288
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,208
If it had been you...

289
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,250
Even given what you've done...

290
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,125
I would have felt the same!

291
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,416
Daddy...

292
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,833
Don't kill this man...

293
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,500
Forgive what he's done...

294
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,541
Even someone as corrupt as
this... is worth preserving!

295
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,375
[TABATA] I shouldn't...

296
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,833
I shouldn't have
done what I did...

297
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,166
They had their whole
lives ahead of them.

298
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,708
I beg you... Save her.

299
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,833
[evil laugh]

300
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,041
Moment of truth,
Fireballman...

301
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,250
if you're the hero,
then I'm the villain!

302
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,083
Come on,
don't hesitate now...!

303
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:16,250
You know me...! I'm Devilfiend,
your greatest adversary!

304
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,291
What are you doing?

305
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,041
Daddy, I'm scared.

306
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,541
[TABATA] I'm sorry, honey.
He's not here for you.

307
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:28,958
He's come for me: his
arch nemesis in disguise.

308
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,041
Nuh-uh...!
That's not true!

309
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,458
He's just doing
his job as a hero...

310
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,000
After all, he's got
a world to protect...

311
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,875
...right?

312
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,458
If he can escape
my evil clutches!

313
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,333
Ogami...! Don't do it!

314
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,125
Burn to nothing.

315
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,791
Chisa, my darling--

316
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,000
Tabata...

317
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,250
[CHISA] Why did you do that?!

318
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:12,958
[SAKURA] Chisa!

319
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,541
My daddy... He's dead!

320
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,625
How could you...!

321
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,875
He wouldn't have hurt you...

322
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:26,666
He was pretending... He was
