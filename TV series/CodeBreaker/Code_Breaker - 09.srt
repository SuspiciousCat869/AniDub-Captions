1
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,708
[OGAMI] Explosions?
What the hell?

2
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,416
[KANDA] I don't have
all the details yet...

3
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,666
All we know for sure
is that they're IEDs;

4
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,041
apparently half a dozen have
detonated all over the city.

5
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,416
[KANDA] Sir?

6
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,708
Go on.

7
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,375
[KANDA] There's only
one person this could be.

8
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,708
I know.

9
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,041
[KANDA] So...?

10
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,875
I'm gonna take the bastard
out myself. Understood?

11
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,416
[KANDA] Yes, sir.

12
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:21,208
You've gone too far, Hitomi...
We end this tonight... Be ready.

13
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,541
[FEMALE ANCHOR A] Officials
are putting the death toll

14
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,208
at twelve, with
twenty-four injured

15
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,291
and at least four
reported missing.

16
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,500
Emergency responders are
still working tirelessly

17
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,041
to combat the blaze and
locate any survivors...

18
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,333
The bombing took place at the
height of rush hour traffic,

19
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,625
so as I'm sure our viewers
at home can imagine,

20
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,625
the scene here is a chaotic one.
We'll keep you updated

21
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,166
on this terrible tragedy
as developments unfold.

22
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,750
[HITOMI] Terrible indeed.

23
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,916
No... How can you support what
he's doing to these people?!

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,208
The misfortune of others
seems to weigh on you heavily,

25
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,958
doesn't it...?
A rather amusing trait.

26
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,333
[door opens]

27
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,541
Are we having fun...?
I'm glad you're getting along.

28
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,625
Oh, I was merely commenting

29
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,875
on our guest's talent
for empathizing.

30
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:07,416
Huh. "Our" guest? I'm surprised
you even brought her here.

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,625
Ask and ye shall receive,
my embattled fellow traveler...

32
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,375
Haven't I always been your
greatest champion?

33
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,791
You've been a person of
interest for quite some time.

34
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,250
Why is that?

35
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,375
Don't be naive... Come on,
this isn't your first clue;

36
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,708
the only reason Ogami
transferred to your school

37
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,541
in the first place was
to keep tabs on you.

38
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,208
That's not true!

39
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:33,041
Well, to be fair, Ogami didn't
know what he was signing on for.

40
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,958
But don't take my word for it.

41
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,166
See, doll... The powers that
be have spared no expense

42
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,750
trying to foil yours truly,
in money or human lives.

43
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,250
What are you... What are
you talking about?

44
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,625
What exactly do you
intend to do with me?

45
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:02,208
Don't be so dark. Not much
I can do with a rarebreed.

46
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,458
Look, I'm just
keeping you here

47
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,000
to make sure you
stay out of the way...

48
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,958
You won't come to any harm...
Think of it like this...

49
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,541
You've got a front row seat
to the best show in town.

50
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,541
You're sick!
This is terrorism!

51
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,625
Yes, it is.

52
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,375
You're a madman!
People are dying!

53
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,500
And what if I told you
to bear with me...

54
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:25,083
Just for a bit... That this
was for the better good?

55
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,458
[KANDA] He's not in
this for the carnage.

56
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,750
Can't be. It'd go
against his nature.

57
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,166
Hitomi...

58
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,583
[beeping noises]

59
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,541
[KANDA] It's me, sir.
I've just received

60
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,875
an anonymous tip
regarding his whereabouts;

61
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:57,333
I think it's worth following
up on. What? You, too?

62
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,500
[HEIKE] Be straight with me,
Ace. The pyrotechnics

63
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:03,500
on the city's outskirts
were just a warm-up, yes?

64
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,291
Just a taste of
what's yet to come?

65
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,916
[HITOMI] Easy, tiger.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,458
Nobody likes a busybody,
especially in my position.

67
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,750
Ya got it?

68
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,916
[HEIKE] You make it sound
as though I've been

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,458
rifling through
your sock drawer...

70
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,791
Enough. If I trusted you
with the bigger picture,

71
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,625
you'd have it by now.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,458
[HEIKE] Ah.

73
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,916
[HITOMI] I might be persuaded
to open up a little more if,

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,583
for example, you fessed up
on just how you found me.

75
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,291
It's like you knew
what'd I do before

76
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,458
I had a clear notion
of it myself...

77
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,791
[HEIKE] My recon network
had these charming digs

78
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,250
flagged months ago...
Come now...

79
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,000
A desperate man isn't
very hard to anticipate.

80
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,708
I don't suppose he is.

81
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,875
[HEIKE] I ask your plans only
as a courtesy. Truth is, I know.

82
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,500
And my sole aim is to
keep them from being foiled...

83
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,291
You and I are in this
together. What other reason

84
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,375
would I have had for
delivering the rarebreed?

85
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,500
Or for that matter reducing
Hachoji to a bloody pulp?

86
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,166
[SAKURA] You didn't!

87
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,250
[HITOMI] Now, why would you,
who cares more than anything

88
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:05,291
for his comrades-in-arms,
turn against... Hachioji?

89
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,541
Why...? Because
I understand...

90
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,250
You and I share the
same bitter grief.

91
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,833
You bastard...!
You wouldn't dare!

92
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,625
Shut up! Don't
presume to know

93
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,916
what a man who doesn't
exist would dare!

94
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,958
[HEIKE] I'm no fool, Ace.
In your position,

95
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,875
I wouldn't believe me either.
But there you have it.

96
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:37,958
Do as you please... But...
Try anything cute... You die.

97
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,166
[HEIKE] I will endeavor
to earn your hospitality.

98
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,250
[HITOMI] Speaking of which...

99
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:48,375
Kanda's here, which means
Ogami won't be far behind.

100
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,458
Crossing swords is looking
more and more inevitable.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,375
[HITOMI] Short
notice, I know,

102
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,833
but how'd you feel
about doing me a favor?

103
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,833
[KANDA] He's up there.
I can feel it.

104
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,916
[OGAMI] I'm gonna take the
bastard out myself. Understood?

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,375
[KANDA] I'm sorry,
master. Forgive me.

106
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,208
[KANDA] Heike?!

107
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,750
But how...? Wait...

108
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,000
[HEIKE] My dear...
I've wanted to see you

109
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,625
in binds since
the day we met.

110
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:40,750
[phone ringing]

111
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,291
[OGAMI] Say that again?!

112
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,500
[MOTHER YUKI] Sakura hasn't come
home yet. I'm worried sick.

113
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:48,166
Please tell me she's with you.
Oh, no--she's not, is she?

114
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,416
She's not answering her phone,
she hasn't left a word,

115
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,666
with all these
bombs going off--

116
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,916
She's gonna be fine...

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,916
I think have a good idea
where she might be...

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,916
I'll call you when
I know for sure.

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,458
[YUKI] Six!

120
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,750
Number Two
has changed sides.

121
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,166
[YUKI] Wait!

122
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,291
[HEIKE] Oh, good...

123
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,750
You've brought the cat.

124
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,875
What have you done
with Number Five?

125
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,041
[HEIKE] Why, what could you
possibly mean by that?

126
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,416
[YUKI] Give it up, dude! I was
there: I saw you attack her.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,291
Interesting. Yet you
inquire after her fate.

128
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,458
Explain yourself...
Right now.

129
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:50,000
What's there to explain...?
Are you that... thick?!

130
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,916
This is precisely
what it seems.

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,583
[YUKI] Yeah? Well, this is
what I think of traitors!

132
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,458
[HEIKE] Not bad. Not bad at all.

133
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,583
Of course, sound does have the
advantage of invisibility.

134
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,166
A shame its trajectory is
so predictable, though.

135
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,791
Ugh! You're such a dick!

136
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,708
[YUKI] Running away?

137
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,416
We call these
evasive maneuvers.

138
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,125
[HEIKE] Aha!

139
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,583
Uh... Uh-oh.

140
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,458
[HEIKE] Kudos on
the mercilessness.

141
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,166
Well, you know me...
Mercy is for bystanders!

142
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,000
Solid policy... Intend to
stick to it, do you?

143
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,000
[OGAMI] What?

144
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,916
Hey, Six! Heads up!

145
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,000
[YUKI] It's okay,
I've got your back. Go on.

146
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,750
[YUKI] I'll take
care of Number Two.

147
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:35,125
Think so? Ha... I may have
a bone to pick with that.

148
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,583
Kanda? What the hell
are you doing here?

149
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,708
[OGAMI] Damn you, Hitomi.

150
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,875
[HITOMI] Probably.

151
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,916
[OGAMI] You--Sakura!

152
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,541
[SAKURA] Ogami!
It's not Miss Kanda's fault!

153
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,208
She's being controlled!

154
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,708
He's made her a prisoner
in her own body!

155
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,666
[OGAMI] I know. He's disrupted
her central nervous system

156
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,583
with electromagnetic pulses.

157
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,708
[HITOMI] Very easy to
get the hang of, actually.

158
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,416
Living tissue's a better
conductor than dead.

159
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,833
Bastard.

160
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:34,958
[KANDA] Stay back. Please...
He'll... make me...

161
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,541
[KANDA] Run!

162
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,958
Get out of here, now!
I'm begging you!

163
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,750
Sir, please.

164
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,916
No! Stop!

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,375
[OGAMI] Keep firing.

166
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,750
I'll deflect every
round you've got...

167
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,791
Just empty the damn clip.

168
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,916
[HITOMI] Wow, kid. Respect...

169
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,958
I'm bummed I've
got to deal you out,

170
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,875
but you know--
it is what it is.

171
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,500
Your Gal Friday has
specific instructions

172
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,875
to unload the final slug into
her pretty little temple.

173
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,833
It's all on you, my friend.
Keep playing Man of Steel

174
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,750
and her ammo gets whittled
down to the coup de grace.

175
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,083
Take one for the team,
though, and I'll let go.

176
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,916
She'll walk out of here
minus a job, sure,

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,375
but she'll walk out of here
alive. What's it gonna be?

178
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,083
Hitomi...

179
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,083
[KANDA] Please, sir...

180
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,916
You hardcore enough to
watch her kill herself?

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,166
[SAKURA] Coward! Look at
what you're doing...!

182
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,041
They don't deserve this!

183
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,833
[HITOMI] Aren't you
adorable? Poor girl.

184
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,583
[SAKURA] These people
were your friends once.

185
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,666
You fought alongside each other!
How could you do this to them?!

186
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,458
Don't let him win,
whatever you do!

187
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,916
Don't give him the satisfaction!

188
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,541
This ends now. You won't
die by your own hand.

189
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,333
What are you...? Oh, no.

190
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,458
That's our Rei; he can
always be counted on to

191
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:08,125
eliminate a threat without
hesitation, no matter the cost.

192
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:13,375
He's a warrior, and a good one.
Course... could just be a pose.

193
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,375
Ogami... I'm sorry...
So sorry.

194
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:31,958
No. Don't! You can't kill her...
Please don't do this!

195
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,458
Ogami, please stop!!

196
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,375
No way!

197
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,541
[OGAMI] What did you do?

198
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,541
[SAKURA] I... I don't know.

199
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,541
Heh... You sneaky
little bastard.

200
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,916
[KANDA] What happened?

201
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
[SAKURA] Oh, thank heavens!

202
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,875
I don't understand,
are you okay?

203
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,333
[SAKURA] I'm fine! All that
matters is that you're okay.

204
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,541
Good work.

205
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,125
[SAKURA] I think it
was all her, actually.

206
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,208
She cares for you so much that
Hitomi's spell was broken--

207
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,000
[HITOMI] Don't be so modest.

208
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,416
You're a rarebreed...
Interfering is what you do best.

209
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,833
Oh, so now you intend to take
my dog hostage, is that it?!

210
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,208
Come clean... Tell me
what this is all about.

211
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,166
What happened to you...?
Why are you doing this...?

212
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,583
The Hitomi we
knew and followed

213
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:56,208
would never resort
to--To terrorism.

214
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,291
[HITOMI] How can you
see all the clocks

215
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,541
on this wall and
not have a clue?

216
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,750
I didn't notice it
before... but... they...

217
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,791
They're all stopped
at different times.

218
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,208
[HITOMI] Each one commemorates
a Code Breaker's time of death.

219
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,291
[HITOMI] 6:23 am--Former
Code Three is killed

220
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,750
while overseeing a
routine escort mission.

221
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,000
10:47 pm--Ogami's successor dies

222
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,000
in a sudden accident
while on cleanup duty.

223
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,416
[HITOMI] Each of
them lost their lives

224
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,000
without ever having the
chance to live them.

225
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,583
These are their headstones.

226
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,375
Each of them killed in
a battle their superiors

227
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:41,666
never spilled blood for.
This wall their only memorial.

228
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,375
That is truly awful.

229
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:48,250
[HITOMI] Don't patronize.
You can't imagine.

230
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,833
[SAKURA] He's insane with grief.

231
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,500
This whole thing is like
some kind of warped eulogy.

232
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,375
[HITOMI] Their orders came from
the Prime Minister... In effect,

233
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:01,541
he signed their death warrants;
and for that, he must pay.

234
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,958
That's absurd...!
What would his death prove?!

235
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,583
Are you listening to yourself?

236
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,000
This won't bring
your friends back!

237
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,500
Sweetheart.
It isn't about that...

238
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,208
I'm giving him the chance
to fulfill his supreme duty.

239
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,500
He gets to die
serving his country.

240
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,375
[SAKURA] You can't be serious.

241
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,291
I arrived on the scene of
this tragedy moments ago...

242
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,625
And I'm coming to you live...

243
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,041
[HITOMI] It's a shame so many
people have to die before him,

244
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:33,250
but... we need the country
in a state of panic.

245
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,166
It's the only way to whet
everyone's appetite

246
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,750
for the Main Event: the Prime
Minister's public execution

247
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,583
will open the eyes
of all of Tokyo.

248
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,875
You're psychotic!

249
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,583
[OGAMI] Shut up!

250
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,375
You sit there and act like
this is a noble cause...

251
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,291
What is this really about?
I want the truth.

252
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,166
I want people to see us...
For Code Breakers

253
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,833
to step into the light and
take our place in the world.

254
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,791
We've suffered in silence far
too long... This is what happens

255
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,625
when the ignorant take
their protectors for granted.

256
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,541
[HITOMI] None of them has earned
the peace they feel entitled to;

257
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:16,916
the illusion of tranquility
we've spilled blood to maintain.

258
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,083
It won't last... The storm'll
break soon enough.

259
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,083
[FATHER] Somebody, help!
My little girl's hurt!

260
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,583
I need an ambulance!

261
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,666
[HITOMI] Only when they tremble
in fear for their lives--

262
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,291
their way of life--when the
veneer is peeled away...

263
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,333
Only when it's perfectly
clear they've been living

264
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,125
on borrowed time
all this while...

265
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:39,750
Only then will they embrace
what we do and how we do it.

266
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,583
So, yes... It's about
power, sure.

267
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,041
The power to live as the
people we protect live

268
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:50,333
and the power to die without
being devoured by shadows.

269
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:54,666
You just want to be
accepted... But...!

270
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,541
[OGAMI] So let me
get this straight.

271
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,000
Once the smoke's cleared,
you're steppin' out on the town,

272
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,541
confident the survivors
will greet you

273
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,416
as a champion of justice?

274
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,333
More or less.

275
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,750
Yeah, well, that's a lot better
than the deal Eden gives us.

276
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,166
You don't mean that...

277
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,625
[OGAMI] Sounds like membership
has its privileges...

278
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,458
Hell, maybe you're right.

279
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,250
Maybe this is our only
way out of the dark.

280
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,875
Now you're gettin' it...
Join the cause.

281
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,916
[OGAMI] Tempting, but...
For all your talk,

282
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,750
has it ever occurred to you
that we belong in the dark?!

283
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:30,708
Code Breakers are killers...!
We don't get a place in the sun!

284
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,541
You don't understand...
Not even a little.

285
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,958
What is there to
understand about evil?

286
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,916
You and I are qualified
to judge it...

287
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,833
'cause we're cut
from the same cloth.

288
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,625
Look at you...!
For all your talk,

289
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,666
the only thing you want is
to see the world in flames!

290
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,250
[HEIKE] Come on, Yuki...
Make this interesting...

291
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,708
Give me a challenge!

292
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,708
[YUKI] Bite me, jerkwad!

293
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:15,000
[YUKI] Gotta hand it to him,
though. He's good.

294
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,333
[HITOMI] The more things
change, eh, old friend?

295
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,875
But this is the
point of no return.

296
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,166
From here on, Code
Breakers will be granted

297
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,750
full citizenship to the world!
Gone will be the era of secrets

298
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,416
and lies; gone the days
when we died in obscurity...!

299
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,916
We will exist! Our brothers
will not have died in vain...!

300
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,791
I burn Tokyo...
to liberate us all from Eden!

301
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,333
Here I am!

302
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,583
[HITOMI] Damn it, Yukihina!

303
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,708
[YUKIHINA] I figured something
must be up for you to be taking

304
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:54,166
this long. Clock's tickin',
boss--now's not the time.

305
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,916
You could've gone ahead
without me, you know.

306
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,416
Yeah, right... If I leave,
you'll be doing this all night.

307
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,833
Fair enough; let's get
a move on, then.

308
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,708
[SAKURA] What was that?!

309
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,583
I hope you're not
stupid enough to think

310
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,791
you can melt my ice
with your flame.

311
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,000
He'll figure it out. Meet you
there, or are you coming with?

312
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,166
Hitomi!

313
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,916
Wait! This isn't--

314
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,541
[OGAMI] Sakura, look out!

315
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,250
I'm coming with.

316
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,458
[OGAMI] Sakura!!!

317
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,500
You're a really pitiful
bodyguard, man...

318
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,708
The whole point is to keep
Sakura out of danger.

319
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,791
[SAKURA] Toki!

320
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,083
[TOKI] You're welcome,
by the way...

321
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,625
Sorry I couldn't be here
sooner, but, you know...

322
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,208
It's always cooler
when the hero makes

323
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,125
his entrance at the last
possible second, right?

324
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,791
Hey! Stop right there!
Drop the politician!

325
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,500
Just so you guys know...
There's a truckload

326
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,416
of explosives set to blow this
place up... You might wanna

327
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,958
think about putting some
distance between you.

328
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,750
Seriously?

329
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,125
Come back! Don't you care
that that's his father?!

330
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,375
Don't be an idiot!

331
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,166
[TOKI] Sakura, no!
He's dangerous!

332
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:34,666
Not ideal. I propose we
revisit this down the road.

333
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,833
Huh?! No you-- Damn it!

334
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,500
Wow... I didn't
think you were game

335
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,166
for what's about to go down.

336
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,291
You won't get away with this...
I promise you that right now...

337
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,583
No one else is
dying on my watch!

338
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,250
[SAKURA] Look at him.
He doesn't even care.

339
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,583
[SAKURA] What could've driven
him to be this kind of person?

340
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,000
[OGAMI] I'll always remember
the night we met; the smell

341
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:51,041
of death and gun smoke. The
haunted look on your face.

342
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,791
[OGAMI] Next time,
"Code: Breaker" episode 10,

343
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,708
"The World People See."
