00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,500
Not letting you get
away that easily.

161
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,708
[SAKURA] They say a
murderer is always drawn

162
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,208
to the scene of the crime.

163
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,541
[children laugh]

164
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,000
[GIRL A] Wait for me!
C'mon, slow down!

165
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,458
[SAKURA] Am I sure
I didn't imagine things...?

166
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,416
I mean... It was all so vivid...

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,291
[SAKURA] Here.
Take the whole thing.

168
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,958
You probably need it since
I couldn't come yesterday.

169
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,833
See, I'm trustworthy...

170
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,083
Not that I'm trying to
replace your previous--

171
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,958
Paranoid mutt!
Why won't you like me?!

172
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,791
Ogami!

173
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,750
Interesting...
So, turns out you don't reserve

174
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,708
the attitude just for me, huh?

175
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,000
Uhh...

176
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,791
[OGAMI] A little awkward,
sure, but I like it.

177
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,000
Means you're a fighter.

178
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,083
Huh...

179
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,333
You trying to say
I have a bad attitude?

180
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,500
Not at all...
You're just confident.

181
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,666
And I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

182
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,583
Ah... I guess that's
all right, then.

183
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,375
It's not every day...

184
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,083
My family's a little
on the weird side so- I--

185
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh...

186
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,208
He's a bit timid, so don't take
it personally if he's scared.

187
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,250
C'mere, you.

188
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,958
Wow, you...

189
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,291
Poor thing.

190
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,416
Not many people have done
right by you, have they?

191
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,083
Ha, ha. Easy on
the kisses, champ!

192
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,458
[OGAMI laughs]

193
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,375
Hey, he's eye-candy,
right...? I get it.

194
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,708
[OGAMI] ...try being friends...
If you're game.

195
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,416
C'mon, knock it off.

196
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,875
[SAKURA] I suppose
he's not all bad.

197
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,375
[OGAMI]
By the way, he's a she.

198
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,750
You know her name?

199
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,833
Just "Dog."

200
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,708
[OGAMI laughs lightly]

201
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,250
[OGAMI] Gets to
the point, I suppose.

202
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,000
She a stray?

203
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,625
[SAKURA]
Her master died recently...

204
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,375
An old homeless man...

205
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,000
So she's more of an orphan.

206
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,166
A gang of street thugs
was responsible...

207
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,833
You'd know them
from their tattoos;

208
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,666
they call themselves G-Falcon...

209
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,833
The crime bosses of
this city cover for them

210
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:49,666
so that the bastards literally
get away with murder...

211
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,333
That's what my dad says, anyway.

212
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,375
That a fact?

213
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,625
Their connections put
them above the law...

214
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,041
So even the police...
turn a blind eye.

215
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,833
[OGAMI] Would you like to see
them get what they deserve?

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,041
Such men are in
need of punishment.

217
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,041
Is that what you'd like
to see happen to them?

218
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,791
No thank you!
I don't want revenge...

219
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,000
I just feel for that old man...

220
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,041
He lived and died
without leaving a trace

221
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,583
of himself in anyone's heart...

222
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,291
Mine breaks thinking about it.

223
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,916
[children laugh]

224
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,125
He's not without
his mourners...

225
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,583
You're living proof of that.

226
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,000
The world may brush
his memory aside,

227
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,958
but you don't.

228
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,333
And though I may not
have known the man...

229
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:46,083
I'll follow your
example... Forever.

230
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,333
[OGAMI] Unfortunately...

231
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,583
As a rule, justice
is only as effective

232
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,875
as the people charged
with doling it out.

233
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,291
An eye for an eye;
a tooth for a tooth...

234
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,750
And evil for evil.

235
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,416
So, Hammurabi's
Code, huh...?

236
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,625
Kudos on the reference,

237
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,958
but that last part you
plucked out of thin air.

238
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,250
[OGAMI] Look at that.
You do smile.

239
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:20,583
I was starting to worry
it was something about me.

240
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,583
You have my
sincere apology...

241
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,583
Perhaps I'm not the
best judge of character.

242
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,666
[PRIME MINISTER]
And Ogami Rei? What of him?

243
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,791
[ADVISOR A] Fully
infiltrated and awaiting

244

our instructions,

[PRIME MINISTER]
Good. Very good...

246
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,333
Then our plan can proceed.

247
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,458
[SAKURA] Assuming it wasn't him,
what exactly did I see...?

248
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,625
I must be losing my mind.

249
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,208
[AOBA] Hey, Ogami!
You like karaoke?

250
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,083
Sakura's gonna be there.

251
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,208
Actually I've got a lot
of stuff to do tonight.

252
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,208
Huh?!

253
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,666
I'm not doing this
for the vocal practice!

254
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,416
Ugh...! Put it together!

255
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,416
Thanks for
the offer...

256
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,625
But I'm kinda
busy tonight, too.

257
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,333
Well boo.

258
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,041
I see...

259
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,583
So you got stuck with the
late shift again, did you?

260
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,958
Trash collectors...
We live the high life.

261
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,333
[SAKURA] Ah. Noble profession.

[cell phone rings]

263
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,875
See...? Probably wondering
where I am already.

00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,208
What the hell
is this...?!

265

When did you two start
getting all buddy buddy?!

266
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,166
[SAKURA] We're not buddy buddy.

267
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,708
We're just... I don't know...

268
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,833
[AOBA] If you're
gonna work that fast,

269
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,333
let a gal know, huh?

00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,500
What've we got?

[KANDA] You ready to
do some cleaning up?

272
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,375
What kind of
question is that...

273
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,625
Just give me the specs.

[KANDA] What about
the Sakura problem...?

275
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,875
Have you decided?

276
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,416
There was never really
any choice, was there...?

277
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I'm proceeding as planned.

down the goods

have seen something.

00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,583
you're gonna have to
look someplace else...!

318
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,500
You thugs have gotten everything
you're gonna get out of me!

319
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,000
[G-FALCON E] You are so dead...!

320
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,041
I demand you turn
yourselves in--

321
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,583
[Dog whimpers]

322
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,041
We're not done playin'
with you yet, little girl,

323
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,791
so why don't you stay put!

324
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,083
[SAKURA] I- I'm paralyzed...!

325
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,791
Let's tie 'er up...!

326
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,875
Stupid bitch...
You just had to come runnin'

327
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,875
when you heard the
parasite scream...

328
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,375
Well take a wild
guess what happens

329
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,541
to good Samaritans on our watch!

330
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,000
[G-FALCON A yells]

331
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,500
The hell'd you come from?!

332
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,250
No, don't!

333
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,583
[G-FALCON A] Get off!

334
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,625
[G-FALCON A] Seriously?!

335
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,833
You're not gonna get me!

336
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,333
Leave her alone!

337
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,416
[G-FALCON D]
Pass 'er over, I'm open!

338
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,291
[G-FALCON A] Heads up!

339
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,000
[G-FALCON B] And it's gooooood!

340
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,125
[G-FALCON E]
Where're you goin'--

341
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,416
You bastards...!

342
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,208
She has nothing
to do with anything!

343
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,958
Face me like men!

344
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,916
If that's what
you really want...

345
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,125
We can be all kinds
of manly for ya...

346
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,125
Hang on...!

347
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,916
I'll get you to a
vet as soon as I--

348
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,458
[G-FALCON C] Two stupid bitches.

349
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,916
If you're so set on
gettin' yourself killed

350
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,583
we can help you out, sweetheart.

351
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,333
Right after you tell me
what happened to my boys.

352
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,833
[OGAMI] Are you in pain?

353
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,208
[G-FALCONS] Huh?

354
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,250
[G-FALCON A] Who the hell?!

355
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,166
No! What are
you doing here?!

356
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,791
[OGAMI] I'm sorry, girl.

357
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,916
There's nothing do
be done for you.

358
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,500
Not anymore...

359
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,666
Frankly I'm surprised
you're still breathing.

360
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,250
[Dog whines]

361
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,750
[OGAMI] You fought justly and
valiantly to protect a life...

362
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,416
Now it's time for you to rest.

363
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,833
[G-FALCON A] Hey, kid...!
This ain't a goddamn pet store!

364
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,041
[SAKURA] Ogami!

365
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,625
Please: get out of here
and find her a vet!

366
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,750
Just please... go now!

367
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,458
[OGAMI] Little one...
Allow me to do you the honor.

368
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,541
[SAKURA] Ogami?

369
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,916
No... Please, no...
How could you?!

370
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
[G-FALCON A] Holy crap...

371
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,708
Somebody does it
hardcore... Oh well...

372
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,916
Looks like we're
just gonna have to take

373
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,500
our frustrations out
on the dog whisperer.

374
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,833
[OGAMI] An eye for an eye...

375
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:22,583
...a tooth for a tooth.
And evil... for evil.

376
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,083
[G-FALCON A] Why you
people gotta mumble--

377
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,625
Burn to nothing.

378
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:35,708
[G-FALCON A screams]

379
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,541
And here we go.

380
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,791
It's about time...
Let's do this.

381
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,500
Wha... What in
the hell are you?!

382
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,083
Who me...?

383
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,666
I'm just the guy who
takes out the trash.

384
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,875
Pay close attention...

385
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,583
This is the part where
I give you all the chance

386
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,166
to face the judgment
of your world

387
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,500
or be consumed by
the flames of mine...

388
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,125
So what do you say?

389
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,791
[G-FALCON B] Screw this!
I say you're a dead man!

390
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:23,791
Very well...

391
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,125
Die... as you have
chosen to live.

392
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,000
An eye for an eye...

393
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,583
...a tooth for a tooth...
And evil for evil.

394
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,208
That's what I saw before!

395
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,250
[OGAMI] It's only
fair to tell you...

396
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,791
...when I suggested
we be friends...

397
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,750
I was lying.

398
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,958
[SAKURA screams]

399
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:46,125
[OGAMI] Next time,
"Code: Breaker" episode 2...

400
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:50,000
"The Spiral Blue Flower,
Blossoming in Flame."

401
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,250
I will burn
everything to nothing.

402
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,625
Until the end.
