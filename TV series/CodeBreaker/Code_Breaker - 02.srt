[footsteps]

00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,041
Mom! Dad...!
Urgent question...!

00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,250
How did I...?

5
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,875
[GOTOKU] Oh...!
We were so sick with worry!

6
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,375
What is this all about?

7
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,500
Oh darling... We're
so happy you're well!

8
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,541
Indeed...!

9
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,583
And she owes it
all to your nursing.

10
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,791
A mother's love it worth
its weight in antibodies.

11
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,333
I'd move heaven
and earth for my girl.

12
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,750
This may sound dumb...

13
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,125
But what was wrong with me?

14
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,708
You really don't know?

15
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,291
No.

16
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,125
Lying at the gate...?
Odd place for me to be.

17
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,958
Poor Daisuke was so frightened
when he stumbled on you...

18
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,333
He was frantic...

19
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,291
No one knows how long
you'd been out there.

20
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,250
But hey, it is
what it is, right...?

21
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,291
At least you're safe now.

You must've been
beside yourselves...

I'm, so sorry to have
scared you both...

24

I can't apologize enough.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,500
Now, that's enough.
No need for that...

26
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,041
It's all water
under the bridge...

27
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,541
The fact there's
nothing seriously wrong

28
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,500
is all your mom
and I care about.

29
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:19,708
Of course...! That's all
that matters. No harm done.

30
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,416
There is still the small
question of who deposited

you on our front doorstep
without knocking...

32

who it could've been?

Yes...! You don't
think it's right

to kill in the name
of justice, do you?

37
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,666
[GOTOKU] No. I don't.

38
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,625
No one person should
have that much power

39

over life and death...

40
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,291
I agree with you entirely.

[SAKURA] He...

He was gonna kill me just
like he killed those guys...

46
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,125
If that's true...

47
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,500
Then what could have
possessed him to let me go?

48

Sakura! So what's up?

49

Uh. Hello, Aoba.
Good morning.

Ugh... You are gonna
love this. Come here!

Enough with the sad face.

at, Ogami, I'll find out.

Fine...! Look: if
you're into the new guy

00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,291
I can totally respect that...
But you're out of your gourd

58

if you think I'm gonna
let you ignore me.

I'm sorry... I don't
mean to ignore anybody...

out of sorts...

If I didn't know better,

I'd say this was just a
ploy to sidle up to Sakura.

speaking, I'm not real.

Like we're not on the
same wavelength here.

289

for the death of
at least one man...

291
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,208
And you caught them
red-handed beating up another.

292
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,208
How many lives have been
saved 'cause of what I did...?

293
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,166

but to burn them up.

don't repent... ever.

'em the next best thing.

innocent with me.

Even if it did that
isn't the point...!

309

Resorting to murder
makes us no better

than the person we kill!

what I'm telling you.

What are you?

Enough of this!

You're out of your mind

if you think I'm
intimidated by you.

So go on and stalk me...

that works both ways.

I swear to you by
the Sakurakoji name...

319
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,208
I shall follow you to
the ends of the earth

320
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,916
protecting the lives
of those you would judge.

321
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,750
So be prepared!

322
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:33,416
[laughs]

323
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Why are you laughing?!

324
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,875
So full of fire...

325
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,625
You're a fascinating person,
you know that, Sakura?

326
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,250
I mean that...

327
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,541
Still, though...

328
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,708
You're not the only
one who can make an oath.

329
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,375
Expose me and it won't
just be you who burns...

330
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,666
Everyone you tell...

331
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,541
Everyone they tell;
all of them get silenced.

332
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,750
The hell they will...!

333
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,875
I'll never allow it!

334
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,666
What are you...?

335
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,833
Stop.

336
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,625
Don't do it!

337
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,208
Whoever...
Whenever... Wherever...

338
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,041
That is my promise.

339
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,791
I'll burn them off
the face of the earth.

340
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,500
Am I paranoid...

341
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,166
Or is something seriously wrong?

342
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,250
It certainly isn't like
her to be so, quiet.

343
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,250
[screaming]

344
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,708
Nothing you're capable of
doing will ever stop me.

345
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,125
[SAKURA] That look...

346
00:19:56,208 --> 00:20:00,750
It's the same look he wore
while playing executioner.

347
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,250
Ogami...

348
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:06,458
Is life so black-and-white
to you? So cheap?

349
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,708
Was the same look on your
face as you killed the dog...?

350
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,875
Was that just part of your job?

351
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,333
Damn you.
There must have been

352
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,250
some feeling in your
eyes at that moment.

353
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,833
[ADVISOR 1A]
Is that wise, sir...?

354
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:36,666
Allowing him to bring someone
so unpredictable into the fold?

355
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,333
[PRIME MINISTER] Oh, their power
far outweighs any difficulty

356
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,666
we may have in
bringing them to heel.

357
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,958
And besides...

358
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,708
We are not without
our collateral.

359
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,250
If things turn unpleasant,

360
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,958
we have ways of
reestablishing the status quo.

361
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,416
[cell phone rings]

362
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,833
What is it?

363
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,416
[KANDA] What's the
situation with Sakurakoji?

364
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,791
[OGAMI] Oh, that.

365
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,458
Think I'll keep her around...

366
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,000
Not every day we
find a Rarebreed.

367
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,833
[KANDA] You're certain...?

368
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,291
That she is one, I mean.

369
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,125
[OGAMI] Absolutely...

370
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,750
She's immune to my flame...

371
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,916
Never seen that before...

372
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,041
We can't eliminate her yet.

373
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,291
Hey...

374
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,000
What happened to you, man...?

375
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,125
Why'd you just ran off
without a word?

376
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,250
There's was work to be done;

377
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:04,166
I couldn't let
myself be chained.

378
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,083
So, you on a killing
spree or what?

379
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,083
That's our Yuki,
straight as an arrow.

380
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,791
Always calling it
like you see it...

381
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,041
I love that about you.

382
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,458
Honestly I thought Ogami'd be

383
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,833
the first one to come
take a pot shot at me.

384
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,875
Hold up,
Number One.

385
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,958
If you really want to be
the one to judge me...

386
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,750
Don't let me stop you.

387
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,458
Eye for an eye.

388
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,166
Tooth for a tooth.

389
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,041
And a requiem of
fury for all evil!

390
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:46,083
[OGAMI] Next time,
"Code: Breaker" Episode 3,

391
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:50,125
"Angry Valor--A Graven Hammer."

392
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,000
Beware, evildoers...

393
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,041
I will not rest until
every trace of you

394
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,291
is consumed by fire!
