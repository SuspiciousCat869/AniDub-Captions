in the middle of the hallway!

162
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,125
[HEIKE] I grant you the
prose is a touch lavender,

163
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,000
but calling it trash
seems a bit harsh.

164
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,833
It's... inappropriate
subject matter!

165
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,291
Please forgive
my enthusiasm.

166
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,416
I'm simply struck dumb
by the author's deft hand

167
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,541
at writing characters stuck
in the quagmire of Eros.

168
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,000
Oh, Ogami... Caution...

169
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,333
You're perilously
close to the Dead Zone.

170
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,708
[OGAMI] Excuse me...

171
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,125
I'd like to get my bag now
if there's no objections.

172
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,375
[SAKURA] Um now is
not really a good time.

173
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,583
What the hell's
going on in there?

174
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,958
Something of
vital importance?

175
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,333
Trust me,
you don't want to know.

176
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,541
[FEMALE STUDENT 1] Crazy, right?

177
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,166
[AOBA] I know! So exciting!

178
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,833
[FEMALE STUDENT 2]
Keep it on the DL, girls.

179
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,125
Is this about me...?
I want the truth.

180
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,625
[MALE STUDENT 1]
Crap, he's right outside!

181
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,416
Everyone, shut up!

182
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,833
You're not
going in yet!

183
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,708
[SAKURA] No, no, no!
You're going to ruin the--

184
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,333
Somebody start talking!

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,083
[STUDENTS] Hey, Ogami...!

186
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,291
Surprise...!
Welcome to our school!

187
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:22,791
[AOBA] Sorry.

188
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,208
Better late than
never, though, right?

189
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,250
[FEMALE STUDENT 2]
We had to put it off 'cause

190
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,916
of all the club
projects, you know?

191
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,791
[FEMALE STUDENT 1] Yeah. But we
finally got our crap together.

192
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,041
[FEMALE STUDENT 2] Here!

193
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,958
All guests of honor have
to wear the party hat!

194
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,083
[AOBA] Bit of a rush job,

195
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,625
so it's not the Ritz -but mad
festive, if I do say so myself.

196
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,416
[MALE STUDENT 1] Here.
We made you a lil' somethin'.

197
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,333
[MALE STUDENT 1] So you
can get all our names down.

198
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,916
Why would
you do all this?

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,125
[MALE STUDENT 3]
Dude, come on.

200
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,416
What kind of question is that?

201
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,750
We're stuck together
for this whole year--

202
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,208
might as well make the
best of it and be friends.

203
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,791
Am I right?

204
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,166
[FEMALE STUDENT 1] Yeah, I mean
you're always polite and stuff

205
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,291
but it's like the
only person you

206
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,041
wanna hang out with is Sakura.

207
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,333
We thought maybe it's our fault

208
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,416
for not making more
of an effort, ya know?

209
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,291
[MALE STUDENT 1] We want ya
to feel like one of the gang!

210
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,958
[FEMALE STUDENT 2]
So, yeah: Welcome!

211
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:07,708
[MALE STUDENT 3]
Welcome!

212
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,583
[MALE STUDENT 4]
Welcome!

213
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,375
[SAKURA] I only found
out about it this morning...

214
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,000
They went to a lot of trouble...

215
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,916
I got the job of keeping
you out of the room

216
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,833
while they set everything up.

217
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:25,208
[OGAMI] Mitta...
Yagi... Yusa... Watanabe...

218
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,333
It wouldn't kill you

219
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,041
to be friendlier
with them, you know...

220
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,291
Everyone in the class is
actually very fond of you.

221
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,583
[OGAMI] Pointless.

222
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,333
[flame ignites]

223
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,750
What is wrong with you?!

224
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:43,041
Seriously...! Ugh...!
Heartless jerk!

225
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,083
[OGAMI] Keepsakes tie you down.

226
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,625
Just more crap
the people you leave

227
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,625
behind have to deal with...

228
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,333
I prefer no traces of
me exist when I'm gone.

229
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,625
So, Takeshi:.

230
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,750
He's the gamer...
Then there's Aoyma:

231
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,333
Into rock Climbing...
The blonde Bombshell:

232
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:04,125
Ijuin... And Uesugi:
He's taking up ESL..."

233
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,666
I don't need flashcards.

234
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,041
It's all up here...

235
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,708
They'd probably get all
emo on me if it wasn't.

236
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,250
What if you...

237
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,166
[OGAMI] I won't forget.
Trust me.

238
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,958
What do you know...?

239
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,500
Sounds like you're
making friends to me...

240
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,708
The lone wolf act is
starting to fall apart.

241
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:25,791
[OGAMI]
Whatever...

242
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,708
I'm not getting
buddy-buddy with anyone.

243
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,541
[SAKURA] Ugh!
You are some piece of work!

244
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,000
You'd think I was asking you
to run for class president!

245
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,333
[TOKI] Okay...

246
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,166
This sucks.

247
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:55,833
[TOKI struggles]

248
00:13:55,916 --> 00:14:00,916
[TOKI] No...
Goddamnit... Not now!

249
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,875
[ADVISOR A]
Following target confirmation,

250
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,125
Kamura's report
abruptly cuts off.

251
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,916
Which is worrying
for obvious reasons.

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,583
He would be the 43rd agent
to go missing, sir...

253
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,708
That we're aware of, anyway.

254
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,416
[PRIME MINISTER]
Hitomi is a former Code Breaker.

255
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,250
Quite a piece of work.

256
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,416
[ADVISOR A] Worthy of
the Code One designation,

257
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,666
without a doubt.

258
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,833
Indeed...

259
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,416
Contemplating his
next move is a thrill.

260
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,541
[HITOMI]
Ah. Just the man. G'morning.

261
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,208
[YUKIHINA] Pretty
impressive roundup, bro.

262
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,125
Whacha gonna
use 'em for?

263
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,625
They are the opening
act to Earth 2.0.

264
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,125
Do you think Ogami

265
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,041
really liked his surprise party?

266
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,125
Yeah, I dunno...

267
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,083
He's always such a
difficult guy to read.

268
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,791
No joke, right...?
He and Sakura...

269
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,750
You gotta wonder how
they make it work.

270
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,083
The two of 'em need all
the alone time they can get...

271
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,166
Thankfully I'm
stage-managing it for them.

272
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,666
Good call...

273
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,333
Roof's a good spot.

274
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,375
They are so gettin'
it on right now.

275
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,000
That'd be the idea.

276
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,625
I swear to you, Ogami...!

277
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,416
You damn well better make
Sakura the happiest girl alive,

278
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,750
or you'll answer to
every dude in this school!

279
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,125
This may sound silly,
but I think they'd love it

280
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,333
if you showed them
that you've already

281
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,291
memorized everyone's names...

282
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,416
plus we need to help... clean--

283
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,166
[JANITOR] Hold on just a minute!

284
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,083
What are you all doing here?

285
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,916
You can't just
come in here without--

286
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,750
[SAKURA] What is this?
What's going on?

287
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,083
Oh crap... Not good.

288
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,916
[SAKURA] No, Ogami,
please! No more killing!

289
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,125
Stop...! You
can't help them.

290
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,625
They're already dead.

291
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,041
What do you mean?

292
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,250
See...?

293
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,583
They're basically
just puppets.

294
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,291
And I know who's
pulling their strings.

295
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,958
[SAKURA] Are you okay?!

296
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,583
[HEIKE] Tsk tsk...

297
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,666
This is what comes of burning
the candle at both ends.

298
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,000
What's wrong...?
Talk to me!

299
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,291
[OGAMI] Damn it, why now?

300
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,541
Oh no! Ogami!

301
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,541
I've got you.

302
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,750
[footsteps]

303
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,333
[SAKURA] Whoa!
Wh-who are you?!

304
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,166
[SAKURA] Miss Kanda?!

305
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,125
[KANDA] Hitomi... Has to be.

306
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,000
Please explain to me
what's going on!

307
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,458
Not yet... First
we make our exit.

308
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,333
Ah hell...
Not the kids!

309
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,875
[SAKURA] What...?! We have
to get them out of there!

310
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,125
[SAKURA] What are you doing?

311
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,833
[OGAMI] Kanda! Stay with Sakura.

312
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:14,791
Wait, what?!

313
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,208
Sir, no!

314
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,500
Alright!

315
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,541
Cross the boundary--And
you get incinerated!

316
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,541
An eye for an eye!

317
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,666
Tooth for a tooth!

318
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,958
And evil for evil!

319
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,708
Oh, Ogami.

320
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,500
[SAKURA] If we survive this,
you and I are going

321
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,625
to have a nice, long chat
about your colleagues.

322
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:36,583
Ogami!

323
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,833
Master!

324
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,416
[SAKURA] No!!!

325
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,208
[YUKI] Hang in there,
Number Six!

326
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,750
Help is on the way!

327
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,875
Yuki... Hey.

328
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,625
Another one?

329
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,208
[HEIKE] Caught between
a rock and a hard place.

330
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,833
Points off for
sloppiness of form, Ogami.

331
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,333
[SAKURA] Heike!

332
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,250
[HEIKE] And you, cat boy...

333
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,041
You've impeccable
timing, as always...

334
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,333
But low marks
for your performance.

335
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,333
[YUKI] Huh?

336
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,833
Whoa...! You
wanna go?!

337
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,083
Stand down.

338
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,500
You're in the Dead Zone.

339
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,375
An eye for an eye...

340
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:45,125
Blah blah... And eternal
rest... for the dead.

341
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:56,583
Damn... Light energy...
Lucky bastard.

342
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,000
[SAKURA] Exactly how
many Code Breakers

343
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,958
are there hiding in plain sight?

344
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,208
Ogami!

345
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,041
[SAKURA] No...
Stay with me...

346
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,666
Don't you dare do this!

347
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,041
Look at me!

348
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,625
[SAKURA] Please. You can't...

349
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:36,125
Not like--Come back!

350
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,875
[HEIKE] He's Lost.

351
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,916
No he isn't.

352
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,166
[HEIKE] Accept it.

353
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,250
If needs must,
madam... blame fate...

354
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,666
Every Code Breaker
succumbs to this in time...

355
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,375
I'm sorry.

356
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:17,416
♪

357
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,791
[SAKURA] I refuse to let
Fate have the final word...

358
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,666
Not today. Not ever.

359
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,166
Next time,
"Code: Breaker" episode 7,

360
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,666
"Sakura, In the Light."

361
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,166
Come back to me,
Ogami! We need you!
