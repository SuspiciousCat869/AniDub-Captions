1
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,208
[PRIME MINISTER] Oh, good...
You've made it just in time...

2
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,125
What's become of Heike?

3
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,666
[TOKI] You mean
the traitor? Oh...

4
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,083
I just kicked his sparkly little
ass... But never mind him...

5
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:34,291
You sure are looking good, Prime
Minister... Y'know, for trash.

6
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,958
I deserve that... Hey...

7
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,583
Why don't you do
your old man a favor

8
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,833
and help him out of
this sticky situation?

9
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:44,875
I'm hardly trussed up like a pig
by choice, you understand.

10
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,333
What's wrong?

11
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,500
What if I decide
not to save you...?

12
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,666
Just left you on
the roof to die?

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,458
You wouldn't.

14
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,541
There's no way in hell I'll let
you walk away with those kids!

15
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,333
[YUKIHINA] Would you prefer they
spent the rest of their lives

16
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,791
like animals locked in cages?
Why do you defy Hitomi

17
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,125
when all he wants
to do is spare

18
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,000
these innocent children
a life with no future?

19
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,666
You can justify his actions
to me all you want, but I know

20
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,958
the difference between
right and wrong! So can it!

21
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,625
Those kids deserve a real
chance... There's no hope

22
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,208
for them if they're forced to
be lapdogs of the State...

23
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,875
They're better off on their own,
out in the real world.

24
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:57,125
Is that right...?! So they're
better off in the streets?!

25
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,958
If you deny Hitomi,
then you forsake him.

26
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,875
[HACHIOJI] That's bullshit!

27
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,416
What the hell do you know
about Hitomi anyway?

28
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,041
All you are is a minion!

29
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:19,083
[HACHIOJI] We're gonna save the
children. And your jackass boss.

30
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,416
Nobody is forsaking anyone!

31
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:28,333
Why on earth fight for them
so hard, Rei? Seriously.

32
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,458
[OGAMI] Do the right thing
and put a stop to this crap!

33
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,625
I'm sorry but I'm afraid that's
not possible; the bombs are set

34
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:37,041
to go off when their time comes,
not even I can reverse them.

35
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,083
We're what you call past
the point of no return.

36
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,375
[SAKURA] Hitomi! Please!

37
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,083
[HITOMI] I think
I'm glad you're here.

38
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,416
We can watch the world
change together.

39
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,583
Watch terror break
people apart...

40
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,833
And watch them cry for us to
use our powers to unify them...

41
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,666
We'll be their only hope.

42
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,875
Don't you see...? The days
of our kind dying in silence

43
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:04,250
are over forever... It's time
for those with special abilities

44
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,416
to step into the light and
claim what's rightly theirs.

45
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,750
No... Stop...
Please, don't hurt him!

46
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,791
Well... What an adorable
little pet you have.

47
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,958
Puppy!

48
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,541
I suggest you take a
seat and enjoy the view.

49
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,083
Ogami!

50
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,875
You bastard.

51
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,708
Still wanna fight, huh?

52
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,250
[OGAMI] You're not
gonna hurt them.

53
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,791
There's no point in you
wasting your breath, Rei...

54
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,375
It's too late now... Stopping
the bombs is not an option.

55
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:40,250
Hitomi! How could you?!
You're just going to send

56
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,333
all these innocent people
to their deaths?!

57
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,333
This isn't you... It's not!

58
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:49,000
The old you never would've done
this... You're not Hitomi!

59
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,916
Come on, then... Fight me!

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,125
Oh, God!

61
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:57,708
You Code Breakers...
Heh... You're so naive.

62
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,833
Wake up, Ogami. The killing
Eden orders you to do

63
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,791
has nothing to do with justice.

64
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,125
They're safeguarding
their power, period.

65
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,250
Those yakuza you
burned up, for example?

66
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,083
They were only targeted
because they were helping me.

67
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,000
There are plenty of
organizations just as bad

68
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,125
they turn a blind eye to...

69
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,291
As long as they fall in line,
Eden looks the other way...

70
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,125
Tell me, what sort
of justice is that?

71
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,458
What do you think the Tabata
fiasco was all about...?

72
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,250
He was killed for providing
me with information.

73
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,333
You think the G-Falcon hits were
a public service? Eden made

74
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,166
an example of them to warn off
other gangs from getting ideas.

75
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,708
Your head would spin if you
knew what all Eden dips their

76
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,500
toes in; they only label it
evil if they choose to put

77
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,666
a stop to it. They use Code
Breakers to do their killing

78
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,750
so they can keep their
names out of it and avoid

79
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:48,166
the media circus. Don't tell
me you take pride in that?

80
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,833
You're the tool of
ruthless bastards

81
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,416
only concerned with
protecting their interests.

82
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,333
That's not true.

83
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,916
Please, I...
wanna... live...

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,791
[OGAMI] Only an idiot
chooses death.

85
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,500
--[SAKURA] Ogami.
--[CHISA] How could you...!

86
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,458
--He wouldn't have hurt you!
--Why did you do that?!

87
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,750
[OGAMI] Your face
as it is now...

88
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,833
[TABATA] He's just doing
his job as a hero.

89
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,750
[OGAMI] Burn to nothing.

90
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,083
[SAKURA] Enough!

91
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,000
[HITOMI] Come, my friend...
Let's fight together.

92
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,166
Have to be prepared.

93
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,250
Take my hand...
We can bring real justice

94
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,375
to the world, once and for all.

95
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,916
For our kind.
For all of us.

96
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:37,833
I understand...
Eden may be evil.

97
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,750
But so are you... Killing
people and assigning reasons

98
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,291
convenient to you...
Reasons that suit your needs...

99
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,541
The blood of innocent
people is on your hands...

100
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,541
You can say they aren't worthy
of protection all you want...

101
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,916
But when you're willing to
kill them, what are you worth?

102
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,250
[OGAMI] You're no better than
Eden... Hell, I'm not either...

103
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,458
I've killed--any way you
slice it, I've killed.

104
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,875
[SAKURA] Ogami.

105
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,666
But I fight for good...
For right... And I'll continue

106
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,166
to fight as long as I
have breath in my lungs!

107
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,750
Our job is to protect
the powerless

108
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,125
as much as it is to
destroy the lawless.

109
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:18,708
No. There's no way I'll
fight by your side, Hitomi.

110
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:22,208
Not ever... Because
I'm a Code Breaker!

111
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,583
That's too bad...
It really is.

112
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,750
[HITOMI] But it's only fitting
I'm the one to send you off.

113
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,583
Let him go!

114
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,125
That won't do any good.

115
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,791
No!

116
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,791
[SAKURA] Ogami!

117
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,583
Uh-oh... Yikes...
What's the matter?

118
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,416
What, you can't use
your flames anymore?

119
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,833
[SAKURA] What's wrong?

120
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,625
[HITOMI] Well, well, look
at this... You've gone Lost.

121
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,041
Oh, no!

122
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,333
[HITOMI] Tell me the truth,
how bad does it hurt?

123
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,666
Please... Stop this!

124
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,916
[HITOMI] The pain of those with
special abilities ends today...

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,291
Eden's reign is over.
The future is here!

126
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,250
No, wait...!
Hitomi, please!

127
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,416
You can't hurt him...
I won't let you.

128
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,083
You really are a good
little girl, aren't you...?

129
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,958
Clearly your parents
raised you with integrity.

130
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,833
Boss... Are you
absolutely certain

131
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,375
this is where the bomb
signals are coming from?

132
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,541
No doubt about it, this
is definitely the spot.

133
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,083
We'd better hurry.

134
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,458
[DAISUKE] Lemme
check it out first!

135
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,500
[GOTOKU] There's no
time, come on!

136
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,083
What are those kids doin'?

137
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,250
[BOY 12A] I don't know...
You think we should?

138
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,333
[BOY 12B] Hitomi said to do our
best to avoid all contact...

139
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,541
But it looks like
they've found us,

140
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,541
so what else are
we gonna do?

141
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,083
[DAISUKE] S'cuse me there, kids.

142
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,083
It's not safe for you boys
to be foolin' around

143
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,750
out here right now.
Step away and let us--

144
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,291
[BOY 12B] Stay back!

145
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,791
Daisuke!

146
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,250
No way those two are
just ordinary children.

147
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,833
This stops here.

148
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,541
I won't let you do this!

149
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,208
[SAKURA] It's over... I won't
let you do this anymore!

150
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,291
And you're planning to
defend him all by yourself?

151
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,333
You don't have
to do this.

152
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:45,166
You are a true friend...
A rare quality these days...

153
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,708
But still...

154
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,083
If loyalty was worth a damn,
we wouldn't be in this mess!

155
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,666
I'll show no mercy to
those who interfere.

156
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,583
Since special abilities
don't work on you...

157
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,958
I'll have to do it like this.

158
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,208
[OGAMI] Stop it... Please!

159
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,791
[HITOMI] Why should I?
You can't stop me...

160
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,375
You don't have the strength
to stand up to me now...

161
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,208
It's all over.

162
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,375
No... No!

163
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,583
[PRIME MINISTER] The bomb
could go off any second now...

164
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:23,291
Hurry up and rescue me.
That's an order, Code Breaker!

165
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,666
So what, you're just
going to watch me die...

166
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,291
That's your plan?

167
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,208
Not just yet... Not until
the Prime Minister and

168
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,416
fifty thousand of his citizens
are shoved into oblivion.

169
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,791
[HITOMI] In my life... I've
watched more Code Breakers die

170
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,875
than I care to remember...
Now it's your turn to watch.

171
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,750
You'll feel so helpless,
knowing you can't save them.

172
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,708
[SAKURA] Don't do this,
please, Hitomi...

173
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,250
You can't...
It isn't right...

174
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,166
There's time...
You can stop this!

175
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,791
[HITOMI] No... The days of our
people hiding in the shadows

176
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,791
are gone forever and a
new day's on the horizon.

177
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,125
[HITOMI] No more will we
live and die in secret

178
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,916
with no one even
knowing who we are.

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,666
Our destiny will be our own!
Forever... and always!

180
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,500
Well, we're in luck.

181
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,541
You think it's over?

182
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,208
I hope so.

183
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,208
You all right?

184
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,208
 Yeah.

185
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,750
 I'm cool.

186
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,791
[HITOMI] What the
hell's going on?

187
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,166
[HEIKE] I took matters
into my own hands.

188
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,250
[HITOMI] Heike?

189
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,875
What happened?

190
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,916
Number Two... It's done.

191
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,625
[HEIKE] The bombs are disabled.
I ordered Yuki to stop them.

192
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,625
And if you think the children
are yours, then you're wrong.

193
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,750
Almost there.

194
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,000
[YUKIHINA] The bombs
haven't gone off.

195
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,166
Could it be the
mission's failed?

196
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,791
Come back!

197
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,833
[HACHIOJI] Under
instructions from Heike,

198
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,916
we had all the children
moved to another location.

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,250
I see... So that's why you
were trying to buy time.

200
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,666
I pretended to die to
get the drop on Hitomi...

201
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,625
As long as he thought I was
out of the picture, I could

202
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:43,291
undermine his plan... The whole
thing was Heike's idea...

203
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,833
Checkmate.

204
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,541
Look what we have here...
Snow boy... Hey.

205
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,416
[HACHIOJI]
Yuki... Watch out!

206
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,125
[HACHIOJI] Damn...
He's gone.

207
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:10,416
[HITOMI] I see... So you've
betrayed me... Is that it?

208
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,916
You know the reasons why
I set up this operation in

209
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,166
the first place. It was to save
our lives. All of our lives.

210
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,541
[HEIKE] It's over...
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,083
Damn you!

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,083
Ace... Keep turning
up the heat like this

213
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,875
and you know damn well
you'll go Lost in moments.

214
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,708
Neither of us wants that to
happen. Just take it easy.

215
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,333
There are still some things
I need to have you do.

216
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:40,000
You're wrong...
I'm not going to go Lost!

217
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,750
[HEIKE] It's time for you
to surrender... Now.

218
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,000
It's over.

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,416
You fool... Do you think
you've won...? Truly?

220
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,833
I've destroyed your
communication device

221
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,000
so you can't detonate any
more bombs. Toki is rescuing the

222
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,208
Prime Minister... Surely you see
your plans have been thwarted.

223
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:13,083
What I asked was if you think
you've beaten me. Has it even

224
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,875
occurred to you why I chose
Sky Tower as the final location?

225
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,250
[HEIKE] What?

226
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,541
[HITOMI] Do you think
I'd operate without

227
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,125
a contingency plan?
I knew they might find out

228
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,750
where I was: it's why
I chose this place.

229
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,083
That's right... From this
height, I can release

230
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,416
an electromagnetic pulse capable
of spanning the country!

231
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,291
I can detonate every
single bomb! You see...

232
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,625
The war against our
kind ends today!

233
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,750
Hitomi, no...! Don't!

234
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm sad it's come to this...

235
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:46,208
Just remember, friend, it's your
doing, not mine... Goodbye.

236
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,666
No, please...
Don't do this.

237
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,250
It's done!

238
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,666
[TOKI] I scared you
good... Didn't I?

239
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,500
[PRIME MINISTER] Yes,
I would say you did...

240
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,458
No harm was done though, and you
managed to stop the blast...

241
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:11,750
So, excellent work. Now, untie
me and let's get out of here.

242
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,708
[PRIME MINISTER] What's wrong?

243
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,958
[TOKI] Right now, his fate is in
my hands and my hands alone...

244
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,250
If I kill him...
Sis will be set free.

245
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:26,000
Don't just stand there. Come...
Untie these ropes right now!

246
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,791
Toki! What is this about?!

247
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,500
I busted the camera.

248
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,416
So the only people watching
right now are you and me.

249
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,291
No one will know the truth
about what happens to you.

250
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,291
No... Toki, please!

251
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,958
Please... This isn't you!
Don't do this to me!

252
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:48,416
See reason, Toki... I'm going
to fall! Help me, damn it!

253
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,000
Listen to you...
Big scaredy cat.

254
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,583
[PRIME MINISTER] Oh, no!

255
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,083
Every once in a while we can all
stand to be put in our place.

256
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,583
[PRIME MINISTER]
Tell me, Toki...

257
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:10,208
Did you find the satisfaction
you were looking for in that?

258
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,125
It's one thing to dangle
a man off of a building...

259
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,708
It's another thing to follow
through, and that you didn't do.

260
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,000
You're nothing but my dog. You
might've been able to sit back

261
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,625
and watch as the bomb
scattered me to the winds...

262
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,500
But in the end you were too
scared to do it yourself.

263
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,708
You really are worthless, aren't
you, m'boy...? I should've

264
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:32,250
listened to my gut and recruited
your sister instead of you.

265
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,083
What kind of father are you?!

266
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,625
I'm going shopping
with my Dad today...

267
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,416
No... You won't do that...

268
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,833
Unless you want to see
Nenene become a killer...

269
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,583
You will obey my every word.

270
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,916
That was our agreement
from the beginning...

271
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,250
Mister Code Breaker...
Code Number Four... Ha!

272
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,291
The fun's just
getting started, son.

273
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,291
You bastard!

274
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,708
There something else
you'd like to say to me?

275
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,500
[TOKI] Only this...
I can kill you

276
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,916
any time I want to...
Know that.

277
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,625
Please. Both of us know
you don't have the balls.

278
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,458
[TOKI] It's 'cause I don't
want to become like you!

279
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,000
What?

280
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,250
[TOKI] I won't let me being
a Code Breaker change me,

281
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,541
not one bit... I won't use it
for my own selfish bullshit

282
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,291
and end up an evil
prick like you!

283
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,083
What nonsense.

284
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,416
You can't...! No!

285
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,250
Don't do this!
It's wrong! Please!

286
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,666
Kaboom.

287
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,208
What?

288
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,000
This ends now, Hitomi!

289
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,583
Hachioji! I can't believe
you're really alive!

290
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,791
Yuki! Damn it!
How about a warning

291
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,666
before you blast me through
the top of a building?

292
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,833
Yeah, my bad...
We're almost out of time,

293
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,041
I didn't have a choice.

294
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,583
[SAKURA] Yuki!

295
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,250
[HACHIOJI] It's over,
Hitomi. Surrender.

296
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,958
[HITOMI] Deny me
and you forsake me!

297
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,375
[YUKI] Number five!

298
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,291
Hitomi...! Stop it!

299
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,208
I have no idea what's happened
to you, Number One...!

300
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,666
But we're not gonna stand here
and let you hurt those people!

301
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:43,083
Hitomi! I know you,
and you would never do

302
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,208
something like this!
Let it go!

303
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,166
How could you do this, man?
We used to worship you!

304
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,375
[HITOMI] You idiots don't
understand anything.

305
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,458
Back in the day, when we
used to work together

306
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,750
as friends, it was perfect.
I miss those days,

307
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,291
miss the simplicity of knowing
we were trying to do good...

308
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,916
But now, things are a hell
of a lot more complicated...

309
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,666
As long as Eden is in charge
of the Code Breakers...

310
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,583
Our kind is fated to die
like pawns in their hands...

311
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,750
Can't you see Eden is using you?

312
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,291
Can't you see they've
made you their dogs?!

313
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,750
[HITOMI] How can you be so
blind? You're slamming the door

314
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,791
on the future of every child
born with powers like ours.

315
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,458
Even if we are...
That doesn't mean

316
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,333
you have the right to drag
innocent people into this--

317
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,125
[HITOMI] Innocent?!

318
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,416
They're not... The people
I once fought so hard

319
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,166
to protect are guilty...
Their crime is ignorance.

320
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,875
The people are blinded...
All of them... They don't

321
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,333
even realize we risk our lives
every day to defend theirs!

322
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,166
[HITOMI] Do you think they
know how many of us have died?

323
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,666
How many Code Breakers have paid

324
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,000
the ultimate price
for their freedom?

325
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,666
They live their lives
in complete ignorance.

326
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,166
Enjoying their peace
and happiness!

327
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,375
They don't even realize
what they owe us!

328
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,041
If that isn't a crime,
then what is?!

329
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,083
Nothing can stop me now!
Not Eden and certainly not you!

330
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,791
The world will change forever!

331
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,416
Hitomi... There's a
good person in you...!

332
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,958
A good person who fought
for innocent people...!

333
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,000
Who fought to do the right thing
no matter the personal cost!

334
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,500
I know he's still in there! And
I know you can bring him back!

335
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,750
Yeah, no... Not gonna let that
happen, old buddy. I'm sorry.

336
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,166
I'm drawing the line right here
and now, you son of a bitch.

337
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:07,291
I'm begging you!
No more, please!

338
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,541
Please.

339
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,541
You just don't know when
to quit, do you, girl?

340
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,250
Don't touch her! Hitomi!

341
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,500
I don't care if I have
to exterminate the whole

342
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,750
damn country! The people have
indulged themselves too long!

343
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:26,333
No more! Today our kind
will be acknowledged!

344
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:30,625
[OGAMI] An eye for an eye.
A tooth for a tooth...

345
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,083
and evil for evil.

346
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,791
This ends... Right now.

347
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,333
Hitomi.

348
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,458
[OGAMI] Goodbye.

349
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,833
What's this?

350
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,041
This can't be!

351
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:03,458
[OGAMI] Hitomi. I hereby
judge you an evil man...

352
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:08,000
And therefore... I must
burn you to you nothing.

353
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:12,083
Outstanding... Such
strength... Such power.

354
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:49,291
[SAKURA] Toki... Yuki...
Hachioji... Heike... Hitomi...

355
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:52,041
Next time... "Code Breaker"
episode thirteen...

356
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,333
"A Flower Blooming with God"...

357
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,875
Goodbye, Rei Ogami...
Goodbye.
