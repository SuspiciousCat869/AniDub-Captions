1
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,541
[YUKI] An eye for an eye...

2
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,250
Tooth for a tooth...

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,500
And a requiem
of fury for all evil.

4
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,125
Not cool!

5
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,791
[YUKI] They're gone.

6
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,041
Killing spree,
here we come.

7
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,250
[SAKURA] I'm leaving.

8
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,625
[SAKURA] I don't
understand him. At all.

9
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,625
[SAKURA] But, there is one thing
I'm certain about in all this.

10
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,375
[SAKURA] What he does
is wrong. Plain and simple.

11
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,875
Miss Sakurakoji...
Beautiful day, huh?

12
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:02,875
Are you
trying to keep me

13
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,125
from leaving the house?

14
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,666
No... Just watching.

15
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,875
Yeah well...

16
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:12,125
That goes both ways...
You're watching me.

17
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,791
I'm watching you.

18
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,875
Good morning.

19
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,125
Look at you,
rock star... Ha.

20
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,000
'nother mountain of fan mail?

21
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,750
[AOBA] So, I noticed
you walked to school

22
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,166
with a certain somebody today...

23
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,791
What of it?

24
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,791
Bah...
I'm not grilling you...

25
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,666
How you conduct your
love life is your business.

26
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,625
Look, here's the deal...

27
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,208
Ogami and I are gonna be
hanging out a lot for a while...

28
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:04,375
and I'm not
really sure how long.

29
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,166
Sounds kinda serious.

30
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,375
Yeah. But not
the way you think...

31
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,166
I know it sounds weird, but
I have to keep a strict watch.

32
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,708
[AOBA] Whoa. So intense!

33
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,500
I'm gettin' a little jealous.

34
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,708
Sure wish I had a
guy who'd keep a candle

35
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,833
in the window for me
morning noon and night.

36
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,166
No...!

37
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,250
It's just that I have
to save him from himself.

38
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,500
You hear that, mister!

39
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,041
You better appreciate her!

40
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,541
Shouldn't be hard.

41
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,500
[AOBA] Yeah, well...
I got my eye on you.

42
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,458
[MALE STUDENT F]
Yo! Romeo...!

43
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,250
I'm... I'm drawing a line
in the sand for us all!

44
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,291
Oh right. Them.

45
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,666
See they kinda
come the territory.

46
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,125
[smack]

47
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,041
Back away this instant!

48
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,416
Anyone who
touches this man answers to me!

49
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,208
[shocked noises]

50
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,083
[GIRL STUDENTS] She's in love!

51
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,333
[sad noises]

52
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:07,583
Oh dear. My little girl
is growing up so fast.

53
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,291
Appreciated, but...

54
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,125
I don't recall ever asking
you to be my chaperone.

55
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,333
I can pick my own battles.

56
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,083
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
Oh hey, Ogami...

57
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,083
Sorry...

58
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,500
You're on cleanup
duty tomorrow...

59
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,750
You can pick up a
copy of the checklist

60
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,583
in the student
lounge if you want.

61
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,208
That would be where?

62
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,875
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
You haven't been by there yet?

63
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,041
Hmmm. Let's see.

64
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:34,958
If you walk down D Hall to--

65
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,791
[SAKURA] I'll show him the way.

66
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,750
[OGAMI] I'm a man
of my word, you know.

67
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,500
Long as you keep your
mouth shut they're safe...

68
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,458
I'm evil, but I'm not stupid...

69
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,125
I usually try to give
trouble a wide berth.

70
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,375
We both
know the second I'm out

71
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,875
of your crosshairs you'll assume
I've snuck off to broadcast

72
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,875
your secret to the whole school
and I'm not about to risk that.

73
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,250
Not on my watch.

74
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:03,833
Oh, I spy my favorite pair.
Righty and lefty!

75
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,000
Damn it, Fujiwara...!
We've been through this:

76
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,375
I don't like people
squeezing my breasts

77
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,416
like they're shopping for fruit!

78
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,833
Oh... How cute...
Your bosom has a fan club...

79
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:13,958
...and they even have names!

80
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,625
I'll have to remember that!

81
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,375
[SAKURA] Do not encourage her!

82
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,125
[NENENE] Aaaaah...!
They're so big and squishy!

83
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,541
Hey...! Easy!

84
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,625
Adorable.

85
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,000
You shut up!

86
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,083
Isn't this the bestest
pair in the world?

87
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,458
Sure.

88
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,375
It's super-dooper
awesome you feel that way,

89
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,541
because it means
you and I can be

90
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,208
the bestest
friends in the world!

91
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,333
if you wanna be...

92
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,041
Well why wouldn't I?

93
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,708
That makes it official, then:

94
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,458
I can share my deepest
darkest secret with you

95
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,000
without worrying
that you'll judge me.

96
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,833
[SAKURA] Her eyes
are heterochromic?

97
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,375
Ogami!

98
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,083
Sorry, little girl...

99
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,416
I... thought you
were someone else.

100
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,875
What the crap...?!

101
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,916
I demand an explanation!

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,083
Who did you think she was?!

103
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,750
[cellphone ring]

104
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,750
[TOKI] Yeah, yeah. Speak.

105
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,083
Sure. If you think
we should team up...

106
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,125
I'm game.

107
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,416
Sounds like fun.

108
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,125
Anything else?

109
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,500
[KANDA] The key's in the basket.

110
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,208
Everything else you
need for tonight is exactly

111
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,625
where it should be.

112
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,833
Good luck. Be safe.

113
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,625
[OGAMI] Yeah...
I'll take care of it.

114
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,208
For the record, Sakura...
You suck at tailing.

115
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,708
[SAKURA] Whatever, I still
overheard what you said...!

116
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,750
Planning some vigilante
killing spree for the evening?

117
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,166
Whoa...! Uh-uh...! No!

118
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,583
You just move slowly, please!

119
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,666
Turns out your
friend had a puppy.

120
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,083
You're kidding me!
I had no idea!

121
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,000
[SAKURA] Oh there's no mistaking
who you're from, is there?

122
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,583
Trust issues and all.

123
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,250
That's just great.

124
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,416
 I guess...

125
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:40,791
The apple doesn't fall
very far from the tree.

126
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,291
Poor thing.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,583
[SAKURA] I'm sorry.

128
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,833
I wish I could've
done something.

129
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,458
[SAKURA] Your mother was...
Enormously brave.

130
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,083
It seems pretty quiet.

131
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,416
It won't last...

132
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,166
The storm'll
break soon enough.

133
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,833
Excuse me?

134
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,875
You sure about this...?

135
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,125
If you see behind the facade,
you'll never be able to return

136
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,541
to this peaceful daydream
you've been living in.

137
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,250
Don't talk down
to me like that...

138
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,291
It's not like I spent
my childhood in Munchkin Land.

139
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,125
I suppose your
landlords don't care

140
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,000
if the building gets robbed?

141
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,125
[SAKURA] Your place...?
I mean, I assume.

142
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,166
Last chance to change your
mind about coming in here.

143
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,041
Ha! You think a little
bachelor pad squalor

144
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,958
will get rid of me?

145
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,000
[YAKUZA A] Hey!

146
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,333
[SAKURA] Ogami, what is this?!

147
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,291
Who the hell
are you s'posed to be?!

148
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:24,250
[SAKURA] Oh no.
These people are Yakuza.

149
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,708
Which means... Oh no.

150
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,458
He's come here
to take on the mob!

151
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,166
Hahahaha!

152
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,833
I hate to break it to you...

153
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,708
But I'm pretty sure
the authorities have

154
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,166
beaten you to the
punch, my friend.

155
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,791
Probably best we just leave
and let them do their job.

156
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,250
[OGAMI] Sakura, please...

157
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,041
Those two aren't
here to make arrests.

158
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,708
[SAKURA] Huh??

159
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,916
[YAKUZA G] You got some
massive titanium balls

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,875
coming in here like we're
runnin' some corner store.

161
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,250
Give me one good
reason why I shouldn't--

162
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,333
[OGAMI] There are fewer
of you than I expected...

163
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,000
Good; that means
this'll go quickly.

164
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:58,708
[YAKUZA G] Hey!

165
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,291
Don't interrupt me, kid!

166
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,666
[OGAMI] If it's all the same...

167
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,875
I'd rather get
started killing you.

168
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,208
[YAKUZA J] Did he just
say what I think he said?!

169
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,250
[YAKUZA C] Hope your ass
can cash that check, kid!

170
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,791
[YAKUZA B] Someone's
a dead son of a bitch!

171
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,166
[YAKUZA G] You have no idea
the world of hurt you're in for!

172
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,083
All of you, shut up!

173
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,583
Son... Just what the
hell's your affiliation?

174
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,958
High School...
Homeroom B-1.

175
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,958
Nice one, kid ...

176
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,250
I appreciate a good joke
as much as the next guy...

177
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,666
But...

178
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,541
There is such a thing as
takin' it too far, I'm afraid...

179
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,083
so let's start again...
tell me why you're here.

180
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,125
[OGAMI] Well, you see...

181
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,541
I was afraid you
guys were having to

182
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,291
overextend yourselves,
on account of my wiping out

183
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,875
your G-Falcon street vendors.

184
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:40,750
Say what?!

185
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,916
That's a good way

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
to get yourself killed,
you little prick!

187
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,333
[YAKUZA BOSS] Did I or
did I not say shut up?

188
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,000
[YAKUZA B] My bad, chief.

189
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,375
You're full of
shit, but you got attitude...

190
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,541
As introductions go
you could do a lot worse.

191
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,666
Work for me.

192
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,958
Be a runner.
You got the balls for it.

193
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,666
And like you said, I got some
street vacancies need fillin'.

194
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,583
Yeah...?

195
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,500
What kind of
perks we lookin' at?

196
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,375
Ogami!

197
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,208
Talk to me about my cut.

198
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,000
Hmm... Trust me.

199
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,500
I can make it
worth your while, kid.

200
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,375
[YAKUZA BOSS] Big Pharm's
always a choice investment

201
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,208
when you know how
to bait the market...

202
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,500
And you're in bed
with Collections...

203
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,166
Supply and demand at its finest.

204
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,041
[YAKUZA BOSS] Never
underestimate demand. Ever.

205
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,291
This repeat customer became

206
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,333
a bag man for me
in a matter of weeks.

207
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,208
Anything for a hit.

208
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,208
Sunk now, though.

209
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,583
I see that.

210
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,791
[YAKUZA BOSS] He's less
than useless on the street,

211
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,166
but he's got a little daughter
at home he can barter with.

212
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,416
[OGAMI] Interesting.

213
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,791
[YAKUZA BOSS]
The G-Falcon boys didn't have

214
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,416
a very light touch, though...

215
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,125
They rough-housed the goods...

216
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,166
That's where you
come in, hot shot;

217
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,000
this kind of work needs a hand
that knows how to finesse, yeah?

218
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,291
People usually push back
when you lay out their options.

219
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,416
They need some convincing...

220
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,083
Fascinating...

221
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,583
And the cops are
on board with this?

222
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,625
You know it, my friend...!

223
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,541
Only way to do biz...

224
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,750
Wouldn't you agree, officer?

225
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,125
Stop this...!

226
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,125
I -I can't believe
what I'm hearing!

227
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,250
What?

228
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,750
[SAKURA] You two disgust me...!

229
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,250
Those badges represent your
commitment to the people...!

230
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,833
How could you sell yourselves
to the enemy like this?!

231
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,958
[YAKUZA BOSS]
Commitment to the people!

232
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,208
I am not joking!

233
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,458
[YAKUZA C] That's what's
so funny, sweetheart!

234
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,250
You really mean it, don't you?

235
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,875
[YAKUZA BOSS] Young lady...

236
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,875
It's a dog eat dog world...

237
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,458
I'm sorry if we're not
all paragons of virtue,

238
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,083
but that's how
the world works...

239
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,208
Fightin' the good
fight is for chumps.

240
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,083
Sir, actually...

241
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,583
Goodie Two-Shoes can positively
ID this entire room...

242
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,875
Let's show her...
How the world works.

243
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,000
You wouldn't dare!

244
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,916
[SAKURA] Ogami, no!

245
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,416
I'm sorry, Sakura...

246
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,875
But these men can't
be reasoned with...

247
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,041
Good will only
prevail here by force.

248
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,500
Wait!

249
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,750
What the hell is
up with that fire?!

250
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,958
[OGAMI] An eye for an eye.

251
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:17,083
A tooth for a tooth.
And evil for evil.

252
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,291
Burn to nothing.

253
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,083
Mr. Nitta!

254
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:25,333
Stop it right now! Ogami!

255
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,333
You bastard!
Let go of me!

256
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,083
What are you --

257
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,083
Burn.

258
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,583
I'll snap
your goddamn neck!

259
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,041
Burn.

260
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,000
Put me out, please!

261
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,791
No...! Get away!

262
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,416
Burn.

263
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,416
What is this
accomplishing...?!

264
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,000
Please don't do--

265
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,625
You psychotic son of a bitch!

266
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,375
How did he do that?!

267
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,875
Where the hell is that
fire coming from?!

268
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,750
[YAKUZA A] 
What are you?!

269
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,250
He... He's a demon!

270
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,666
[OGAMI] An eye for an eye.

271
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,291
A tooth for a tooth.
And evil for evil.

272
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,583
[DRIVER A] Officer Kato's
taking his time, sir.

273
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,208
Heh...

274
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,750
He's probably making sure the
little girl is street worthy.

275
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,333
Should we head back?

276
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,458
 In a minute...

277
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,041
We need to swing
by Hitomi's first, too.

278
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,458
[SAKURA] Murderer.

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,416
How could...?

280
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,791
Damn you!

281
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,541
Did you have to
slaughter them...?!

282
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,750
You gonna tell me there was
no other way to solve this?!

283
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,875
And what would you suggest?

284
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,458
[OGAMI] People like
this don't care about

285
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,166
justifying what they do.

286
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,083
Preaching at them about morality

287
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,333
isn't going to stop
them from hurting people.

288
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,375
[SAKURA] But...

289

[MALE HARDLUCK A]
Help me, please.

290

[MALE HARDLUCK A]
I just... need a taste.

291
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,916
[OGAMI] Tell me anyone
capable of doing that

to another human
being is reachable.

00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,250
[YAKUZA C]
You really mean it, don't you?

294
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,958
We're not all
paragons of virtue,

295

but that's how
the world works...

296
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,791
Let's show her...

297
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,208
Evil's a cancer we have to
eradicate however we can.

298

No!

Come on... Let's get
you back on your feet...

00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,583
Let her
go this instant!

323
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,000
[SAKURA] Stop it,
she's innocent!

324
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,083
Let go...! Let go!!!

325
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,500
[FEMALE HARDLUCK A]
I... don't... wanna... die...

326
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,333
[FEMALE HARDLUCK A]
Please I... wanna... live...

327
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,250
[OGAMI] Pain is one
of life's conditions...

328
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,000
I suggest you toughen up...

329
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,625
The next time
you're feeling sorry

330
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,875
for yourself,
remember my face...

331
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,958
Remember my
hand on your throat...

332
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,250
Pain is a luxury...
the prerogative of life...

333
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,958
Only an idiot chooses death.

334
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,541
When you're
ready to be an idiot.

335
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:45,791
I'm ready to oblige you.
That's a promise.

336
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:52,250
[loud sobs]

337
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,833
[SAKURA] Ogami...

338
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,375
What would possess
you to go that far?

339
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,958
Where does evil end
and good begin with you?

340
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,000
Hold on a minute.

341
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,416
[SAKURA] Do you feel that?

342
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,958
That's the warmth of
another human being.

343
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,833
It's what makes life precious.

344
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,916
What are you
trying to prove...? Let go.

345
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,500
Shut up...

346
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,500
This is something you've needed
to feel for a very long time.

347
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,750
[SAKURA] I understand
why you do these things...

348
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,583
And I know you think
it's beyond debate...

349
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,708
But I don't accept
the path you're on.

350
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,125
Period.

351
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,250
People can be reached;
good can win without violence -

352
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,708
you'll be proof of
that when I'm done!

353
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,458
[OGAMI] You are fascinating...

354
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,250
I suppose they call
your kind rarebreeds

355
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,125
for a very good reason.

356
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,041
[SAKURA]
You keep calling me that.

357
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,458
What does it mean?

358
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,958
Sakura, look...
I know you mean well...

359
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,000
But I'm not someone
you'll ever understand...

360
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,041
So you might as
well stop trying now.

361
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,166
What do you--?

362
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,833
It's done...
Send in one of your gofers

363
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,750
to retrieve Miss Sakurakoji
as soon as possible.

364
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,291
[knocking]

365
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,083
[TAKATA] Hello there.
Can I help you?

366
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,333
Am I talking to
Police Chief Takata...?

367
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:31,500
Not to be the bearer of bad news
but your pals died in a fire.

368
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,500
[OGAMI] Who's your underworld
contact and where is he?

369
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,125
You damn
son of a bitch...!

370
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,125
You're a Code Breaker,
aren't you?!

371
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,125
Where is Hitomi?

372
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,291
[TAKATA] Code red!

373
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,916
I'm being chased by
one of your old friends!

374
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,916
Help me!

375
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,875
[HITOMI] Sucks to be you, huh?

376
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,041
[TAKATA] Don't you do it!

377
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,750
Don't you throw me
to the wolves like this!

378
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:57,958
We had a deal!

379
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,208
[HITOMI] We did, and
it served its purpose...

380
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,708
Thing is, I'm a stickler
for style and, uh,

381
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,958
you're making me look bad.

382
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,833
Happy trails, you
corrupt piece of shit.

383
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,833
[TAKATA] Hitomi...!
We had a deal...!

384
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,333
I risked everything...!

385
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,541
You can't just throw me away;
I'm part of the big plan!

386
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,541
Eye for an eye...
Tooth for a tooth...

387
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,166
Goodbye, officer.

388
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,291
[OGAMI] Toki?!

389
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,875
An eye for an eye...
a tooth for a tooth.

390
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,125
[TOKI] And the hammer
of justice for all evil.

391
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,041
[TOKI] S'up, man?

392
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,916
[TOKI] Sorry about
the mess and all.

393
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,583
You're my warm-up act.

394
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:47,125
[SAKURA] Next time, "Code:
Breaker". Episode 4, War Cry.

395
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,916
[SAKURA] You live too much
in your own head, Ogami.

396
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,291
You need a friend. You need me.
