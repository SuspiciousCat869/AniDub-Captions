1
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,000
Ta-daa!

2
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,458
Here
we go!

3
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,916
W-where...?

4
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,958
I'm sorry but...
who are you?

5
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,958
My name's
Éclair. Hi.

6
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,125
Lumiere.

7
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,250
With so many of the
same faces around,

8
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,625
even I almost
have a hard time

9
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:54,083
keeping them all
straight. Except...

10
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,541
Except what?

11
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,416
Well, you've got the
look down pretty good.

12
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,291
But you always did wear
too much makeup... Alv.

13
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,750
What are you
talking about?

14
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,875
I agree... And I'd say the
same goes for you... Dverger.

15
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,750
"Absorb." The ability to
assimilate and copy...

16
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,916
I'm not sure what good
you thought copying us

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,291
was going
to do...

18
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,333
But in any case, this Little
Miss Look Alike contest

19
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,750
has gone on
long enough.

20
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,833
You can say
whatever you want.

21
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,458
We'll see who's real...
and who's dead!

22
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Please...

23
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,416
What do you think?
Should we help?

24
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,125
Let's give
them a chance.

25
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,833
The full might
of the G.O.T.T.

26
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,458
has been turned to
ridding the galaxy

27
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,916
of antisocial
elements like you...

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,625
One way or another,
you're going to be purged.

29
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,416
Just make it easy on
yourself and give up!

30
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,625
Just 'give
up' huh?

31
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,833
I'm sorry, I don't
know what that means.

32
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,000
Those words aren't
in my vocabulary!

33
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,250
You'd do well to
pay attention

34
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,583
when someone gives
you free advice.

35
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,625
That depends on
who's giving it.

36
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,083
You idiot! What
are you doing!?

37
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:01,500
What?!

38
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,958
Did you
see that?

39
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,083
Yes...

40
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,583
Wait!
Is she-?

41
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,791
No! Don't get
close to her!

42
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:33,625
You stupid, stupid girl...
You'll never learn.

43
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,750
That really does
come in handy...

44
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,875
Everyone!
Start climbing!

45
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,250
I'm sorry... I
wasn't much help.

46
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,291
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

47
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,583
What
happened?

48
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,916
She absorbed your powers
when you attacked.

49
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,083
Looks
like it.

50
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,416
But from everything
we've seen so far,

51
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,750
it appears her
"Absorb" ability

52
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,416
only lasts for a
short period of time.

53
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,958
Once the time
limit has expired,

54
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,083
she has to absorb energy
from someone else

55
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,416
in order to 'recharge her
batteries', as it were.

56
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,875
So then... she was
almost out of power?

57
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,791
If I hadn't just gone
rushing in like that...

58
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,916
I probably would've
done the same thing...

59
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,416
...if I
were you.

60
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,833
Now then... don't you
think it's about time

61
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,416
we made
our stand?

62
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,750
As the old
saying goes:

63
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,750
"borrowed wisdom is
a tenuous thing."

64
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,666
Theirs is only growing more
tenuous by the minute...

65
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,291
We don't know
that for certain.

66
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,083
This may be our best
chance to find out.

67
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,250
And why
is that?

68
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,500
In mountainous
warfare,

69
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,916
it's generally favorable
to take the high ground.

70
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,083
If the theory
holds true,

71
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,875
that would give us
the clear advantage.

72
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,500
For my part, I'll
do what I can

73
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,416
to keep all of our new friends
here out of harm's way.

74
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,208
The rest... I
leave to you.

75
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,791
'Kay... Ready?

76
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,000
Ready.

77
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:38,916
Ready.

78
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,166
Go!

79
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,500
My power!

80
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,375
That got her!

81
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,750
You see? Now what
did I tell you?

82
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,125
No!

83
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:25,541
Ah, perfect. Our little
delivery boy's right on time.

84
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,666
Here's your tip...
You've earned it.

85
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,500
You're mine!

86
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,083
Fools!

87
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,875
No! Don't,
Armblast!

88
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,833
Get out
of the way!

89
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,916
Go.

90
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,500
Now why would
I do that?

91
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,791
I believe I've
already mentioned

92
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,041
how fond I am
of these two.

93
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,125
In that
case... Die.

94
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,291
Dextera!
Sinistra!

95
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,208
I'm sure you would've done
fine without our help...

96
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,250
We just couldn't pass
up the opportunity

97
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,416
to give the good "Acting
Chief" a little payback.

98
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,291
We've been watching
for a while.

99
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,291
I wanted to come
down sooner, but-

100
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,541
Don't worry about it.
Your timing is perfect.

101
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,708
Of course,
I'm not sure

102
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,916
everyone would agree
with you on that...

103
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,083
We've run out of
time. The game is up.

104
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,375
You're wrong. We haven't
lost this fight yet.

105
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,833
And we're not going
to lose it now.

106
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,750
Not when I'm so
close to my revenge!

107
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,708
Your
revenge?

108
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,375
Everything I've done: absorbing
your G-Class abilities...

109
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,583
disposing of
the Chief...

110
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,458
assuming control
of the G.O.T.T...

111
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,708
It was all part of my
plan to take revenge

112
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,916
against the
Nouvlesse!

113
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,333
What is the
"Global Union"?

114
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:49,250
Or even the G.O.T.T.?
Empty names...

115
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,750
In the end, it's still the
Nouvlesse who control the lives

116
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,750
of every single
person in the galaxy!

117
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,750
You of all people
should understand.

118
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,250
You've seen the way the
Nouvlesse exploit the masses

119
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,625
to serve
their whim.

120
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,333
You know the hardships we've
been made to endure...

121
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,958
And all the suffering we've
caused in their name!

122
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,416
The G.O.T.T. you serve so
proudly is a mockery.

123
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,666
It was only created as a
tool for the Nouvlesse.

124
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,166
All these years,

125
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,791
the only thing we've ever
protected is their interests.

126
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,958
We have no choice but to
act the part of pawns.

127
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,666
We aren't even
allowed to die!

128
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,416
If there's a worse
hell than this,

129
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,041
then you tell
me what it is!

130
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,916
But now it's their turn to
suffer, just as I have.

131
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,541
The Nouvlesse and all
of their puppets...

132
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,375
I'm going to pay you all
back - ten times over!

133
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,833
I'll stop at nothing. Even
if it costs me my life!

134
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,875
I understand that you
hate the Nouvlesse.

135
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,500
So do I... But you're
acting like a selfish child!

136
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,208
I think we all share your
feelings to some degree.

137
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,666
Even so, that doesn't
excuse what you've done.

138
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,500
What else was I
supposed to do?!

139
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,583
You had the option to become
fugitives, just as we did.

140
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,958
What are
you saying?

141
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,625
If it was what you truly
wanted, with your abilities,

142
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,750
I'm sure the
two of you

143
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,083
would've had little
trouble escaping.

144
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,750
That's
absurd!

145
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,125
You say everything
you've done

146
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,541
has been in the
name of revenge...

147
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,000
But I
suspect

148
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,750
that you're only trying to
convince yourself of that...

149
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,916
to justify your
true lust for power.

150
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,166
Believe what you
want. I don't care.

151
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,750
In another five minutes...
it won't matter.

152
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,625
Like I said, we haven't
lost this fight yet.

153
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,583
Come on! We need
to fall back!

154
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,458
Well... So much
for the advantage.

155
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,958
Yeah... Any more
bright ideas?!

156
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,208
They're
coming!

157
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,000
Faster!

158
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:58,958
I've got
them...

159
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,625
You know, it's really
something of a shame

160
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,666
that things had to
turn out this way.

161
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,166
How's that?

162
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,666
I mean, in the end, we all
basically want the same thing.

163
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,416
It's just a thin line that
separates us from them.

164
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,666
Perhaps... Except
their goals included

165
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,458
the destruction of
G.O.T.T. headquarters.

166
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,833
However noble
their motives,

167
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,083
that's a line that should
never have been crossed.

168
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,250
And let's not forget the
murder of Chief Eclipse...

169
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,083
I can't say I agree with the
way the Nouvlesse operate

170
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,500
any more than
they do...

171
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,750
But there's a difference
between changing the system

172
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,125
and throwing
it into chaos.

173
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,541
If they succeed in
destroying the G.O.T.T.,

174
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,083
it could potentially lead to
the complete financial collapse

175
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,083
of the galaxy!

176
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,916
Yeah, but how do
you really feel?

177
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,916
That's irrelevant. I'm
only stating the facts.

178
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,125
More than
anything,

179
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,083
I think Dextera here is
just a little bitter

180
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,208
about being made
to play the fool

181
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,541
through all
this business...

182
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,125
Sinistra!

183
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,416
Well, you guys can sit around
and argue about that later...

184
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,750
Right now, I think
we can all agree

185
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:00,875
the only thing
that matters

186
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,000
is defeating Alv
and Dverger, yeah?

187
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,500
Do you have to ask? I'd think
that obvious at this point.

188
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,625
Okay
then!

189
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,291
Where do they think
they're going?

190
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,416
Nowhere. We're coming
up on a dead end.

191
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,916
A 'dead end'?
How appropriate.

192
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,875
It will be for them in
more ways than one.

193
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,916
We can't keep
this up...

194
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,083
Oh, my,
my....

195
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,500
What?

196
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,000
You surprise me. I didn't
think the words 'give up'

197
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,750
were in your
vocabulary...

198
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,208
This is not the time
to start joking around!

199
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,500
Sorry. I was only
making an observation.

200
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,375
Hurry! Just
keep moving!

201
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,500
[Armblast] Should
we swim for it?

202
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,416
[Éclair] Don't
be ridiculous!

203
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
[Lumiere]
They're here!

204
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,333
It's over.

205
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,750
Such a nice
breeze...

206
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,458
They say that if you die in
a gentle breeze like this,

207
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,583
it will carry
your soul

208
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,916
to better fortunes
in your next life.

209
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,083
It'd be nice if
that were true.

210
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,666
But we both know better
than that, don't we?

211
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,416
Well, then there's
nothing left to say...

212
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Except the
final "goodbye".

213
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:37,750
What the-?

214
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,000
Is that...?

215
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,083
It's about
time...

216
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,250
Well, a lady has to wait
for the right moment

217
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,958
to make a
proper entrance.

218
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,083
It... can't be!

219
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:06,083
Yes, the High-Speed Cruiser
La Muse... Prototype Zero...

220
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,458
Or, as it was formerly
known: Calliope.

221
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,500
But how?!

222
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,375
Donner!

223
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,041
This is the upgraded
version of Donnerschlag...

224
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,625
But for the
La Muse,

225
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,166
we actually had to go back to
the original production model.

226
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,500
Impossible...
Eclipse?!

227
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,750
Un-oh...?

228
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,125
It's like I
told you...

229
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,916
We found a job with more
interesting prospects.

230
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,666
How, Eclipse?! You were
dead! I watched you fall!

231
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,416
You know I was an ES
Member myself at one time...

232
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,250
My ability was known as
"Quandt"... or Quantum Jumping.

233
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,166
Surely, you've
heard of it.

234
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,166
The short version is it's
what brought us back to life.

235
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,791
Her ability is what
encoded all of us

236
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,875
as ES Members
to begin with.

237
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,583
Do you have any idea what I've
been through to get this far?

238
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,125
Do you?! The pain
I've suffered?

239
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,791
The humiliations I've
been forced to endure?

240
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:19,291
And at long last... Revenge
is finally within my reach.

241
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:23,166
It's mine! I won't
let it slip away!

242
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,375
It's all right.

243
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,833
I knew about
this... All of it.

244
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,000
I've known
from the start.

245
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,041
You see, you two
aren't the only ones

246
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,250
with access to
Security Line 606...

247
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,125
No!

248
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,333
...nor are you the only
ones with the ability

249
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,333
to absorb
and reflect.

250
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,750
Thank you...

251
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:50,333
Thanks for helping us. But
I guess this is goodbye...

252
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,375
We're just
shadows, really...

253
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,625
Disposable puppets Alv
created in your image,

254
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,125
so she could continue
to absorb your powers.

255
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,416
You could say our lives were
built on "borrowed wisdom."

256
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,291
They were never
meant to last...

257
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,125
But, you-

258
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,708
Understand,
Éclair...

259
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,833
the Global Union Charter
strictly prohibits

260
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,833
the creation of
clones such as these.

261
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,958
The law is very
clear in this matter.

262
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,250
They cannot be
allowed to exist.

263
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,166
Chief
Eclipse!

264
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,916
My advice to you
now is to forget

265
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,541
that they ever existed
in the first place.

266
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,000
After all,

267
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,291
something that doesn't exist
can't be judged, correct?

268
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,583
La Muse's
prototypes...

269
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,791
Number 1 is Clio...
Number 2: Terpsichore.

270
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:49,208
Number 3: Erato. Then Euterpe,
Thalia, and Polyhymnia!

271
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,833
All of you must
leave now.

272
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,833
But to help you on your way, I
present you with these ships.

273
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:58,833
I trust you
will use them

274
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,791
to make the most of
what limited time

275
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,666
you might have
in this life.

276
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,916
Good luck,
ladies...

277
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,666
They'll be just fine.
After all, they're us.

278
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,000
And look how
we turned out.

279
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,916
Chief
Eclipse...

280
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,333
Éclair... I want
you to know-

281
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,708
It's all right. I think
I understand now...

282
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,166
You did what you had to.
We can leave it at that.

283
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,916
Now things are really
getting interesting...

284
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,416
I'm sure the Global
Union Council

285
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,416
will have more than a few
words to say about all this...

286
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,625
A new day. A chance
to start a new life.

287
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,625
But time does
not stand still.

288
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,125
In the blink of an eye, the
future becomes the present,

289
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,666
becomes the past...

290
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,208
Next time on Kiddy
Grade: Lost / Days.
