1
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:04,958
Care to share
your thoughts

2
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,208
on the completion of
the Atlas Project?

3
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,500
Could you tell
our viewers

4
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,583
your plans for tomorrow's
launching ceremony?

5
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:24,583
It's unbelievable...
How massive it is...

6
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,208
Yes. The
Atlas-class

7
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,583
intergalactic
spaceship, Deucalion...

8
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,333
Total length:
Sixty-three thousand,

9
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,875
fifty-eight
kilometers...

10
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,416
With an indefinite fuel supply,
independent warp capability,

11
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,333
and even a state-of-the-art
terraforming facility.

12
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,500
I'm aware of
what it is...

13
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,333
What it's for is
another matter.

14
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,583
This ship represents everything
we've accomplished as a race.

15
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,916
It's human kind's
crowing achievement.

16
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,291
Man has built a machine
with the powers of a god.

17
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,875
Human kind? You mean
the Nouvlesse, right?

18
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,708
You make it sound like
they're somehow separate

19
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,375
from the rest
of humanity.

20
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,083
The Nouvlesse are a
different breed...

21
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,583
They're
Earthlings.

22
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,750
Sure is coming
down out there...

23
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,750
It certainly is...

24
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:35,083
"Lightning"... Well, how 'bout
that. Just like my name, huh?

25
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,166
So it would
seem, yes.

26
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,000
That looks
so tedious.

27
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,708
Tedious, but
necessary.

28
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,083
After all, even if I
can't use my abilities,

29
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,583
I still need to know
this information

30
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,833
to do my job
properly.

31
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,583
Lumiere...

32
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,750
Okay,
that's it...

33
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,375
Next time, we're using
a nanomist shield.

34
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,166
Or an
umbrella even!

35
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,333
Oh, come on!

36
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,708
Do we really need to dissolve
every single molecule that-

37
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,208
Can I...
help you?

38
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't play
dumb with me!

39
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,833
You still owe us some
serious payback, Lummi!

40
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,541
Payback?

41
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,916
Sorry if this comes
as a surprise...

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,041
But evasion tactics are
one of my specialties.

43
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,000
Hey, Viola! Just
let it go, okay?!

44
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,541
Your choice: We can do
one million dinners...

45
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,083
or we can go out for
three million lunches.

46
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,583
But they're all
your treat, got it?!

47
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,958
That sounds fair...

48
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,583
I mean it, Lummi! One
million! I'm not kidding!

49
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,958
This office is a bit more
luxurious than your old one...

50
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,625
You've done well
for yourself.

51
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,833
I'm not sure what
to tell you...

52
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,833
Besides, we have more
important matters to discuss.

53
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,541
Yes, I understand you've
given the siblings

54
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,125
the all-important task

55
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,750
of carrying the champagne for
tomorrow's launching ceremony.

56
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,416
That's right. Those two
will serve as my eyes.

57
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,166
Then does that
make me your ears?

58
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,375
Information is a
valuable commodity.

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,250
[Eclipse]
In which case,

60
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,333
I believe I've already
paid you more than enough,

61
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,750
thanks to
your partner.

62
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,083
[Armblast] Nothing
gets by you, does it?

63
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,708
[Armblast] Well, then. As
I'm sure you are aware,

64
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,875
the Atlas Project was
largely financed

65
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,833
by the G.U. itself. And its
publicly declared intent

66
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,500
placed it under the
direct oversight

67
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,250
of the G.O.T.T.'s
Development Bureau.

68
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,500
There it is, in
all its glory.

69
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,625
That big hunk of metal
just cost the Global Union

70
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,000
a couple hundred years'
worth of its general fund.

71
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,166
Not to mention the thousands of
corporations, financial groups,

72
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,916
and planet-states
that have their assets

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,333
tied up in
this ship.

74
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,541
There's a lot
riding on it...

75
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,333
No. Actually, it's a
fairly safe investment.

76
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,750
The Deucalion should more
than pay for itself, right?

77
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,875
Planetary development...
That's the key.

78
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,875
With its terraforming
capabilities,

79
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,541
the Deucalion will
be able to produce

80
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,250
whole worlds of
prime real-estate

81
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,666
in a relatively short
amount of time.

82
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,500
Aren't they worried about
over-saturating the market?

83
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,000
...but it's not
what it appears.

84
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,916
As its name would suggest,
the Deucalion is an ark.

85
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,000
[Council A] Has the Council
reached a consensus?

86
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,500
By show of hands, all
those in favor...

87
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:52,458
Very well. Let the record show
that, by unanimous decision,

88
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,541
Chevalier d'Autriche is hereby
dismissed from the post of

89
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,875
Global Union
Minister of Finance,

90
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,875
and relieved of his duties
as G.O.T.T. Secretary.

91
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,458
Personally, I'll be
glad to be rid of him.

92
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,208
Yes... d'Autriche has caused
us nothing but

93
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,416
trouble from the start.

94
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,000
We put this off
for far too long...

95
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,166
The completion of the Deucalion
marks the perfect opportunity

96
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,333
for us to drop our
excess baggage.

97
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,041
Perhaps you're interested
in taking over his position?

98
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,333
Please... You
must be joking.

99
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,208
I have no intention of
getting my hands that dirty.

100
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,666
Yes? Come in...

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,708
I'm sorry it took
so long, Chief.

102
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,583
I have the records
you requested.

103
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,750
That's all right.
Thank you, Vendredi.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,416
[Armblast]
Records?

105
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,375
[Eclipse] A complete accounting
of the G.O.T.T.'s affairs,

106
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,166
from the
top down.

107
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,458
Interesting... Are you sure
I should be seeing this?

108
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,833
Well... you're used
to sticking your nose

109
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,666
where it
doesn't belong.

110
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,666
What can I say?
It's my job.

111
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,541
So, if you
don't mind...

112
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:09,833
What do we have here? Corporate
bribery, judicial tampering...

113
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,833
Several payoffs to regional
government officials,

114
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,375
illegal market
manipulation -

115
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,000
and that's just
the first page.

116
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,000
You've been busy
here at the G.O.T.T.

117
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,625
Actually, the events
you describe...

118
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,875
they are the actions of one
man, working behind the scenes.

119
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,250
One man?
You mean...?

120
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,333
So...
You two...

121
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,708
You don't sound too
happy to see us.

122
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,000
I thought we agreed to
restrict our communications

123
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,541
to Security
Line 606.

124
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,833
So we did. But today we're
acting as messengers.

125
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,166
We've come to inform
you that, moments ago,

126
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,041
the Privy Council
unanimously voted

127
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,833
to remove you
from office.

128
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,333
You are hereby
relieved of your duties

129
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,416
as the Global Union
Minister of Finance

130
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,708
and G.O.T.T.
Secretary.

131
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,166
Is that a fact?
How unfortunate.

132
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,708
I've grown
rather accustomed

133
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,208
to the view from
up here. Though...

134
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,416
I can't say
I'm surprised.

135
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,791
At least...
not like I was

136
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,041
when I learned that the two
of you were still alive,

137
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,708
and that I wasn't
your only employer.

138
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,708
Old fool... I
work for myself.

139
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,333
But I am willing to
play the part of puppet

140
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,166
if it gets me
what I need.

141
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,125
That's very
clever of you.

142
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,708
I couldn't have said
it better myself.

143
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,500
How could all of
this go unnoticed?

144
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,291
It just doesn't
seem possible...

145
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,875
Not unless other high-ranking
G.U. officials were involved.

146
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,333
Which would then imply
that these crimes

147
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,250
were committed
by the G.O.T.T.

148
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,083
with the sanction
of the Nouvlesse...

149
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,458
That is an accurate
assessment.

150
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,541
I don't understand. If
you've known about this-

151
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,458
There is a vast
difference

152
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,000
between knowing
about something,

153
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,333
and being able to do
anything about it...

154
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,708
Isn't there?

155
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:07,541
Of course. My apologies.
So, why give this to me now?

156
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,500
You don't mean-?

157
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,000
It's incredible,
isn't it?

158
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,333
What is?

159
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,083
This new office. The
exterior may look the same,

160
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,208
but the internal systems have
been upgraded significantly.

161
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,875
We now have direct access to
every network on Aineias.

162
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,375
Wow, so with your
ability, you can-

163
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,958
No, I'm afraid I still
can't do much of anything.

164
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,500
Well, then we'll just have
to get that new body of yours

165
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,083
back to normal,
won't we?!

166
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,791
Yes, but how?

167
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,208
So, that was your whole
point in coming here?

168
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,083
To tell me I've
been fired?

169
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:54,875
Mostly... Except I was hoping
I'd get to tell you in person!

170
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,083
Were you now? Well,
it's the same result...

171
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,375
This is a reliable
security line.

172
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,750
I assure you, the
reception is quite clear.

173
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,000
Why you...! Where
are you?! Tell us!

174
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,375
I think not. You don't
need to know right now,

175
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,458
but you'll find
out soon enough.

176
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,666
Actually, there is
one more thing...

177
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,041
We want
the key!

178
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,166
The key entrusted to you as
the head of the G.O.T.T.!

179
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,541
Give it back, and then
make yourself scarce...

180
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,833
You'll find that you'll
live a lot longer.

181
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,791
Tell the Council... I am
no longer their puppet.

182
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,500
I believe we've
made the wishes

183
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,166
of our client
exceedingly clear.

184
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,333
Indeed.

185
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,250
Consider
yourself warned.

186
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,041
I wonder if this is the last
time I'll ever see this view.

187
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,916
Lumiere?

188
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,166
Is something wrong?

189
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:47,291
Nice to see you...
Éclair. Lumiere.

190
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,416
Me- Mercredi?

191
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,000
Where have you been all
this time?! I thought-

192
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,333
Well, I... I didn't
know what to think.

193
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,708
After all the
commotion around here,

194
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,708
when I heard you'd
turned up missing-

195
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,791
You could've at least
called me or something!

196
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:05,666
I'm sorry... so much has
happened since then...

197
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,750
So, that's a new
look for you, huh?

198
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,041
If you hadn't
said anything,

199
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,875
I wouldn't have
recognized you!

200
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,958
You've changed quite a bit
yourself since I saw you last.

201
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,666
Yeah... I guess a lot's
happened to us, too.

202
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,541
Right,
Lumiere?

203
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,291
Anyway, why don't we find
somewhere we can sit down

204
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,750
and talk for
a while?

205
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,375
I wish I could. I only came
in to deliver a message...

206
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,375
Oh. Well, okay.

207
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,416
So what's the deal? You
sure are acting strange...

208
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,041
Am I
really?

209
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,750
You're telling me you didn't
notice anything unusual.

210
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,708
You mean with Mer? Well, sure,
I mean she looked different...

211
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,666
I'm not merely talking
about outward appearances...

212
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,208
According
to this data,

213
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,708
Mercredi was removed from the
employee registry, since...

214
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,583
since it was unclear whether
she was alive or dead.

215
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,000
So, in terms
of access,

216
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,208
she should be treated
as a general visitor.

217
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,375
And yet, somehow, she managed
to enter the building

218
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:12,083
without passing by us
at the reception desk.

219
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,333
You don't think there might
be something to that?

220
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,250
You won't
find her.

221
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,916
Besides... didn't you think
her messege was interesting?

222
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,250
"Go to the Chief's
office immediately!"

223
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,041
What are you
two doing here?

224
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,583
Yes?

225
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,000
Excuse me, Chief.

226
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,583
ES Members Éclair and
Lumiere are here to see you.

227
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,541
Very well.
Send them in.

228
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,500
Terribly sorry, ladies. But
I'm afraid I was here first.

229
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,041
So that's it...

230
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,500
Wh- what is
all this?

231
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,250
It's a little glimpse
at what the G.O.T.T.'s

232
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,500
really been up to
behind the scenes.

233
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:11,500
Like they say, "the
truth hurts." Right?

234
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,833
Chief Eclipse!
How could you?!

235
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,250
No, Éclair! Read
it carefully!

236
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,625
Each of the things
listed here was done

237
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,250
under the direction of
the G.O.T.T. Secretary,

238
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,791
not the Chief.

239
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:37,125
The G.O.T.T. Secretary? You
mean he... he did all this?

240
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:42,625
That's right...
Chevalier d'Autriche.

241
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,708
Bye!

242
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,458
All right! See
you tomorrow!

243
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,000
It's a shame,
really...

244
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,250
School
lets out,

245
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,666
and the children have to
go rushing off to work.

246
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,541
They don't have
to, they want to.

247
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,583
This might be their
only chance...

248
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,083
I mean... they'll have plenty
of homework to keep 'em busy

249
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,125
once school's in full swing.
And it's gettin' there!

250
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,791
It certainly is.

251
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,875
The Rosenfeld Foundation's
done so much for us.

252
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,166
It just goes
to show you,

253
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,458
not all of the Nouvlesse
are bad people.

254
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,583
Even so... we can't
let our guard down.

255
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:47,500
Well, it's a good thing we
have you to look out for us.

256
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,500
Hey,
Bateau!

257
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,791
Do you mind if I go
ahead and call it a day?

258
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,166
Timothy! I didn't know
you were still here.

259
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,083
That's all right, Tim!
Go have some fun, okay?

260
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,083
Thanks!

261
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,041
Master Timothy, I do hope
this is the last time

262
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,208
you'll
do this.

263
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,708
What with your
schedule and all...

264
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,458
Sorry... We're just gonna
have to make the time.

265
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,833
I wanna keep coming back
until that school's finished.

266
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,791
So, what's next?

267
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,708
I've got that dinner with
the Prime Minister, right?

268
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,333
Yes. Immediately
following which,

269
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,708
you have a meeting
with the leaders

270
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,166
of the Trade
Union. After that,

271
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,791
we will be relocating
to the second continent.

272
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,500
At Oh-Nine-Hundred
hours local time,

273
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,041
you are scheduled
to appear before

274
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,666
the Financial
Board of Trustees,

275
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,083
where they will be submitting
the first of the Fair Trade

276
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,208
Éclair...

277
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,250
This planet is going
to be all right...

278
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,166
Thanks
to you,

279
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,666
Aure will
finally be free...

280
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,500
This is most
inopportune...

281
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,916
Just as we rid ourselves
of one little nuisance,

282
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,625
another one
rears its head.

283
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,625
I take it you are referring
to the Rosenfeld Group.

284
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,125
They were expelled
from this Council

285
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,708
as of our last meeting,
were they not?

286
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,416
Still, further
reprimand is justified.

287
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Nouvlesse who have lost
their pride as Earthlings

288
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,916
are even worse
than commoners.

289
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,083
Granted, but even if
they continue to aid

290
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,708
the anti-Nouvlesse
movement,

291
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,000
it changes
nothing.

292
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,916
With enough time, they'll
spread their influence

293
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,875
throughout the galaxy
and foul everything...

294
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,666
Including our
precious Earth, here.

295
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,666
Isn't that why we've
built the ark?

296
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,541
Isn't that what the
Deucalion is for?

297
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,333
Even so, it's still
distasteful...

298
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,333
In the end, it
means retreating...

299
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,875
Surrendering the
galaxy to them.

300
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,750
There's nothing that can
be done about that now.

301
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,583
Or would you prefer
we destroy them all?

302
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,250
It would be
simple enough.

303
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,208
But such barbarism, I
leave to the commoners.

304
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,500
We are
above them.

305
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,916
As pureblooded
Earthlings,

306
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,041
it is our duty to
remember that fact.

307
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,833
A phase
fluctuation?

308
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,041
Tweedledum... Run a
perimeter sweep, level 5.

309
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,166
I'm on it.
Initiating sweep...

310
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,416
It's a canceller! A small ship,
on approach to the Deucalion!

311
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,000
Can you
I.D. it?

312
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,958
Negative! I'm
losing the signal!

313
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,750
It just...
disappeared.

314
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,875
[Control] Attention,
G.O.T.T. vessel.

315
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,666
You are entering
restricted space.

316
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,666
You have not been cleared for
approach to the Deucalion.

317
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,916
Break off your present
course immediately.

318
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,833
Our ship has detected
an irregularity.

319
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,791
Requesting permission to
approach and investigate.

320
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,708
Negative. I repeat: discontinue
your present course at once!

321
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,583
The Deucalion!
It's powering up!

322
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,208
No, that's
impossible!

323
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,375
[Council B]
The Deucalion!

324
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,625
[Council H] But how?!
This can't be happening!

325
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,000
[Council D] There's
only one person

326
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,500
capable of
starting it up...

327
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:58,125
[Council C] Stop it! Stop
the Deucalion at all costs!

328
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,416
When a man wields
tremendous power,

329
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,000
he will appear in
the eyes of others

330
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,916
as a god
or a devil.

331
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,958
However, there is no one who
can truly know his heart.

332
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:37,958
Next time on Kiddy Grade:
Demolition / Titan.
