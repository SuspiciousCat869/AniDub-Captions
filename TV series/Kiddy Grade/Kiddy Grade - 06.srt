1
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,291
Hey. Relax.

2
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:26,416
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
for flying B0L flight 9216,

3
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,625
non-stop to
Planet Satyros.

4
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,833
We are currently
approaching the orbital rim,

5
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:34,083
and will be passing through the
deceleration field momentarily.

6
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,791
Please remain seated until we
have completed our descent.

7
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,833
Look, we made it this far.
Nothing is going to happen, ok?

8
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,333
This is unit three
five, reporting in.

9
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,833
Initial check is
negative, over.

10
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,750
Yes, I'm
afraid so.

11
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,291
I don't know how
but they managed

12
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,083
to get the ratification
draft. We failed.

13
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,416
It just doesn't
make any sense.

14
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,833
Clear.

15
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,541
So all the passengers
are clean, huh?

16
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,500
It certainly
appears that way,

17
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,625
and it's exactly the
same M.O. as before.

18
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,208
Amazing.

19
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,916
How can someone steal something
in a shuttle full of passengers

20
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,125
and then just walk
past our screening?

21
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,916
I don't know. But this
is the eighteenth case.

22
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,583
Nineteenth. We've got
to do something fast.

23
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,916
We can't
do that.

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,125
What?
Why not?

25
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,208
Satyros is a
planet of commerce.

26
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,625
And this spaceport
is a major hub

27
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,291
for shipping and transit
routes from all over the galaxy.

28
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,541
You don't seem to realize
how many spacecraft

29
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,916
arrive here
in one minute,

30
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
much less an
entire day.

31
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,708
There's no way
we could stop--

32
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,666
Excuse me.

33
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,625
We're not asking you that
you stop the flights,

34
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,000
just check them.

35
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,125
A simple pre-flight screening
should be enough to-

36
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,375
What's the
difference?

37
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,458
The G.O.T.T. will
just have to realize

38
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,916
we're already doing
everything we can.

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,791
Eh...
but uh...

40
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,375
It's alright.

41
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,458
The G.O.T.T. does realize that,
which is why they've sent us.

42
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,166
We've collected data from
every planet, state, business

43
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,291
and vessel that
uses this spaceport,

44
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,083
which should provide
some useful clues

45
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,125
as to how these robberies
are perpetrated.

46
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,875
Now it's a simple
matter of transporting

47
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,000
a hard copy of this
data to Aineias,

48
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,541
where it can be
properly analyzed

49
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,708
at G.O.T.T.
headquarters.

50
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:52,083
Uhhh, you mean you're
G.O.T.T. agents?

51
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,291
E.S.
members!

52
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,625
That's correct.
ES Member Dextera.

53
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,333
And Sinistra,
at your service.

54
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,791
Well, I guess
that settles it.

55
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,125
We don't have anything
to worry about now,

56
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,916
not with these
two on the case!

57
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,083
But thank you
for all your help.

58
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:19,291
Control tower,
this is UAS 0003.

59
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,541
Pre-flight systems
check is complete.

60
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,791
Engines prepped and
ready for launch.

61
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,750
Requesting final
clearance for departure.

62
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,333
UAS 0003, you have
been cleared for take-off.

63
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,916
Please proceed to
linear shaft number six.

64
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,125
So, those are
the E.S. Members?

65
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,791
Yes, but there's no
way we can stop them.

66
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,958
If the G.O.T.T.
analyzes that data,

67
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,083
they'll have no problem tracing
the robberies back to us.

68
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,958
Let them go.
They're just decoys.

69
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,500
Our operatives
discovered the data

70
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,875
is actually being carried
on a commercial flight.

71
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,291
That'll make things easier.
This might just work.

72
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,458
Wait! We're going to steal
from G.O.T.T. agents now?

73
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,625
Don't worry. These are just
two low-level members.

74
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:05,458
Getting the jump on the
G.O.T.T. would be remarkable.

75
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:12,208
Ok. Then it's all
settled. Let's go.

76
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,625
Would you hurry? We have
to check in! Miss Montague!

77
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,125
Hello,
Miss Montague?

78
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,125
Éclair
Montague! Hey!

79
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,791
Oh, sorry about
that Miss Padushka!

80
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,416
I need you
to focus.

81
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,958
Our mission is
very important.

82
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,541
You see, the ES Members
are just a decoy.

83
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,791
We are the ones
carrying the data.

84
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,125
I've got it
inside this case.

85
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,750
Oh, I get it! That's
a perfect plan!

86
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,708
Try not to
tell everyone!

87
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,250
Look, I know
up until now

88
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,666
you've been just
a receptionist,

89
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,958
but they've given you
a big responsibility.

90
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,291
So... so
straighten up!

91
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,666
Okay. Do you feel all
right, Miss Padushka?

92
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:11,583
What? Well... well
of course I'm all right!

93
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,750
I mean, I have been
an S.O. Member

94
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,791
for over seven
years now, you know!

95
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:20,250
And besides that,
Miss Montague...

96
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:24,625
It's, um
Mrs. Padushka.

97
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:28,291
Really? Oh, that's wonderful!
And he's very handsome!

98
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,083
My husband happens
to be commander

99
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,958
of C-force's
third detachment.

100
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,250
And yes, he
is very handsome.

101
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,625
But enough of this,
Miss Montague.

102
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,791
We've got to
check in. Come on!

103
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,458
Yes Miss, uh...
Ms. Padushka!

104
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,875
Huh?

105
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:51,250
Well, Mrs. just sounds so
old, and you're so young.

106
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:55,375
It doesn't matter what you
call me. Let's just check in.

107
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,375
She's pretty high strung
for an "S.O. Member."

108
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,458
Ok, just need
to check your bag.

109
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, no. Please this
must be carry-on!

110
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,125
All right, in that case I just
need you to fill out a form.

111
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,333
So, if you wouldn't mind
getting up off the floor.

112
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,375
Yes,
of course!

113
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,708
Sorry about
this.

114
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,291
You see, there's been a
rash of burglaries lately.

115
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,541
We can't be
too careful.

116
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,000
Um, right.

117
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,333
Oh, please!
I'm in a hurry!

118
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,708
Where can I find
flight BNL 3522?

119
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,916
You're just
in time.

120
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,333
They're making the final
boarding call now.

121
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,083
Go around the corner
and down to Gate 82 A.

122
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,333
Thank you,
sir.

123
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,541
The...
the case!

124
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,291
Ms. Padushka.

125
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:58,000
Miss Montague! Oh, I've
made a terrible mistake!

126
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,583
[Éclair] It's called
"distract and snatch."

127
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,875
One person gets
your attention

128
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,708
while the other
steals your stuff.

129
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,916
It's an old con
but it still works.

130
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,958
Thank you so much,
Miss Montague!

131
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,625
Say, would it be ok
if you called me Éclair?

132
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,916
It just isn't
so formal.

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,916
Thank you
then, Éclair.

134
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,916
Your baggage
request, ma'am.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,125
Oh right.
Sorry.

136
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,375
Excuse me sir, I
have something, too.

137
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,458
I see. You'll be carrying
cargo as well, huh?

138
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,666
Yes sir.
That's right.

139
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,791
I'll get
the form.

140
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:43,083
[Pilot] Control tower, this is
BOL 3600, non-stop to Aineias.

141
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,208
All systems are
green for launch.

142
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,833
Now requesting final
departure clearance.

143
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,250
Ma'am, could I
stow your luggage?

144
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,833
What? Oh no,
I can't!

145
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,291
I keep all my travel
sickness medication in here!

146
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,416
[Lumiere] Looks like
they're finally taking off.

147
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,125
Don't you think that we
should be following them?

148
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:15,333
Are you that concerned?
You follow her then.

149
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:19,208
But if you'll excuse me,
I have my own work to do.

150
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:50,041
You're not worried about
Éclair? That seems a bit cold.

151
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:54,000
I find it's best not
to get too attached.

152
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,750
Because you're
afraid of losing her?

153
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,833
Oh, I think
that's it.

154
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,541
[Flight-Attendant]
Good morning passengers.

155
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,458
We have now entered
the orbital rim.

156
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,958
And in just 23 minutes we'll
be arriving at the warp-gate.

157
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,458
[Flight-Attendant] The captain
has asked that you please

158
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,708
remain in your
seats at this time,

159
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,666
with your seatbelts
securely fastened.

160
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,833
Thank you for chosing
BOL Space Shuttles.

161
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,541
Now please, sit back and
enjoy the rest of your flight.

162
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,375
Are we
there?

163
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,083
We just left!
Please be still!

164
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,791
Thank goodness everything
went off without a hitch.

165
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,041
Look I'm
sweating here!

166
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,375
Well, you do seem
a little tense.

167
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:44,666
Oh, I guess I am tense.
I must be getting old.

168
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,000
But Ms. Padushka!
You're very young.

169
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,125
It's ok.

170
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,125
Y'know, the truth is this
is the first big job

171
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,666
entrusted to me
in seven years.

172
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,791
And it's also
the last one.

173
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,125
Why's that?

174
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,500
I told Gluck,

175
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,833
Gluck's my husband,

176
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,958
I told him that's what
I wanted and he agrees.

177
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,458
After this I'm
going to resign.

178
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,750
GOTT will be a
thing of my past.

179
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,916
Why are
you leaving?

180
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,750
Well,
congratulations!

181
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,416
Thank you. You can see
why I want this mission

182
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,375
to succeed
without inci--

183
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,708
What's
that?

184
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,333
My nano-mist?

185
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,500
Oh! It's some
kind of gas.

186
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,166
Sleeping gas from
the air vents!

187
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:21,166
Get ready. Obviously they
weren't fooled by the decoys.

188
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,291
S-Stand
back, Éclair!

189
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,125
Y-You are obviously
the criminals

190
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,291
who have been victimizing
this spaceport.

191
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:41,041
Well, I was sent here to
end your cycle of crime.

192
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,916
You will not take
what is in this case!

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,500
Oh,
boy.

194
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,833
Hehe...
Right.

195
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,291
Get up!

196
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,250
Oh uh, Nano-mist
shield, expand!

197
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,291
St-Stay where you are!
Don't come any closer!

198
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,833
Uh, retreat!

199
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,000
Now! S-Surrender and put
your hands in the air!

200
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,333
It's ok now, Ms. Padushka. You
must have scared them all away.

201
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,916
Huh? What? How...
How'd I do that?

202
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,958
I guess they couldn't get
through your shield. Good job!

203
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,833
Thank goodness! I have no
idea what I would've done

204
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,125
if they had
gotten through.

205
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,625
Someone's still
flying the ship.

206
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,208
The gas should've
affected them too,

207
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,458
unless they were
prepared to neutralize it.

208
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,916
You think the
pilot's in on it?

209
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,083
Looks
that way.

210
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,250
Wait!

211
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,458
So they probably
weren't expecting us

212
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,458
to neutralize the gas
with our nanomists!

213
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,916
Uh...
okay.

214
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,625
--And so that means we have
the element of surprise!

215
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,458
--Oh, no.

216
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,291
Come on!

217
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,500
Uh, yes,
Ms. Padushka!

218
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,250
Hold it!

219
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,708
Very
nice.

220
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,708
Y'know, this is the first
time I've used this thing.

221
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,500
Works well
doesn't it?

222
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,041
Ms. Padushka,
listen!

223
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,916
You're gonna have
to take the controls!

224
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,250
[Ms. Padushka] Mayday!
Mayday! This BOL 3600!

225
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,125
We have been attacked
by serial robbers!

226
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,291
We managed to
frighten them off,

227
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,083
but unfortunately the
pilot was in on it

228
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,416
and had to
be detained.

229
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,041
He and the co-pilot both
are currently unconscious!

230
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,125
There's no one left to
fly this ship now but me,

231
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,416
and I'm just one
of the passengers!

232
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,125
Mayday! Mayday!
Come in! Mayday!

233
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,125
Éclair! They're
not responding!

234
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,625
What?
Where'd she go?

235
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,625
And at a time
like this!

236
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,583
TA-DAH!

237
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,791
Wait a sec. Their ship!
It's an Orbital Police Cruiser!

238
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,625
You mean they're
the robbers?

239
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,708
Éclair!
Come in!

240
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,333
Ms. Padushka?

241
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,833
Just stay where
you are! Hang on!

242
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,416
Oh, no!

243
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,833
Ms. Padushka,
good job!

244
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,125
Oh great,
more troops.

245
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,833
What's this? Controls
aren't responding!

246
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,125
[Commander] They
know who we are!

247
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,166
We've got no choice
but to eliminate them.

248
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,375
Make sure it seems
like an accident!

249
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,166
Looks like these guys
are playing for keeps.

250
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,625
All right then, if that's
the way they want it.

251
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,500
Okay, Donnerschlag.
This is your cue!

252
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,708
Please straighten
out! Come on!

253
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,541
What now?

254
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,125
Right! Let's show
'em how it's done!

255
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,666
It works!

256
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,208
[Éclair]
Round two!

257
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,833
Little brat!

258
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,000
Now I've
got you!

259
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,416
Oh no!

260
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,000
Donner,
hang on!

261
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,708
C'mon!
Where is it?

262
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,583
Let's see
you dodge this.

263
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,541
Oh, there.

264
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,666
Die!

265
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,333
What is that?

266
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,458
[Sinistra] Sorry
we're a little late.

267
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,083
[Dextera] Did we
miss the party?

268
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,000
[Éclair] Oh no, you
guys are right on time!

269
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,041
Well, that's
a relief.

270
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,291
[Sinistra] You'll
be happy to know

271
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,666
that their base is being
raided right about now.

272
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,750
[Sinistra] As it turns
out the criminals

273
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,333
were just a small faction
of the police department.

274
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,583
They were very clever
in the way they operated.

275
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,125
In addition to
the sleeping gas,

276
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,958
they manipulated acceleration
and deceleration velocities

277
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,791
to give themselves
more time to work,

278
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,833
not to mention the pay-offs
they made to the pilots.

279
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,125
There were
actually a few cases

280
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,625
where the victims
themselves were in on it,

281
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,416
cases of insurance
fraud, and the like.

282
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,875
But, all of this isn't
really important right now.

283
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,458
The important thing is,
they've been stopped.

284
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,250
Thank you
very much.

285
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,291
If the two of you hadn't
arrived when you did,

286
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't know what would
have become of us.

287
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,625
No, we should
thank you.

288
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,166
If you hadn't been
so conspicuous

289
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,750
drawing them to
the shuttle,

290
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,958
we might not have
tracked down their base.

291
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,291
You mean to tell me
that the whole time

292
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,500
we were risking
our lives,

293
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,791
we were
the decoys?

294
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,750
It's called
"distract and snatch."

295
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,166
It's an old technique,
but effective.

296
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,416
Oh, boy. I think I'm
gonna pass out now.

297
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:44,458
Hey, Ms. Padushka!
Ms. Padushka!

298
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,541
Thank you everyone! And
thank you especially, Chief!

299
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,041
We're the ones
who are grateful!

300
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,291
You cracked a very big case
and on your last assignment!

301
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,833
Unbelievable!

302
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:04,125
Remember you are always welcome
back here, Mrs. Padushka!

303
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,833
Thank you, sir. Thank
you all, very much!

304
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,541
You know, Éclair,
without your help

305
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,708
I would not have
ever succeeded.

306
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,000
Thank you!

307
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,125
But a girl your age
shouldn't be so reckless.

308
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,875
How are you ever
going to find a husband?

309
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,708
A lady should be more
elegant. You know?

310
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,500
[Ms. Padushka] Still,
you're pretty sharp.

311
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,666
Keep it up, and you might

Do you leap over them?
Do you avoid them?
