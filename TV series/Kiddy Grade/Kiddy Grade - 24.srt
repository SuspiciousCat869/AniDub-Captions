1
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,541
Ta-daa!

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,541
[All]
Éclair!

3
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,958
That's
impossible!

4
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,875
The reception
chamber!

5
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:47,583
Just for that... I'll
wipe you all out at once!

6
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,541
Nice to see you back out
in the field, Chief...

7
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,833
Thanks, but... all I've
managed to do is get your

8
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,833
dog-fight bridge
destroyed...

9
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,666
As long as you and
Wirbelwind are still safe,

10
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,708
that's all
that matters.

11
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,208
Oh, Lummi... is
that really you?

12
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,541
Yes, it's me, Viola....
We're all here.

13
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,375
I'm sorry if we
made you worry.

14
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,791
What's
going on?

15
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:27,333
What happened to your body?
And how'd you come back?

16
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,083
You know I cried when I saw you
get turned into particles...

17
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,541
And there's
your answer.

18
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,625
My primary ability is not
"Puppet", but "Particle"...

19
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,291
In addition to the
flow of electrons-

20
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,625
In addition
to electrons,

21
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,125
she can control every
type of quantum particle.

22
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,916
It's a
G-Class ability.

23
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,166
I'd heard rumors that
such a power existed...

24
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,416
but until now, I never
believed they were true...

25
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,250
Cesario...

26
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,750
Unfortunately, it's
quite draining...

27
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,291
Are you
all right?

28
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,500
We've lost the starboard
flex-phaser...

29
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,625
Our total power output
is down, over 35%!

30
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:23,916
[Éclair] Viola? Cesario?
Viola! Cesario! Say something!

31
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,125
Let me know you're
still there!

32
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,625
[Alv] Another
G-Class ability?

33
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,958
Even if it
is true,

34
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,125
what good can it do in the
hands of a mere human?

35
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,833
It's nothing
compared to me now!

36
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,791
The fading light of a person's
life as they pass away...

37
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,083
At times
like these,

38
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,958
the sight of it is
enough to make me regret

39
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,083
that I have
this ability...

40
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,333
Tell me
about it...

41
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,958
We're really not
going to get involved?

42
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,375
The only way the galaxy
will ever know the truth

43
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,791
of what happened
here...

44
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,625
is if someone
lives to tell it.

45
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,250
This is hard
for him.

46
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,416
I know in his heart,
he's dying to help...

47
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,333
Sinistra...
Sinistra!

48
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:16,541
Dextera... Glad to hear
you're still in one piece...

49
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,916
Sinistra!

50
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,875
So then... does anyone have any
requests for their epitaph?

51
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,250
Stop this, Alv!

52
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,333
I didn't realize you were
still alive, Éclair...

53
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,041
Please, Alv... You and
I are so much alike.

54
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,500
Don't make the same
mistakes I made.

55
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,083
How dare you?!

56
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,666
What gives you the right to
compare yourself to me?!

57
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll kill you for
even thinking it!

58
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,791
When I was human, all my
life consisted of was pain!

59
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,916
Suffering!
Humiliation!

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,208
I'll never go
back to that.

61
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,416
I'm going to take
the Nouvlesse.

62
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,375
I'm going to take the
miserable little planet

63
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,625
that spawned them.

64
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,333
And I'm going to
destroy them all!

65
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,208
It... may be hopeless
at this point.

66
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,833
No, it's not.

67
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,833
You'll find my daughter's weak
point is still her left side...

68
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,458
The blast this ship
reflected back at us that day

69
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,041
nearly
killed us.

70
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:38,000
My injuries were mainly to my
right side. Alv's to her left.

71
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,750
We survived, but we were
both left without feeling

72
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,333
in half
our body...

73
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,666
[Lumiere] So aboard
the Deucalion,

74
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,791
the reason she stopped
attacking at one point...

75
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,083
That's right. Even with all
the power of her new "body".

76
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,541
Her mind still remembers
the old body's scars...

77
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,750
Are you sure
you're up to this?

78
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:00,916
I think so...

79
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,500
Please... You're wasting
your time, human!

80
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,416
Why isn't
it working?

81
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,750
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,166
It seems I still haven't
recovered enough power...

83
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,958
Donner... We need
your help up here.

84
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,250
Éclair, I hope you
know what you're doing.

85
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,708
Lumiere needs power, and well,
that is my ability, right?

86
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,958
Here's
the plan:

87
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,583
we're going to use
Calliope's reception shield

88
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,458
to absorb my
"Power"...

89
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,875
Once that's done, Wirbelwind
will act as a converter

90
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,625
and send it back
to Lumiere...

91
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,458
Have you lost
your mind?

92
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,958
Listen,
Éclair...

93
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,833
You do understand what
could happen to you

94
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,541
if you actually go
through with this?

95
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,375
Unless you two have
a better idea,

96
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,791
this is our only
chance to stop her...

97
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,750
And besides...
It's me!

98
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,333
I'm the ES Member who
never dies, remember?

99
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,583
Good luck,
girls...

100
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,333
[Éclair] Okay! Donner's
ready, too! Let's go!

101
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,541
Their shields are
completely down!

102
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,458
A malfunction? Or are
they up to something?

103
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,291
Shields are cut. You have full
reception system power...

104
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,291
We won't survive
a direct attack.

105
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,500
[Éclair] It's all
right, Eclipse.

106
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,416
I have of faith in
your piloting skills.

107
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,458
I wish I could
say the same...

108
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,000
It doesn't matter what
you're planning...

109
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,125
Without your shields, how do
you expect to withstand this?!

110
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,958
Oh no... I can't
avoid that!

111
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,458
Your ship will
be vaporized!

112
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,833
And with it, the last reminder
that I was ever born human!

113
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,583
We won't make
it in time!

114
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,333
It's the C-Squared...
Oh, Tweedledee!

115
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,458
Hit the
eject!

116
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,291
Do it! Éclair!
Lumiere! Hurry!

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,083
What?!

118
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,666
Is it over?

119
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,166
Oh no...
not yet.

120
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,583
You want my left
arm so badly?

121
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,666
Fine! Then take
it. It's yours...

122
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,791
I'll just make
a new one.

123
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,291
Don't just
sit there!

124
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,166
Are you trying to give her a
chance to repair herself?!

125
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,000
We're right behind
you, Chief...

126
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,250
Can you
make it?

127
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,916
I better... you're pretty
useless without me.

128
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,583
Well, Éclair... You really
did it this time, huh?

129
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,125
I hope it was
worth it.

130
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:40,416
Thank you, Éclair.. I promise
we won't let you down...

131
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,916
Amazing, how quickly
time can pass...

132
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,291
Has it already
been so long

133
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,208
since we put the
Deucalion incident behind us?

134
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,625
Superintendent General.
What a pleasant surprise.

135
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,625
Even so. No matter
how much time goes by,

136
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,083
I doubt anyone in
the galaxy will

137
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,458
ever forget what
happened that day,

138
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,125
or in the
days since...

139
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,916
Éclair, no...

140
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sorry,
Éclair...

141
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,208
What are...
you doing?

142
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry, but...
I have to go.

143
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,125
But before I leave all
of you... a gift...

144
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,375
I've never used this power
on anyone other than Alv.

145
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,791
"Transmission"...

146
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:27,000
It's a reversal of her
"Absorb" abilities...

147
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,875
Éclair,
you're alive!

148
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,666
You
made it.

149
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,833
T- Ta-daa...

150
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,541
Oh,
Éclair!

151
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:10,541
Th-Thank you. Thank you
for saving... my mother.

152
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,083
You're
welcome...

153
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,416
I hope you
don't mind...

154
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,208
I just need to borrow a bit
of your energy, Wirbelwind...

155
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,625
With this...

156
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,041
I'll be able to stay with
my daughter until the end.

157
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:15,250
Mother?
Mother...

158
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,875
Mother!

159
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,500
Mother's
here now.

160
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,458
I promise I'll never
leave you again, Alv.

161
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,291
Look, son. You
see? That's Earth.

162
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,958
That's the place where all of
us humans first started out.

163
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,041
See how blue and
pretty it is?

164
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,416
Yott, is... is that really
it? That's the Earth?

165
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,583
Sure is... Just like the
pictures in my textbook.

166
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:05,125
Mother...
É- Éclair?

167
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,625
I'm right
here... son.

168
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,041
Will you
smile for me?

169
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,333
Time for a
shift change.

170
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,791
I thought I was about to
die of boredom in here...

171
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,291
Don't
complain.

172
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,916
I'm not sure you'd want any
excitement on this watch...

173
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,458
Never thought I'd live to see
the day when us "commoners"

174
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,958
would pass through the
gates of the G.U. Senate...

175
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,833
It definitely feels like
the start of a new era...

176
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,625
Sir Isaac! I just want to
thank you for everything

177
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,125
you and the
Rosenfeld Foundation

178
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:17,458
have done for all of us.
You're a great man, sir...

179
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,000
[Chairman] As its first
order of business,

180
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,166
this Council will
launch a full inquiry

181
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,583
into the details
surrounding

182
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,041
the construction
and intended use

183
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,083
of the
Atlas-class

184
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,166
intergalactic
spaceship Deucalion,

185
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,583
and into the
current whereabouts

186
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,666
of those most
directly responsible.

187
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,000
At the same time, a new
Global Union charter...

188
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,333
[Eclipse] Yes... so much
has happened since then...

189
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,666
[General]
Unfortunately,

190
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,750
my committee schedules
here have changed again,

191
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,500
so I'm afraid I may have to
put my visit off even further.

192
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,000
[Eclipse] I'm sorry
to hear that.

193
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,125
But I understand.
You're very busy.

194
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,958
[General] Yes, well, I
feel it's important

195
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,458
that someone
remain here

196
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,750
and represent the late G.O.T.T.
Secretary's final wishes.

197
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,750
After all, he had such great
visions for the future,

198
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,791
and for the
G.O.T.T...

199
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,083
I'm afraid I have to get
to another meeting...

200
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,500
But it's been a pleasure
talking to you, Chief.

201
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,083
You wanna live in the past
forever?! We've got work to do!

202
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,500
That's why your eyeballs are in
the front of your head, people!

203
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,125
So you'll keep
moving forward!

204
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:18,958
Yes,
ma'am!

205
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,458
His skin is
so soft!

206
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,375
Don't be shy... It's
okay to pick him up.

207
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,583
You just have
to be careful

208
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,750
until he can hold his
head up on his own.

209
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,375
Is that
your baby?

210
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,791
Oh, no. We're
just visiting.

211
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:43,333
He belongs to a friend of
ours. His name's "Chevalier".

212
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,541
Pleased to meet
you, Chevalier.

213
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,791
Is that your baby
girl? She's cute.

214
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,291
Oh, thank you...

215
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,458
Did you hear that? She
thinks you're cute, Éclair!

216
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,333
I know... Everyone
tried to tell us

217
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,375
it's an unusual
name for a girl...

218
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,833
But we really
wanted to name her

219
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,458
after this nice young
lady who helped us...

220
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,666
We like it just
fine, don't we?

221
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,041
It's such an exciting
time, isn't it?

222
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,916
To think that when
these children grow up,

223
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,416
the fact that there
were once people

224
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,708
like the Nouvlesse
in the galaxy

225
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,500
will just be
an old fable.

226
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,000
There you are. They said it
was time to come get you...

227
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,333
Uh, Ma'am? Do you ever
get, you know... nervous?

228
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,708
Most of the people
you'll talk to

229
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,208
are here for the
first time...

230
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,541
Chances are, they're pretty
nervous themselves...

231
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,166
Just relax and
put on a smile,

232
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,166
and you've got the biggest
part of the job covered...

233
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,708
Right. "Relax and
smile". Got it.

234
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,208
You know, when I
was in school,

235
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,375
my social studies class took
a tour of the G.O.T.T.,

236
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,625
and while we
were here

237
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,333
this group of cyborgs
attacked the lobby...

238
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,666
Really?

239
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,000
When it
happened,

240
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,625
it was one of the girls
behind the reception desk

241
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,666
who jumped out
and saved us.

242
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,666
That's the day I decided
to join the G.O.T.T.

243
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,333
Excuse me...

244
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,041
I wonder if you'd point
us in the direction

245
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,916
of the Branch
Management offices?

246
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,958
Yes, sir! I'd be glad to! Just
follow the main hall here...

247
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,291
All right, that's
it for your shift.

248
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,583
It's time for E-Shift...
Ready, Éclair?

249
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,250
I'm ready...
Let's go, Lumiere.

250
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,083
And so, even today... 
I continue the fight...

251
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,916
But my biggest battle
is with myself...

252
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,750
With the memories that
still sometimes haunt me...

253
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:26,791
I won't let myself repeat the
mistakes of my past any more.

254
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,500
I'm going to
keep fighting...

255
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,708
so I can protect the
promise of the future.
