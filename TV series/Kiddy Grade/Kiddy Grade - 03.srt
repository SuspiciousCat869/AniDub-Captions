1
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,208
[Éclair] Taaa-daaah!

2
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,875
Under our authority as
G.O.T.T. ES Members,

3
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,708
we hereby charge you as
being in direct violation

4
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,208
of interstellar law!

5
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,416
Okay, Chief..

6
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Requesting authorization
to make an arrest!

7
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,708
Now listen up!

8
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,791
You are all being held
for extradition...

9
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,166
The central
galactic authorities

10
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,375
may recognize your right to
an attorney... I don't!

11
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,125
Inspector...

12
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,125
[Armblast] So, we finally
have Drake Han.

13
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,750
We've been after him for a
long time. Congratulations.

14
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,000
[Éclair] Yeah, well he
almost got away.

15
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,333
I hate coming this far
out into the Frontier.

16
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,125
What good is the
element of surprise

17
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,291
when getting an
arrest authorization-

18
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,375
Hm...?
Éclair?

19
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,000
-takes this long!

20
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,208
Yes, I can see
how the time lag

21
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,791
would be a
minor inconvenience

22
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,333
But the mission is still a
success... is it not?

23
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,833
So far, perhaps.

24
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,333
But we still have to transport
the prisoners to Borgall.

25
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,500
Éclair. Lumiere.
Good work, you two.

26
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,875
I'll be looking
forward to your safe return.

27
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:25,875
[Both] Thanks, Chief!
Understood!

28
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,875
[Station Announcement] This
is the final boarding call

29
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,166
for commuter shuttle
two-zero-one,

30
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,250
bound for Talkoon-B. All
remaining passengers,

31
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,875
please proceed
to gate 32.

32
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,166
Repeating: Final
boarding call...

33
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,000
[Inspector] Han and his men are
to be transported from Colce

34
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,125
to the Central Galactic
Judiciary Offices for trial.

35
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,208
However, Han's doctors
have informed us

36
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,708
that he cannot
be disconnected

37
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,458
from his bio-mechanical
apparatus. Which means,

38
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,375
you won't be able to carry
him aboard your ship.

39
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,166
That's a bulky
way to travel..

40
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,333
It's taller than the
La Muse's payload deck.

41
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,541
What's all that
stuff for, anyway?

42
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,000
Han may have little fear
when it comes to the law,

43
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,875
but it seems... he's
still afraid of death.

44
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,625
All that stuff is a
life-support system

45
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,583
to keep his
body from failing.

46
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,666
Why doesn't he just get
cybernetic enhancements?

47
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,250
He's preserving his purity
as an Earth-born human..

48
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:20,916
Or, so he claims,
at least...

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,666
As you can see, I've
already made arrangements

50
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,416
for the use of
another ship.

51
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,583
What?
That one?

52
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:31,458
An AP-D330 Armored Destroyer.
It does seem a bit extreme.

53
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,500
Compared to what
you're used to, perhaps...

54
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,083
But the Frontier
is no place

55
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,125
for children and
their toys...

56
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,916
I'm sorry
Wirbelwind...

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,166
The La Muse's hull
is just too slim.

58
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,708
We may not be
together in body..

59
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:10,625
but we will
be in mind.

60
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,166
Be careful, you dolt! This
is delicate equipment!

61
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,833
If you so much as
scratch the paint,

62
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,833
I'll sue your department
into the ground! Got it?!

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,708
Are you done yelling?
Or can I finish my scan?

64
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,708
How dare you take that tone
with me?

65
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,541
Don't you know who I
am? I am Drake Han!

66
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:39,000
I can have you thrown off
the force with a word!

67
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,416
Right, right...

68
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,541
Will you and your men be
coming with us, Inspector?

69
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:48,916
It's the only way to be
sure the job gets done.

70
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,083
What happened? Did you say
something to upset him?

71
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,333
Don't know... But,
anyway... How's the La Muse?

72
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,500
She's fine..

73
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,708
It's not as though
we're abandoning her.

74
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,375
Wirbelwind understood.

75
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,416
[Crewman A] Proximity cordon,
3-by-3, clear!

76
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,333
No enemy
targets detected!

77
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,541
[Éclair] There've been a
lot of new faces

78
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,458
around headquarters
lately, haven't there...

79
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,833
Are you sure about
this, Armblast?..

80
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,750
Please, put my
mind at ease...

81
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,916
Is something
wrong?

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,958
[Inspector] These two...
These ES Members...

83
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,375
They're part of the
G.O.T.T.'s shadow unit,

84
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,541
are they not? I've
heard the stories.

85
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,666
I don't condone
illegal activities,

86
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,666
even in the name
of of justice.

87
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,500
To say nothing of whether or
not these children are fit

88
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,208
to serve as agents
of the law...

89
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,166
[Armblast] You're wrong
to call their activities

90
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,250
illegal, Inspector.
They're extra-legal.

91
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,833
And as to their being
children, well...

92
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll just say I trust them
more than most adults.

93
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,416
Pardon my skepticism,

94
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,666
but if the G.U. places so
much faith in these girls,

95
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,583
why have they sent
an auditor along

96
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,833
to supervise
their actions?

97
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,625
Actually, if they were
under my supervision...

98
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,500
both of them would
probably be considered

99
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,583
S-Class wanted
criminals by now...

100
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,916
As though we can't hear
what they're saying...

101
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,916
Attention.
Attention.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,166
Departure schedules for Warp
Gate transit routes A-04

103
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,166
through H-21 have been
delayed due to an accident.

104
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,166
All ships bound for
central galactic regions

105
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,375
via these routes are
requested to enter

106
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,083
[Éclair] What are
they talking about?

107
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,750
[Inspector] This sort of
problem isn't entirely uncommon

108
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,541
out here. Our departure
has been slightly delayed.

109
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,958
That's all...

110
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,166
It's nothing for us to be
alarmed about just yet...

111
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,250
Or are you concerned
you'll be late

112
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,541
for your favorite
TV show back home?

113
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,666
Now hold on! I never
said that!

114
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,750
My only concern is getting
these prisoners to Borgall!

115
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,708
If anything
happens to them-

116
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,875
What's on your mind?

117
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,375
We need to
keep moving..

118
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,916
We shouldn't let ourselves sit
in one place for too long.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,458
I say we try taking an
alternate route to Borgall,

120
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,958
even if
it's longer.

121
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,458
That's not a
good idea...

122
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,958
I say it is!

123
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,791
And as the G.O.T.T. member
responsible for this mission-

124
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,541
[Inspector] I'm
against it.

125
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,458
As the commanding officer of
the Colce force, I say no.

126
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,833
It would be unwise to alter
our route at this point

127
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,333
without
proper planning...

128
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,208
That's precisely the
sort of rash decision

129
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,583
the Insurers will be
waiting for us to make.

130
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,666
Insurers?

131
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,125
[Lumiere] I think
I've heard of them.

132
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,000
They're a criminal group
that specializes in

133
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,625
raiding prisoner transport
ships. Isn't that right?

134
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,083
[Armblast]
That's right.

135
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,541
[Armblast] What they offer
is a sort of life insurance

136
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,500
for the underworld. In exchange
for a certain premium,

137
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,291
they will agree to free
you from the authorities

138
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,041
in the event of
your capture

139
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,333
by any
means necessary.

140
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,916
It's best not to
take chances..

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,041
We're already in enough
danger as it is...

142
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,333
[Station Announcement]
Attention. Attention.

143
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,750
Now updating departure
schedules for Warp Gate

144
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:43,250
transit routes
A-04 through H-21.

145
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,375
As of 23:20
Galactic Standard Time,

146
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,333
Uh... Where are you
going, Inspector?!

147
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,250
We're getting nowhere
talking over the monitors!

148
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,333
I'm going to straighten
this out face to face!

149
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,375
Stay at
your posts!

150
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,875
Yes, sir!
Understood!

151
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,375
It's not so bad. Only
three more hours.

152
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,708
And that's
three more hours

153
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:13,291
we'll be easy prey
for the Insurers!

154
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:17,000
Excuse me, sir..
Care for some coffee?

155
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,458
É- Éclair... what-?

156
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,166
No thank you. I
don't drink coffee.

157
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,125
'Kay... tea?

158
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,041
Fine.
Some tea.

159
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:36,583
Inspector... you don't
like me very much, do you?

160
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,875
We're both
professionals.

161
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,916
Our personal feelings
shouldn't matter.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,916
Well, I just thought as long
as we're working together,

163
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,666
it'd be nice if
we got along.

164
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,833
The only thing we have
to do is our jobs.

165
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,000
This isn't a
sightseeing tour.

166
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,625
No, but don't you
think it's possible

167
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,000
to do your job and enjoy
yourself at the same time?

168
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,875
I suppose it is...
for some.

169
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,583
Thanks for the tea... I'm
going back to the ship.

170
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,541
Hey, Inspector,
wait a second!

171
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:15,416
I haven't
finished my tea yet!

172
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,583
See, uh...

173
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,791
The inspector lost
his wife and daughter

174
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,750
a few
years back...

175
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,666
He was
working a case,

176
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,875
and one of
the suspects

177
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,791
decided to
make it personal...

178
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,250
Ever since then,
he's been-

179
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,125
[Inspector]
Smith!

180
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,791
That's quite enough!
Don't get the wrong idea.

181
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,000
My past has no bearing
on my present duty..

182
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,708
I live by the
letter of the law...

183
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:42,291
And I punish
those who don't.

184
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,750
You'll probably think I'm
naive for saying this,

185
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,541
but it's always
been my belief that

186
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,250
the main purpose of the
law was to protect people,

187
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,416
not punish them.

188
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,500
You know?

189
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,541
Sir! I'm picking up
multiple targets! Incoming!

190
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,416
The Insurers?

191
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,000
My line of sight's
obstructed...

192
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,833
I can't
get a shot!

193
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,458
What's wrong?

194
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,791
They're in the beam
cannon's blind spot!

195
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,208
I can't
get a lock!

196
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,416
What was that?

197
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,708
I'm afraid I don't have a clue.
The enemy units, sir...

198
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,708
they all just
blew up!

199
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,083
They what?

200
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,333
[Lumiere] My
apologies...

201
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,541
I was a bit slow in
dealing with them...

202
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,166
We okay?

203
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,750
The ship's armor
is still intact,

204
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,916
but I'm
afraid the paint

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,500
may have been
scratched a little.

206
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:08,875
Uh... The
paint's been-

207
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,208
What are you doing?
After the mothership!

208
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,791
[Crewman] It's... already
been secured, sir...

209
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,583
59AP-325-8775:
cleared for departure.

210
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,500
Please proceed
to Warp Gate.

211
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,333
[Escourt Ship Captain] Okay.
This is as far as we go.

212
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,458
Once you're
past that gate

213
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,125
you'll be out of
our jurisdiction.

214
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,916
Best of
luck...

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,791
Thank you, Captain.
And good work today.

216
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,166
I'll expect your
incident report

217
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,125
on my desk
when I return.

218
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,291
That's it then. From here
on out we're on our own...

219
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,416
Let's just
hope the Insurers

220
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,041
don't have
anything else in store-

221
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:55,291
[Warp Gate Controller]
Course field is clear!

222
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,791
AP-D330 Destroyer,
on approach.

223
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:04,458
I'm picking up a
mass-fluctuation...

224
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,208
Wait. Cancel that. It's
just within parameters.

225
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,875
What are you doing?!
On to the next one!

226
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,333
Yes, sir! Sorry sir!
Course field is clear!

227
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,875
[Crewman C]
Warp-in complete.

228
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,916
Countdown to
Warp-out commencing.

229
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,916
Okay, we're
almost there.

230
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,166
Less than three
hours to go...

231
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,541
We're not
there yet.

232
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,000
Crewmen, run a status
check. Check all stations.

233
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,791
Yes, sir... Running
status check.

234
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,708
Condition green.
One-hundred percent.

235
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,291
How's it goin'?

236
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,625
Thirty seconds,

237
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,375
and this ship'll be blind
as a thousand-ton bat.

238
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:15,375
Come on. You'll need this...
It's not much, but it'll do.

239
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,000
You're kidding.
You're the insurers.

240
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,375
That's
right... heh,

241
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,250
We moonlight as cops
to make ends meet.

242
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:26,666
Wait a second...?
That's odd...

243
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:32,125
Excuse me.

244
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,083
Well, well, well..

245
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,750
That's a handy
piece of work..

246
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,333
Looks like someone's been
busy severing key circuits

247
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,791
all over
the ship...

248
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:40,625
But who...?

249
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:44,541
Wirbelwind...

250
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,666
How could my men
betray me like this?

251
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,166
Like I've always
said, Inspector:

252
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,916
just when you think
you know somebody...

253
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,416
Smith!

254
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,666
Good. As long as you're
using these old things,

255
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,833
I won't have to
call Lumiere.

256
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:12,791
Get down!

257
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,708
Were you
worried about me?

258
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,000
Now's not
the time!

259
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,916
Heh...
Thanks, Inspector.

260
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,250
[Guard]
Come on! Fall back!

261
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,125
We need to get to
Han and the others!

262
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,166
Hold it!

263
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,958
How are you,
Smith? You okay?

264
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,666
It stings a
little bit, but..

265
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,333
I'll be alright...
I'm sorry.

266
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,125
Hang in there...
Take care of him!

267
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,125
Yes, sir!

268
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,833
All right!
Let's go!

269
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,708
So you've been lying
to us this whole time...

270
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,458
That all depends on
your point of view,

271
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,708
now doesn't it.

272
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,166
See, what some
might call...

273
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,708
a cleverly concealed
weapons system..

274
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,833
I call life support.

275
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,958
What do you
think you're doing?

276
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,166
Oh... Nothing.
Killing two birds...

277
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,333
Now that you are technically
free from the authorities,

278
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,750
your contract
with the insurers

279
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,708
has been
fulfilled...

280
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,208
And so... as long as
our business is done,

281
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,375
we have
another client

282
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,250
who's taken out a
contract on your life.

283
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:28,666
Who...?
Who did this...?

284
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,166
It was Red.
Wasn't it.

285
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,250
But he's been long
since taken care of...

286
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,500
Sorry. I
can't say..

287
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,000
But
you understand..

288
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,250
We have a duty to
protect our client..

289
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,958
Even if that client
does happen to be dead...

290
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,708
Looks like your life
support equipment

291
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,291
isn't working
too good...

292
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,000
But then again,

293
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,458
I suppose that all depends
on your point of view...

294
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,166
Now what
is this?!

295
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,375
She's alive...

296
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:08,333
Seems there's more to her
than meets the eye...

297
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,166
[Crewman C] Countdown to
warp-out complete!

298
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:11,916
Warp-out
initiated!

299
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,375
[Éclair] Oh, great.
Where are all the stars?

300
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,916
Looks like they
shot us even farther

301
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,833
out into
the frontier.

302
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,500
[Crewman A] Sir!
Picking up multiple targets!

303
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,125
We're
completely surrounded!

304
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,625
[Inspector] The Insurer armada.
They've been waiting for us...

305
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,000
[Armblast] Yes. They probably
expected their agents

306
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,083
to be in control
of the ship.

307
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,708
But, seeing as how
that isn't the case,

308
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,458
my guess is they'll want
to start shooting soon...

309
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,000
Can you raise
the shields?

310
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:50,666
All the circuits
have been cut!

311
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,250
One of their ships
just exploded!

312
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,708
And
another one...

313
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,500
No need to apologize,
Wirbelwind. We're alright..

314
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,500
They only managed to
shake us up a little bit.

315
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,708
There's no
real harm done.

316
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,041
Whatever it is,

317
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,333
I'm not getting any new
readings on the sensors...

318
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,625
I think it's
using a Canceller!

319
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,875
All right, Lumiere!
Really let 'em have it!

320
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:37,916
Like she said,
Wirbelwind.

321
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:50,416
Like she said,
Wirbelwind.

322
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,541
You mean that
was... your ship?

323
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,916
I don't know how
you got her

324
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,500
into the Warp
Gate with us,

325
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,625
but that was a
killer trick!

326
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,166
A lady should
be more elegant.

327
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,833
[Inspector] We just
received a transmission.

328
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,333
It seems the
Insurers were blackmailing

329
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,083
one of the Warp
Gate controllers.

330
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,666
They were threatening
to harm his family

331
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,250
unless he sent
us out here...

332
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,958
But you... You're
completely healed.

333
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,208
If I didn't
know better,

334
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,000
I'd say you've had
a few illegal enhancements

335
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,833
made to
your body...

336
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,333
And does that mean you
think I should be punished

337
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,541
for breaking
the law?

338
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,083
Well, I suppose in
this particular case..

339
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,291
it's worth making
an exception.

340
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,208
Okay, then.

341
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,666
We'll take Han the rest of
the way in the La Muse.

342
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,291
I doubt I really
need to say it,

343
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,875
but Be careful..
After all,

344
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,208
the Frontier's no
place for children.

345
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,208
You're not
worried, are you?

346
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,666
Well, of course
I'm worried-

347
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,541
for any poor fool who
tries to stop you!

348
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:15,625
Thanks a lot
Inspector...

349
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,208
You know, if you
offered to pay me...

350
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,208
say, twice what you
paid the Insurers...

351
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:34,916
I might be convinced to
untie you and let you go...

352
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,833
But since you're not
saying anything...

353
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,791
I guess I'll just have to
take your silence as a 'no'

354
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:43,208
Oh well.. Forget
I mentioned it.

355
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,333
Hey! Just a minute! Come
back here! Hey! Hey!! 

356
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:49,708
Come on! Hey,
come back!

357
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,250
[Éclair] The heart keeps
beating. Minute after minute.

358
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:29,583
Hour after hour. And though
it may speed up at times,

359
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:33,250
it can never stop... The
word stop means death.

360
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:37,625
Next time on Kiddy
Grade: High / Speed
