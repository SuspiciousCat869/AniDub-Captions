1
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,208
We scrap in order
to rebuild.

2
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,500
We destroy, so that we may
create anew from the rubble.

3
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:04,750
Throughout
human history,

4
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,375
the cycle has repeated
itself time and again.

5
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,958
As a race, we've learned
to rebuild entire worlds...

6
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,000
But we still can't heal
our hearts and souls.

7
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,958
Not by ourselves... That's
why we have each other.

8
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,500
Then there's hope. After
all, you still have me.

9
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,375
And don't forget, you
will always have me.

10
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,333
You're
unbelievable...

11
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,333
Even after everything
that's happened,

12
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,333
you think you're just
going to settle right back

13
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,500
into the same
old routine?

14
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,416
How quickly
you forget...

15
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,916
I haven't
forgotten.

16
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,958
So you say,
at least...

17
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,833
You'll keep the
memories that suit you.

18
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,000
But as always, you'll
lock the rest away,

19
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,166
along with the truth
of who you really are.

20
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,291
I'm done trying
to escape my past.

21
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm tired
of running.

22
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,291
What's the point? No
matter how hard I try,

23
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,833
I always end up back
at the same place.

24
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,333
So from now on, I'll just
save myself the effort.

25
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:33,000
That is what you wanted me
to say? Isn't that right?

26
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:37,041
Yeah... I guess you
finally understand.

27
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,708
So this is the last
I'll be seeing of you.

28
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,166
Now that you've
decided to take back

29
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,541
all of your memories
and abilities,

30
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,125
I'll become more and more
integrated within you...

31
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,541
until, finally,
I fade away.

32
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,708
No, you won't disappear
completely...

33
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,208
We'll both go on
living... but together.

34
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,333
Excuse me...

35
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,791
I'm trying to find the Fair
Trade Offices, Section 3.

36
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,250
Oh, sure! You'll need to take
the first hallway on your left.

37
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,625
Fair Trade, Section 3 is
located in the west wing

38
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,083
of the main
building...

39
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,291
Great idea, Ricki. It's a
perfect day for a picnic.

40
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,750
Isn't it
though?

41
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,291
Hey! This stuff's
actually pretty good today!

42
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:38,041
Oh, what'd you get,
Bonita? I wanna try a bite...

43
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,166
Don't you have enough
on your own plate?

44
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,416
There, see?
No harm done.

45
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,375
I haven't put the
jam on it yet, so...

46
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,916
it's still
all right.

47
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,208
A lady should be
more elegant.

48
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:12,500
Well... At least it's good to
know Éclair is still Éclair...

49
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,041
I was beginning to
get a little worried,

50
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,958
what with the
new look and all.

51
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,750
So'd you get the plastic
surgery done for an assignment?

52
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,625
It's not like
you needed it.

53
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:24,791
I'm jealous! I wish
I were an ES Member!

54
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,750
Cut it out, Ricki!
I'm ticklish!

55
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,958
And wait... if I
didn't know better,

56
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,000
I'd say you got 'em to add
a little bit extra up top.

57
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:37,791
No, that's not how it- Well...
maybe just a little bit.

58
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,125
That's a clear abuse
of your authority!

59
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,125
I've got half a mind to
blow the whistle on you.

60
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,250
Even after all
the trouble,

61
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,208
she's still the
same old Ricki...

62
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,541
Ricky, this
is a bad idea!

63
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,291
Oh, come on. You
look great! Éclair?

64
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,458
Uh-huh?!

65
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,333
Éclair, you look
beautiful! I mean it!

66
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,000
On second thought,

67
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,583
the "same old Ricki"
could mean trouble for me.

68
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,916
But...
then...

69
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,666
With so many of the
same faces around,

70
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,750
even I almost have a hard time
keeping them all straight.

71
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,791
That's for
sure...

72
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,291
We'll be fine as long as
the backup's in place.

73
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,916
Don't get
killed.

74
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:49,125
It's been set to fire since
before we left Aineias.

75
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,000
No, you won't disappear
completely...

76
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:01,083
We'll both go on
living... but together.

77
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,125
Again? Really, Éclair...

78
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,041
That one does
have jam on it...

79
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,625
So what are you
going to do now?

80
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,541
Is it okay for pigeons
to eat that stuff?

81
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,875
They look like
they're enjoying it.

82
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,791
I still haven't completely
adjusted to my new body.

83
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,958
I guess
for now,

84
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,208
that's a bigger problem
than my memories.

85
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,666
Right then,
back to work!

86
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,958
Yeah, I'm sure
Selena and them

87
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,000
are probably wondering
where we are by now.

88
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,375
Bye, guys! Don't
work too hard!

89
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,875
So, should we go take
these dishes ba-?

90
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,458
Are you feeling all
right, Lumiere?

91
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,916
You hardly even
touched your lunch.

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,875
I- It's nothing...
I'm fine...

93
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,291
Lumiere!

94
00:07:54,875 --> 00:08:00,500
Lumiere...?
Lumiere...? Lumiere!

95
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,625
Lumiere!

96
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,291
I'm afraid there's nothing
more we can do for her.

97
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,958
Eclipse...?

98
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,041
She's okay...
Isn't she?

99
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,625
She's okay,
right?!

100
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,958
Éclair...

101
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,708
Just tell me my partner's
going to be all right!

102
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:22,625
I'm sorry... But as an ES
Member, you should understand.

103
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,958
She's not used to
her new body, right?

104
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,166
No... It's
more than that.

105
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,958
In Lumiere's case, her
ability puts her in contact

106
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,750
with a vast amount
of network data...

107
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,625
And combined with the
memories of her past...

108
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,208
It's too much information for
her to process all at once.

109
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,625
But she's always been able
to handle it before...

110
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,375
This shouldn't
be happening.

111
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,708
You're supposed to
be the one in charge

112
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,333
of encoding
ES Members!

113
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,833
Why can't you
do something?!

114
00:09:55,791 --> 00:10:00,500
I wish I could. But even
with my Quandt abilities...

115
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,625
I can't heal
her soul.

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,541
I'm sorry I
snapped at you.

117
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,041
It's alright.

118
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,500
Good bye, Chief...
And good riddance.

119
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,583
[Eclipse] During "Encoding",
we can regenerate the body...

120
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,375
assign
abilities...

121
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,166
but even with all
our technology,

122
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,875
some things are still
out of our hands.

123
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,500
Actually, the most
important thing...

124
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,625
Lumiere...

125
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,500
We've done everything
we know to do for her...

126
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,416
And the G.O.T.T.'s
Quantum Physiology Unit

127
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,666
is the best
in the field.

128
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,875
From this point on, everything
depends on Lumiere herself.

129
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,208
All we can do is
watch... and hope.

130
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,958
Lumiere...

131
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,250
How is it going? The
optimization process...

132
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,333
Tweedledee...

133
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,333
You've always had such
amazing abilities...

134
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,750
It saddens
me greatly,

135
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,000
that you should have to be
punished for it like this.

136
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,875
Be strong,
Lumiere...

137
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,541
I hope you and I will
have another chance

138
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,625
to play in the
virtual sphere...

139
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,666
I'm sorry there isn't
something more we can do.

140
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,000
But if it's
any help,

141
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:42,333
know that our thoughts
are with her... and you.

142
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,125
You beat us pretty good
last time we met...

143
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,500
I'm willing to let
that go for now,

144
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,458
but as soon as your
partner recovers...

145
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,291
I think my sister and I
are ready for the rematch.

146
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,625
Tweedledum...

147
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,333
No, it's all right.
I hope someday...

148
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,208
we can take you
up on that.

149
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,958
Sister...

150
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,458
Yes, I know.

151
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,958
It looks like we aren't the
only ones who are worried...

152
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,833
La Muse... I'm sure I have no
right to ask this of you...

153
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,250
But if there's anything you
can do to save Lumiere...

154
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,833
then, please...

155
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,791
Oh, hello,
Chief...

156
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,333
Just "Eclipse",
please...

157
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,500
I'm sorry I couldn't come
to check on you in person.

158
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,416
How is she doing
this morning?

159
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,583
It's been over a week,
and still no change.

160
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,416
What happens if the
optimization isn't working?

161
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,583
Go on, say
it, Eclipse.

162
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:02,125
She will die. And it will
be a slow, painful death.

163
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:07,375
Éclair... A lady should
really be more elegant.

164
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,416
And there's...
nothing we can do.

165
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,666
I'm sorry...

166
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,083
La Muse!
Come out!

167
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,833
I know you're
there...

168
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,625
Lumiere...

169
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,125
La Muse... or I guess I
should say "Wirbelwind"...

170
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,625
You have to know what condition
Lumiere is in right now...

171
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,791
Her memories are too much
for her new body to handle.

172
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:03,333
If my case was
bad... hers is worse.

173
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,083
She's in so
much pain...

174
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,000
And if this optimization
doesn't work, it...

175
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,583
it's going
to kill her!

176
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:15,875
And there's nothing I can
do! I'm a G-Class ES Member.

177
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,875
I'm a G-Class ES Member,
and I'm so helpless!

178
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:24,666
It doesn't matter how fast I
can move, or how strong I am...

179
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,541
I took back all of my
powers and memories...

180
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,625
but if I can't
save her...

181
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,083
And that's why... I
need your help now.

182
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,666
You're Lumiere's terminal.
You're an extension of her!

183
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,666
You know her mind better than
anyone, even better than I do!

184
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,458
So if there's anyone
who can save her...

185
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,875
Come back,
Wirbelwind!

186
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm using a
9 millimeter.

187
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,875
That means I've still
got thirteen shots left.

188
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,791
I'm sorry, but... when
it comes down to it,

189
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,333
Lumiere's a lot more
important to me than you are.

190
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,541
[Young Lumiere]
Who are you?

191
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,958
Éclair...
Just "Éclair".

192
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:06,791
"Éclair"... That's
an unusual name.

193
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,166
So I've
heard...

194
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,250
Another whole
city, wiped out...

195
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,583
If there's
one thing

196
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:29,291
Earthlings have always
been good at, it's war.

197
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,708
Maybe so... But
this isn't Earth!

198
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,791
So you're the Quandt we've
been hearing about...

199
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,208
I didn't really expect
you to be a woman.

200
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,916
I don't like this,
Éclair. Watch out!

201
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,750
[Buyer] What the-? She's
some kind of monster!

202
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:10,125
I'm the monster? I'm not the
one shooting at little kids!

203
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,208
Don't worry, you're
in good hands.

204
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,666
You sacrificed
yourself to save me?

205
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,916
But the Three Laws
of Robotics...

206
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,875
they're just
a program!

207
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:42,333
I think it's time we gave
you a name. Let's see now...

208
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,833
How does
"Wirbelwind" sound?

209
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,083
It's only
fitting

210
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,083
you should have the most
elegant body in the galaxy...

211
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,500
Right,
Wirbelwind?

212
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,291
Such a detestable
assignment...

213
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:06,541
That's it. It's time...
Aren't you going to fire?

214
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,750
No. I can't do this...
Not of my own free will.

215
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,916
I knew that you
would say that...

216
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,541
I only wish I
could do the same.

217
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,500
Hands in the air...
Away from the console.

218
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,541
It's no use.

219
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:25,875
No...

220
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,000
I can never forgive
myself for this...

221
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:39,833
It's been set to fire since
before we left Aineias.

222
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:46,625
No... I mustn't let myself cry.
For Éclair's sake... and mine.

223
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,000
I have to lock
this inside.

224
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,833
[Lumiere]
That's not true...

225
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,500
Where am I?

226
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,041
You've done enough.

227
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,500
You don't have to carry these
painful memories any longer.

228
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:15,083
Open your eyes... And
leave the past behind.

229
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,583
You still have the
entire future to face.

230
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,125
The entire
future...?

231
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,958
What's
happening?!

232
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,583
You're
awake!

233
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,750
Éclair...

234
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,250
I remember...
the optimization.

235
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:08,041
This... This
is... This is...!

236
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,250
Oh, yeah, that...
Wirbelwind gave it to me.

237
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,750
I hope you don't mind, I had to
give it to you mouth-to-mouth.

238
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:23,208
[Lumiere] You wasted
the entire bottle!

239
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:29,875
Why, Wirbelwind?! How could
you?! Answer me, Wirbelwind!

240
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,625
Hey, what's
the matter?

241
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,458
I- I'm not sure...

242
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,041
My power... It
seems to be gone.

243
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,083
There are some doors
that, once opened,

244
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,916
can never be
closed again.

245
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,833
And sometimes, the
fate of mankind

246
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,416
hangs on the turn
of a single key.

247
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,666
Next time, on Kiddy
Grade: "Nouvlesse/Ark"
