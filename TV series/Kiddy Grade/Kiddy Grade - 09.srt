1
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,208
[Man] Welcome
to Green Room.

2
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,708
[Computer] Welcome to Green
Room, the official interface

3
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,083
of the Dardanos
government. At this time,

4
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,916
please state the
reason for your visit:

5
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,708
business,
or personal.

6
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,041
[Man] Uh,
business trip...

7
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,958
So you've come all the way from
Aineias... Quite a long trip.

8
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,916
I must confess, for a
G.O.T.T. inspector...

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,666
you do seem
rather young.

10
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,333
Missing persons?

11
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,666
[Eclipse] As you
know, Planet Dardanos

12
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,583
is one of the galaxy's
major cotton exporters.

13
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,125
Over the last
few years,

14
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,625
key industry leaders on the
planet have been disappearing,

15
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,875
one after
another.

16
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:35,916
[Lumiere]
How many?

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,166
Well, at this
point, all of them.

18
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,666
And their absence is being felt
by Dardanos' trading partners.

19
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,041
These men were
in the midst of

20
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,875
important trade negotiations
when they disappeared.

21
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,291
Ah, let
me guess.

22
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,958
Here's the part where
we come in, right?

23
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,083
I want you to go undercover and
find out what happened to them.

24
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,041
Well, I guess...

25
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,916
that's why I'm stuck with
these lousy assignments.

26
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:03,291
I'm stuck here in this white
room every single day...

27
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,375
Tied to my chair, as it
were... These walls...

28
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,000
You wouldn't believe
the headaches.

29
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,750
Yeah, I can see how the glare
might get to you after a while.

30
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,166
Maybe you can
talk them into

31
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,208
painting it a different color
in here. I don't know...

32
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,000
like, green,
maybe...?

33
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:21,458
Your entry visa is approved...
Welcome, to Dardanos.

34
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,625
[Éclair] You were
right. I should be able

35
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,083
to handle this one on
my own, no problem.

36
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,333
I thought these guys
were supposed to have

37
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,708
the toughest entry
inspection in the galaxy.

38
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,708
They barely
questioned my story.

39
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,208
That's to
be expected.

40
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,166
I doubt they want to
be seen as interfering

41
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,958
with a routine G.O.T.T. audit
of the Dardanos branch office.

42
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,666
[Éclair] Hey, are you
feeling all right?

43
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,625
You don't
sound so hot.

44
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,166
I'm surprised
you have to ask.

45
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,208
Why else would she decide
not to go with you?

46
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,833
Of course she's
not feeling well.

47
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,291
[Éclair] Armblast! Do
you always have to be

48
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,833
so insensitive?!

49
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,833
Sorry... I was only making
an observation.

50
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,083
In any case, we'll
leave this up to you...

51
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,083
Be sure to check
in regularly, okay?

52
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,125
[Éclair]
Gotcha!

53
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,500
Insensitive. Really.
Is that how she sees me?

54
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,625
Well, I for one happen to
think I'm very sensitive...

55
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,375
There sure aren't very
many people out...

56
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,041
That's weird.
What day is this?

57
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,375
Umm...
Tuesday.

58
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,666
Is it a holiday
or something?

59
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,833
Oh, nah. Nothin' like that.
It's just a day off...

60
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,708
The way it works, we get
four days off a week here.

61
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:33,833
Seriously?!

62
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,791
Hey, hey, I got
no reason to lie.

63
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,625
But most off-worlders
are pretty shocked...

64
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,375
I guess you could say
it's governmental policy...

65
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:44,041
Yeah, we like to take
things nice and easy.

66
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,666
I think I'm starting
to get jealous...

67
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,708
What are we listening to?
Is this song popular here?

68
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,041
[Taxi-Driver]
Are you kidding?

69
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,291
It's only about the biggest
hit we've ever had.

70
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,916
It's called Holiday. I hear
it's even made its way onto

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,583
the Galactic Net's
Wonder Song Charts.

72
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,041
It's a little on the
sleepy side, isn't it?

73
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,375
I suppose that's
why we like it.

74
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,083
It sort of captures that laid
back Dardanos vibe, y'know?

75
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,958
I see what
you mean...

76
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,875
[Éclair]
Hello...?

77
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,708
Just a minute!
Be right with you!

78
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,666
(whispering)
Hey, she's here!

79
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,916
What? Already...? Uh! Wait
a second! Give me a hand!

80
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,333
Sorry to keep
you waiting...

81
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,041
We were actually going to
come meet you at customs...

82
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,166
That is 'til this guy went and
made a mess of the office.

83
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,416
So it's
my fault?!

84
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,125
Well, I'm not the idiot
who dumped coffee

85
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,208
in the chimera
tank, now am I?

86
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,750
Quiet! Just
let it go.

87
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,333
I'm sorry. Where
are my manners?

88
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,833
I'm Buchholz,
in charge of

89
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,500
the G.O.T.T. Dardanos branch
office. At your service.

90
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:09,375
And me too! I'm Hors!
This is so exciting.

91
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,416
I never thought
I'd get a chance

92
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,916
to work with a
real-life ES Member!

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,041
Actually... you
think I could get

94
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,750
your autograph
a little later?

95
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,708
Will you cut it out,
already? Act professional!

96
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,708
Look, why don't we just
get down to business.

97
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,833
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to take a break for a while?

98
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,958
No. I'm all
right. Really.

99
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,500
That's
strange...

100
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,708
Far as I know, we haven't
heard anything about it...

101
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,958
You're sure all these important
guys have been disappearing?

102
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,791
Well, that's what I've been
sent to investigate...

103
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,875
You two really haven't
heard anything?

104
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,125
Oh... Actually, there was an SO
member here a few months ago...

105
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,375
There!
See?

106
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,875
Ah, that's right...
I remember...

107
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,125
Sort of a long-haired
fella'. Real nasty type.

108
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,875
Yeah, but he was only
here a couple days.

109
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,250
And he's been
missing ever since...?

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What have you been
doing?! It's your job

111
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,833
to keep an eye out for
things like this, isn't it?!

112
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,708
Hey, we're
sorry...

113
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,208
I really did get stuck with
a lousy assignment...

114
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,375
I still say this is all
just some kinda' mistake...

115
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,000
Well, we're about
to find out.

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,708
Can I
help you?

117
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:25,541
Yes, uh, we're looking for
Mr. Verracio. Is he in?

118
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,333
No, but I'm
Ms. Verracio.

119
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,833
Um, Actually... we were hoping
to speak to your husband.

120
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,750
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,333
This man.
Luc Verracio.

122
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,958
We were told he
owned this estate.

123
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,333
I'm sorry. I think
you've been misinformed.

124
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:51,083
My name is Rita Verracio...
But I have never been married.

125
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:57,041
Here. Take a
look at these.

126
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:01,291
What do you think?
Magnificent, aren't they?

127
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,625
These moth orchids are
a new addition this year.

128
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:13,250
Ah... they just bloomed
this morning... Beautiful...

129
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,708
What's the news? Any
word from Éclair?

130
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,458
No. Not
yet.

131
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,583
You know,
I still think

132
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,500
you should lie down
and get some rest.

133
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,708
It feels like a lifetime's
worth of headaches,

134
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,125
hit me all
at once...

135
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,708
I'm trying to find the
cause of it right now.

136
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,458
You think you'll
be able to?

137
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,083
All I know is, if I
don't figure it out soon,

138
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,916
my head is going
to explode!

139
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,500
[Éclair]
This is it.

140
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,500
[Hors] Come on. Do we really
have to go into this place?

141
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,000
[Buccholz] It's an abandoned
building. What's to see?

142
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,625
[Éclair] This is
where the trail ends

143
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,291
for the SO member who was
investigating this case,

144
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,208
as well as the other
missing persons.

145
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,541
So you think that long
haired fella's in there?

146
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,916
He sent a transmission
to his superiors

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,708
before he disappeared.
His final report said

148
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,250
he was heading here,
to this address.

149
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,333
Hey... why don't
we just give it up?

150
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,750
There's
nothing here.

151
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,166
The SO guy got sick of his
job and quit. Simple as that.

152
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,250
There's no crime
on Dardanos...

153
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,958
That's why we get paid to sit
around at the office all day

154
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,500
and look after
our tropical fish.

155
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:56,375
Then how do you explain all
of these disappearances?

156
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,583
Everyone we talked to today
said the exact same thing.

157
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,583
Those people
never existed.

158
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,708
[Buccholz]
He's right.

159
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sure it's all
just a mistake.

160
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,541
Yes... Let's go back...
It's getting late.

161
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,541
We need to
feed our fish.

162
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,375
Come on. Let's
go back now.

163
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,916
Let's...

164
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,041
Ow! That hurt!

165
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:34,166
Uh... What got into
you all of a sudden?

166
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,291
I... I'm sorry... There's
something about this place...

167
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,083
Something's
not right!

168
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:50,500
Hey...
Wait for us!

169
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,708
Wait for us!

170
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,958
[Éclair] Stop firing!
Relax! They're just rats!

171
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,291
Right, sorry about
that... but, uh...

172
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,500
But what?

173
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,875
Looks like... you're
out of bullets, too...

174
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:46,791
oh...

175
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,333
Verracio.

176
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,000
What do you
think it means?

177
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:57,000
Isn't it obvious? They were
all murdered in this place...

178
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,916
Probably the
inspector, too...

179
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,333
This is the Dardanos
Secret Service!

180
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,583
We have
you surrounded.

181
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,750
Kneel down on the floor.
Hands above your head!

182
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,125
Comply! Or we
will resume fire!

183
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,875
Over here!
In this room!

184
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,666
Now!
Open fire!

185
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:55,125
...what...?

186
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,250
[Radio] All points bulletin!
Suspects are escaping!

187
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,375
Are you two
all right?

188
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,208
[Hors] I'm
good...

189
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,041
[Buccholz]
More or less...

190
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,083
What was that
back there...?

191
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,000
[Hors] Even if I can do
something with this terminal...

192
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,875
What exactly are
you hoping to find?

193
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,500
I wanna know who ordered the
police to come after us...

194
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:35,875
Someone killed those men
for a reason... But why?

195
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:43,041
I'm in. I've
accessed the GHC.

196
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,375
What, is the government
here a bunch of morons?

197
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,916
The Host Computer's
wide open.

198
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,125
There's no security
in place at all.

199
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:55,375
Yeah. I can't believe we
never noticed this before.

200
00:14:55,458 --> 00:15:01,583
Go in deeper. Let's
get some answers.

201
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,166
The GHC. The Government
Host Computer, huh?

202
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,833
It can't be...

203
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,875
Impossible!

204
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,416
We'd better
hurry...

205
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,875
It looks like they've
anticipated our movements.

206
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,208
[Lumiere] There's a
low-level EM pulse emanating

207
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,041
from somewhere on
the planet's surface.

208
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,791
That's what's
causing my headaches.

209
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,375
It's mind
control...

210
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,833
The families of
those missing men

211
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,041
have all had their
memories altered...

212
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,583
That's why they denied
ever knowing them

213
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,708
in the
first place.

214
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,666
It's an extremely
low-frequency signal,

215
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,791
which is why it's able to
pass through our shielding..

216
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,333
They're using it as part
of an encephalomagnetic

217
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,208
field monitoring
system.

218
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,666
Ah, I see. You
mean what they use

219
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,666
to control battle
cyborgs in the field...

220
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,000
But it's strange,
though...

221
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,916
I don't seem to be
feeling the effects at all...

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,458
You're lucky... It must not
affect everyone equally...

223
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,375
But for someone who's
particularly sensitive,

224
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,958
the effects
are extreme...

225
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,375
That's right.
And it worries me

226
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,166
that we haven't
heard from Éclair...

227
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,041
I'm going down
to find her.

228
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,250
I'll go
with you.

229
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,708
That's a
first.

230
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,416
Well, as I'm sure Éclair
would be quick to remind you,

231
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,458
I am particularly
in-sensitive...

232
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,541
That may be a good
thing in this case.

233
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,041
I get it...
They broke free.

234
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,250
Somehow, I think the
businessmen who disappeared

235
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,833
realized their minds
were being controlled...

236
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:29,875
In order to protect
their interests,

237
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,500
they tried to put
a stop to it,

238
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,333
perhaps expose it
to the public...

239
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,416
Which is why they
were eliminated.

240
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,125
But, I don't
understand. Why do this?

241
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,500
[Éclair] Well, it
wouldn't be the first time

242
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,916
someone has tried to develop
a mind control system

243
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,625
to take over
the galaxy.

244
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,041
Now wait... I mean,
this planet is one thing.

245
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,375
But how would they
spread this pulse

246
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,291
through the whole galaxy?!
It's not possible!

247
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,708
I hear this song has
been making its way

248
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,291
up the Wonder
Song charts...

249
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,000
And I don't think that's just
because of the catchy melody.

250
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,791
This is...
This is intense...

251
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:13,166
See, now that proves
it. I am sensitive.

252
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,500
It's getting
stronger...

253
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,500
But if we can trace the
signal back to its source,

254
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:20,041
there's a chance it will
also lead us to Éclair! Eh...

255
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,041
Be gentle.
I'm sensitive.

256
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,583
[Hors] Hey, we've
got company!

257
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,625
So, this encepha-whatever
monitoring system...

258
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,791
Where would they set
something like that up?

259
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,875
The lack of security
on the GHC shows

260
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,875
the government here
is pretty confident...

261
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,208
If I had
to guess,

262
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,916
I'd say they're hiding
it right out in the open.

263
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:43,041
I'm stuck here in this white
room every single day...

264
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,541
Tied to my chair,
as it were.

265
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,958
Maybe you can
talk them into

266
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,500
painting it a different color
in here. I don't know...

267
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,541
like, green,
maybe...?

268
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,166
That's it... I'd
bet my life on it!

269
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:03,458
Gotcha! Hey! Now
you splash me, too!

270
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,000
Let me out of
here! Let me out!

271
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,166
Éclair!

272
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,083
Éclair...
no...

273
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,291
Hands in the air...
Away from the console.

274
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,875
Éclair!

275
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,500
So warm...

276
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,708
Please come back...

277
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,333
So...
warm...

278
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:16,333
Please, Éclair... Come
back... Come back!

279
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,416
I can't bear to
lose you again!

280
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:36,625
There you are... Glad
you could join us.

281
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,583
[Armblast] That should
take care of it...

282
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,583
All that's
left now...

283
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,500
is to recall all
the Holiday copies

284
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,458
that're floating
around out there.

285
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:47,375
You know, I... I feel
better off of a sudden.

286
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:51,208
Yeah... it's like a fog's
been lifted from my brain...

287
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,083
Is that so?

288
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,166
Yes...
Also...

289
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,208
I've received a request from
Éclair for some time off.

290
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,458
Approved...

291
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,625
You can escape your
work for a time, Éclair.

292
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,083
But I fear you won't be
able to escape yourself...

293
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,625
Where ignorance is bliss,
knowledge is a curse...

294
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,500
For even those who have
learned from the past

295
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,916
are sometimes
doomed to repeat it...

296
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,166
Next time on Kiddy
Grade: Rebirth/Slave
