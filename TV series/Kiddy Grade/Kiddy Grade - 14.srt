1
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,041
Status?

2
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,916
Everything is running
smoothly, Chief.

3
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,791
The nanomachines
in the atmosphere,

4
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,750
crust and magma are
fully operational.

5
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,166
Coffee?

6
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,166
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

7
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,958
Looks like the
energy supplies

8
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,250
to the islands
are working fine.

9
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,041
Her atmosphere has already
settled into the Earth model.

10
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,791
Now, if we can
just maintain

11
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,916
the mantle plume's stability
and sustain the plate,

12
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,083
seems as if our
job here is done.

13
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,250
Thanks, Chief.

14
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,250
They say that in a
hundred and thirty days..

15
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,458
They're expecting to
have eighty percent

16
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,458
of the oceans'
water filled in.

17
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,791
But, of course, it'll
still be a few years

18
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,625
before plants can grow and she
can sustain any human life.

19
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,666
That's true, but that's
work for another team.

20
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,791
We'll be long
gone by then.

21
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,333
I doubt we'll have any
reason to come back here,

22
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,125
unless it's
on vacation.

23
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,791
Heh, Sounds
good to me.

24
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,500
We'll certainly
have the time.

25
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,041
Once the new Atlas models
are put into service,

26
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,708
it's going to make
our jobs a lot easier.

27
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,625
Careful, Éclair. You're
upsetting Donnersclag.

28
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not upsetting
you am I, Donner?

29
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,500
But I sure wouldn't blame
you if you were upset...

30
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,166
being on the run and having
to fight your friends.

31
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,166
I guess things aren't
really working out

32
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,416
like you thought
they would, huh?

33
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,708
Does this mean you're
having regrets?

34
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,125
Why should I have any
regrets, Lumiere?

35
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,416
I mean, it's not like I
did anything wrong here!

36
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,583
Well if that's
the case,

37
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,125
then why do you keep
beating yourself up

38
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,791
over something that
isn't your fault?

39
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,416
Here, I have
an idea,

40
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,458
why don't you help
me repair La Muse?

41
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,458
That way we'll be
ready to take off

42
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,458
if they find out
where we are.

43
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,416
But we don't have
any spare parts.

44
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,916
Actually, we
have plenty...

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,041
It's just that
at the moment,

46
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,166
they're scattered
all over the planet.

47
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,208
You didn't think I brought
us all the way out

48
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,333
to this
frontier region

49
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,416
just for the
seclusion, did you?

50
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,250
Right then...

51
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,833
Now let's
get to work.

52
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,208
Thank you.

53
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,375
I don't think I ever
could've made it this far...

54
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,166
not by myself, anyway.

55
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,791
You, Donner, and La Muse are
all I have to keep me going.

56
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,958
This is no time to get
sentimental, Éclair.

57
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,291
We have a
job to do.

58
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,500
There's an unmanned island
about to pass over us.

59
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,458
You're sure we're not gonna
run into anyone up there?

60
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,125
[Lumiere] There should
be a small team

61
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,666
aboard the Central
Command Island...

62
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,041
But since the planet's
surface is still forming...

63
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,708
We're the only ones who
can survive out here.

64
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:58,250
See, there she is. Just like
I told you. Let's do this.

65
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,125
Fine.

66
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,958
Does this really
bother you so much?

67
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,625
Yes, of course
it does.

68
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,291
What? Do you think I should
be happy about this?

69
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:22,458
Sister, if it bothers you...
Maybe you shouldn't do it.

70
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,083
How many times
have I told you-

71
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,791
don't call me 'sister'
when we're on assignment.

72
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,916
Especially not
one like this.

73
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,541
Please forgive me for
what I'm about to do.

74
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:40,458
Donnersclag...
Wirbelwind...

75
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,291
[Lumiere] A terraforming
operation like this

76
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,833
requires an
enormous number of

77
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,958
nanomachines to affect
change on a planetary scale.

78
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,791
These islands
inject the nanomachines

79
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,291
into the environment,
supply them with power,

80
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,291
and relay commands
from Central Control.

81
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,791
Yeah?
So what?

82
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,750
In order to get from
one planet to the next,

83
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,041
the island itself
functions as a spaceship.

84
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,583
Which means we should
find a few parts

85
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,333
that we can
use inside.

86
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,708
I think that should take care
of La Muse for a while...

87
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,625
What? What's
the matter?

88
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,500
A small craft approaching
us at tremendous speed.

89
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:46,916
Determining model...no
time! 3...2...1...!

90
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,125
Donnersclag?!

91
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,583
Donner?

92
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,041
What's wrong
with him?

93
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,166
His AI must have
been tampered with.

94
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,583
How can
that be?

95
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,125
It's supposed to be impossible
to hack into his system.

96
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,791
Wait a
minute...

97
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,958
Who could possibly be
capable of tampering with

98
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,250
Donnersclag's AI system
from the outside?

99
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,083
It's
Tweedledee!

100
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,041
Okay, ladies, I'll come
right to the point...

101
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,541
By order of the GOTT,

102
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,166
your crafts have
been reprogrammed...

103
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,625
They now have only one
primary function...

104
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,708
...And that is to ensure the
destruction of you both.

105
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,458
What're you
talking about?!

106
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,333
No! Not
Wirbelwind, too!

107
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,458
I'm sorry, but I
have my orders...

108
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,916
Under normal
circumstances,

109
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,583
these are not the methods I
would have chosen to use.

110
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,250
La Muse's security
will soon be down

111
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,916
and it's new
program in control.

112
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,083
You have about
five minutes left.

113
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,250
Use that time
to decide

114
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,083
if you're going to
die quietly or fight.

115
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,125
There's one
more thing...

116
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,375
It may
sound selfish

117
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,750
but I would like to ask
for a personal favor.

118
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,750
Please do everything
within your power

119
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,375
to spare
these children.

120
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,041
Very well. Goodbye.
And good luck.

121
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,375
Tweedledee... Do you think
you handled that well?

122
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,500
I mean they can easily
scan your memory

123
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,333
and play back
what you said.

124
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,333
Get that thing
out of my sight.

125
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,916
Tweeledum! I said
get rid of it!

126
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,708
What could the
GOTT be thinking?

127
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,000
It's bad enough
that the Chief

128
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,083
is ordering friends
to kill each other...

129
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,291
but to make me do
something so awful...

130
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:11,166
so disgusting... They've
gone too far this time.

131
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,833
This is the worst mission
I've ever been on!

132
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,458
I don't get it. What
kind of program is this

133
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,875
that has you
so worked up?

134
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,000
The worst kind.

135
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,833
The special assassination
program... Hashish.

136
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,541
[Éclair] Can't you
control him?

137
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,916
[Lumiere] No... Not with
his nanomist shield up.

138
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,208
Even under normal conditions
it would take me hours

139
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,291
to hack into
his system.

140
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,333
I certainly couldn't
do it in five minutes.

141
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,625
It's not like Donnersclag
to keep missing like this...

142
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,000
especially at
such close range.

143
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,333
What are
you saying?

144
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,166
This will buy
us some time!

145
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,166
It seems to me... his
actions are forced.

146
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,458
I don't think the program has
complete control over him...

147
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,583
at least
not yet.

148
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,125
So there's
some hope.

149
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,791
Do you think you might be
able to get through to them?

150
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,708
I might, but it
won't be easy.

151
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,291
And besides, I would
hate to have to

152
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,583
subject them to
my usual methods.

153
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,541
Oh, this is hopeless!
We have to destroy them.

154
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,958
It's either that or
let them kill us!

155
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,500
Well I say...
Neither!

156
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,666
No! Éclair, wait!

157
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,125
Go!

158
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,208
I'll hold off
Donnersclag somehow.

159
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,208
You go take
care of La Muse!

160
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,583
If I can just make it to
the emergency control room,

161
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,458
I may be able to
utilize the nanomists

162
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,583
in the environment
to our advantage.

163
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,666
You'd be easy enough for
me to destroy, my friend..

164
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,875
But don't worry... I'll
find a way to save you.

165
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,000
Come on then... I'm
ready, Donnersclag.

166
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,250
Hey, Chief! You wanna
take a look at this?

167
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,750
A high concentration
of nanomist

168
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,125
has created a
tropical cyclone

169
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,500
on the other side
of the planet!

170
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,625
Impossible!

171
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,166
Wait a second. This
can't be right!

172
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,333
There also seems to be
a massive energy drain

173
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,208
in the airspace
over that region!

174
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,208
Readings from Islands
Alpha through Gamma

175
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,125
show all energy plants
operating at full capacity!

176
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,458
I need an immediate analysis!
Find out what's happening!

177
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,458
The storm is centered
on Island Theta.

178
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,875
I'm measuring a
40-kilometer radius!

179
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,958
[Lumiere] Okay, I've gained
control of the nanomists.

180
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:14,000
I should be able to create
a protective barrier.

181
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,875
Don't worry,
Wirbelwind...

182
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,500
I'll get you back to
normal... somehow.

183
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,208
Just
in time.

184
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,041
I should have known it would
take a lot more than that

185
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,625
to stop you,
Wirbelwind!

186
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,458
I've got to do
this just right,

187
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,541
or the La Muse
will be vaporized.

188
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,458
It's spreading! Nanomists
all over the planet

189
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,500
are behaving
erratically!

190
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,833
I don't
believe it!

191
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,625
The nanomists in the
stratosphere are condensing!

192
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,125
It's acting as
a giant lens!

193
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,583
The chlorophoric value
is off the charts!

194
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,375
There's just no
precedent for this...

195
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,125
What in the world is
going on out there?

196
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,166
Well, this will be
trickier if I can't see you.

197
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,625
I doubt that move's going
to work a second time...

198
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,166
My girl is as crafty
as she is cautious.

199
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,291
I wonder where she
gets that from?

200
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,833
This must be so
hard for her!

201
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,291
My goodness... You're...
a tough boy aren't you...?

202
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,708
I guess I can't go
easy on you anymore.

203
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,458
Sorry... Donner!

204
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,166
Don't worry I'll put
you back together

205
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,083
better than
new... I promise!

206
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,833
Forgive me...

207
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,458
She's redirecting energy
to her flex phasers.

208
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,416
Oh no! She going for
a point-blank attack!

209
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,666
Stop it!
Wirbelwind! No!

210
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,375
Please...stop
it...Donner...

211
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh no...! Please
don't shoot!

212
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,916
She's getting more
aggressive with each attack.

213
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,166
The program must be
gaining control...

214
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,208
What am I
going to I do?

215
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,750
Magma concentration readings
below Theta are off the scale!

216
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,458
And the viscosity
is dropping.

217
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,291
I'm reading a massive
build-up of Lorentz forces...

218
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,458
Pressure levels are
approaching critical mark!

219
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,458
Is there anything
we can do?

220
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,750
Cheif, I hate
to say this,

221
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,208
but it's been out of our
hands for some time now!

222
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,625
Some outside force has taken
control of the region.

223
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,958
At this rate, it's going to
break through the crust!

224
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,083
It's over now.

225
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,666
I gotcha.

226
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,875
Donner...?

227
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,666
Donner... No...

228
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:25,958
Activate!

229
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,000
Now initiate
cooling systems!

230
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,791
Good. Her shield is down...
and she's immobilized.

231
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,875
I need to hurry and rewrite
the program while I still can.

232
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,000
Donnersclag activated
his self-destruct mechanism.

233
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,125
Do you think it
was... Hashish?

234
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,458
Hashish...
what's that?

235
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,833
Originally,
it was a drug

236
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,416
given to numb the
emotions of assassins.

237
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,125
It created the
perfect killer.

238
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,458
One who fears nothing.
Not even his own death.

239
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,333
Now, it's a
viral program

240
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,666
created to mimic
those same effects...

241
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,791
A machine's
primary function

242
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,916
under the virus'
influence is to kill.

243
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,750
It will stop at nothing
for that objective,

244
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:27,250
even if it destroys
itself in the process.

245
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,875
Oh no! That means
Wirbelwind too...!

246
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,916
She's activated
her inertial drive!

247
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's no use...!
I can't stop her!

248
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,041
Please, Wirbelwind!
Don't do this!

249
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,666
Stop it,
Wirbelwind! Stop!!

250
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,500
No!!

251
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,750
Wha...? Hey, what...? It all
just went back to normal!

252
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,583
What just
happened?

253
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,541
[Lumiere] Even if they had been
successful in killing us...

254
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,625
they were programmed
to self-destruct

255
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,916
after their
mission.

256
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,833
Wirbelwind and
Donnersclag knew this

257
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,958
and spared us by
destroying themselves

258
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,916
before they lost
complete control.

259
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,500
In their
final moments,

260
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,541
they were doing everything in
their power to save our lives.

261
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,958
I get it... So they were
considered disposable

262
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,583
right from
the start.

263
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,041
So this is...

264
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,291
...This is how
the GOTT works?!

265
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,500
Donnersclag...

266
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:17,166
No more... This time
they've gone too far.

267
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:26,500
I'm going to put an end to
this... One way or another.

268
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,041
I won't let
you stop me.

269
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, then I'm
going with you.

270
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,666
What did you
expect me to say?

271
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,208
If there's a time for
elegance... this isn't it.

272
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:29,625
Complete destruction. All that
was once held dear is gone.

273
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,833
But after everything's
been taken away,

274
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:34,000
there's nothing
left to lose.

275
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:38,416
Next time on Kiddy
Grade: "Break/Down".
