1
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,541
I finally have a
whole day off!

2
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay, okay, okay!
Hello? Hi, Ricky!

3
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:38,083
Huh...? Dinner...?
Sure! I'd love to...

4
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,458
Just tell me what
time you want to meet!

5
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,125
Uh, Right now...? Well,
it's a little early...

6
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,541
What do you mean
it's almost dark?

7
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,958
I don't
believe it.

8
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,916
I overslept.

9
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,708
I'm still
kicking myself.

10
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,458
How could I sleep
through the whole day?

11
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,750
At least you won't
have to take a catnap

12
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:17,208
at work tomorrow
like you normally do.

13
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,625
But this was
my day off...

14
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,958
Hey, cheer up! We're
young, we're single,

15
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,125
and we're about to
have dinner at Ubu!

16
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,625
Ubu! Really?!

17
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,458
You're the
best, Ricky!

18
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,125
Um, we're splitting
the bill... 'kay?

19
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,166
Wow! But I
don't know.

20
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,166
I hear this place
is pretty pricey...

21
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,791
Let's live a little,
Éclair... Besides,

22
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,000
my frequent diner's card
will get us a discount.

23
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:05,458
Miss?

24
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,791
I'm sorry, but the restaurant
does not admit anyone

25
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,458
under the age
of eighteen.

26
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,458
Hey, wait. She's with me,
and I'm a frequent diner.

27
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,458
I'm afraid those
are the rules.

28
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,000
Our money's just as good as
anyone else's here, pal!

29
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,208
Sorry, I'm just a
waiter, ma'am.

30
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,458
It's okay, Ricky. Let's
go someplace else.

31
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:28,041
Ladies...
Welcome to Ubu.

32
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,916
Sir, I tried
to stop them.

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,666
Sorry,
he's new.

34
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,916
This way.

35
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,291
Thank you, sir.

36
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,875
Are you sure
about this, sir?

37
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,708
Turning away customers will
only draw unwanted attention...

38
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,416
Got it?...

39
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,708
Besides, who do you think
our benefactors would blame

40
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,958
if a customer complaint
brought down their operation?

41
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,458
We've got enough to
worry about tonight.

42
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:54,250
Good evening,
gentlemen.

43
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,791
[Mercredi]
Insider trading?

44
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,791
[Eclipse] Yes. With
economic regulations

45
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,500
here on Aineias
being relaxed,

46
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,458
criminal organizations
are conspiring

47
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,625
to take advantage
of the situation.

48
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,916
Our sources believe that
Laughing Jester is involved.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,625
Laughing Jester...

50
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,875
They steal and sell secret
financial information

51
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,458
to the
highest bidder.

52
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,500
I've been told they're
meeting with another group

53
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,000
to discuss a
partnership...

54
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,208
and we're hoping that we
can catch them in the act.

55
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,958
But on a planet of this size,
finding the meeting place

56
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,041
is going to be
extremely difficult,

57
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,625
even for our
best agents.

58
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,750
Keep me apprised of
any reports, Mercredi.

59
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,958
Wow! This place looks
absolutely fantastic!

60
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,291
It is. Hey, should we
have invited Lumiere?

61
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,500
I see her everyday.

62
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,875
I don't think it'll
hurt either one of us

63
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,875
to spend a little
time apart, you know?

64
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,291
So that's
how it is.

65
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,416
Uh-Huh, that's
how it is.

66
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,500
Miss Lumiere,

67
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,791
are you sure that Miss Éclair
wouldn't want to accompany you?

68
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,833
I'm sure... This
is her day off too,

69
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,958
and I think she'll appreciate
spending a little time

70
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,541
away from
me for a change.

71
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,166
Besides,
knowing Éclair,

72
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,208
I'm positive wouldn't have
wanted to go to the opera.

73
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,875
Okay then.
Good night, all.

74
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,500
Good evening, ma'am.

75
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:24,125
That looks great! 
Almost too good to eat!

76
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,208
A partnership, huh?

77
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,958
It's a win-win
situation for everyone.

78
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,291
So tell me,

79
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,791
why do we need to get in
bed with Laughing Jester?

80
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,625
You get inside information
that will let you

81
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,208
make a killing
in the markets,

82
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,416
and we get a piece of
that fancy technology

83
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,125
I've heard so
much about.

84
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:44,166
Basically... you scratch our
back and we'll scratch yours.

85
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,875
Oh, I'm so full!

86
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,000
Then why did you
order dessert?

87
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,250
No matter how
much you eat,

88
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,125
there's always room
for ice cream!

89
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,208
I agree!

90
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,500
Excuse me?

91
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,541
May I have
this dance?

92
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:12,750
It's yum-yum-yummy!

93
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,166
If you acted a
little older,

94
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,791
maybe some guys would
ask us to dance tonight.

95
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,041
You say
something?

96
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,666
Hmm...

97
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,791
This
should work.

98
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,583
What are
you doing, Ricky?!

99
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,625
Wait a minute!
Knock it off... No!

100
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,333
Here I come!

101
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,041
All done...

102
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,125
Now you look like a
sophisticated mature woman!

103
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,958
Uhh.. Ricky,
this is a bad idea!

104
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,416
You look great.

105
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,875
And you should really wear
lipstick more often I mean,

106
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,958
I can't remember the last
time I saw it on you...

107
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,291
That's because
wearing lipstick

108
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,958
makes it difficult to
control my powers.

109
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:48,875
Éclair?

110
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,041
Uh-huh?!

111
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,833
Éclair, you look
beautiful... I mean it!

112
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,750
Miss?

113
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,791
Yes?!

114
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,416
May I have the
pleasure of a dance?

115
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,250
With me?
But I don't-

116
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,458
No! No! Go ahead
and have some fun!

117
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,875
Are you sure?
No, wait!

118
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:12,416
Come.

119
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,125
I take it... you're
not a dancer.

120
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:35,166
Nope. I've got two left
feet... Sorry about that.

121
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,000
What?!

122
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:39,625
A bomb!

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,916
Must have been
an earthquake.

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,333
Maybe it's a sign...

125
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,333
of the power our two
organizations could have.

126
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,791
We'd be
earth-shattering, huh?

127
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,958
I knew this lipstick
would get me in trouble.

128
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,291
Did the earthquake
scare you, my dear?

129
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,833
Don't worry... Heh...
I've got you.

130
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,125
You're an
exquisite woman...

131
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,416
but I must have a name to
match your lovely face.

132
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,791
É- Éclair.

133
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:22,791
That means... Lightning,
correct? How heavenly.

134
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,666
Éclair.

135
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,500
Do you believe in
fate? ...I do.

136
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:33,208
I believe that fate has brought
us together this very night.

137
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,125
Our destiny is written
in the stars above...

138
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,916
and our story
begins with a kiss.

139
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,750
Is this one of
your assassins?!

140
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,583
No, we've never seen
this man before!

141
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:59,666
I knew we couldn't trust
you lousy jesters!

142
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,166
What's happening?!

143
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,166
What's...
going on here?!

144
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,166
...and I just
bought this one!

145
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,666
A cyborg!

146
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,250
We can't let
her escape!

147
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,000
This is supposed
to be my day off!

148
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,041
Éclair! Where are
you?! Éclair!

149
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,708
Éclair!!!

150
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,416
Éclair!

151
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:15,000
La Traviata... I'm
practically in tears already.

152
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,166
Seems I'm not
the only one...

153
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,833
Excuse me... Hi...

154
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,791
Hey... There, there,
now. What's the matter?

155
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,583
Did you get separated
from your mother?

156
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,125
Good girl.

157
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,458
What do we have here? An
illegal cyborg, huh?

158
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:30,041
Do you know how much damage
you caused us tonight?

159
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,750
Hey, don't blame me. I just
came here to eat dinner...

160
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,541
And with service like this,
I won't be leaving a tip.

161
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,791
Thanks to you,
sweetheart...

162
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,958
we can no longer use this
establishment as a front...

163
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,291
and you ruined
the plans we had

164
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,625
for our now-dead
associates in the other room!

165
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,958
This isn't my fault!
That guy grabbed me-

166
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,333
Ah, shut up...

167
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,541
We were planning on killing
them eventually anyway.

168
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,791
However, you've forced us
to accelerate our schedule

169
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,416
more than a
little bit...

170
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,583
and we expect to be paid
for our inconvenience.

171
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:07,125
M- Me pay you? But I could
barely afford dinner tonight!

172
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:11,041
Don't want money...
We want your body!

173
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:34,958
Where am I?

174
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,458
This definitely isn't
the evening show

175
00:13:54,541 --> 00:14:04,875
at the
opera house.

176
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,750
The bosses didn't check
in. We need to leave.

177
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,458
Don't freak out... No one's
got the balls to take us on.

178
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,125
Laughing
Jester does...

179
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:17,375
Let's get these brats to
the treatment facility.

180
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,791
Treatment facility?

181
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,291
[Kidnapper 2] We've
gotta get out of here now!

182
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,458
Prepare to blast-off!

183
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:34,541
That means... we're
at... the spaceport!

184
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:42,916
That means... we're
at... the spaceport!

185
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,041
[LJ Leader] In
order to succeed,

186
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,041
you've got to have
a competitive edge.

187
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,708
Our late friends
used to have that edge,

188
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,791
but now we're going
to take it from them.

189
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,500
What's
their secret?

190
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,708
Children.

191
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,541
Children?!

192
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,875
[Leader] Sons and daughters of
this planet's upper classes.

193
00:14:58,958 --> 00:14:59,916
They kidnap 'em,

194
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,583
zap some post-hypnotic
suggestions

195
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,833
in their
little minds,

196
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,750
and then send 'em
home to mommy and daddy

197
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,500
seemingly no worse for wear.
It's brilliant, really.

198
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,000
They even use the kids
to kidnap more kids...

199
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:15,791
and we're finally gonna get
us a piece of that action!

200
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,458
[Lumiere] Timed
hypnotic suggestions...

201
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,458
They take effect when the
children reach adulthood

202
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,000
and have become
prominent members of society.

203
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,958
They're being
turned into puppets.

204
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,458
And you'll be the one
pulling their strings...

205
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,625
Wow... That's what I
call a long-term plan.

206
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,916
We're prepared to wait.

207
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,791
One day little Johnny
and little Suzie

208
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,791
are going to control
this planet's finances

209
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,375
and government. But all
their influence and power

210
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,625
will
belong to us.

211
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,583
Huh... Sounds like you've
got it all worked out.

212
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,208
This has got to be the
most interesting job

213
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,875
that I've
ever had.

214
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,458
If you do what you're
told, keep quiet,

215
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:55,875
and shoot straight... maybe
I'll forgive your debt.

216
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,208
Uh, okay!
I'll do my best!

217
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,666
Well, now
that I'm here,

218
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,333
I can't very well leave without
doing something about this.

219
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,666
I've gotta break
away from these guys...

220
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,625
I told you those bastards
would double-cross us!

221
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,833
Alright! Alright! We're
going! We're going!

222
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,208
Go make sure those
brats are secured!

223
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,208
Roger!

224
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:08,333
How did you get out?
Hey! Stop that whinin'!

225
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,333
I really hate
these whiny kids.

226
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,666
Come on... Get back
in your chamber!

227
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,041
I know how
you feel...

228
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,541
I fell for the
same trick.

229
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,250
But, I suppose you really
should have seen it coming...

230
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,666
They could certainly learn a
thing or two about elegance...

231
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,958
Hey! Someone's hacking
into our mainframe!

232
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,166
They're trying to override
our assault fighters!

233
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,416
Hacking in...?

234
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,875
So hit 'em with an EMP
and shut the punk down!

235
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,875
Yes, sir!

236
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:13,208
I can't!

237
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,708
What the-
I'm losing control!

238
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:25,750
Hackers, great! Where's
Lumiere when I need her...?

239
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,500
Uh- what is that girl doing?!
C'mon! Get us out of here!

240
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,750
I... can't, sir!

241
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,208
Official G.O.T.T.
business.

242
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,750
[Lumiere] The children we
found on board the ship

243
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,625
have already been taken to
the hospital for treatment.

244
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,375
I also discovered
a database

245
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,708
with the names of
all the children

246
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,833
they had ever kidnapped...
With a little follow up,

247
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,500
we should be able to
reverse the damage.

248
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,958
You and Éclair sure
did a lot of work

249
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,541
on your day off...
Didn't you?

250
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,875
Hush now,
my child

251
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:27,333
Close your
little eyes.

252
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:33,833
Slumber awaits... and
all the sweetest dreams

253
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,500
Rest now,
my child

254
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,291
Close your-

255
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,291
Oh, Mer!

256
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:45,291
What a pretty song...
Where did you learn it?

257
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,291
Beats me.

258
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,833
What...? Really?

259
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,791
I just know
it somehow.

260
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,416
Don't cry,
little baby...

261
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,583
Mommy will be here
very soon, okay?

262
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:01,208
I know. How about I sing
to you a little more? Okay?

263
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,583
Rest now, my child...

264
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,791
looks pretty good at that,
doesn't she?

265
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,166
Yes, she does.

266
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:14,958
Let mother rock you, Un-der
The Heavenly skies...

267
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,291
[Eclipse] We're lucky
Lumiere and Éclair

268
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,875
stumbled on this
when they did...

269
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:26,541
How are those
two holding up?

270
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:32,500
What...? A lullaby? I see...
Thank you, Mercredi.

271
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,000
Tell the girls not to be
late for E-Shift tomorrow.

272
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,291
[Éclair] The mirror
reflects an image,

273
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,791
but what it shows
is not the truth.

274
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:32,583
Just as right turns into left,
the truth becomes a lie...

275
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:36,916
Next time on Kiddy
