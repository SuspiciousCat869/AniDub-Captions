1
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,125
Of course, you're not really
the "Chief", now are you?

2
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,166
The official title is
"Acting Chief", right?

3
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,083
What are you
doing?! Kill them!

4
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,708
You've done enough
for one day. Rest now.

5
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:25,166
Who sent you? The Global
Union? The Nouvlesse?

6
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,833
Whose ES Members
are you?

7
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,250
Sounds like you've been busy
making enemies, huh "Éclair"?

8
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,666
Answer me!
Who are you?!

9
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,125
Well... You're right about one
thing. We're not your friends.

10
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,125
Sorry we can't stay
and chat more...

11
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,125
But we'll be
seeing you around.

12
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,000
After them!

13
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,250
That was
incredible!

14
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,500
Whoever
they were,

15
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,583
I'm glad someone stood
up to this nonsense...

16
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,416
This is an emergency alert of
the 3rd and 4th battalions...

17
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,833
Secure the escaping
antisocial elements at once!

18
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,791
All units, outfit for
anti-terrorist combat!

19
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,625
Extend security to a
300-kilometer radius!

20
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,041
Verify ID on all civilians
before evacuating!

21
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,750
What are you two doing?
Get back to the office.

22
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,833
You're to stay there and
wait for further orders.

23
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,125
Are we clear?

24
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,583
Yes, Acting Chief.
Understood.

25
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,000
So, what are
you thinking?

26
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,166
The same thing that you're
thinking, by the sound of it.

27
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,250
Those girls are...
are probably...

28
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,666
Two of the units
are still unstable.

29
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,583
We'll need to watch
them closely.

30
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,583
Are you sure?

31
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:28,625
Well, if you ladies are in need
of an auditor... Here I am.

32
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,541
Armblast.

33
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,833
How did you get
past the guards?

34
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,541
That was quite a
commotion earlier.

35
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,666
I guess I must have slipped
between the cracks.

36
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,208
I'm surprised
you didn't run.

37
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,833
Now why would I
do that, Éclair?

38
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,375
You know how fond
I am of you two.

39
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:51,208
All right... I'll give you a
chance to prove you're useful.

40
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,250
I won't
disappoint.

41
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,833
Care for
a lift?

42
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,875
A lift? No. But thank you
for your concern, Auditor.

43
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,625
I... I think we've recovered
enough to manage on our own.

44
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sure. It's me
I'm worried about.

45
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,875
You think
this is wise?

46
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,708
We might as well keep all
the risky elements together.

47
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:36,375
Target acquired, fleeing
westbound on Route 5-3-8.

48
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,791
Red Squadron,
in pursuit.

49
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,000
1st Division, approach
from the west-southwest.

50
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,000
2nd Division, approach
from west- northwest.

51
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,541
Converge on
our position.

52
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,250
All civilian traffic
has been diverted.

53
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,666
Your target is the only
moving vehicle in the area.

54
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,208
Get a lock.

55
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,166
Oh, look! They called out the
whole cavalry, just for us!

56
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,291
So it seems... I'm sure
"Acting Chief Éclair"

57
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,958
was all too eager
for the chance

58
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,666
to show off
her new army.

59
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,208
Funny... You'd think a former
ES Member would be able to

60
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,041
take care of
things herself!

61
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,250
Our goal here
is containment.

62
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,208
Try to lead them
with your fire.

63
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,333
They just had to start
blowing things up.

64
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,708
We need to get
out of the city.

65
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,375
One thing
at a time!

66
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,041
Heads up!

67
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,583
See ya'!

68
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,750
I think it's time you started
taking this seriously.

69
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,083
Here we go...

70
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,375
That trick may have
worked on your partners

71
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,875
back at
the assembly,

72
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,291
but you'll have to come up
with something better for us!

73
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,625
Here... Let me show
you the right way

74
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,041
to use a
nanomist javelin!

75
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,875
Get off the street!
Find some cover!

76
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,750
Tell you what- you guys
keep practicing, okay?

77
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,750
Something wrong?

78
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,166
No. It's
nothing.

79
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,208
Attention,
all units...

80
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,166
Steady...

81
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,125
The targets have escaped
the security perimeter,

82
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,500
and are headed into the El Lac
forest, southwest of Kolkia.

83
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,875
All ES Members are to proceed
to that location immediately.

84
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,458
That is all.

85
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:35,708
Proceed... to location...
immediately...

86
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,541
Right. Just
point the way.

87
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,333
Another order from 'Her
Majesty', I take it.

88
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,083
5th Division is
searching Block E-6.

89
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,333
I want the 6th
Division covering F-7.

90
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,333
Now move out...

91
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm told the Chief
is on her way.

92
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,208
She's leading a unit
into the field herself.

93
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,041
If they get too deep
into that forest,

94
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,291
we're going to have real
problems pulling them out.

95
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,500
Well, we'll just
have to stop them.

96
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,750
I'm not above getting my hands
dirty every now and then.

97
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,333
You sure
about this?

98
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,375
She did more or less order
us to sit this one out.

99
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,666
The only thing
I'm sure of...

100
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,333
is things are about
to turn ugly.

101
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,333
I'd say that's pretty much
a given at this point.

102
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,708
Besides, the
last I checked,

103
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,083
we were already the Chief's
new "whipping boys".

104
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,833
I can't see how it
makes much difference

105
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,083
if her opinion of us
gets any lower.

106
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,541
But if you're so
worried about it,

107
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,166
maybe you should've
stayed behind.

108
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,375
Well I would have, except
you're forgetting one thing-

109
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,833
Since when can you
look after yourself?

110
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,875
At the very least, we get to
enjoy some interesting scenery.

111
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,791
The rock formations
in this area

112
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,000
have a strong magnetic
quality to them.

113
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,541
You don't say...

114
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,458
So then... why don't
we take a break?

115
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,875
How are you? Are you
feeling all right?

116
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,875
I don't
understand...

117
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,833
I never... I never
swore an oath...

118
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,875
Not to follow the
Chief's orders...

119
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,708
Not to uphold the laws of the
G.O.T.T... So then... why?

120
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,375
Perhaps I could
tell you a story.

121
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,625
It's a story
about two girls

122
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,750
I once had the
pleasure of knowing.

123
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,750
They were lovely...
much like yourselves.

124
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,041
Except one of them did
have a tendency to slap me.

125
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,666
Auditor, I hope
this won't turn out

126
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,958
to be some strange
fantasy of yours.

127
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,875
Did I mention that both
of them were ES Members?

128
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,250
They were very
young in appearance.

129
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,583
So much so,

130
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,791
that one might easily
mistake them for children.

131
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,541
However, their appearance
belied the truth-

132
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,000
that the two of them had
lived a long, long, time.

133
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,833
Hundreds
of years.

134
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:03,416
They were giving, gracious,
and always cheerful.

135
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,333
It was only by the
slightest of chances

136
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,708
that I came to know
them for a time.

137
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,583
Unfortunately, it was
brief. In the end...

138
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,916
they disobeyed
a direct order,

139
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,083
and were
both expelled.

140
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,375
They were
expelled?

141
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,541
From the G.O.T.T.?
That's terrible!

142
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,625
It might seem that way
to some. However...

143
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,083
For them, it was a
small price to pay

144
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,250
for following
their hearts.

145
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,416
So what happened
to them?

146
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,291
They're dead now...
or so I have heard.

147
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,416
Don't you think this
might be too extreme?

148
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,791
If the sun goes down, it's
only going to make our search

149
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,000
that much more
difficult,

150
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,375
so I intend to settle
this before it does.

151
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,500
But still...

152
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,208
All who oppose us
must be eliminated.

153
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,791
I want these two to be an
example for the entire galaxy!

154
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,875
Output calibrations
complete.

155
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,000
Target set. Search
program initiated.

156
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,041
Find them.

157
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,041
Turn them
loose!

158
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,708
So, she's brought
the Genetic Beasts.

159
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,375
What
are those?!

160
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,000
It would appear
that Her Majesty

161
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,416
is a bit short
on patience.

162
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:21,875
What?

163
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,166
Why'd
they stop?

164
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,833
Control! What's
going on in there?!

165
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,333
Status on
Number 3.

166
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:41,041
Malfunction. Specific
cause unknown.

167
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,250
It's not
responding at all!

168
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:01,291
This is Point G4! Taking
heavy fire. We need back-up!

169
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,666
The most destructive of
all Genetic Beasts...

170
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,416
The D-32,
E-Type.

171
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,666
How
unfortunate.

172
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,333
This particular model is
controlled via radio waves.

173
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,958
The magnetic ores
in these rocks

174
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,750
must be causing
some interference.

175
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,708
A costly oversight,
to say the least.

176
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,500
Wait! Where
are you going?

177
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,750
Where do
you think?

178
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,250
I'm going down there
to stop those things.

179
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,708
Are you sure you should
be acting without orders?

180
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,250
I'm sure Her Majesty won't be
so forgiving a second time.

181
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,791
I know, but...

182
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,000
...but... I can't
just let them die!

183
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,416
Wait!

184
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,458
Were you going to
leave without me?

185
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,833
Fall back!

186
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,000
Now hurry.
Get moving!

187
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,083
Thanks!

188
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,958
Come on, then! It's
just you and me now!

189
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,416
Stop!

190
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,666
I did not give you the
order to get involved!

191
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,666
What you're doing now could be
considered an act of treason!

192
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,625
I- I'm sorry, Chief. It's
just- people were dying!

193
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,666
This is valuable
military property.

194
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,458
We will
restore control.

195
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,666
Go back to your
positions, at once.

196
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,583
But, Chief, we
thought that-

197
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,166
You will
follow orders!

198
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,375
It is not your
place here to think.

199
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:42,291
Your first and only duty is
to follow orders, understand?

200
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,958
...m-my duty...
follow orders...

201
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,458
That's right. Now be
a good little girl,

202
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,708
and return to
your position!

203
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,791
No.

204
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,750
I'm sorry...
I can't do that!

205
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,875
Don't tell
me she's-

206
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,791
Easy now...

207
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,333
All who oppose us
must be eliminated.

208
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,958
All who oppose us
must be eliminated!

209
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,000
All who oppose us
must be eliminated.

210
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,708
All who oppose us
must be eliminated.

211
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,125
Do it!

212
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,250
Ta-daa!

213
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,666
Here we go!

214
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,625
What are you doing? Don't
just stand there! Attack!

215
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:27,666
Your turn!

216
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,833
Yes, I can
see that.

217
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,500
W-where...?

218
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,958
I- I don't...
Was I...?

219
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,833
Is that...?

220
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,541
None other.

221
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,041
I hope you
don't mind.

222
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,000
I took the liberty of giving
them a neural net de-inhibitor.

223
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,416
Or in
other words:

224
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,916
you don't get to play with
your dolls anymore. Sorry!

225
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,500
You two... So you've
managed to come back.

226
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,041
I'm sorry but...
who are you?

227
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,958
I'm Éclair. Hi.

228
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,166
Lumiere.

229
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,125
We're your
originals.

230
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:28,000
It can be stolen...
It can be broken...

231
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,125
but as long as you never
stop following your heart,

232
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,708
the wounds
will heal...

233
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,875
and the time will
come to take it back.

234
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:38,125
Next time, on Kiddy Grade:
"Take / Revenge".
