1
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,083
So you were held
under threat?

2
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,208
Yes. It was
terrifying.

3
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sure I'll be having
nightmares for some time.

4
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,875
Will you now?
That's interesting.

5
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,500
You've never struck me as
being the sensitive type.

6
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,666
Yes, well... I've always had
trouble coping with violence.

7
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,083
The inquiry
is concluded.

8
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,916
You will be kept in
custody until such time

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,958
as this matter
can be settled.

10
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,375
Should I check
his statement

11
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,916
against the S.O. Team's
incident report?

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,625
Don't bother. I doubt
you'd find much of any use.

13
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,666
Right...

14
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,916
Trying to keep a lid
on all this, ah?

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,458
Well, you are
the chief...

16
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,166
I guess that's what they pay
you to do when things go wrong.

17
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,291
I understand the two of you
share something of a history

18
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,125
with Éclair
and Lumiere.

19
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,458
We've known them for a long
time, if that's what you mean.

20
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,375
But I can't exactly say
it's been as friends.

21
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,833
We've gotten in
each other's way

22
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,708
more than once
over the years.

23
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,375
I always thought it was
strange that we all

24
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,916
ended up working
for the G.O.T.T...

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,083
But then, I knew
right from the start

26
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,958
that it
wouldn't last.

27
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,625
Very well.
Un-ou.. A-ou..

28
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,583
I hereby order you to
eliminate the fugitives,

29
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,166
Éclair and Lumiere.

30
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,208
Yes, Chief.
Understood.

31
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,791
Wow. This sure
takes me back...

32
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,041
How long's it been since we
were here last? What, decades?

33
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,708
I wish I could
be as optimistic

34
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,000
about all this as
you seem to be.

35
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,083
Right now, the whole galaxy
is searching for us...

36
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,750
You do
realize that...

37
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,916
Don't worry! Look, we made
it this far, haven't we?

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Trust me, this is
the last place

39
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,541
anyone'll think to
look for us.

40
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,833
I hope
you're right...

41
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,916
They really
did it, huh?

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,791
I'd heard about what happened
after we left... but still...

43
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,625
"Éclair".. That's
a nice name...

44
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,500
A phase fluctuation...
Another ship warping out!

45
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,458
Hostile?

46
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,666
That's what we
have to assume.

47
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,875
I just don't get it.
How did they find us?

48
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,125
We didn't even tell Armblast
where we were going!

49
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,708
I can only think of
two other people

50
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,333
with ties to this
place... There!

51
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,250
The Salyut...

52
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,708
Well, hello there, fugitives!
Nice to see you again!

53
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,083
It's
Un-ou.

54
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,416
I can't say I'm surprised
you came back here.

55
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,416
This would have been a
perfect hiding place!

56
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,666
Except you forgot about
our eyes and ears.

57
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,000
Let me guess- this was the
first place you looked.

58
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,250
I'm impressed you
still remembered it

59
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,916
after all
these years...

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,958
Like we could forget all
the trouble you caused us.

61
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,458
You two put us in a "difficult"
situation, to say the least...

62
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,458
Well as much as I'd like
to relive old times,

63
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,541
we'll have to save
it for another day!

64
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,416
Oh, no
you don't!

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,500
Emergency
warp aborted!

66
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,291
The phase navigation
systems have gone off-line!

67
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:58,291
You won't get away that
easy! I know all your tricks!

68
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:07,958
Come here!

69
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,208
They're fast...

70
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,208
They must've upgraded the
Salyut's inertial controls.

71
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,250
We can't match their
maneuvering capabilities.

72
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,958
They're systematically
closing in on us.

73
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,416
Lumiere!

74
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,958
Lumiere...

75
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,166
Un-ou!

76
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,250
This should be
interesting...

77
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,333
What happened?!

78
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,166
Interference from
the explosion...

79
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,500
Quantum turbulence...

80
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,916
It's overloaded our
inertial controls.

81
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,166
Right. A new upgrade and a
whole new set of problems.

82
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,541
Defensive stance!

83
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:32,375
What the-?

84
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,250
I don't get it.
Where are they going?

85
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,750
That would have been a
perfect chance to attack.

86
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,708
It looks like they've
taken damage as well.

87
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,500
Well... It must
be our lucky day.

88
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,541
Wirbelwind...
how is she?

89
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,750
But... if the emergency
medical nanomachines

90
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,291
won't save
her, then...

91
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,458
Éclair...

92
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,583
How do you feel?
Are you in pain?

93
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:52,583
No. I'm fine. How long does
Wirbelwind say I have left?

94
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,041
Two hours.

95
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,916
Funny. I've lived so long...
but now, looking back...

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,333
it feels like
such a short time.

97
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,125
Éclair... I have
a nice bottle

98
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,875
of vintage grape
juice on board...

99
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:12,416
I hid it behind panel 3A
on the dogfight bridge.

100
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,625
It's something I've been
saving for a special occasion.

101
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:19,500
I'd like it... if we
drank a glass together.

102
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,000
No!

103
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,083
We still have
two hours left...

104
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,375
I'm not ready to say
goodbye just yet!

105
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,458
Éclair... where...
are we going?

106
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,458
To the place
he promised.

107
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,458
You don't mean...

108
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,583
I doubt there's even a
one-in-a-million chance

109
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,625
we'll find
anything...

110
00:09:55,708 --> 00:10:00,125
"One-in-a-million" is
still better than "zero".

111
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,958
I wish I could... be
as optimistic as you.

112
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,208
C'mon Franz...

113
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,791
It looks like you're
coming along nicely.

114
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:03,208
I see. So it would seem you
girls are living beyond time.

115
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,166
I can't hear a thing.
How about you?

116
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,583
Nothing. There's
too much debris.

117
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,250
My eyes are
useless here.

118
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:30,916
That figures. I guess they
know all of our tricks, too.

119
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,833
Well, look at that.
The old assembly hall.

120
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,791
I remember when
you made that hole.

121
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,416
It should'a been
such an easy job.

122
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,875
All we had to do was
round up the members

123
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,416
of the existing
administration

124
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,833
and hand them over to the
leaders of the coup d'état...

125
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:47,875
They would
have given us

126
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,791
all the reward money
we could carry.

127
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,250
Although, I never
understood why

128
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,291
they wanted us to
take them alive,

129
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,833
if they were just going
to kill them anyway.

130
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:59,291
Who knows? And those two made
sure we never got that far.

131
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,958
The wounded come
first! Hurry!

132
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,125
Back then, we were mercenaries
working for the coup d'état,

133
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,125
and they were the
peace officers

134
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,291
sent in by
central dispatch.

135
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,250
Now, we're the ones
sent in by the G.O.T.T.

136
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,583
to 'keep the peace',

137
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,083
and they're
the criminals.

138
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,166
Funny how things
change, isn't it?

139
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,083
Change is inevitable. It's the
only constant in this universe:

140
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,500
All things that are
must one day pass.

141
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,125
I just thought
it was funny.

142
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,791
You don't have to get
all philosophical on me.

143
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,500
Where?

144
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,458
It's not them. Just what's
left of their trail...

145
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,166
Here. Let me see...

146
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,166
Did they take
off again?

147
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,416
Thirty minutes left...

148
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,625
Hang on
Lumiere... Please...

149
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,458
If anything
happens to you, I...

150
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,250
You know...

151
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,333
Being here like this brings
back a lot of memories...

152
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,541
Like the first time we met
him. When he helped us.

153
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,291
After you'd
been hurt...

154
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,708
Together now...
I'll take this side.

155
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,833
I can
help her.

156
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,750
My hospital's not
far. Let's hurry!

157
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,750
R- right!

158
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,375
That was decades
ago, but still..

159
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,541
it feels like
yesterday...

160
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,416
Shhh... Save
your strength.

161
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,250
You're right
about him...

162
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,583
He wasn't the sort of
man to forget a promise.

163
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,916
Maybe he really is here for
us, even after all this time.

164
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,708
Lumiere...!

165
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,541
Ganador...!

166
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,291
Donner!

167
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,250
Donner! Look after
Lumiere for me!

168
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,333
You're
mine, Éclair!

169
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,583
I always knew I'd be
the one to kill you.

170
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,291
Now don't go getting
ahead of yourself...

171
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,583
That's enough.

172
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,000
So, that's
what happened...

173
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,166
Please, just... just
give me one hour.

174
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,000
If Lumiere doesn't get medical
treatment right away...

175
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,291
No. That won't
be necessary.

176
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,583
You're not going
back to Aineias.

177
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,125
We weren't sent to
capture, but to eliminate.

178
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,666
Besides, how did you think
you were going to treat her

179
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,166
in a place
like this?

180
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,000
What, were you hoping to find
a doctor under the rubble?

181
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,750
He promised us...

182
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,166
I see... So it would seem you
girls are living beyond time.

183
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,666
Is that right?

184
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,166
That's right. Though we've
taken on many different forms.

185
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,416
Well, in
that case,

186
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,375
I suppose it never would
have worked between us.

187
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,708
I'm kidding.
I'm only kidding.

188
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,083
Are you... Are you sure you
won't come with us, Franz?

189
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,250
It isn't safe for
you here anymore.

190
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,833
This civil war is going
to drag on and on.

191
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,916
You should get out now,
while you still can.

192
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,041
No. I'm sorry, I can't. But
this war will end someday.

193
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,583
And when
it does...

194
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,791
I hope I'll see
you both again.

195
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:09,708
Of course. I could very
well be an old man by then.

196
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,333
Please, Franz...

197
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,208
I know... I'll make
you a promise...

198
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,958
He promised us that if we
ever got into trouble,

199
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,416
he would always be
here to help us.

200
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,125
That even if he should pass
away before we returned,

201
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:31,250
he would at least leave behind
a facility that we could use.

202
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,791
So I know, if we could
just get to his hospital...

203
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,083
Don't be an idiot.
Look around!

204
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,458
What you're talking about
is ancient history.

205
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,000
You see what happened to
this colony after we left?

206
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,750
You think he remembered
some silly promise

207
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,416
with the whole place coming
down around his ears?

208
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,083
Even if he did, he
was probably killed

209
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,916
before he could do
anything about it.

210
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,250
Compared to us, people
with normal lives

211
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,416
are like shadows.
They don't last.

212
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,333
You know that. So
what if your "doctor"

213
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,416
made a promise?
He's dead and gone.

214
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,625
It's stupid to think
he can help you now.

215
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,166
Yeah. Knowing you,
you would think that.

216
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,291
Well, I'll always
be around.

217
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,416
I'll try to come visit your
grave every now and again.

218
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,958
A-ou!

219
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,666
Is there anything
you want me to do?

220
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,291
Just stay here
like this...

221
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,208
It's active...

222
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,291
...the password?

223
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:29,000
"Éclair"... That's
a nice name...

224
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,458
It's worth
a shot...

225
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:50,000
Hello, Éclair and Lumiere.
It's been a long time.

226
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,791
Hello, Franz...

227
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,708
I wonder how many
years it will be

228
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,166
before you finally
receive this message.

229
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,125
Ten? Fifty?

230
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,416
Or perhaps it will be even
farther into the future

231
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,791
than I
can imagine.

232
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,875
Right now, as I
make this recording,

233
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,083
it's been almost
three years

234
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,916
since we said our
last goodbyes.

235
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,416
The war is still raging.
Worse than ever, it seems.

236
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,166
I do what I can
to help, but...

237
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,208
people die so easily. I'm
not sure how much longer

238
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,000
I'll be able to
hold out myself,

239
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,208
but I will leave
you this place,

240
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,041
for whenever you
should need it.

241
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,791
Just like
I promised...

242
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:35,125
It's about time for me
to make my rounds now.

243
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,500
Goodbye,
Éclair...

244
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,958
Stay close
to Lumiere.

245
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,041
And take care of
yourselves, both of you.

246
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,000
Thanks, Franz...
for everything.

247
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,625
Can you at least wait
until we're finished?

248
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,666
Are you sure? After this,
you'll be traitors, too.

249
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,166
I was getting tired of
the G.O.T.T. anyway.

250
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,625
It's about time we
found ourselves a job

251
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,125
with more
interesting prospects.

252
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,583
Lumiere's Anti-D-Command
Vaccine. You might need it.

253
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,666
Éclair!

254
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,583
I'm the one who's going to
kill you. Don't forget that.

255
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,583
We all wear
our defenses.

256
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,375
But if you can pierce through
the hard, cold armor,

257
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,666
what you'll find is
something soft and warm.

258
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,041
Next time on Kiddy
Grade: "Steel / Heart"
