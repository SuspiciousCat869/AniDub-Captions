1
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,458
Éclair and
Lumiere, huh?

2
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,375
They've been expelled
from the ES?!

3
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,916
Control: this is
2-0-5-6-4-5-4,

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,458
G.O.T.T. Destroyer Priamus
and L.S.U. Canopus.

5
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,333
Priority code:
Emergency.

6
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:14,833
Requesting immediate departure
clearance on linear shaft one.

7
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:19,041
This is Control. G.O.T.T.
Priamus and L.S.U. Canopus,

8
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,125
you are clear
for launch.

9
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,375
I don't like
this, Commander.

10
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,125
I don't like it either,
Yusef. But it's our job.

11
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,541
We're not paid to
question orders.

12
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,333
We're paid to
follow them.

13
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,333
You have a son,
don't you?

14
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,041
Yes, sir... He'll
be five next month.

15
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,375
Well, if you love
him, take my advice.

16
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,916
Start teaching him now:
No matter what happens,

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,083
never work
for the G.O.T.T.

18
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:49,375
I'll do that. That is,
assuming I make it home alive.

19
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,083
Start the
countdown to warp

20
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,333
as soon as we've cleared
the shaft. Two minutes!

21
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,250
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,583
Registrations
deleted.

23
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,625
We'll be entering the Zero
Star System in five minutes.

24
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,625
Our best bet is to go to one
of their lesser-known colonies

25
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:21,458
and hide out there for a
little while. Let's see now.

26
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,250
Here we go. This one
seems pretty obscure.

27
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,500
LAV- Seven Eight.

28
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,541
Immigration:
eighty-seven percent.

29
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,666
Political stance:
neutral.

30
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,541
And it looks like it's pretty
easy to get permission to dock.

31
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,208
I feel like we're fugitives
behaving like this!

32
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:42,250
It can't be helped, Éclair.
After all, you are fugitives.

33
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,791
You're deleting
our registrations?

34
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,416
This mandate comes directly
from the Privy Council,

35
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,333
with full support
by the G.U. Senate.

36
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,375
I have no choice but
to give the order.

37
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:57,875
Is something wrong?

38
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,666
Well, let's see.

39
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,916
How 'bout the
way the Chief

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,333
just gave those purge
orders without question?

41
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,000
And what
of it?

42
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,958
It means there's absolutely
no one here we can turn to

43
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,958
to plead
our case!

44
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,583
No one.

45
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:17,166
Life is long, Éclair. So many
unexpected things can happen.

46
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,875
Especially for someone who's
lived as many lives as you.

47
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,833
How dare you. Do you think
I wanted it this way?

48
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,666
My ice cream has
lost its flavor.

49
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,041
You're thinking about
those two, aren't you?

50
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,916
About what we'll
have to do.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,666
Tweedledum!

52
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,208
Right.
Sorry.

53
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,000
"Humans are greedy;
therefore, they are human."

54
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,291
It's an interesting
saying, don't you think?

55
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:52,083
Everyone dreams of
having eternal youth.

56
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,208
However, once they
finally obtain it,

57
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,333
they don't know what to do with
it, and say they don't want it.

58
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,583
What's your deal?

59
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,333
You make these observations
from a distance

60
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,208
and assume that's
the way everybody is.

61
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,291
I am an Auditor,
Éclair. That's my job.

62
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,500
So if you want to shoot
me, go right ahead.

63
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,416
But, you might wish you'd
saved your ammunition later.

64
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,333
Now that the orders
have officially cleared

65
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,458
the proper channels,

66
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,791
SO Members, either
Team 1 or Team 2,

67
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,833
will be dispatched
to pursue us.

68
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,583
And depending on how
badly they want us,

69
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,416
Internal Section 13 may
have already been deployed.

70
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,666
What? Section
Thirteen?

71
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,833
Yes. That's right.

72
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,541
The G.O.T.T.'s infamous
"purging unit".

73
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,625
We won't be able to stay
in one place for long.

74
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,791
Our best chance for
hiding is in open space.

75
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,500
Which means you might
want to consider

76
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,791
re-stocking
your supplies.

77
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,541
He's right. We're
going to need it.

78
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:59,333
They think they can get away
clean? Fine. I say let 'em try.

79
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,833
I feel sorry
for them.

80
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,166
Are you
kidding me?

81
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,000
I feel sorrier for whoever
has to go after 'em.

82
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,875
They're the
ones in danger.

83
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,416
Mmm... Where did you
find this tea?

84
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,916
The aroma is perfect.
It's delicious.

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,791
Is something
the matter?

86
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,958
Sorry. It's just, I
was hoping to share

87
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:29,250
that with Éclair
and Lumiere.

88
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,958
I was saving it
for their return.

89
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,500
I guess I'm having
a hard time

90
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,791
getting used to the idea that
they won't be coming back.

91
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,791
Broken brooms only
make more trash.

92
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:43,583
That's why we throw useless
tools away, Mercredi.

93
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,041
It's nothing
personal.

94
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,833
I might be the next
tool to be disposed of.

95
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,750
Check your equipment three
times and then check it again!

96
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,083
Any oversights could
cost you your life!

97
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,125
Yes, Sir!

98
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,875
All eyes here, men! The
Commander is ready to speak!

99
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,291
We will be
disembarking soon!

100
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:17,375
Our primary targets are the ES
Members Éclair and Lumiere!

101
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,666
However, our mission
in this case

102
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,625
will be limited to
containment only!

103
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,416
In other words, we
will be negotiating.

104
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,291
Commander, I
don't understand.

105
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,625
I thought our orders were
to purge the targets.

106
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,791
Have they
been changed?

107
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,166
My first responsibility
as commander

108
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,625
is the safety
of my men.

109
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:42,041
And I intend to bring you all
back to Aineias in one piece!

110
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,500
Any more
questions?

111
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,000
Good! Now, under
no circumstances

112
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,500
are you to engage
the targets

113
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,833
without a direct order from
me! Don't do anything rash!

114
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,791
Remember, the purpose
of negotiations

115
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,875
is to arrive at a
peaceful settlement!

116
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,791
Commander!?

117
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,666
I know a four-year-old boy
who wants to have his Dad

118
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,291
at his birthday
party next month.

119
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,125
Yusef, don't
disappoint him.

120
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,625
Yes, Sir. I'll take
that as an order.

121
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:12,708
All right! All units, battle
stations! ETA is five minutes!

122
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,375
Sir!

123
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,708
Guess that's it. Well,
at least for the food.

124
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,958
What's that
supposed to mean?

125
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,291
I just think you were a
little too harsh, that's all.

126
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:38,041
He's only doing his
job as an Auditor.

127
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:41,958
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,000
For not having
better tea.

129
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,666
We do have very good
wine if you'd like some.

130
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,375
Well, I think I'd better pass.
Thank you for offering though.

131
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,583
You're
welcome.

132
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,833
Funny. I don't think
I was too harsh at all.

133
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,666
He's always been
supportive of us, Éclair.

134
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,833
He's even helping us
right now as we speak.

135
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,375
We should
be grateful.

136
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,500
I guess I'm
just angry.

137
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:09,333
I am too, but we need to direct
our anger at the Nouvlesse.

138
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,458
Not at Armblast
or the Chief.

139
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,125
Yeah, yeah. That
all sounds good.

140
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,916
But forgive me if I can't
be as "logical" as you.

141
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:26,333
What? You've got to be
kidding me! Are you sure?

142
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:32,333
Oh my, gosh! Éclair and Lumiere
purged! Who would have thought?

143
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,916
This is
ridiculous.

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,666
They put enough garlic in
my pasta to kill a horse.

145
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,166
Approaching "C" Colony
LAV Seven Eight, Commander.

146
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,083
It's on the view
screen now.

147
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,000
The head office has already let
them know that we're coming.

148
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,416
Cut off the
identification beacon.

149
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,541
We'll go in stealth style
and moor at the northwest

150
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,458
general purpose docks
on the standard bar!

151
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes, commander!

152
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:02,875
I mean, a purging order? I
don't get it! Why so extreme?

153
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,125
That's not all.

154
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,375
They've authorized us
to use the D-Command!

155
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,250
I take it you're
from Section 13 then.

156
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,083
That is correct.

157
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,833
I see. But then, why
are you telling us?

158
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,541
Clearly, you had the element
of surprise on your side.

159
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,500
According to
standard protocol,

160
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,875
we have to confirm
your intentions

161
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,333
before resorting
to force.

162
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,583
Intentions?

163
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,625
You still have the
option to surrender.

164
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,958
An inquiry session
would be held.

165
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,291
You two could
plead your case.

166
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,291
Yeah, right. I'd
rather not, thanks.

167
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,250
How about you?

168
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,375
If Section Thirteen has
already been deployed,

169
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,458
there's little hope of
winning an Inquiry Session.

170
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,875
Is that so?

171
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,333
I understand.

172
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,666
Good luck.

173
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,791
Why aren't they
attacking us?

174
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,833
They're probably waiting
for another team to arrive!

175
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,833
Huh?

176
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,500
Section Thirteen
is a smaller unit.

177
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,625
It was probably sent for
reconnaissance and containment!

178
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,000
One of the main units
must be on the way.

179
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,333
Either Team One
or Team Two!

180
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,916
They're mobilizing an
entire army just for us!

181
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,208
How flattering!

182
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,708
They mean business,
I'm afraid!

183
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,625
Ironic,
isn't it?

184
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,791
She erased all
of her memories.

185
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:10,458
And now she's making the
same choices all over again.

186
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:14,291
No matter how many times it's
played, a waltz is a waltz.

187
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,500
The rhythm doesn't
change its time.

188
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,750
Well, you'll be
glad to know

189
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,000
that I just finished
loading the suppli-

190
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,583
We're escaping!
Come on! Let's go!

191
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,041
Now how could
you be escaping?

192
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,333
Wouldn't that mean that
they're already here?

193
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,916
Yes! That's exactly what
it means! Hurry, Please!

194
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,291
Release them!

195
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,666
Restraining Mortars
to the front!

196
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,833
Fire!

197
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,083
All units
take aim!

198
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:04,208
This is Commander
Lyall of S.O. Team 2!

199
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,916
As of 16:43, on orders
from the head office,

200
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,041
we have taken measures
to restrict your movement!

201
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,708
Resisting will put us
all in grave danger.

202
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,333
I ask that
you surrender.

203
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,250
And what if
we refuse?

204
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,208
Then I'll ask you a second
time. Please surrender.

205
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,583
No, we won't.

206
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,666
Activate it!

207
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,916
Yes, Sir.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,708
You heard
him! Activate!

209
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,583
Oh, no.

210
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,416
As you can see, those are not
ordinary restraining wires!

211
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,458
The joints in the
middle of the wires

212
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,833
have been rigged
with explosives!

213
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,041
The slightest movement
from your ship

214
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,833
will cause the
joints to pull apart

215
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,208
and the explosives
will be detonated!

216
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,875
If that happens, more
than half of this colony

217
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,916
will be destroyed
in the blast!

218
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,333
More than half? That means all
of you people will die, too!

219
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:07,666
Yes! Precisely! That's why
we're asking you to surrender!

220
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,458
Most of us have
wives and children

221
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,291
and we'd like to make it
home to them alive!

222
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,458
This'll be our last
sit-down meal for a while.

223
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:27,125
Things're about
to get hectic.

224
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:31,333
Do you think that Éclair
will beg for her life, Alv?

225
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,875
No way.

226
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,541
So if we refuse
to give up,

227
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,291
all of your men are
going to die right now?

228
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,666
That is
correct!

229
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,666
You're treating
them like hostages.

230
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,750
What about you? Don't you
have a hostage as well?

231
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,291
When you
ran away,

232
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,666
you took an agent
of the Global Union

233
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,708
with you against
his will.

234
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,125
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
made a distress call.

235
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,125
What? How
could you?

236
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,125
That's how they
found us so quickly.

237
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,458
You told them
where we were!

238
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:06,958
"Humans are greedy;
therefore, they are human."

239
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,541
You'd do well to
remember that.

240
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,541
Go ahead and shoot me
if you want, Éclair.

241
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,791
Although, I still
think you'd wish

242
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,916
you'd saved your
ammunition for later.

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I owe you
one, Commander.

244
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,625
We're not out of
trouble yet, Sir.

245
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,125
I'll ask one more time:
Please, surrender.

246
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,708
So you can take us
back to the G.O.T.T.?

247
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,708
No thanks,
Commander.

248
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,416
I think we'd rather take our
chances out here with you.

249
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,000
Fair enough.

250
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,458
But I'm afraid you'll
leave me no choice

251
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,333
but to execute
the D-Command.

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,583
The D-Command! I might
be able to survive it.

253
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,541
But what
about Éclair?

254
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,916
Please
surrender!

255
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,958
That's not an
option! Forget it!

256
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,875
The restraint wires have
been neutralized, Commander!

257
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:15,375
Yusef, execute
the D-Command!

258
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,750
That's not what
we agreed upon!

259
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:21,375
I don't have a choice.
The negotiations failed.

260
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,375
Commander.

261
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,875
Yusef! I gave you
a direct order!

262
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,041
As you wish, Sir!
All right, men.

263
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,458
Prepare to activate
the D-Command!

264
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:36,125
Ignition on standby.
Awaiting your numbers, Sir!

265
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,333
Don't do it!

266
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:44,958
Two! Three! Sixty-two!
Zero! Six! Seven! Nine!

267
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,208
Pass code confirmed,
Commander! Executing D-Command!

268
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,916
The D-Command is
transmitting a signal

269
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,750
to the nano-machines
inside their bodies,

270
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:15,125
forcing them to reproduce
at an accelerated rate.

271
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,833
L-L-Lumiere...

272
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,458
Éclair...

273
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,541
The resulting
increase in mass

274
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,875
puts enormous
pressure on the body.

275
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,708
Enough to crush their
internal organs.

276
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,458
I'm well aware of
that, Commander.

277
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,458
So why did you
execute the command?

278
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,708
The Head Office said that
these two are fugitives!

279
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,125
If you have any evidence
to the contrary,

280
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,125
I demand to hear it right
now. I'm a soldier!

281
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,208
I don't give the orders!
I carry them out!

282
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,333
And if I don't follow
the purging protocol,

283
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,625
these two could send my
entire team home in body bags!

284
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,166
An anti-mist vaccine...

285
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,458
I have to make them
work as antibodies.

286
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,500
Éclair

287
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,875
Oh no... It's too late...

288
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,166
Hold it! That's
far enough!

289
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,375
What are
you doing?!

290
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,166
These girls have lived
very long lives, Commander.

291
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,416
But in many ways

292
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,708
they are still young. I
won't let you destroy

293
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,958
what future they
have left.

294
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,791
Not like this.

295
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,125
You're one of them,
aren't you, Auditor?

296
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,083
You're an
ES Member!

297
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:16,500
Lumiere, I've stopped time
within her for a little while.

298
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,416
You can try making
the antibody now.

299
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,500
But I'm afraid that this will
cause her memories to awaken.

300
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,041
All of her
memories, Lumiere.

301
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:29,708
It's better than letting
her die, isn't it?

302
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,666
Everyone dreams of
having eternal youth.

303
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,291
The problem is how
one comes to live

304
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,708
with it once
they have it.

305
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,416
Éclair, I'm giving you
the antibodies now.

306
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,958
[Armblast] "Humans are greedy;
therefore, they are human."

307
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,708
In other words, you cannot
fight your own nature.

308
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,083
[Éclair] What
do you mean?

309
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,208
It's simple. You
have to learn to accept

310
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,166
things the
way they are.

311
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,375
Your past, the
choices you've made,

312
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,916
and the future laid
out before you.

313
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,166
That doesn't sound
so simple to me.

314
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,333
If I know you,
you'll do just fine.

315
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,708
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have helped you.

316
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,541
Then, all
this time?

317
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,333
They say that to
deceive your enemies,

318
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,833
you have to begin
with your friends,

319
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,750
don't they?

320
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,000
Thank you.

321
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:39,208
Yes. But now, sad
as I am to say it,

322
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,666
I think it's best if I didn't
accompany you from here.

323
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,750
After all, I am
still an auditor.

324
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,791
I'm sorry. I've said so
many terrible things to you.

325
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,458
Don't worry. I know
you didn't mean it.

326
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:01,500
Sir! This power! It's
equivalent to a G-Class!

327
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,083
How can he be
that strong?!

328
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,833
It's not
coming from him!

329
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,125
This is beyond the
scope of our mission!

330
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,791
It seems that they've
both run away!

331
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:30,166
17:49: Both
targets lost.

332
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,916
Let's go,
men! Move out!

333
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,708
Good luck, girls.

334
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,041
We move through
life blindly,

335
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,208
guided only by
the hand of fate.

336
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:32,625
But fate is not always kind.
The open hand can also strike.

337
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:36,791
