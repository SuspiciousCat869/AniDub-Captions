1
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:54,625
G.O.T.T. Secretary
Chevalier d'Autriche,

2
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:59,083
and Superintendent
General Deuxiame Maximoff,

3
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,833
you may now
come forward.

4
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:07,500
Concerning the appointment of
the new acting G.O.T.T. Chief,

5
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,833
the council has
made its selection.

6
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,041
This decision
is final.

7
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,250
Secretary d'Autriche,
as I'm sure you are aware,

8
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,583
this incident does not
bode well for your future.

9
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,083
However, with G.O.T.T.
reconstruction efforts

10
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,625
still
underway,

11
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,375
and the scheduled launch of
the Atlas line almost upon us,

12
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,250
it is still in your
interest that you present

13
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,500
a strong face
to the public.

14
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,416
Not only for the sake
of your position,

15
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,708
but for the benefit
of the Union itself,

16
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:37,416
and more so, the
Nouvlesse. That is all.

17
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,625
I pray you do not allow an
otherwise distinguished career

18
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,916
to end in
disgrace.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,041
Superintendent
General...

20
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,541
Tell me, do you still
remember any of the dreams

21
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,708
you had as
a child?

22
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,666
Your plans for
the future?

23
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,500
Yes. I wanted to
be a policeman,

24
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,208
more than anything
in the world.

25
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,875
Obviously, the choices
I made in life

26
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,166
led me down a
different path.

27
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,041
I see. Then do you
know what it takes

28
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,958
to make your dreams a
reality? One thing...

29
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,958
Hard work?
Dedication?

30
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,416
The answer
is "patience".

31
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,000
Is that the
last of it?

32
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,083
Yeah, I think
that's everything.

33
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,166
Good work. Just carry
it up to the office

34
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,916
and we'll call
it a day.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,583
I still can't believe
they've got this place

36
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,583
up and
running already.

37
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,458
Well, they can't keep
it shut down forever.

38
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,750
I mean, all the
branch offices

39
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,166
gotta have somewhere
to report to, right?

40
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,208
Do you have the status
report on the Deucalion?

41
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,666
Yes, ma'am. Minus
zero-point-three percent.

42
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,416
Good. That's
top priority.

43
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,583
ES Member
Sinistra...

44
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,291
...and Dextera.

45
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,291
So they're rebuilding it
exactly as it was before?

46
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,166
On the exterior.

47
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,041
The new interior will
be far more impressive.

48
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,291
My own
little castle.

49
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,208
Just one of the minor
perks of the position?

50
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,916
Acting Chief...?

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,416
What is it,
Mercredi?

52
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,333
I'm sorry, but actually,
it's "Vendredi".

53
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,666
You haven't answered my
question. What do you want?

54
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,000
Excuse me... ES Members
Dextera and Sinistra

55
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,875
are here
to see you.

56
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,791
Fine. Send
them in.

57
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,833
Of course. Right
away, Acting Chief.

58
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:34,000
Sinistra and Dextera, reporting
in as ordered, Acting Chief.

59
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,000
First they give the order
to have her purged,

60
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,500
and when that
doesn't work,

61
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,166
they appoint her as Acting
Chief of the G.O.T.T. instead.

62
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,416
A sudden shift in
policy, to say the least.

63
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,541
And one that's sure
to have raised

64
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,916
more than a few
eyebrows by now.

65
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,500
The Nouvlesse certainly
aren't making any effort

66
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,041
to mask their contempt
for the general public...

67
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,750
But perhaps I should
just concentrate

68
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,708
on adjusting
to my new diet.

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,666
What? New
ES Members?

70
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,083
That's right.

71
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,333
Two of our ES Teams-

72
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,166
Tweedledee and Tweedledum,
Viola and Cesario-

73
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,541
are still out
of commission.

74
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,500
And with the reconstruction
still going on,

75
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,541
this places the G.O.T.T. in
a very vulnerable position.

76
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,583
I felt it necessary to
strengthen our fighting force.

77
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:32,083
Necessary how? You understand,
the G.O.T.T. isn't an army.

78
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,958
That's about
to change.

79
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:38,250
Soon, this organization will
be even greater than an army.

80
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:42,291
In ability, rank...
and severity.

81
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:43,958
Dextera!

82
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,666
And it is not the
place of an ES Member

83
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,041
to question the
Chief's judgment!

84
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,916
We meant no disrespect,
Chief Éclair!

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,958
Dextera...

86
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,916
Dextera!

87
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:07,625
I meant no
disrespect. I'm sorry.

88
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,791
"Acting" Chief.

89
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,833
Excuse me, Acting
Chief Éclair.

90
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,458
When you're
finished here,

91
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,791
there are more pressing matters
in need of our attention.

92
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,666
All right, fine.

93
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,083
But there's something I'd like
the two of you to do for me...

94
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,708
Takes you back,
doesn't it?

95
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,375
It's just like it
was in the old days.

96
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,500
Hey, what do you think? We've
come a long way, haven't we?

97
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,958
You remember how
hard this used to be

98
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,375
back when we
first started?

99
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,708
How many times
did you fall?

100
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,958
If memory serves, you
fell more than I did.

101
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,166
Sinistra!
Behind you!

102
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,166
Who in the-?

103
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,666
Sinistra!

104
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,958
Who in the
hell are you?!

105
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,750
I'm sorry. I suppose I
should make the introductions.

106
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,166
Chief Éclair!

107
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,125
These girls are the new ES
members I told you about.

108
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,583
Like I
said before,

109
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,041
they're still a little
wet behind the ears.

110
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,833
But don't worry. For
trainees, they learn fast.

111
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,250
You know, I almost
feel sorry for them.

112
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,666
They're the last team
of S-Class members.

113
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,833
As long as I have them... I
intend to put them to good use.

114
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,791
Trainees? I
don't buy it.

115
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,250
They're too powerful
to be only C-Class!

116
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,541
They're
not alone.

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,916
Look again.
Up there.

118
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,750
Six teams, twelve
members in all...

119
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,000
It would appear that
our dear "Acting" Chief

120
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,333
has a rather
high estimation

121
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,333
of our abilities,
now wouldn't it?

122
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,666
We don't want to be on the
receiving end of that.

123
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,416
You're right. I'd say it's
time for us to leave.

124
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,333
What?!

125
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,083
A nanomist
barrier?

126
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,333
Those girls!
It's their ability!

127
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,833
But that...
That would mean-!

128
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,958
Are you all right?
Are you hurt at all?

129
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:30,583
I'm okay... I think. Thanks
for pulling me out of there.

130
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:34,416
You were right... There's
no way they're "trainees".

131
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,125
Yeah. It would've been
nice of the Acting Chief

132
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,708
to at least
warn us

133
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,125
we'd been demoted
to "whipping boys".

134
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,458
But did you notice?
Those girls...

135
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,708
You realize what
they are...

136
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,125
Excuse me,
Chief Éclair...

137
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:17,750
It's Security Line 606... A
message. For Alv and Dverger.

138
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:23,250
Line 606? So, Secretary
d'Autriche himself.

139
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,833
Haven't we already
informed him

140
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:29,166
that Alv and Dverger are
dead? The man's a fool.

141
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,250
Yes...

142
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,666
Ricki...

143
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,291
Who are
those kids?

144
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,291
Attention!
Come to order!

145
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,083
At this time,

146
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,375
the Acting
Chief of

147
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,666
the Galactic Organization
of Trade and Tariffs

148
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,541
is prepared to
make her address!

149
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,666
It's
Éclair...

150
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,250
Now, to all within the
sound of my voice...

151
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,791
those of you
gathered here today,

152
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,125
as well as those hearing my
words via some other means...

153
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,291
Let it be known
throughout the galaxy...

154
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,250
The G.O.T.T. has risen
up from the ashes...

155
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,750
and emerged as a force
to be reckoned with!

156
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,625
As you are aware,
in recent years,

157
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,000
we have seen a
rising trend

158
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,708
among various planets toward
financial independence.

159
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,166
It is a trend that can
no longer be ignored.

160
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,500
Left unchecked,

161
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,000
these rogue planets weave
a thread of disruption

162
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,916
that threatens to
unravel the very fabric

163
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,291
of our great
union. However...

164
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,333
As the new Chief
of the G.O.T.T.,

165
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,750
I will not sit idly by
and allow this to happen.

166
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,875
In accordance with the
duties of my office,

167
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,375
and in the interests
of galactic peace,

168
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,583
I will use the full force and
might of this organization

169
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,125
to ensure that
order is restored!

170
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,083
It sounds like
she's declaring war.

171
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,625
She doesn't have that
kind of authority!

172
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,083
Actually, the Senate just
issued a new mandate.

173
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,458
Seems they're adopting more
of a hard-line stance.

174
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,333
If there was a question
over whether or not

175
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,208
she has the authority,
she does now.

176
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,125
That's crazy...

177
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,916
Are you sure that this is the
best course of action to take?

178
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,291
After all, you've always
hated the Nouvlesse,

179
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,916
and everything
they stand for.

180
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,458
You'd think by now I wouldn't
have to explain myself to you.

181
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,250
We're going to play the part
of puppets for a while.

182
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,500
And little
by little,

183
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,250
we'll climb our way
up the strings,

184
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,208
until we have them
by the throat.

185
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,875
It's always worked for
us in the past...

186
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,333
Why should this time
be any different?

187
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,958
Attention!
Come to order!

188
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,791
From this
day forward,

189
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,583
all those who would seek
to harm our great union

190
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,875
through their cries for
financial independence

191
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,166
or autonomy,

192
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,916
or any who attempt
to defy the Nouvlesse,

193
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,416
will be dealt with,
swiftly and severely!

194
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,416
Any who attempt to
defy the Nouvlesse

195
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
will be dealt with,
swiftly and severely!

196
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,958
...will be dealt
with swiftly...

197
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,416
...and severe..ly...

198
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,958
Don't stop!

199
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,291
Go back!

200
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,250
You have
been warned.

201
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,916
You have no right
to do this!

202
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,458
I don't care what
your contract says!

203
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,666
They're humans!
You don't own them!

204
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,625
If you want to shoot them,
you'll have to shoot me first!

205
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,833
But before
you try it,

206
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,958
you better be ready
for me to shoot back!

207
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,083
To all planetary governments
or antisocial elements

208
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,958
that oppose the
order set forth by

209
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,583
the G.U. and it's
ruling class,

210
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,750
the Nouvlesse- you
have been warned!

211
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,083
The G.O.T.T. is
prepared to strike!

212
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,291
Any and all who oppose
us will be eliminated!

213
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,625
th-th.. they're...

214
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,083
That's it...

215
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,500
They're..
st-still...

216
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,000
Impossible...

217
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,208
Dextera!

218
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,125
Yes, I
see it.

219
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:30,541
They're... still... h-..
h-.. hu.. human... y-you...

220
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,625
y-you have n-no
right... right...

221
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,291
What's wrong
with you?

222
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:39,625
You wish to speak? Well,
then. By all means...

223
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,958
"The G.O.T.T. will
systematically eliminate

224
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,291
any and all
antisocial elements

225
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,291
that dare to
oppose us!"

226
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,458
Th- The G.O....
T.T. will...

227
00:17:54,541 --> 00:18:00,416
...systematically...
e-eliminate...

228
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,541
...any- any
and all...

229
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,541
--anti... s-social...

230
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,791
--no... no...

231
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,625
--th- that...
d-dare... to --no...

232
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:15,416
No! No! No!
No! No! NO!

233
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,916
You have no right
to do this!

234
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,541
I don't care what
your contract says!

235
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,083
They're humans!
You don't own them!

236
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,583
You have no right
to do this!

237
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,666
They're human!
You don't own them!

238
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,666
What?!

239
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,958
Come to
order!

240
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,458
They're human... you have
no right... no right...

241
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,875
How dare you?
You would defy me?

242
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,458
You are a mere ES Member! Who
are you to defy the Chief?!

243
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,583
Die.

244
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,916
Let's go!

245
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,333
That's right. The
rules do say:

246
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,458
A G.O.T.T. ES Member
may not disobey

247
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,625
a direct order
from the Chief!

248
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,916
But... I'm gonna go
out on a limb here

249
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,750
and say whoever
wrote that rule

250
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,500
probably didn't have a
Chief like you in mind!

251
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,958
Of course, I suppose
it's a moot point.

252
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,250
Because you're not really
the "Chief", now are you?

253
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,791
The official title is
"Acting Chief", right?

254
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,208
What are you
doing?! Kill them!

255
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,666
So, it's
true...

256
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,541
Looks like there's still
some hope for you two.

257
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,458
Eliminate
the intruders!

258
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,750
Eliminate...
the intruders...

259
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,875
Eliminate...

260
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,375
You've done enough
for one day.

261
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,291
Rest now.

262
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,416
Who sent you? The Global
Union? The Nouvlesse?

263
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,833
Whose ES Members
are you?

264
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:46,166
Sounds like you've been busy
making enemies, huh "Éclair"?

265
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,500
Answer me!
Who are you?!

266
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:53,041
Well, you're right about one
thing. We're not your friends.

267
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,416
Sorry we can't stay
and chat more...

268
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,625
But we'll be
seeing you around.

269
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,125
After them!

270
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,916
What's going on?
Who was that?

271
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,208
I dunno...

272
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,750
This is an
emergency alert.

273
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,083
All available security forces
cordon off the city at once!

274
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,458
At this time, the ceremony has
been temporarily suspended,

275
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,500
while a full-scale military
search has been launched.

276
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,416
However, the identity
of the mysterious pair

277
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,333
that caused
the disruption...

278
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,750
A laughing face...
A weeping face...

279
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,916
When all the masks we hide
behind are torn away...

280
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,875
what will our
true face reveal?

281
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:38,000
Next time, on Kiddy Grade:
"Unmasked / Face"
