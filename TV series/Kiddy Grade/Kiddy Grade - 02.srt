1
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,791
[Max] I see you've
made improvements.

2
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,583
However, you still
haven't perfected

3
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,250
the refinement
process.

4
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,166
There are irregularities
in the crystal alignment.

5
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,250
It's well within
acceptable tolerances.

6
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,708
That's the highest
purity level

7
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,291
we can reach
with our equipment.

8
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,250
MAX does not
manufacture products

9
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,750
that are merely
"acceptable".

10
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,708
Our clients demand
perfection. Nothing less.

11
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,208
You will have
to do better.

12
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,875
[Alarm sounding]

13
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,916
The alarm. What
is this, a raid?

14
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,333
[Alv] That's right.

15
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,250
You are hereby charged with the
illegal production and sale

16
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,541
of the gravity control
material "Hi-G".

17
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,708
I suggest you
come quietly.

18
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,458
Who... Who are
you people?

19
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,833
G.O.T.T. ES
Members, Alv...

20
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,833
And Dverger.

21
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,708
[Max] Don't just stand
there! Shoot them!

22
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,791
[Trooper] Hi-G. So that's
what they confiscated.

23
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,458
That's some prize.

24
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,625
No wonder they wanted
to keep it secret.

25
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,958
We don't need the commentary.
Just do your job.

26
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,208
Sorry, sir.

27
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
It's empty.

28
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,000
Have a nice
day, sir.

29
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,000
You know, jealousy
isn't very becoming.

30
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,458
And besides, I don't think
scowling at the S-Class members

31
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,583
is going to change the
fact that they outrank us.

32
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,750
I'm not jealous! I
just- I hate the way

33
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,208
they act like they're
better than everyone else!

34
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,541
Really? I wonder if you'd
still feel that way

35
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,166
if you had abilities
equal to theirs?

36
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,375
[Alv] Hold on.
What do you mean?!

37
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,541
Empty. There was
nothing inside.

38
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,916
[Dverger] You're
sure about this?

39
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,416
Yes. I should
also note,

40
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,750
the seal on the container
was securely intact.

41
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,416
[Dverger] We know.
We sealed it.

42
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,375
What is this?
A trick? A trap?

43
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,083
Someone's trying
to set us up!

44
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,875
[Eclipse] Mercredi,
report this incident

45
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,458
to Tweedledee
and Tweedledum.

46
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,166
Have them
look into it.

47
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,208
[Alv] Wait a second!

48
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,500
This is our mess. We can
clean up after ourselves,

49
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,083
if you
don't mind.

50
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,000
[Eclipse] Very well...

51
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,208
But you'll be taking along
a support team this time.

52
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,250
Y-yes, ma'am.

53
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,250
Mercredi, give Éclair and
Lumiere the assignment.

54
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,666
[Mercredi] Right
away, Chief.

55
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,833
I'll also inform Inspector
Armblast of the situation.

56
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,666
This is the
binary system

57
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,250
formed by the stars
Latium and Latinus.

58
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,875
The artificial satellite
in close orbit around them

59
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,916
is the maximum-security
detention center "Globe-Cage"...

60
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,750
That's where the
MAX operatives

61
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,041
currently in custody
are being held.

62
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,875
Yeah, yeah. We
heard the briefing.

63
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,083
We don't need
a guided tour.

64
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,375
If you have
a problem,

65
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,250
feel free to turn
back at any time.

66
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,458
If it were
up to me,

67
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,000
I wouldn't be here
in the first place...

68
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,541
I'm sorry.
What was that?

69
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,250
What was what?
I didn't say anything.

70
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,333
I heard you.

71
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,458
Sorry. Must be
a bad transmission.

72
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,291
[Éclair] At this
close of an orbit,

73
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,625
I'm surprised the whole thing
doesn't just melt away...

74
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,958
That's because there's

75
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,333
a 30-times-normal-gravity
control buffer in place

76
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,833
keeping
it stable.

77
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,958
Really? So what happens if
this control buffer fails?

78
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,916
Then the detention center
falls into one of the stars.

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,541
And everyone gets
a really good tan!

80
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,000
If it's alright with you,
I think I should stay here.

81
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,500
Why? Something wrong?

82
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,500
[Armblast] You don't find it
odd that we've just entered

83
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,500
a maximum-security
facility unnoticed?

84
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,750
There should at least be
a guard here to greet us.

85
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,916
I don't know.

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,333
Maybe they're all
on their lunch break.

87
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,333
Or asleep
on the job!

88
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,416
You are being
facetious, I hope.

89
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,208
Well, we're going
with or without you.

90
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,500
If you ask me, it seems pretty
pointless for an auditor

91
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,583
to come all this
way and not audit.

92
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,041
But hey, suit
yourself I guess.

93
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,791
[Dverger]
It's just a cleaner.

94
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,583
First the missing Hi-G,
now a deserted prison.

95
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,791
Someone's tying
up loose ends.

96
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,750
Haven't you ever seen
a dead body before?

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,500
Lumiere,
what is it?

98
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,625
I feel
so... heavy.

99
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,916
Someone's planted...
a gravity bomb!

100
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,125
Alv... Use your Reflex.

101
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,041
I guess this would
be our cue to leave.

102
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,125
In any case, we're just
wasting our time here.

103
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,166
The prisoners we planned to
interrogate are already dead.

104
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,250
[Dverger] There's nothing
more we can do. Let's go.

105
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,291
[Éclair] Hold on! You could
at least give us a hand here.

106
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,750
You're both
ES Members.

107
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,958
I think you can handle
a simple gravity bomb

108
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,000
on your own.
Don't you?

109
00:09:56,541 --> 00:10:00,125
Where is it?
Why can't I find it?

110
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,958
A physical shield?

111
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,125
Best of luck, ladies.
I'll see you around.

112
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,416
Lumiere!

113
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,916
Sorry. I'm okay.
I just found the bomb.

114
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,250
I think I...
can still... stop it.

115
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,250
It's about time.

116
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,666
What was that?

117
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,875
What do
you think?

118
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,666
The gravity bomb
did it's job.

119
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,750
We're
losing orbit.

120
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:08,333
The Svard. It's not
in the docking bay.

121
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,666
It was Armblast.

122
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:23,083
What a shame. I guess they
didn't make it out in time.

123
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,541
Lumiere. This whole
place is coming apart!

124
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,208
Lumiere!

125
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,000
Lumiere?

126
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,708
A lady should
be more elegant...

127
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,708
What's going on?

128
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,708
The ship's computer wants
to go back and save them.

129
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,291
[Éclair]
They took our ship?

130
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,125
La Muse!

131
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,416
She came
for us!

132
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,583
[Éclair]
Armblast?

133
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,500
He's the one who
took the Hi-G.

134
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,291
And then he had the
audacity to steal our ship.

135
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,708
I don't believe it.
Why that two-faced...

136
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:55,958
He left
a message.

137
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,250
What, you guys
didn't open it?

138
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,958
I think we can guess
what it says. Don't you?

139
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,791
It's pretty obvious
at this point.

140
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,125
Whatever.
I'm opening it.

141
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,250
[Armblast] An
abandoned warehouse.

142
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,083
It seems rather
old-fashioned,

143
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,583
choosing a place like this
for an exchange point.

144
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,041
[Shopper] I find
that sometimes

145
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,125
the old ways are
still the best.

146
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,291
You're right on
time, "Magician".

147
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,041
Actually, my
nickname is "Wizard".

148
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,583
Not that it makes
much difference.

149
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,583
It's silly either way.
Is that a hologram?

150
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,750
In my business, the secret
to living a long life

151
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,125
is to become
a coward.

152
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,333
It's a lesson those MAX
fools never learned...

153
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,041
Ah, then the gravity
bomb at Globe-Cage...

154
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,791
A little test
of our goods.

155
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,375
Shopper manufactures a
wide variety of weapons.

156
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,500
We're now ready to add
gravity bombs to our list.

157
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,333
All we require are
the raw materials.

158
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,333
[Armblast] You mean
like Hi-G, perhaps?

159
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,250
Very nice. You've brought
me a choice sample.

160
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,000
Highly pure, few
crystal irregularities,

161
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,958
and a gravitational
deviation of zero-point-two.

162
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,333
Definitely
weapons-grade material.

163
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,125
I trust you're satisfied
with the quantity as well.

164
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,000
Just one question: are you sure
you wouldn't rather build

165
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,833
an artificial gravity
system instead of a weapon?

166
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,583
Don't pretend
to be so naive.

167
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,000
You know as
well as I do,

168
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,333
weapons are much
more profitable.

169
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,333
[Éclair] The first
rule of economics:

170
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,583
the higher the profit,
the higher the risk!

171
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,375
Or didn't you learn
that in school?

172
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,375
Taa-daaah!

173
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,708
I don't know about you guys,
but I've had enough shady deals

174
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,416
and double-crossing
for one day.

175
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
How 'bout we try something
that isn't so...

176
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,000
you know...
illegal?

177
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,375
How'd you find
us so quickly?

178
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,833
I've had Donnerschlag
keeping an eye on you

179
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,291
since the
detention center.

180
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,333
Ah, yes, I should have
known. Well, thank you.

181
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,875
I'm grateful
for the escort.

182
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,583
You're working with
them? You set me up!

183
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,208
Donner! Look after
 wise guy here for me!

184
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,750
The name's "Wizard".

185
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,708
You're kidding! My shield
is out after one blast?!

186
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,500
Elegant, Éclair!
Elegant!

187
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,000
Donner...

188
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,166
Oh no... I can't get through
while the shield is up!

189
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,208
Three...

190
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,166
Two...

191
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,125
One...

192
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,500
Zero!

193
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,125
Lumiere!
Great!

194
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,666
What the--?

195
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,250
Under our authority as
G.O.T.T. ES Members,

196
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,583
we hereby
charge you,

197
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,041
as being in direct violation
of interstellar law.

198
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,833
Chief Eclipse? Requesting
official authorization

199
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,000
to make
an arrest.

200
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,791
Éclair. Lumiere. Arrest
authorization granted.

201
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,333
Yes, ma'am!
Understood!

202
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,333
Arrest me?
Ridiculous!

203
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,000
How are you going to
arrest a hologram?!

204
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,750
Now might be a good time
to look behind you.

205
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,041
Thanks for
the diversion.

206
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,708
Chief, we've infiltrated
the Shopper Crime Syndicate.

207
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,250
We have the leader
in our custody.

208
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,916
Job well done,
Alv... Dverger.

209
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,750
Like I said, the only way to
survive is to become a coward.

210
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,541
A gravity bomb!

211
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,375
It's at point
blank range!

212
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,541
Good luck escaping
the blast radius!

213
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,458
No!

214
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,916
I should have
mentioned

215
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,666
Lumiere's ability
allows her access to

216
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,791
virtually any computer system
and bring it under her control.

217
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,000
The closer she is,
the easier it is for her.

218
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,166
[Armblast] It's a sturdy
case, isn't it?

219
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,125
It's saved my life
more than once.

220
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,583
Except now it's been
ruined, hasn't it.

221
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,916
No. Not
at all.

222
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,958
I'm quite proud of
this little treasure.

223
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,083
[Helmethead] I am very much
in your debt, young man.

224
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,458
Thanks to your help,
both of the groups

225
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,375
that were encroaching
on my territory

226
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,000
have been
neatly eliminated.

227
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,000
I can't
take credit.

228
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,791
MAX and Shopper brought their
downfall on themselves.

229
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,958
[Helmethead] Regardless.
Now that they're gone,

230
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,625
I can conduct
my own business

231
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,708
without worrying about
outside interference.

232
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,416
And for that,
I thank you.

233
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:43,250
What pretty stones. Do you
mind if I ask what they are?

234
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,458
What if I
told you

235
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,125
they were a brighter
future for 28 colonies?

236
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:55,666
Would you think I was only
trying to impress you?

237
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,416
Ha... I suppose I might...

238
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,250
Funny. You know, you're not
nearly as serious as you look.

239
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,958
[Doctor] Low
implantation rates.

240
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,000
Increased rates of deformity
during development.

241
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,250
Diminished immunity.

242
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,250
It would be negligent
of me not to warn you

243
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,708
how harsh the microgravity
environment here can be

244
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,250
on an unborn
child. However--

245
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,708
But we heard there was a new
therapy that could help...

246
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,583
Ah... So, you've heard.
As I was saying...

247
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,000
However, our colony
has received

248
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,333
a new artificial
gravity room!

249
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,416
Maria!

250
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,208
So what you're
telling us is,

251
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,666
we're gonna have
a healthy baby!

252
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,416
Well, let's head
to the next colony.

253
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,416
[Helper] Yes, sir!

254
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,083
You've done a great
thing, young man.

255
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,083
Thank you,
"Wizard".

256
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,291
[Éclair] There is no such
thing as complete freedom.

257
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:30,416
Those who escape their cage
will only find themselves

258
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,166
in a prison of
another shape...

259
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,250
Next time on Kiddy
Grade: "Prisoner/Escort"
