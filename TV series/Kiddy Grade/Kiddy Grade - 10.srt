1
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:11,000
My, you're up early
today, Éclair...

2
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,625
Wha- É- Éclair?

3
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,791
What's the
occasion?

4
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,416
Don't tell me you're
actually going into

5
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,583
work early for
a change...

6
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,041
No no- that would be
just too crazy...

7
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,250
Let me guess - you've
been up all night...

8
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:39,916
So, should I get you
your usual? Cafe latte?

9
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,875
Actually... I'll try some
tea... have the day off today.

10
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,583
In that case, how 'bout
a nice chamomile?

11
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,166
It'll help
you relax.

12
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,166
Here
you go.

13
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,458
Th- Thank you.

14
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,833
Hey, what are
you doing?

15
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,666
You shouldn't be taking
sedatives with tea!

16
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,166
You're right,
Caprice. I'm sorry.

17
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,666
Good morning, sir! I'll
be right with you, okay?

18
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,125
[Man] I'll
be here.

19
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,250
It's happening
again...!

20
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,083
[Eclipse] Now you can't
just go charging in there.

21
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,375
Try using some
restraint for once.

22
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,625
[Éclair] Oh, c'mon.
We'll be fine

23
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,750
as long as the
backup's in place.

24
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,750
[Lumiere] There. I've
bypassed the security system.

25
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,708
[Éclair 3] Good. Let's go.
Try to keep up, Eclipse!

26
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,541
Chief Eclipse?!
What is she-?

27
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,791
[Éclair 4] It's
been half a year

28
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,416
since I first looked upon your
dirty faces here, Recruits.

29
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,416
Six long and
difficult months.

30
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,083
Your ranks have
thinned since then.

31
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,416
The weaklings,
the wash-outs,

32
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,416
they are gone now.
Only the best remain.

33
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,583
And now, the time has come
for you to prove yourselves.

34
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,416
As you know, our National
Planetary Federation

35
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,250
has been thrust
into a state of war

36
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,333
Is that me?

37
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,583
with the Planetary
Republican Union.

38
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,833
The time has come

39
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,750
for you to earn your pay
as Federation Soldiers!

40
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,916
Training is done...
As of this moment,

41
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,208
you are each appointed to your
respective ranks and duties...

42
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:42,041
But before you go... I will
give you one final order:

43
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,083
Don't get killed...
That is all.

44
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,833
[Éclair 5] Let me out
of here! Let me out!

45
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,750
We can't let them do this!
If we don't stop them,

46
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,250
millions of people are
going to die! Millions!

47
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:20,708
Please!
Why...? Why?!

48
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,458
It's time...

49
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,583
Aren't you
going to fire?

50
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,750
No. I can't do this...
I won't do it...

51
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,375
Not of my own
free will.

52
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:45,750
Hands in the air... 
Away from the console.

53
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,541
It's
no use.

54
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,000
[Éclair 6]
No...

55
00:07:55,166 --> 00:08:00,500
It's been set to fire since
before we left Aineias.

56
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:04,291
Aineias? But that means the
G.O.T.T. was responsible for-

57
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,041
What is
this place?

58
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,250
[Éclair 7] Oh, you poor
thing, are you hungry?

59
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,291
Hehe! No, no!

60
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,125
We'll have to find some
milk for you somewhere else.

61
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,416
Please,
no more.

62
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:50,083
Are you
okay?

63
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,583
Were you having a bad
dream or something?

64
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:58,500
Sorry.

65
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:05,083
No, it's... it's my fault...
Sorry if I caused any trouble.

66
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,416
What's
that for?

67
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,416
That should be enough
to settle my tab.

68
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,291
What, are you saying you're
not coming back anymore?

69
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,750
Well, fine! Don't come
back! We don't need you!

70
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,125
Stupid.

71
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,083
Stupid to think normal
drugs would work on...

72
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,166
someone like me...

73
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,083
It's starting to
make sense now...

74
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,083
It's been a long
time, Éclair!

75
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,166
Yes, I'd recognize
you anywhere!

76
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,416
I don't remember who I was
before! This is who I am!

77
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,791
He was talking about my
Predecessors... Pre-holders-

78
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,541
the women who carried the
codename Éclair before me...

79
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,416
Predecessors...?
Pre-holders...?

80
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,791
Don't pretend to be so naive... 
Those words mean nothing...

81
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,708
They don't
change the truth.

82
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,875
Stop! I already know
what you're going to say!

83
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:48,750
But it's not true... 
...I'm not like you...

84
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,291
Oh, no?

85
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,250
You can't escape
your past.

86
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,791
You can't erase the
harm you've done.

87
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,250
No matter how many times
you die and are reborn,

88
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,458
you cannot change
who you are.

89
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,750
Predecessor..?

90
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,666
Do you really think that you
are somehow separate from me?

91
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,291
Look
closely...

92
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,125
You're the one with
blood on your hands.

93
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,500
Yes... This
is Éclair.

94
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,083
[Mercredi] Chief. Éclair
is here, as you requested.

95
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,583
Good. Send
her in.

96
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,958
Chief, um...
Éclair is still-

97
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,958
Thank you, Mercredi.
That will be all.

98
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,583
Of course.
Excuse me.

99
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,041
It's me.

100
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,458
Yes, I've been
expecting you.

101
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,875
This is Omega. The
operation is proceeding...

102
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,625
But we've hit a couple
unexpected snags...

103
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,000
The good news is,

104
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,333
we've secured eighty
percent of the scheduled data

105
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,875
and a sample of the E-4
material. The bad new is,

106
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,958
these crooks are being
aided by another ES unit.

107
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,333
From what
we've seen,

108
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,958
I don't think they work
for the Pelian government...

109
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,041
But they're no small-time
smuggling outfit, either.

110
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,250
My guess is, they've been
sent in by a third party.

111
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,708
We can deal
with them.

112
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,416
But we'll need to move our
schedule back a few counts.

113
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,791
Omega Out.

114
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,833
I need the two of you to
help extract Anoh and Eioh

115
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,250
from their
current situation...

116
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,000
Ordinarily, an
assignment of this nature

117
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,041
would go to Tweedledee
and Tweedledum.

118
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,500
But I'm afraid time
will not allow us

119
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,583
that option
in this case.

120
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,291
Yes, Chief.
Understood.

121
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,750
Right.
Understood, Chief.

122
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,416
I'm sorry, we're
in a bit of a hurry.

123
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,916
I think the usual
should suffice.

124
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,208
What's this?

125
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,041
If you're planning to
save someone's life,

126
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,083
take the
forty-five...

127
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,750
If you're planning to put
the barrel in your mouth,

128
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,208
the nine-millimeter
is more than enough.

129
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,000
[Lumiere] Planet Pelias is
located in this region,

130
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,500
on the edge of
the frontier.

131
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,750
It is technically a part
of the Global Union...

132
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,916
[Armblast] However, that hasn't
stopped the criminal element

133
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,250
from making
it their own.

134
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,791
Thanks to the lax
local government,

135
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,083
it's become something
of a Smuggler's Heaven.

136
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,500
Which I guess...

137
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,208
would make it hell for
anyone sent in to investigate.

138
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,375
[Lumiere] Units have
been put in place,

139
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,875
and are
preparing to move

140
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,541
against a number of smuggling
operations simultaneously.

141
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,875
But we'll be going in in
advance of the raid,

142
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,375
to make sure Anoh and Eioh
escape safely with their data.

143
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,083
I see, just a quick jaunt
through the gates of hell.

144
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,208
You must really be looking
forward to this, Éclair.

145
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,375
That's
right...

146
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,166
You know, I'm starting
to get the feeling

147
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,750
they don't like
us very much...

148
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,541
I don't think they found
your disguise very funny...

149
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,375
Yeah, but did you see
their sorry faces?

150
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,500
Even their ears were red!
I thought they were gonna-

151
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,875
What was
that?

152
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:11,208
I don't know...
It's as if...

153
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,583
We're caught in some
kind of force field.

154
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,583
It's the
ES Members.

155
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,416
Oh, great... These guys
again. Don't they ever quit?

156
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,458
Eat this!

157
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,291
Come on! Why aren't
the torpedoes

158
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,916
getting through
the shield?!

159
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Phase interference. Looks like
they're one step ahead of us.

160
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,125
So, they've
got us...

161
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,916
[Lumiere] Well, with that
sort of negative attitude,

162
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,375
it's a wonder you've even
managed to make it this far.

163
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,916
It's nice to see
you two again.

164
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,041
Uh,
Lumiere?

165
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,083
Where's
Éclair?

166
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,000
She stepped outside
for a moment...

167
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:04,708
You're
kidding!

168
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,291
Punch it!

169
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,791
I can't
get a lock!

170
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,250
Yeah? So try again!
I can't shake it!

171
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,958
[Lumiere] It's a
biological homing array.

172
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,666
Standard countermeasures
won't work.

173
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,458
Well that just
figures, doesn't it!

174
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,500
Éclair!

175
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:16,041
Donner!

176
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,166
Is she-?

177
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,083
Don't do it!
Stop, Éclair!

178
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:27,625
Éclair! No!

179
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,041
Goodbye...

180
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,208
Éclair!

181
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,458
After all
I told you,

182
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,958
you're still trying
to escape your past...

183
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,666
Is that what
you think?

184
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,541
Where am I?

185
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,708
Grandma!
I hate you!

186
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,041
What's
the matter?

187
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,541
Grandma said she's
going to die...

188
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,750
But it's not
true, is it?

189
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,791
Maybe it's
her time...

190
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,416
When someone's
accomplished everything

191
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,916
they have to do
in this life...

192
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,583
They get called away
to the next one.

193
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,291
Your Grandma knows
that... Look at her,

194
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,916
sitting there. She
isn't sad, or afraid...

195
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,250
But I... I want her to
stay with me forever...

196
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,208
Yes... which is why you
should stay with her now.

197
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,708
We only have the
time we're given.

198
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:07,041
One day...
everyone dies.

199
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,916
Even you...

200
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,500
...and me...

201
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,833
Well... that's
quite a speech,

202
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,583
coming from someone
like you...

203
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,958
Considering what you've
done with your time...

204
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,041
You're right... I do
have blood on my hands.

205
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,083
I know I can't
change that.

206
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,000
But that doesn't mean
I can't change myself.

207
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,458
It doesn't mean I
have to be like you...

208
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,541
Right now, this life
is mine to live...

209
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,916
And I'll do what
I have to do...

210
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,750
until I've made
peace with my past,

211
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,666
like that woman
over there.

212
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,041
Go ahead. You can
try all you want...

213
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:54,458
But I am a part of you...
I will always be with you.

214
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:01,458
Yeah... keep watch
over me, okay?

215
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,291
So... Will you be needing
these any longer?

216
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:28,500
If not, I'll be happy to
throw them away for you.

217
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,041
Good morning!
Be right with you!

218
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,958
The usual?

219
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,458
We cry for
release...

220
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:29,250
But the moment we break
through our heavy chains,

221
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:32,250
the weight of
freedom falls upon us...

222
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:37,583
