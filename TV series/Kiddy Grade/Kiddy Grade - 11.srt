1
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,666
The Nouvlesse
have ignored

2
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,833
our human rights
for too long!

3
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,083
Go back
to Earth!

4
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,625
We will not allow this
tyrannical oppression

5
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,833
to continue!
We are not slaves!

6
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,583
How I detest
this noise.

7
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,458
Yes. It sounds
like they've managed

8
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,083
to acquire a
few megaphones.

9
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,666
Uh, please excuse me, sir.
Continuing with my report-

10
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,833
Enough! Let's hear
these supposed

11
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,958
"radical measures"
you've concocted.

12
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,333
Of course. As I was saying,
this last rash of sabotage

13
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,833
could technically be
considered economic terrorism.

14
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:18,833
And...?

15
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,250
And.. therefore,
we could file suit

16
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,875
with the Galactic Organization
of Trade and Tariffs.

17
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:30,333
Very well. But understand,
I want this handled quietly.

18
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:42,041
Ah... So they do actually
have troubles in paradise.

19
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:46,250
Then, this is a suit filed
by the Aurean government?

20
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,000
In a sense. But to
be more precise,

21
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,416
it comes from the
administrative offices.

22
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,333
Aure does not have an
independent government.

23
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,833
The planet is privately
owned by the Nouvlesse.

24
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,875
Th- The
whole planet?

25
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:02,375
Authentication complete.
G.O.T.T. cruiser La Muse,

26
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:06,333
approach on course A-3-0-7
for entry inspection.

27
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:11,166
Code 3-3-5-7-2-1-2. Over.

28
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,500
They call that an entry
inspection? It's a violation!

29
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,833
And on top of
everything else,

30
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,875
they say we can't bring La
Muse or Donnerschlag?!

31
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,500
Who do they
think they are?!

32
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,625
There's no sense in
kicking the wall.

33
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,083
Besides, was it
really so bad?

34
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,458
I know I for one
didn't mind seeing you

35
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,041
without your
clothes on.

36
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,958
You'll never
learn, will you?

37
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,666
I'm an auditor. It's
my duty to observe.

38
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:43,250
Oh... It's so blue!
Even bluer than Aineias!

39
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,916
It's just like all
the pictures of Earth.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,833
As it was intended,
I'm sure.

41
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,250
"Aure" is an ancient
word meaning "garden".

42
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,500
That's exactly what this planet
has become. A beautiful garden,

43
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,625
created in the image
of an ideal Earth.

44
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,000
It's
incredible!

45
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,000
So does this mean you're
not angry anymore?

46
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,625
Just smell that air.
All those flowers!

47
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,791
We're going
in now.

48
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,541
Right! Coming!

49
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,416
Welcome to Aure, the
'Secret Flower Garden'.

50
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,708
I am Assistant
Director Mister.

51
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,958
I hope you were
not put off

52
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,916
by the stringency of
our entry inspection...

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,708
Uh... No.

54
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,500
Spoken like a
true ES Member.

55
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,208
Always elegant,
even under pressure.

56
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,583
Thank you, sir.

57
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,875
As you know, Aure
prides itself

58
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,458
on its long history
as a vacation planet.

59
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,958
Is that right?

60
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,666
Unlike other planets, every
aspect of our environment -

61
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,083
gravity, atmosphere,
vegetation-

62
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,333
has been recreated here
exactly as it is on Earth.

63
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,708
The only difference,
of course,

64
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,458
being that we've removed
the season of winter.

65
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,083
But, why? I mean, it must
take constant terraforming

66
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,333
to maintain
this place.

67
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,166
I'd think
that obvious.

68
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,416
We Nouvlesse are
very particular

69
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,875
when it comes
to our comfort.

70
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,083
Ordinarily, the
costs involved

71
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,000
in terraforming
an "ideal planet"

72
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,833
like this one
are prohibitive.

73
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,625
Therefore, humans
have been forced to

74
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,750
adapt themselves to a wide
variety of environments.

75
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,583
But the Nouvlesse
are an exception.

76
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,916
They refuse
to adapt,

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,625
in order to maintain their
"purity" as Earthlings.

78
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:44,500
Yeah, yeah. I know that much.
They're just... so stuck up.

79
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,000
They're the
Nouvlesse.

80
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,250
They're arrogant because
they can afford to be.

81
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,708
We're coming up on the
manufacturing facility now.

82
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,833
Quiet, isn't it? Not
even half the laborers

83
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,833
have bothered to
report to work.

84
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,333
It's the same
everywhere...

85
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,125
Aure's jewelry is the
finest in the galaxy,

86
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,000
but with these recent trends
of sabotage and worker unrest

87
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,416
taking hold
over the planet,

88
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,166
our production has virtually
been ground to a halt.

89
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,958
I don't mean to interfere with
your internal affairs but,

90
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,000
have you
considered listening

91
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,833
to what the citizens
have to say?

92
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,666
But the opinion of the
citizens are of no-

93
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,875
But they are not citizens.
They are laborers.

94
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,291
Right, I
just meant...

95
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,833
For generations, these
laborers have been bound to us

96
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,500
under a perpetual lifetime
employment contract.

97
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,166
In other words,
we own them.

98
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,583
Let's hurry along. We haven't
even been through half

99
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,208
the scheduled
inspection yet.

100
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,375
So, if you "own" these
laborers, are they cyborgs?

101
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,000
Of course not.
I'm proud to say

102
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,208
there isn't a single
cyborg on all of Aure.

103
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,541
We do not use
machines or androids.

104
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,291
All of our goods are
luxuriously handcrafted.

105
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,750
This may not be the most
efficient means of manufacture,

106
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,916
but we find it adds
to the aesthetic.

107
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:10,916
Well, it seems we've
stumbled onto a demonstration.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,916
Build schools!

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,416
Give us the
freedom to relocate!

110
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,250
Don't you allow them to leave
the planet for any reason?

111
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,791
Heavens, no.

112
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,208
We can't have the laborers
thinking they can

113
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,833
shirk their contractual
obligation-

114
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,166
Speaking of which,

115
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,833
I wonder if you'd mind
doing a little job for me.

116
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,000
Assistant Director, what
is it you want me to do?

117
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,333
I'd like you to stop this
demonstration, all by yourself.

118
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,833
You what?!

119
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,041
The military police will be
standing by to assist you.

120
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,875
But I thought we might
first give them the chance

121
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,000
to see a G.O.T.T.
ES Member in action.

122
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:44,708
But...

123
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,208
Don't
hold back.

124
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,875
Éclair you to make a firm
example of these protesters.

125
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,750
And if I won't, the
military police will.

126
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,208
Each planet has its own set
of rules and regulations.

127
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,500
And regardless of whether
or not we agree with them,

128
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,916
that's the way things are
throughout the galaxy.

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,666
We can't
change it.

130
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,666
Yeah, but... who do these
Nouvlesse think they are?

131
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,000
Have you forgotten the
reason why we're here?

132
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,750
We are to do
whatever's necessary

133
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,500
to help the Aurean
administration

134
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,666
restore normal
economic activities.

135
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,416
Those were the Chief's exact
orders. She was very specific.

136
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,833
And an ES Member can't
disobey a direct order

137
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,708
from the Chief
of the G.O.T.T.

138
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,833
Is that what
you're saying?

139
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,250
Yes,
that's right.

140
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,208
Hey, why did
everybody stop?

141
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,541
Who is that?!

142
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,375
Doesn't look like
the military police.

143
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,125
One'a the
administrators dogs.

144
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:39,291
Whoever she is, she can't stop
all of us! Let's keep moving!

145
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,083
An ES Member can't
disobey a direct order

146
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,916
from the Chief
of the G.O.T.T.

147
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,666
Stop! I can't let
you go any farther!

148
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,166
Don't stop! Push
your way through!

149
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,208
Please, listen to
me! Turn around!

150
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,083
Put your
backs into it!

151
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,083
Go back! Please,
don't make me do this-

152
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,416
She's not human! She's
a cyborg or somethin'!

153
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,000
Some kinda'
machine!

154
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,958
She's a puppet
for the Nouvlesse!

155
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,291
Please!
Stop!

156
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,333
I beg you.
Go back.

157
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,041
Well. It would seem
your reputation

158
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,625
for "elegance
under pressure"

159
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,833
has been greatly
exaggerated.

160
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,166
I will be waiting at the
Administrative Offices.

161
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,625
A hotel room has been
arranged for you.

162
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:58,000
Once you've cleaned off
the filth, come see me.

163
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,083
About face!

164
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:14,875
It's not true, what he said.
You've never been more elegant.

165
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,291
Hi there! Would you
like some flowers?

166
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,791
Excuse us,
please.

167
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,708
We are here as guests
of the administrati-

168
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:47,375
No. It's okay. I can clean up
in the fountain at the park.

169
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,083
Éclair!

170
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,333
Are you two
all right?

171
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,750
Kanoe!

172
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,333
Did you
see that?!

173
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,166
So, anyway, thanks
for saving my sister.

174
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,666
You're welcome. But I'm
sorry I was so dirty.

175
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,375
I guess I made a mess
of us both, didn't I?

176
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,833
Don't worry
about it.

177
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,625
She's always rollin'
around in the dirt anyway.

178
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,625
Am not!

179
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,166
Sorry I thought you
were scary before.

180
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,625
You're really
pretty, Éclair!

181
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,041
Thank you!

182
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,708
See?
Pretty!

183
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,958
She's
beautiful.

184
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,333
Ah, so you've been looking
after Yott and Kanoe, eh?

185
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,833
Here. It's
nothing fancy,

186
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,708
but eat as much as you
want. On the house.

187
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,666
Come on, Aunt Etta,
don't you have something

188
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,250
better we can
give her?

189
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,166
What's that supposed to mean?
I know it may not be gourmet,

190
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,416
but I've never heard
anyone complain.

191
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,791
Oh, really? So
all these years,

192
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,333
I guess I just haven't been
complainin' loud enough.

193
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,583
And if you start
now, Garrett,

194
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,583
you're gonna be eating
that hat instead!

195
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,541
Hey, Bateau.
Come on in.

196
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:46,916
It's her! She's the one who
broke up our demonstration!

197
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,500
One of the
administrators' dogs!?

198
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,291
A spy!?

199
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,333
Who brought
them here?

200
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,875
She's one
of them?

201
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,666
If the administrators have
discovered our plan, then...

202
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,750
I don't feed dogs
at my table.

203
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:19,166
It's not true, is it Éclair?
I mean, you're not really a...

204
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,541
I was at the demonstration
earlier today.

205
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,458
I work for
the G.O.T.T.

206
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,000
But, I didn't come
here as a spy-

207
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,583
Go away!

208
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:40,250
Please, just... get
out. Get out now.

209
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,833
Some turnout
tonight.

210
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,250
It's a reception for
those G.O.T.T. pigs.

211
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,416
The administrators
wanna show 'em off.

212
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,208
Really?
Sounds serious.

213
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,000
Hmph. What difference can
a couple people make?

214
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,541
Those are the ES Members? They
look like ordinary girls to me.

215
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,416
Oh, but appearances
are deceiving.

216
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,416
There's more to them
than meets the eye.

217
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,541
Did you hear?

218
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,166
One of them supposedly
overwhelmed

219
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,000
an entire crowd
of demonstrators!

220
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,875
You mean children,
making play at revolution!

221
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,333
In any case, I'll just be glad
when all of these troubles

222
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,500
are safely
behind us.

223
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,000
What I wouldn't have given, for
just a spoonful of that soup.

224
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,541
Is it all
happening again?

225
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,708
Men! Are
we cattle?

226
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,291
No!

227
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,958
Men! Are
we machines?

228
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,791
No!

229
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,958
No. We are humans, all of us!
Humans, born to live our lives,

230
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,916
to work out our days, and to
raise our children in peace!

231
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,166
That's right! We're not gonna
be toys for the Nouvlesse!

232
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,125
Our ancestors, dying of
thirst, gasping for air,

233
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,458
living in
desperate poverty,

234
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,166
turned to the
Nouvlesse for help.

235
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,750
Yeah! They signed
away our freedom!

236
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,750
Our ancestors' lives were
saved by that contract.

237
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,458
And their children, and
their children's children!

238
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,125
For this, we owe
the Nouvlesse

239
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,458
our deepest gratitude and
respect. But nothing more.

240
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,500
We are not cattle!
We are not machines!

241
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,000
We are humans!
Just as they are!

242
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:32,666
And after 300 years of slavery,
our debt to them has been paid!

243
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,666
We will no longer
be deprived!

244
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,791
Of the fruits of our hard
labor! Of our dignity!

245
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,958
Or of our freedom!

246
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,375
And to the administrators
and their puppets,

247
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,916
we will cry
out as one!

248
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,833
There she is, Yott.
Just like I told you.

249
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,333
Laborers! I order
you to disperse!

250
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,333
What you are doing constitutes
a serious breach of contract.

251
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,875
What you're doing constitutes a
serious breach of human rights!

252
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,583
If you refuse to
comply peacefully,

253
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,875
I have been
authorized to use any

254
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,333
and all means of
force at my disposal.

255
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,416
In other words, if they don't
leave, he's going to kill them.

256
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,791
We will not be intimidated
by your threats!

257
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,291
Even if we
die here,

258
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,625
our cause
will live on!

259
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,500
The Nouvlesse will one day
be expelled from Aure!

260
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,625
You have
been warned.

261
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,875
They
shot them!

262
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,750
Stop!

263
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,583
You have no right
to do this!

264
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,500
I don't care what
your contract says!

265
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,875
They're humans!
You don't own them!

266
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,291
Well, once again,
you disappoint me.

267
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,750
I'd have thought a
G.O.T.T. ES Member

268
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,416
would be better able to
maintain her composure.

269
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,041
You call killing people with
that smug look on your face

270
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,666
maintaining composure?!

271
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,958
Not yet.

272
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,833
You've exploited these
people for generations,

273
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,375
but you call them
the criminals!

274
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,125
So you shoot them
in cold-blood!

275
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:28,208
And all because you Nouvlesse
are too weak or too afraid

276
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,833
to adapt yourselves to
the rest of the universe!

277
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,583
I knew it.

278
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,166
I trust you've been following
the situation, Chief Eclipse?

279
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,500
No! You deal
with me!

280
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,250
This is most
unacceptable.

281
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,041
How do you explain the
actions of this ES Member?

282
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,375
Mister!

283
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,500
My deepest apologies,
Assistant Director Mister.

284
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,750
Chief...!

285
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,041
No! Don't do it!

286
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,583
ES Member Éclair. I
order you to stand down.

287
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,833
You will apologize to the
Assistant Director at once.

288
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,333
Chief, no...

289
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,708
Listen to me! An ES Member
cannot disobey a direct order

290
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,958
from the Chief of
the G.O.T.T.!

291
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,458
Hey! Now you
splash me, too!

292
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,000
Let me out
of here!

293
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,416
You have
been warned.

294
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,333
Hands in the air...
Away from the console.

295
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,666
I gave you an
order, Éclair.

296
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,916
Éclair!

297
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,916
Fire!

298
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:23,750
Éclair!

299
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,458
Éclair!

300
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,958
What is this?

301
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,791
She's gone mad!

302
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,375
Stop it,
Éclair!

303
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,833
I told you, didn't I?
You can't escape your past.

304
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,541
You will always be
destined to repeat it.

305
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,333
You are in direct
violation of orders!

306
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,541
Stand down,
Éclair!

307
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,000
If you want to shoot them,
you'll have to shoot me first!

308
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,166
But before
you try it,

309
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,041
you better be ready for
me to shoot back!

310
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:09,500
Éclair!

311
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,708
Kill all
of them!

312
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,666
Lumiere!

313
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,625
What did you expect?
We're partners, aren't we?

314
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,291
Hey...

315
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,833
Yes, I know.
Enact Plan C-5!

316
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,708
Citizens of Aure!
Our time has come!

317
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:03,833
...To revolt!

318
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,208
So much for handling
things quietly.

319
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't know what
happened, sir.

320
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:33,666
We have decided it best to cut
our losses... Aure... and you.

321
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,833
There. Quieter already.

322
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,875
The last thing we Nouvlesse
need is more trouble.

323
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,750
So, a bloodless
revolution...

324
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,000
Without the funds for
continuous terraforming,

325
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,666
this planet
won't last long.

326
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,000
Winter is
coming to Aure.

327
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,750
This order has been issued
by the Privy Council,

328
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,000
and with full support
by the G.U. Senate.

329
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,375
Mister Secretary, are
you saying that this

330
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,666
is the consensus
of the Nouvlesse?

331
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,833
No, Superintendent General.

332
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,291
I'm saying this
is the consensus

333
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,416
of the ruling bodies
of the Global Union.

334
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,208
Is something funny
here, Chief Eclipse?

335
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,666
I'm sorry. I just find
the thought amusing,

336
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,166
that the galaxy's great
Nouvlesse could be so upset

337
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,708
by two
little girls.

338
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,000
Éclair and
Lumiere, huh?

339
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,791
They've been expelled
from the ES?!

340
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,500
Registrations... deleted.

341
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:48,166
In other words,
they're being purged.

342
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,375
It is an
endless cycle:

343
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:30,208
somewhere, a person is
born and another dies.

344
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,666
It cannot
be broken.

345
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,375
It is as inevitable as
the passing of time.

346
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:38,291
