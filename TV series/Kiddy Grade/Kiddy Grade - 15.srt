1
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,458
So... the time has
finally come...

2
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,666
You're welcome, sir, and enjoy
your visit to the G.O.T.T.

3
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,791
1030 hours..
All clear..

4
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,916
Nothing abnormal to report
on sensors or optics.

5
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,791
Ricki?
What is it?

6
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,166
I don't know.
For a second,

7
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,791
I thought I saw
Éclair and Lumiere.

8
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,500
You could at least
try to cheer up...

9
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,708
Cheer up? So you want me
to be happy about this?

10
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,750
Sister...

11
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,458
No matter what happens, I'll
be right there by your side.

12
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,750
Tweedledum...

13
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,708
No matter
what...

14
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,208
This stinks. We shouldn't
even be here today.

15
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,625
Don't give
me that look.

16
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,125
I heard the orders
just like you did...

17
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,083
"All ES Members not
on active duty

18
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,750
are to remain on stand-by
'til further notice."

19
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,041
But this was supposed
to be my vacation!

20
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,000
What about
all my plans?!

21
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,291
Don't worry... I'll be
ready when the time comes.

22
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:02,208
But that doesn't mean
I have to like it.

23
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:10,000
Interesting. First Éclair and
Lumiere.. Now Un-ou and A-ou..

24
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,208
Looks like all the
G.O.T.T.'s brightest stars

25
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,958
are falling
from grace.

26
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,250
Does it?

27
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,875
I beg to
differ.

28
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,833
ES Members, by the very
nature of their work,

29
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:24,708
must live in the shadows.
They are not bright stars.

30
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:29,250
I forgot... that's an honor
reserved for the Chief, right?

31
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,791
They've certainly picked an
opportune time to come,

32
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,625
with Dextera and Sinistra
still on assignment.

33
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,041
So it
would seem.

34
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:41,875
Just leave it to us. We've got
it all worked out. Trust me.

35
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,708
New explosion! Tower 2!
Section 35-A! Sir!

36
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,458
I'm reading fifteen
separate disturbances!

37
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,666
What's
the cause?!

38
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,458
Unknown! But they appear
to be both physical

39
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,000
and logical
attacks!

40
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,333
Silence
those alarms!

41
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,500
Start listening for anyone
still trapped inside!

42
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,500
Understood!

43
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,291
Everyone! This
way! Quickly!

44
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,208
Stay calm!

45
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,916
You'd better get
outta here, too!

46
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,208
All the explosions were
in Towers 1 and 3, right?

47
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,375
That's what
I heard.

48
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,708
We can still take
the express elevator!

49
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,625
Forget it! That's suicide!
I'm taking the stairs!

50
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,833
Your
funeral!

51
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,375
I told you you couldn't
escape your past...

52
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,791
And now, just
like before,

53
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,958
you're going to die...
The same way we all died.

54
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,958
That's as far as
you go, Éclair!

55
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,875
Tweedledee!

56
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,291
Traitor... You should never
have come back here.

57
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,958
Tweedledum...

58
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,291
It doesn't have to end like
this.. Surrender quietly.

59
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,083
No harm will
come to you.

60
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,125
That's assuming you can
still convince the Chief

61
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,833
to lift the
purge order.

62
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,666
Tweedledee...

63
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,250
What the-?

64
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,041
It's true, isn't
it, Éclair?

65
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,833
You've reawakened your past
memories and abilities...

66
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,333
...and you've remembered
that you're the most powerful

67
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,500
of all the
ES Members.

68
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,208
My gun's not
working either.

69
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,666
Ready men!
Fix bayonets!

70
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,791
Advance!

71
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,166
Now!
Release!

72
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,208
The fun stops
here, Lummi. Sorry.

73
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,375
A nanomist
shield?

74
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,416
That's Lummi!

75
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,291
She's probably controlling
all the security nanomists

76
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,791
in the building
by now.

77
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,958
Well, we can play
that game, too...

78
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,041
You're making
this too easy.

79
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,708
I thought
you knew...

80
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,666
'Containment' is sort of
one of our specialties.

81
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,791
I'm glad I can count on
your aim being so precise.

82
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,666
Sorry if this comes
as a surprise...

83
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,833
But evasion tactics are
one of my specialties.

84
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,416
Now, if you'll
excuse me...

85
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,916
I really don't
have time to waste

86
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,958
dealing with you
right now. Good day.

87
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,583
So you've opted for the
direct approach, huh?

88
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,958
It might've worked,
too, except...

89
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,875
we knew you
were coming.

90
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,208
Took you
long enough.

91
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,500
Lummi...?

92
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:12,791
I know it's not too 'elegant'.
But you have to admit...

93
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,458
a few modifications, and
even a simple extinguisher

94
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,666
can be quite
effective.

95
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,833
Cesario?

96
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:27,000
Cesario?! Cesario!

97
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:28,958
Cesario!

98
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,541
No more
running!

99
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:29,375
It's time we found out which
of our abilities is stronger...

100
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,916
Your 'Power'... Or
my 'Magnetfeld'.

101
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,166
Look out!

102
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Tweedledum... When
I give the signal,

103
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,083
we're going to use
our 'Windstob'.

104
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,291
Sister! She's
still human!

105
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:56,583
She's more than that...
She's a G-Class ES Member.

106
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,458
What...?

107
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,458
Éclair...

108
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,208
Sister...

109
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,166
Tweedledum!
Hold on!

110
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,833
No... It-
It's... impossible!

111
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,458
Sister!
Get down!

112
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,166
Lumiere...?

113
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,500
After all that, they think a
door is going to slow us down?

114
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,916
Lumiere should know
better than that.

115
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,875
She's getting desperate.
They know they can't win!

116
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,791
Tweedledee!

117
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,750
Sister...?

118
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,750
Lumiere...

119
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,416
I wouldn't worry about
her, if I were you.

120
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,166
I can't open it. The
circuits have been severed.

121
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,791
I guess the little
fireworks display

122
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,291
was more than
they could take.

123
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:28,000
So... this was your
plan all along.

124
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,875
Was it your idea? Or is someone
still pulling your strings?

125
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,000
I am not anyone's
puppet... Not anymore.

126
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,708
No, Eclipse...
I want this.

127
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,416
Good bye, Chief.
And good riddance.

128
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,166
[Soldier] Look! There! Is
that someone on the roof?!

129
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,000
Even the mighty
G.O.T.T...

130
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,208
blown down like a
house of cards...

131
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,375
Perhaps it's time I
took my leave as well...

132
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,375
[Soldier 1] Move in! If
someone's trapped up there,

133
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,166
we need to
get him out!

134
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:29,833
[Soldier 2] Right!

135
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,416
He's gone...
Sensors!

136
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,458
I'm not reading
any life signs!

137
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,500
Move! Take us up,
now! It's collapsing!

138
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,458
So... this is
how it all ends.

139
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,291
No...

140
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,791
It's not
the end...

141
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:31,791
It's a beginning. A whole
new chapter is about to start.

142
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,500
The things we
have lost...

143
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,583
and the things we
have thrown away...

144
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,166
They lay forgotten
along the wayside.

145
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,375
The only trace
we've left behind...

146
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:37,541
Next time on Kiddy
Grade - "Look / Back"
