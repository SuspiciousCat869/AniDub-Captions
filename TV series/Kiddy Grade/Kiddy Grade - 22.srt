1
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,791
[Council B]
The Deucalion!

2
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,041
[Crewman A] The Deucalion's
systems are powering up!

3
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,208
[Captain A] What?!
Emergency shutdown!

4
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,416
[Crewman A]
No response!

5
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,875
[Captain A] Stop
it! At all costs!

6
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,875
[Crewman A] The ship's
N-Layers are activating!

7
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:02,916
[Captain A] Damn!

8
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,250
[Crewman A] It- It's
starting to move!

9
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,625
[Captain A] All hands!
Get clear at once!

10
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,708
So, d'Autriche...
it's you...

11
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:26,041
All of our hopes...
All of our plans...

12
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,500
He's going to
ruin them all!

13
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,208
Issue a
priority alert!

14
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,208
Order all ships in the vicinity
to converge on the target!

15
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,750
Secure the
Deucalion!

16
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,291
The
Deucalion!?

17
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,125
Sister...

18
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,666
How could this
happen...?

19
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,833
Tactical, I want
a 4-D Auto-Lock.

20
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,208
All turrets, prepare
to fire on my mark.

21
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,708
Targeting
failure!

22
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,208
It's a gravitational
anomaly, sir!

23
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,000
It's interfering
with our systems!

24
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,333
Sir... The Deucalion...
It's preparing to warp!

25
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,500
Stop it!

26
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,791
Hurry! Run a
warp trace!

27
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:22,583
Right. Initiating scan...
There's too much interference!

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,125
There it is. Hardly a
moment's journey in this ship.

29
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,916
Aineias...

30
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,041
The Deucalion
is here.

31
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,166
What are you doing? You're
in no shape for this!

32
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,583
I'm still your partner!
I can't let you go alone!

33
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,291
Wait!

34
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,125
Stubborn girl...

35
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,166
[Crewman C] The target craft
is beginning to transform!

36
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,458
[Captain B]
Impossible!

37
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,958
Something that massive
shouldn't be able to-

38
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,583
Sir! I'm reading a large output
of terraforming nanomists!

39
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,208
They're inside
the Roche Limit!

40
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,958
Truly... This
is Atlas.

41
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,916
The titan that holds the
world in his hands...

42
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,208
I'm scared, Mom...

43
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,416
It's all right...
It'll be all right...

44
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,791
At present, wide fluctuations
in barometric pressure

45
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,041
are being experienced
all over the planet.

46
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,833
Tsunami warnings have been
issued for all coastal regions,

47
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:17,916
and violent shifts
in weather patterns

48
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,791
are expected
to continue.

49
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,833
All citizens are
urged to seek shelter,

50
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,875
until normal communications
and transportation routes

51
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,125
can be
restored...

52
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,208
Once again, this is a
special news bulletin...

53
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,333
First wave,
intercept!

54
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,375
Prepare to clear the
8th Fleet for launch!

55
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,875
Conditions won't
allow it, sir!

56
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,375
I'm picking up a new
reading on sensors!

57
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,583
A G.O.T.T.
High-Speed Cruiser!

58
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,291
Nearing escape velocity...
Acceleration L-3...

59
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,708
Initiate an emergency
command override...

60
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,458
Route all planetary management
control to my station.

61
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,375
For the entire system?
Are things really that bad?

62
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,708
What happened to
repeating my orders?

63
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,708
Sorry, Chief.

64
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,041
Initiating
command override,

65
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,958
and rerouting all planetary
management systems.

66
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,916
So that's it.
The Deucalion.

67
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,833
Yes... That's our target. The
ship... And the man inside.

68
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,250
Éclair... So, you've
come, after all.

69
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,875
The Chief of the
G.O.T.T. has just issued

70
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,833
a formal declaration
of emergency

71
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,416
and is raising the
planetary shield

72
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
over all regions
of Aineias.

73
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,625
Current weather
conditions shou-

74
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,916
Current weather
conditions should

75
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,208
begin to stabilize,
however...

76
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,375
...all citizens are
requested to remain where-

77
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,041
...indicates that all regions
of Aineias have been affected

78
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,375
by this wave of
environmental disaster...

79
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,375
This global crisis follows
the sudden appearance

80
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,041
of the spaceship
Deucalion,

81
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,458
and is the result of the
massive gravity disturbance

82
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,083
created by its close
proximity to the planet.

83
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,625
The Atlas-class intergalactic
spaceship Deucalion

84
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,916
is the first
of its kind,

85
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,208
and the largest
vessel ever created

86
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,958
in the history of
the human race...

87
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,000
The completion of this
technological marvel

88
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,375
was expected
to usher in

89
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,500
a new era of exploration and
planetary development...

90
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,125
However, one day before
its scheduled launch...

91
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,000
the ship was stolen
by an as yet unknown-

92
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,750
Wait, we're receiving
some new data...

93
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,250
It's breaking
through?!

94
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,125
Chevalier... I
don't understand.

95
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,333
Why are you
doing this?

96
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,916
The defense system. It's locked
onto us, but it isn't firing!

97
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,333
Chevalier!

98
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,375
So sorry to barge
in like this.

99
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,000
But there didn't seem to
be much point in knocking.

100
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,125
You two
again...

101
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,708
And after all
the care I took

102
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:32,958
to stay one step ahead of
you... Most impressive.

103
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,500
[Alv] Thanks for warming
up the engines for me.

104
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,166
You really
shouldn't have...

105
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,958
No, Alv.

106
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,583
It's an uncharacteristically
efficient move by the Council,

107
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,125
sending you here
so quickly...

108
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,458
They didn't send me. I told
you, I work for myself.

109
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,333
Another betrayal.
And all this time...

110
00:09:56,416 --> 00:10:00,416
I thought "Absorb" was your
only ability. Silly me.

111
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,666
Stop Alv! We've got
what we came here for.

112
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,041
I see no reason for any
more senseless killing...

113
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,041
You think you can
order me around?!

114
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,250
No, I-

115
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,625
I'm sorry...

116
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,708
Why, Alv...?

117
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,250
It's not what we came for,
it's what I came for.

118
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,625
And I see no reason to
share it with anyone.

119
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,416
Not even your
own mother?!

120
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,750
No...
don't...

121
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,708
You mean
you knew?

122
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,833
I- I
knew...?!

123
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,291
You've known
all along!

124
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,875
And you still shot
her in cold blood!

125
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,791
Oh, shut up.

126
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,750
A shield...?

127
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,208
Nothing like a little appetizer
before the main course...

128
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,500
I'm sure you'd swallow us all
if you could. Parasite...

129
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,250
I won't give
you that chance.

130
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,708
Wh- what's this?
A gravity well?

131
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,916
Wh- Where am I?

132
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,875
What the-?
What's happening?!

133
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,375
No!

134
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,875
The Reception
System chamber...

135
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,000
It essentially
duplicates

136
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,208
your "Absorb"
abilities mechanically.

137
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,416
Alv...
Oh, no...

138
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,041
It will break down
any form of matter

139
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,708
into its component
particles

140
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,708
and convert it
to pure energy.

141
00:11:56,791 --> 00:12:00,208
It's one of this ship's main
power processing facilities.

142
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,708
Stop it!
Make it stop!

143
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,583
Alv...

144
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,666
The La Muse, Mark
Zero... Calliope...

145
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:29,041
The nanomist layer is most
likely acting as a shield.

146
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,333
We'll need to find
an entry point

147
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,041
where we can
punch through.

148
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,500
This is
too easy.

149
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,208
I'm going in
with you.

150
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,916
The Deucalion is just
one large machine, right?

151
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,500
Even without
my ability...

152
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,583
I still have a few tools
that might come in handy.

153
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,041
She'll be
here soon.

154
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,708
Yes...
This is it.

155
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,375
After more than half
a century of waiting...

156
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,916
The moment has
finally arrived...

157
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,791
Chevalier...

158
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,625
Well, now... That's quite an
entrance, albeit unnecessary.

159
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,375
I should think it
obvious by now

160
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,125
that I've been
expecting you.

161
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,791
I would have gladly
opened the door.

162
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:24,958
Secretary
d'Autriche.

163
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,166
Under our authority as
G.O.T.T. ES Members,

164
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,541
we hereby charge you as
being in direct violation

165
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,083
of interstellar law.

166
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,000
More specifically, you have
committed multiple violations

167
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,208
of the Global
Union Charter

168
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,458
and Interplanetary
Navigation statutes.

169
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,875
All told, you are
being charged

170
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,375
with three hundred
and seventeen

171
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,041
separate criminal
offenses.

172
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,833
Really?
Is that all?

173
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,666
I'd say the number of
crimes I've committed

174
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,541
is actually closer to
80,000 at this point..

175
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,916
That's a rough
estimate, of course...

176
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,416
What?

177
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,916
I'm afraid I don't have the
time to name all of them...

178
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,833
Which is why, a few minutes
before your arrival,

179
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,708
I submitted the full
details to the public...

180
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,333
We have only just
begun to sift through

181
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,833
the vast
quantity of data

182
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,166
that we've
received, however-

183
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,041
...clearly indicates a
long history of corruption

184
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,666
within the highest
levels of-

185
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,041
...illegal dealings with
prominent corporate executives

186
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,250
and government
officials,

187
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,875
which would seem to
imply a vast conspiracy-

188
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,875
...news of these crimes
has spread rapidly

189
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,458
over the
galactic network,

190
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,875
and already the first cries of
public outrage are beginning...

191
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,541
Why are you doing this? What
do you hope to accomplish?

192
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,083
I wanted... I wanted
to save you, Éclair.

193
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,791
You remembered me?
After all this time?

194
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:43,125
Fifty years. Yes. I
remembered. Or rather...

195
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,916
I couldn't
forget...

196
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:50,208
Oh, you poor thing,
are you hungry?

197
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,041
No, no.
Nothing there...

198
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,250
We'll have to find milk
for you someplace else.

199
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,708
What do they
mean, "G.O.T.T."?

200
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,208
What do they mean, "For the
service of the Global Union".

201
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,875
I can't...
I can't go...

202
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,958
Mom? Are
you okay?

203
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,541
How many times
have I told you?

204
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,625
You don't have to
call me "Mom".

205
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,750
It's just
"Éclair", okay?

206
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,166
But why not? Is
it because...

207
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,791
Is it because I'm
not your real son?

208
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,541
You silly boy...

209
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,708
Éclair...

210
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,708
We might not be
related by blood...

211
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:40,208
but you are still every bit
my beautiful little son.

212
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,500
You have no idea what
a wonderful difference

213
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,041
you've made
in my life.

214
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,708
You've given me more happiness
than you could ever know...

215
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,083
But...

216
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,666
But what?

217
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,208
Someday you'll have
your own life,

218
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,166
and you'll forget
all about me...

219
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,708
Éclair! Éclair!

220
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,041
Everything's going to be
fine. You'll be happy.

221
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:03,916
They tell me you'll
have nothing

222
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,375
but the best
from now on...

223
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,291
After all, you're
an Earthling.

224
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,208
It's only right you should
be with the Nouvlesse.

225
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:25,541
Éclair... I won't forget
you. I'll never forget...

226
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,541
And I promise,
when I grow up,

227
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,791
I'm going to be strong
enough to protect you...

228
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,791
And then,
someday... Someday...

229
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,333
From now on, you'll be known
as Chevalier d'Autriche.

230
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,958
You are expected to
conduct yourself

231
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,666
as a proud member of
the d'Autriche family.

232
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,500
Yes...

233
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,541
Dirty
Nouvlesse...

234
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,833
Éclair...
ES Member?

235
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,750
So... She works for
the G.O.T.T. now?

236
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,250
What you got there?
Anything interesting?

237
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,375
No... not
really.

238
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,541
Let me guess... More
studying. Am I right?

239
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,375
Sort of. I just
chose a career.

240
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,833
I'm going to be
a politician.

241
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:13,958
[News Anchor] Planet
Azlantia has suffered

242
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,208
a second
major disaster,

243
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,583
but in an unprecedented
show of cooperation,

244
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,625
hundreds of planet-states
have agreed to contribute

245
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,333
to the
reconstruction effort-

246
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,000
one more sign of the radical
shift in economic policy

247
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,791
taking place
throughout the galaxy.

248
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,375
In response to the
changing times,

249
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,041
the Global Union
has recently named

250
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,666
a new Minister
of Finance.

251
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,666
The youngest man to
ever fill the post,

252
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,666
Chevalier d'Autriche
will also serve

253
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,708
as the Secretary
of the G.O.T.T.

254
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:41,166
Chevalier... A word of
caution from an old man...

255
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,708
These commoners have become far
more clever than you realize.

256
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,708
Don't let things
get out of hand.

257
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,916
Sir...

258
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,750
The Deucalion...?

259
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,416
What is this?

260
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,375
Éclair... you may have
lost your memories...

261
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,250
But I still
have mine.

262
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,208
So then, why
steal this ship?

263
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:20,208
Because it's proof. Undeniable
proof of the Nouvlesse's plan

264
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:23,625
to rid themselves of the
"commoners" once and for all...

265
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,791
I'm not sure I follow.
You're talking about what?

266
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,833
Less than
100,000 Nouvlesse?

267
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,583
What can they do against
a galaxy of billions?

268
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,458
I have already made the public
aware of the illegal means

269
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,541
through which
the assets

270
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,625
to build the Deucalion
were acquired.

271
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:41,208
However, that is not the extent
of the Nouvlesse's betrayal.

272
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,125
Upon its completion,
they intended to flee-

273
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,416
Earth and all- to
another galaxy...

274
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,625
"Earth and all"?!
Is that possible?!

275
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,375
It is, with
this ship...

276
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,291
So, if they all
left, then...

277
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:55,666
Yes. Chaos. The entire galactic
economy would collapse.

278
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,666
After which, those planets that
require continuous terraforming

279
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,708
to remain habitable would
suddenly find themselves

280
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,708
without
resources.

281
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,916
They would not be able to
sustain themselves for long.

282
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,625
That's
terrible...

283
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,125
To further
prevent recovery,

284
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,541
this ship has also been
programmed to launch a virus

285
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,750
that would destroy all of
the Warp Gate networks...

286
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,166
All the evidence you
need is right here.

287
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,458
The Deucalion
itself-fully complete,

288
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,625
and on the eve
of its launch...

289
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,791
So unless it was
stopped before hand...

290
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,833
by the time anyone realized
what was happening,

291
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,416
it'd be
too late.

292
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,750
And now that
you understand,

293
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,708
there is only one thing
left for me to do...

294
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,833
[Council B] Shut down that
transmission, at once!

295
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,208
The signal's already being
carried by every media outlet

296
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,500
in the galactic
network.

297
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,125
It's too
late...

298
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,708
We're going to have a full
scale revolution on our hands.

299
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,041
It might be prudent
to re-establish our ties

300
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,750
with the
Rosenfeld Group.

301
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,625
We're at the mercy of
the filthy "commoners".

302
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,291
So what's the
one thing?

303
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,500
The Nouvlesse will all
but disappear after this.

304
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,791
But not until they've had
their revenge. My life is over.

305
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,666
That is the price
of my actions.

306
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,208
Éclair... If you feel you
can bring yourself to do it-

307
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,000
Don't
say it!

308
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,333
If I must die,

309
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,916
I prefer it to be at the
moment of my own choosing.

310
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,875
I ask you to do me the
favor of taking my life.

311
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,125
But before
you do...

312
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:30,416
Allow me... to call you
"Mother", one last time.

313
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,583
It's all I've really
ever wanted...

314
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,375
For all these years, I've
labored under the belief

315
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,458
that if I could
somehow free you

316
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,458
from the rule of
the Nouvlesse...

317
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,958
Maybe then, and only then,
would my one wish be granted.

318
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,041
Chevalier...

319
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:48,541
I'm glad it was not
in vain... Mother...

320
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,125
[Chevalier]
What did you-??

321
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,416
I can't
shoot you...

322
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,291
Not when everything you've
done was all because of me!

323
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:12,041
I'm sorry, Chevalier...
I'm so sorry!

324
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,875
Mother!

325
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,416
Chevalier!

326
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:24,625
Chevalier...? Chevalier!
Why'd you do it?

327
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,375
As much as I've
enjoyed watching

328
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,583
this ridiculous
little drama,

329
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,375
I think it's time
I made my entrance!

330
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,833
That
voice...

331
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,166
Alv... Is
that you...?

332
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,000
You mean... she's
taken the ship?!

333
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,750
Time has come
full circle.

334
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,416
But when the
beginning is the end,

335
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,083
and the end the
beginning...

336
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,458
nothing can
exist in between.

337
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:37,916
Next time on Kiddy Grade:
"Annihilation / Zero".
