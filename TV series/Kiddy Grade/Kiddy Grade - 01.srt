1
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,958
[Tour Guide] As all of you
already know, 162 years ago,

2
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,291
in Star Century
Zero-One-Sixty-Five,

3
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,291
the Global Union
was officially formed.

4
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,791
At the
same time,

5
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,083
the Galactic Organization
of Trade and Tariffs,

6
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:27,125
or G.O.T.T.,
was also created.

7
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,500
Its initial purpose was to
provide an impartial mediator...

8
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,500
No trouble
at all, sir.

9
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,375
That's why we're
here to help! Bye!

10
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,250
Check out the
reception desk.

11
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,958
Is the G.O.T.T.
hiring kids now?

12
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,333
I dunno. But that
one on the left

13
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,833
looks like she could be
in elementary school.

14
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah. She kinda
looks like this girl

15
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,000
my kid brother used
to have a crush on.

16
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,000
She was a real
flake, though.

17
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,750
All right, boys! How about
a little target practice?

18
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,708
Ugh! My night vision's
shorting out!

19
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:10,666
Oh, it hurts. Somebody
switch off my pain sensors.

20
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,291
Um, what just happened?

21
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,041
I had my
eyes closed.

22
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,666
[Éclair] Taa-daaah!

23
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,000
Ladies and
gentlemen,

24
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,875
welcome to the main
office of the G.O.T.T.!

25
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,791
We hope you all enjoyed
watching today's demonstration,

26
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,916
A little crime prevention
drill we like to call

27
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,250
"Lowlifes In The Lobby"!

28
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,875
Please bear with us
while we clean up the mess.

29
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,708
And enjoy your visit
to the G.O.T.T.

30
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,500
So, that was all just an act?
But it seemed so real.

31
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,625
Excuse me,
Miss?

32
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,833
I sincerely
apologize

33
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,375
if our demonstration
startled you in any way.

34
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,000
But I assure you, there's
really no need for concern.

35
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,458
These daily readiness
drills are just one part

36
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,541
of our ongoing training
at the G.O.T.T.

37
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,541
By being prepared
for any situation,

38
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,583
we're better able
to protect the

39
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,125
rights and freedoms of
everyone in the galaxy.

40
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,625
It's about time for
E-Shift, isn't it?

41
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,291
I'm sorry, I'm afraid
I have to go now.

42
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,375
But if you
wait here,

43
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,333
someone else will
be able to answer

44
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,208
all of your
questions shortly.

45
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,833
Is there something
I can help you with?

46
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,000
No, I'm...
I'm alright.

47
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,583
Oh, good. You're here.
The chief is waiting for you.

48
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,875
I made
some tea.

49
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,791
You must be thirsty
after all the excitement.

50
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,958
Not really. Besides, you know
I'm not a big tea drinker.

51
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,458
Actually, I just
ordered something

52
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,458
I think you might
like a little better.

53
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,750
I'll let you
try some

54
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,666
if you make it back
from your next assignment.

55
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,291
What do you mean,
if we make it back?

56
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,416
Right, I forget who I'm
talking to. I meant "when".

57
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,291
Well in that case,
when we get back,

58
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,250
I'll take you up
on that. Thanks, Mer.

59
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,583
I'll have something
for you too, Lumiere.

60
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,125
Maybe some of that
'grape juice' you like.

61
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,875
As always,
you're too kind.

62
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,958
[knock on door]

63
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,291
Come in.
The door's open.

64
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:47,916
Well, our two brave
receptionists,

65
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,333
Éclair and
Lumiere.

66
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,125
Good work
this morning.

67
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,291
But I hope
you're ready

68
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,041
for something a little
more challenging.

69
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,666
[Éclair] Planet Faunus?

70
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,291
Those greedy corporate
raiders called us for help?

71
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,208
[Eclipse] No.

72
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,750
So then, what
is this about?

73
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,833
Did the Medeian government
file another complaint?

74
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,083
Are they still
complaining

75
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,791
that Faunus is exploiting
them or something?

76
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,875
[Eclipse] No. Neither side
has filed suit at this time.

77
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,291
Still, the
situation is such

78
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,250
that the Global Union
feels intervention is necessary.

79
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,458
You will be
working directly with us.

80
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,708
Meaning you
want us to run

81
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,625
one of your shady
errands for you, right?

82
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,541
As I said, your client
is the Global Union.

83
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,500
I just happen to be their
representative in this case.

84
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,208
So, in other words, the G.U.
hopes to negotiate a settlement

85
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,333
between the two planets
before the current tensions

86
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,458
can lead to
war, correct?

87
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,291
Correct. Your assignment will be
to escort Auditor Armblast

88
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,791
and his package safely
to Planet Medeia.

89
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,625
What?!

90
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,791
[Éclair] A letter of
attorney? What is that?

91
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:55,833
[Armblast]
Arbitration provisions

92
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,583
signed by the
President of Faunus.

93
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,291
A bill acknowledging the
transfer of authority

94
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,125
by the
parliament.

95
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,708
And a letter of attorney
from the G.U. ambassador,

96
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,625
among other things.

97
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,291
All in all, by means of
this 182-page document,

98
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,291
I currently act on behalf of
the government of Faunus.

99
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,833
[Éclair] Wow. Faunus must
really be desperate.

100
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,041
[Lumiere] In any case,

101
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,833
it's our duty to deliver
him safely to Mediea

102
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,000
and ensure that the
arbitration proceedings begin.

103
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,875
That should be
our only concern.

104
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,166
[Éclair] Hey, wait.

105
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,208
You don't suppose that
attack on the lobby

106
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,458
this morning had anything
to do with this, do you?

107
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,291
[Armblast] Maybe it
had something to do

108
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,916
with your
last mission.

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,291
[Lumiere] If I had to guess,
I'd say it has more to do

110
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,708
with the assignment
we'll receive next week.

111
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:36,708
You're kidding,
right?

112
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,583
Just making
a point.

113
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,666
According to probability,
it's more likely to suppose

114
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,416
it had nothing to
do with us at all.

115
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,625
They could have
just as easily

116
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,833
been looking for any
of the other members.

117
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,000
Those cyborgs were constructed
from a jumble of parts,

118
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,500
in order to make them
difficult to trace.

119
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,625
But a spectral analysis of
their packing gel does match

120
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,125
that used by the
Medeian Special Forces.

121
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,666
So they're
from Medeia?

122
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,583
Or perhaps that's what someone
on Faunus wants us to think.

123
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,000
They could have easily
disguised these-

124
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,291
Okay, so your point is we just
don't know. I get it.

125
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,750
Then if all
we have to do

126
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,083
is take this guy to see the
Prime Minister of Medeia,

127
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,250
let's just do it
and get it over with.

128
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,166
Thank you very
much, ladies.

129
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,000
I look forward to the
pleasure of your company.

130
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,666
Don't do that!

131
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,916
Didn't I make myself
clear enough last time?

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,166
I must have
forgotten.

133
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,416
Yeah, right!

134
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,875
Flight Two-Zero-Four-
Five-Three-Four-Three,

135
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,458
S-2 Cruiser La Muse, you
are clear for departure

136
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,958
in linear shaft
Number Three.

137
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:31,875
Thank you,
Control.

138
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,416
[Éclair] Huh. Not much
traffic today, is there.

139
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,416
Now why can't it
always be this easy?

140
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,208
What's that?

141
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,416
You G.O.T.T. dogs
aren't goin' anywhere!

142
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,416
Wirbelwind, activate
the inertial drive.

143
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,375
We're making an
emergency separation

144
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,666
from the
linear track.

145
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,083
Fire on
my mark.

146
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,166
Amateurs. When the
inertial drive is engaged,

147
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,916
it creates a gravity
distortion around the ship.

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,166
They forgot
to compensate.

149
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,500
Yes, well that's why
I'm riding with you.

150
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,375
Now let's go out
with a bang, shall we?

151
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,583
You could try to be
a little more elegent.

152
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,500
They got away!

153
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,583
I've plotted our
new trajectory.

154
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,708
Now accelerating
to escape velocity.

155
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,875
Next stop,
Planet Medeia.

156
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,166
[Mercredi] I've
just received word

157
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,791
that Éclair and Lumiere
have departed safely.

158
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,708
Best of luck, you two.
And be careful.

159
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,416
I don't want to lose
either one of you again.

160
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,333
[Reporter]
Ladies and gentlemen,

161
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,625
the view you currently
have on your monitor

162
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,750
is that of the magnificent
Faunus space fleet.

163
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:30,750
It's rare to see
such a concentration

164
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,083
of military might
on display,

165
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,250
but this is the
latest effort

166
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,541
on the part of the
corporate planet Faunus

167
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,000
to improve
interstellar commerce,

168
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,958
by protecting the galaxy's main
artery for trade and travel,

169
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,666
the warp gate.

170
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,166
The wheels of the propaganda
machine are turning.

171
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,125
"Improving interstellar
commerce" my foot.

172
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,333
That's their
corporate double-talk

173
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,208
for imposing an economic
blockade on Medeia.

174
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,625
They're not even letting
food shipments get through.

175
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,958
Hey. It's sad
for Medeia,

176
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,875
but I don't want to be
unemployed because of it.

177
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,208
Sellin' out
to the man.

178
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,375
[Aide] We still
cannot determine

179
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,583
who was responsible
for yesterday's bombing

180
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,041
of the air
circulation system.

181
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,166
And our public service
organizations have nearly

182
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,875
exhausted their supplies of
food and medical provisions.

183
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,125
The population is growing
restless, Prime Minister.

184
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,750
[Prime Minister]
And the arbitrator

185
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:19,000
of the
Faunusian Parliament?

186
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,166
Still no word.

187
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,125
It seems they are
also being obstructed

188
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,333
by the military
blockade.

189
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,333
Our operatives on
Aenias have failed.

190
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,000
They've allowed the
target to slip through.

191
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,333
No matter.

192
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,416
As long as we maintain
our hold on the warp gate,

193
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,791
the special envoy to Medeia
will never be allowed to land.

194
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,208
I hate this
waiting game.

195
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,583
If we were to send a force
down to the planet itself,

196
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,750
we could end this
with one stroke.

197
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,791
It's good
politics, Admiral.

198
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,041
We don't want
to risk

199
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,250
tarnishing Faunus'
corporate image

200
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,625
with a naked act
of military aggression.

201
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,666
Especially, if
you're hoping to run

202
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,208
in the next
presidential election.

203
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:03,791
Are you sure?

204
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,083
It's a powerful
Canceller, sir!

205
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,000
Unable to get a solid
lock on the target!

206
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,083
Maintain your
position!

207
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,375
Sir! Incoming transmission!
It's G.O.T.T.!

208
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,125
This shouldn't
be happening.

209
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,625
We haven't allowed anyone
through the Warp Gate.

210
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,500
Unless they have their
own warp capability!

211
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,000
What are you
men waiting for?!

212
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,750
You have your orders!
Shoot them down!

213
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,500
Blast any ship that
gets near Medeia!

214
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:38,791
What was that?

215
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,750
[Knock on door]

216
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,833
[Éclair] Hello in there! And
greetings from the G.O.T.T.!

217
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,125
We have an urgent
delivery for Admiral Van,

218
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,625
commander of Planet
Faunus' 8th Fleet.

219
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,541
Mind if we
come in?

220
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,000
Taa-daaah!

221
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,708
Admiral Van, we're here
to deliver your pizza!

222
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,416
Hey! Oww.

223
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,958
What the--
Who are you people?

224
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,208
Pardon the dramatic
entrance, Admiral.

225
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,125
We're with the
Galactic Organization

226
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,500
of Trade
and Tariffs.

227
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,166
More specifically, we are
ES Members. I'm Lumiere.

228
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,875
And I'm Éclair! Happy
to be at your service!

229
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:37,416
They sent ES Members?
That's the shadow unit.

230
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
At this time, in accordance
with the authority

231
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,208
granted us by the
Union Charter,

232
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,833
we are on our way
to Planet Medeia

233
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,291
to begin arbitration
proceedings

234
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,250
between their
government and your own.

235
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,375
Therefore, we have come
to make a formal request

236
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,791
that you loosen
your blockade

237
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,125
and allow us safe passage
to the planet's surface,

238
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,333
for the mutual benefit
of Faunus and Medeia.

239
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,250
And if that isn't
enough for you,

240
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,083
we have a letter from
the Faunisian government

241
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,166
to back us up.

242
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,291
Or not.

243
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,291
No problem. I have
another copy right here.

244
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,166
So, Admiral. I assume we
can take this to mean

245
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,750
that you don't
wish to cooperate?

246
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,500
Now, men! Vaporize these
intruders, and their ship!

247
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,958
I want no trace left
that they were ever here!

248
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,250
Do you understand?

249
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,166
[All] Sir!

250
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,625
[Crewman]
The MPU is down!

251
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,666
Electrical systems
not responding!

252
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,000
Use your Solbrights!

253
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,791
You know, you boys
really shouldn't play

254
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,166
with such
dangerous toys.

255
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:06,250
Under our authority
as G.O.T.T. ES Members,

256
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,750
we hereby charge
all of you,

257
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,958
as being in direct violation
of interstellar law.

258
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,791
Chief, requesting
official authorization

259
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:15,916
to make
an arrest.

260
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,125
Lumiere. Éclair. Arrest
authorization granted.

261
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,916
It's your
show, ladies.

262
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,375
Yes, ma'am!
Understood!

263
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,250
We're finished!
Finished!

264
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,666
Our careers. All of
our plans. Everything!

265
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,958
It's all
ruined!

266
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,958
I think this is finally
about to get interesting.

267
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,791
We've already done
what we came here to do.

268
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,500
We can finish this
from the La Muse.

269
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,375
[Éclair] You know, I was
expecting a little more

270
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,625
from the
Fleet Flagship.

271
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,000
What a bunch
of pushovers!

272
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,500
Yes, well I suppose your
"pizza delivery" disguises

273
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,583
must have
thrown them off.

274
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,583
[Armburst] Sounds
like the two of you

275
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,375
had a fun time
over there.

276
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,000
If I'd known that,
I would've gone with you.

277
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,666
It was lonely
here by myself.

278
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,791
[Éclair] Hey, don't blame us.
You're the one who said

279
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,250
you couldn't leave
that case behind.

280
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,958
[Announcer] This is a
Level 1 priority alert.

281
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,250
System failure
on main bridge...

282
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,583
[Van] Where are they?

283
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,000
Do you have a fix on their
position? I want visual!

284
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,666
Tactical! Get me a 4-D
autolock on that target, now!

285
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,500
Bring the main
batteries on line!

286
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,166
Fire!

287
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,833
Targeting computer
is failing, sir!

288
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:52,833
What?

289
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,666
[Crewman] We've
bypassed the MPU, sir,

290
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,958
but the malfunction
is spreading

291
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,291
to the
secondary systems!

292
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,541
I can't
contain it!

293
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,500
Order all ships to
sever their uplink

294
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,625
to the tactical
mainframe, immediately!

295
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:09,125
All battle units,
annihilate the target!

296
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,291
It's too late! Computer
systems have been compromised

297
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,666
throughout
the fleet!

298
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,958
All ships,
cease fire!

299
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,041
No, Wirbelwind.
I'm all right.

300
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,958
Their security systems
weren't too difficult.

301
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,833
It's just controlling
every ship in the fleet

302
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,916
is a bit more exhausting
than I thought it would be.

303
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,333
[Éclair] Minus 30 degrees
to critical temperature.

304
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:46,041
Lumiere, I'm gonna leave it to
you to work out the timing.

305
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,875
Understood. I'll
take it from here.

306
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,541
Just don't talk
to me for a moment.

307
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,916
I need to
concentrate.

308
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,291
What the--
What's going on?!

309
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,291
The entire fleet is completely
out of control, sir!

310
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,333
We're all finished!
We're all finished! Finished!

311
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,333
[Van] This can't
be happening!

312
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,250
Well, that should
hold them for a while.

313
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,500
I see. So you flushed them all
into a warp space with no exit.

314
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,916
'Then you slammed the lid
on the toilet', as it were.

315
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,708
[Lumiere] I'd prefer to
think of it as

316
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,708
'locking birds in a cage'.

317
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,083
It's the same
thing, isn't it?

318
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,708
Anyway, here you go.
The 'key to the toilet'.

319
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,000
A lady should really
be more elegant.

320
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,833
Well, President Dean.

321
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,250
I must say, this is a
most welcome surprise.

322
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,500
You had the President
of Faunus...?

323
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,291
I thought this case
seemed a bit large

324
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,125
to be carrying
only documents.

325
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,208
[Reporter]
Ladies and gentlemen,

326
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,500
this will surely
be remembered

327
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,375
as a great day
for the galaxy,

328
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,541
and we are proud
to bring you

329
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,291
live coverage of this
historic event...

330
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,625
Wait a second.

331
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,458
Why didn't you tell us
about this from the start?

332
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,916
What did you
get out of it?

333
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,458
What are you suggesting?

334
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,166
That I'm a double agent, or
something ridiculous like that?

335
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,000
Go ahead and play
innocent if you want.

336
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,666
You've got something
working on the side.

337
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm merely
doing my job

338
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,750
as a loyal agent
of the Global Union.

339
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,583
I have a duty to
aid the efforts

340
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,208
of the G.O.T.T.
in any way I can.

341
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,500
Perhaps this is a
discussion for another time.

342
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,416
[Mercredi]
So thanks to you,

343
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,125
President Dean was
able to put a check

344
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,875
on the corruption within
the Faunusian military,

345
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,333
and at the same time improve
his planet's corporate image.

346
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,541
Which should practically
guarantee his re-election.

347
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,250
Oh, and another thing.

348
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,791
The G.O.T.T. has received
an "unofficial" apology

349
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,625
from the Prime
Minister of Medeia.

350
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,291
He said there's a
very high possibility

351
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,666
that those battle cyborgs who
attacked us had ties to Medeia.

352
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,041
Most likely, it was a renegade
faction within the military

353
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,375
that believed the G.O.T.T.
was conspiring with Faunus.

354
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,625
[Éclair] This
is too bitter!

355
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,125
What? You don't like it?

356
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,041
I don't know. I guess
I just don't have

357
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,291
the refined taste
that you guys do.

358
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,791
We'll try something
else next time.

359
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,250
Which reminds me, two
hours 'til E-Shift!

360
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,958
Light and shadow.
Right and wrong.

361
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,083
For every force that
exists, there is another.

362
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,166
One that
opposes it.

363
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,750
Next time on Kiddy Grade:
"Tight / Bind"
