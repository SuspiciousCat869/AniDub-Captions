1
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,708
[Foxy Foxx] I've
changed my mind!

2
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:09,208
Cyborgs!
Run, you guys!

3
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,250
[Cyborg 1] Take it.
You've earned it.

4
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,208
Never speak to
anyone about this.

5
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,791
It will be our
little secret.

6
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,958
What have I
done?

7
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,875
No!!

8
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,833
[Carvo] Are
you okay, Foxy?

9
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,625
Yeah, fine.

10
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,625
Don't tell me the
Galaxy's strongest woman

11
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,250
is crying over
a nightmare?

12
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,458
[Foxy Foxx] Am I the
galaxy's strongest woman?

13
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,833
Or the galaxy's
best product?

14
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,083
Come now!

15
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:11,583
High Speed Reactor aside,
you are all woman!

16
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,833
You can be sweet,
Carvo... Sometimes.

17
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,875
Well, thank you
very much!

18
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,208
You know you're
everything to me, Foxy!

19
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,458
Yeah, right.

20
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:24,875
You mean you
don't believe me?

21
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:34,958
Hmm.

22
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:44,958
Hmm.

23
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:54,208
Hmm.

24
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:04,500
Ah, yes, you obviously
have an eye for quality!

25
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,416
The AG30 is one of our
most versatile models!

26
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,666
His armor is virtually
indestructible!

27
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,666
It's made
of solid...

28
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,583
How much for an
entire battalion?

29
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,250
Right this
way, please.

30
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,375
Are you trying
to rip me off!

31
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,416
Of course not.

32
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,916
We take great risks
in this business

33
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,083
and so we charge
a premium rate.

34
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,958
But perhaps my assistant can
quote you a better price!

35
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,708
Maybe not.

36
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,708
She appears to be in no
mood to bargain with you.

37
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,416
Tiffany, dear,

38
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,208
would you mind showing
this kind gentleman

39
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,375
to the door
for us? Thank you.

40
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,250
Mm, hmm!

41
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,750
[Fight Announcer] Whoa! It
looks like we have a winner!

42
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,000
That may have been
the shortest fight

43
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,000
of the century! Mad Bad
Bull is unstoppable!

44
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,083
Wow!

45
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,500
After being reengineered
the former GCAA Champion

46
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,875
is back on top.

47
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,291
And what a run
this has been-

48
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,125
thirteen
consecutive victories!

49
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:06,250
How's that for a
title defense!

50
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,125
Boasting lightning
fast processors

51
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,250
and advanced
nerve-tronics,

52
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,208
Mad Bad Bull is back
with a vengeance!

53
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,166
[Announcer] It looks
like another challenger

54
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,208
is entering
the arena!

55
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,125
Yes! It's official!

56
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,708
The judges have posted
the challenger's name!

57
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,375
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome,

58
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:31,291
Miss Beauty
Aphrodia!

59
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,125
What a
spectacular achievement

60
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,083
in
humanoid design!

61
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,875
Tah, dah!

62
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,333
[Armblast] Posing as
a battle cyborg-

63
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,875
only Éclair could come
up with such a plan.

64
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,583
[Lumiere] Éclair's charm rests
in her reckless behavior.

65
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,000
However, this is
the best place

66
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,291
to seek out the cyborg
with the stolen reactor.

67
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,250
But it's a
dangerous Operation.

68
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,541
I only wish that you
were there for backup.

69
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,208
Too young to get
in! How insulting!

70
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,125
Even special agents have
to follow rules sometimes.

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,916
I'm sure he's not the one,
but I'll check just in case.

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,416
Did he just stick
his tongue out at me?

73
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,625
He's going down!

74
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,708
I was right.
He's not the one.

75
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,750
That slowpoke can't
even keep up with me.

76
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:53,791
I need to end this without
making it look too obvious.

77
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,875
The modifications
we've made

78
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,833
have placed him heads
above the rest.

79
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,000
You might want
to consider

80
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,083
buying now before
his price goes up.

81
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,750
No thanks. I have my
eye on someone else.

82
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:18,875
I'm sorry to
hear that, sir.

83
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,583
Thanks for waiting. You
won't be disappointed.

84
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:25,291
That much,
I can promise you.

85
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,791
As you can see, he's
clearly the best.

86
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,375
Sorry, but I... just
don't have time for this!

87
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,708
[Announcer] He's out of
bounds! The match is over!

88
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:12,916
And the winner is Miss
Beauty Aphrodia!!

89
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,791
[Armblast] Hmm. Still two
hours to go before we move in.

90
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,583
How 'bout a game of
cards to kill the time?

91
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,250
I refuse to play
cards with someone

92
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,875
who carries their own
deck around with them.

93
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,458
Then how about
some refreshments?

94
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,708
Pepperoni and crackers with
a little aged grape juice?

95
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:49,583
And our next challenger is
quite a beauty herself!

96
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:53,458
Lets hear it for the
amazing Foxy Fox!

97
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,208
The winner of this
challenge match

98
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,416
will earn the right to
face our new champion!

99
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,541
What the heck?!

100
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:47,291
Unbelievable.
This is the real thing.

101
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,916
So she beat
a cyborg.

102
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,750
No ordinary person is
capable of such things.

103
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,000
Now, you see

104
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,916
just how much the high
speed reactor is worth!

105
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,791
You're asking
too much, Carvo!

106
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,708
No problem,
the deal is off.

107
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,875
You're not the only
bidder you know!

108
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,250
Carvo! Are you dealing
with the enemy?!

109
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,208
I'm not a soldier.
I'm a merchant.

110
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,750
The highest
bidder wins.

111
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,625
No one's that fast...
She must be the one.

112
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,083
Poor guy.

113
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,416
Oh, no. Please don't
be who I think you are.

114
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,958
Oh great!

115
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,375
Move it, men! We
don't need to advertise!

116
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,000
It's her!

117
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,083
Let go of me!

118
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,625
Are you okay?

119
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,583
Yes.

120
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,416
It's been a long
time, Éclair!

121
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,541
Yes, I'd recognize
you anywhere!

122
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,375
Your body's different
but you move the same.

123
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:39,000
You even wear your hair
the same, you GOTT dog!

124
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,041
You're from GOTT?

125
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,041
I don't remember
who I was before!

126
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,916
This is all I've ever
known! This is who I am!

127
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,416
Forgetting
your past

128
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,208
doesn't make you any less
accountable for it, Éclair!

129
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,166
Come back here!

130
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,541
[Boss] Is
there a fire?!

131
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,875
[Worker] We're
still looking!

132
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,208
[Boss] Well, turn off
the alarms for now!

133
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,125
[Computer] Warning.
Intruder alert. Classified.

134
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:24,041
Oh, great! An ES
Member from GOTT!

135
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,750
That's some serious
technology, my friend!

136
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,541
Then it's settled.
We'll work together.

137
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,375
We'll divide whatever
proceeds we make

138
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,166
from the
reactor equally!

139
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,708
What do you
want from me?!

140
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,916
I think
you know!

141
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:05,916
It's useless!

142
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,708
I take it Carvo
modified you as well!

143
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,958
You really don't
know anything?

144
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,041
I know that I was weak-and
that now I'm strong!

145
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,375
Carvo's a thief!

146
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,375
The part he
put in you

147
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,125
was stolen from
the Global Union!

148
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,000
The people that kidnapped
you killed Carvo!

149
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,625
You're my
only witness!

150
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:34,625
What makes you
think I care?!

151
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,250
There they are!

152
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,208
We're supposed to
take her alive!

153
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,458
Which one
is she?!

154
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,666
The one in blue! Foxy
Fox! She has the device!

155
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:56,208
Well, It looks like
we're both famous now!

156
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,625
There they go!
Come on!

157
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:16,375
What are
you doing?!

158
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,625
Sorry, but I can't
give up this power!

159
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,083
I've already
made plans!

160
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,541
I'm going to become
the new GCAA Champion

161
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,125
and make some
big bucks!

162
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,500
Would you kill someone
who helped you

163
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,458
just so you
can make money?!

164
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,958
I have-I've
killed for money.

165
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,333
I betrayed my friends
and they were shot.

166
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,583
I was so hungry
that I was in pain.

167
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:49,208
My stomach was in pain
and I wanted to eat.

168
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,333
But that day my soul started
hurting and I realized

169
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,625
that my physical pain
had been nothing.

170
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,166
There are still kids
like that out there...

171
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,458
and I can
help them.

172
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,833
You can't end poverty
single handedly, Foxy.

173
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,458
I know that!

174
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,291
But I can save
some of them

175
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,666
from making the
same mistake.

176
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,916
That's why I want
to be Champion.

177
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,416
It must be nice

178
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,250
to fight for something that
you feel so strongly about.

179
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,041
Too often I don't
have that luxury.

180
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,958
Uh, oh. I was supposed
to take them alive.

181
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,125
You got the alive
part right.

182
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,166
Yeah, but you
failed to take!

183
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,166
It seems like the whole
Galaxy wants this part!

184
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,250
They do!

185
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,916
Then can I keep it
to defend myself?

186
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,916
I'm sorry.

187
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,708
Then they'll kill
me eventually.

188
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,291
No! I won't let
that happen, Foxy!

189
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm not used to
relying on others!

190
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,583
Where are
you taking us?

191
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,083
The emergency escape port
for state officials!

192
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,333
Éclair!

193
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,041
We'll be dead before we
ever get off the ground!

194
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,208
[Éclair]
Normally, yes.

195
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,208
But we've
discovered

196
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,500
that a magnetic
disturbance occurs

197
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,541
around this station
every 57 hours.

198
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,916
For five minutes,

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,541
their radar and surveillance
systems are useless.

200
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,958
That's when my partner
will move in and get us!

201
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,083
Partner? There're
only two of you?

202
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,333
That's right!

203
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,958
Us two and a whole
battalion of robot-police,

204
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,250
so don't get any
bright ideas, Foxy!

205
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,125
You're lying!

206
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,500
Why do you
say that?

207
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,083
The GOTT don't
travel with police!

208
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,708
No, but we always
travel with back-up.

209
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,750
She's worried
about my power?

210
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,541
When will your
friend arrive?

211
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,083
We need to hurry.
We only have ten minutes.

212
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:02,916
[Foxy Foxx]
Look out!!

213
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:08,166
[Foxy Foxx] It looks like he
wants a re-match, Champ!

214
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,750
He's in
lethal mode.

215
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:13,875
What's that mean?!

216
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,375
That means that
Mad Bad Bull

217
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,166
is about to go
ballistic on us!

218
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,333
When I kill the
gravity, weigh him down.

219
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,291
Éclair wait!!
Please!

220
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,125
Éclair, now!!

221
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,166
Oh, no!

222
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,583
Are you okay?

223
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,375
Thanks to
you, Éclair.

224
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:37,750
[Armblast] It's time!

225
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,500
Lumiere,
where are you?

226
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,875
Hang on! We'll be
there in two minutes!

227
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,000
[Éclair]
Hurry!

228
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:54,750
Will do!

229
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,458
There is no back-up unit, is
there?

230
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,583
Believe what you
want to believe, Foxy!

231
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,750
Foxy!

232
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,583
Foxy, run!!

233
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,666
[Lumiere] Sixty
more seconds!

234
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,583
[Éclair] What are
you waiting for?

235
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,500
Just go!!

236
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,000
Why didn't you
run away, Foxy?

237
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,750
And turn my back
on my friend?

238
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,208
[Lumiere] Éclair, we've
docked! Let's get out of here!

239
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,666
We'll be there
in a sec!

240
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,750
Tell the back-up unit they
can have the afternoon off!

241
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:07,458
[Announcer] She did it!
She did it! Phenomenal!

242
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,000
What a match!

243
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:14,500
And the new GCAA
Champion is... Silver Rex!

244
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,666
Congratulations!

245
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,541
I'm a big fan!
You were great!

246
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:28,541
They're beautiful.
Thank you very much.

247
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,500
You're welcome,
Champ.

248
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,208
Hey, wait!
Haven't we met before?

249
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,208
Can I have your
autograph, Silver Rex?

250
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,208
Me too!

251
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,541
I saw her first!

252
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,541
Where did you learn
to fight like that?

253
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:49,750
Can you sign
my shirt?

254
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,041
[Éclair] Often the
grandest moments in life

255
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,541
are revealed in the
smallest of details.

256
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,666
Those who pay attention
should not miss them.

257
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,541
Next time on Kiddy Grade,
Day/Off.
