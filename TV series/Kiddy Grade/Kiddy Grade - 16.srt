1
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:09,541
I can't go on like this.
I just- I just want to die.

2
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,416
You know as
well as I do,

3
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,416
death is not an option
for people like us.

4
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,375
I don't care anymore. I just
want to make the pain go away.

5
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,666
I just want
to forget.

6
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,833
Are you awake?

7
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,916
Well, that's that...

8
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,791
Where
am I...?

9
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,083
Your apartment.
This is your room.

10
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,458
Really? Then
who are you?

11
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:17,833
I'm your partner.
My name is Lumiere.

12
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,833
Partners?

13
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,625
"Lumiere" what?

14
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,916
It's just "Lumiere",
Éclair. Just "Lumiere".

15
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,875
Éclair...
Is that...?

16
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,208
I'm here to help you,
Éclair... if you'll let me.

17
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,250
That's...
me...?

18
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,875
I think a little modesty
might be called for.

19
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,583
Don't touch me!
Just leave me alone!

20
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,208
Éclair, I-

21
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,750
Did I... Did
I do that?

22
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,666
So then, "Éclair"... I'm
guessing that's my name?

23
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,333
Yes, that's
correct.

24
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,666
"Éclair" what?

25
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,666
Just "Éclair".
That's all.

26
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,666
Stop toying with me! Who am
I?! What are these powers?!

27
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,000
That's your
ability.

28
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:29,083
You're lying! You're lying!
You're lying! You're lying!

29
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,083
Please, who am I? What
am I? Why am I here?

30
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,333
Like I told you before... I'm
here to help you, Éclair.

31
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,625
I know you...
better than anyone.

32
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,958
Maybe better than
you know yourself.

33
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,708
I'll tell you everything. But
in time. Little by little.

34
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,916
You're
lying...

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,333
The first thing
you have to know

36
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,583
is that I will
never lie to you.

37
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,458
I truly believe
in you, Éclair.

38
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,125
Sorry about
your cheek...

39
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,125
It's nothing. As long
as you're all right.

40
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,333
How are you doing?
Do you need anything?

41
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:46,541
No. No, I'm fine. I think I
remember how to use a shower.

42
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,375
Éclair...
That's my name.

43
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:59,958
Strange... Still, something
about it... feels right.

44
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,916
I'll leave a fresh
towel here for you.

45
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Thanks!

46
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,000
Ah, that's
much better!

47
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,333
Good, then phase
one is complete.

48
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,791
For phase two, perhaps
we should find you

49
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,750
a more suitable
outfit.

50
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,583
These are all
your clothes.

51
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,500
On second thought, perhaps
we should eat first.

52
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,458
This is
fantastic!

53
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,291
A lady should really
be more elegant.

54
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,791
Okay, one
second...

55
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,958
Ta-da!

56
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,625
So...
Having fun?

57
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,375
Yeah! I
sure am!

58
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,541
As any girl would.
But like I said,

59
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,291
a "lady" should always
strive for elegance.

60
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,541
We'll work
on that.

61
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,666
There are quite
a few things

62
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,166
you're going to
have to re-learn

63
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,125
until we've managed to
replace all of your memories.

64
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,833
"Replace" my
memories?

65
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,291
I'm not sure I know
what you mean by that.

66
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,166
I'm sorry, I think
I simply misspoke.

67
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,000
I mean until you've
regained your memory.

68
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,375
Is something
wrong?

69
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,000
Guess not. I was
just thinking...

70
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,208
You really are my
partner, aren't you?

71
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,166
Why else would I feel so
comfortable around you?

72
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,666
I'm very glad to
hear you say that.

73
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,208
So, who's
this lady?

74
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,500
Her name
is Eclipse.

75
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,875
She's the
current chief

76
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,083
of the Galactic Organization
of Trade and Tarrifs,

77
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,541
or G.O.T.T.

78
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,791
It's the organization
to which we belong.

79
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,833
Wow. She's really
beautiful, isn't she?

80
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,500
In time, you'll come
to know her very well.

81
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,625
And what's
this building?

82
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,791
That is G.O.T.T.
headquarters.

83
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,166
It's also the main center of
government for Planet Aineias.

84
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,375
But we'll be
covering all this

85
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,625
in your first history
lesson here shortly.

86
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,416
You mean it? Seriously?
We're going out?!

87
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,166
Can I get you
anything else?

88
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,541
Actually, what time do
you open in the morning?

89
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:47,041
6:30. But most days,
I'm usually here by six.

90
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,375
You hear
that?

91
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,916
So we can come here for
breakfast tomorrow, right?

92
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,750
I take it you're
new in the area.

93
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,125
Let's see now... If
I had to guess...

94
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,416
I'd say you two
were sisters?

95
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,500
That's right. My sister has
taken an apartment nearby.

96
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,500
But she'll be
living on her own.

97
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,583
Perhaps you could keep
an eye on her for me?

98
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:10,958
Sure. I take great care of my
regulars. My name's Caprice.

99
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,166
I trust we'll be
seeing you around?

100
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,166
Yeah, I guess so. Nice to
meet you. I'm Éclair.

101
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,666
And this is my little
sister, Lumiere.

102
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,708
Hey,
Caprice!

103
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,208
Coming! Just shout
if you need me!

104
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,208
So? Come on!
How'd I do?

105
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,583
I'd say
you passed.

106
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:36,208
Then, all that... about
"living on my own"?

107
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,291
Well, I think you're
ready, don't you?

108
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,500
I'll come back in a few days
to see how you're doing.

109
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:48,000
Here you go.
Anything else?

110
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,333
[Door Knock]

111
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,166
Oh! Be
right there!

112
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,916
Lumiere! Hi! Come in, come
in! I'll put some coffee on!

113
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,916
Please, don't go
to any trouble.

114
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,375
So, how have you
been getting along?

115
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,958
Great! Except I'm
already getting sick

116
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,125
of the training
menu you gave me.

117
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,708
What are all these
photographs here?

118
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,833
Just
friends.

119
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,291
Friends,
huh?

120
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,500
Is photography a
new hobby of yours?

121
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,541
I guess... I guess I
just want to make sure

122
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:25,416
I never forget.
You know?

123
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,041
I think
I do.

124
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,000
Ahh! So this is
Donnerschlag!

125
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,708
Nice to finally meet
you. My name's Éclair.

126
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,958
You know... I think I'm
really gonna like it here.

127
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,250
I don't know, this
one's pretty good.

128
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,666
It just... feels like
something's missing.

129
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,041
That's
your gun.

130
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,041
Mine?

131
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:38,500
Hello, Éclair... Lumiere.
Welcome back, you two.

132
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,958
[Armblast] This is my latest
surveillance report on

133
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,333
Galactic Organization of
Trade and Tariffs, G.O.T.T.,

134
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,750
ES Members Éclair
and Lumiere.

135
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,583
A timestamp was encrypted
within the sub-layers

136
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,791
of each
video file

137
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,666
as it was recorded.
I could display it now,

138
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,041
as evidence that the
images you see here

139
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,875
have not been
altered in any way.

140
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,500
[G.U. Official] That
won't be necessary.

141
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,041
I'll take your word that
the files are authentic.

142
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,333
If I didn't trust you, I
never would have given you

143
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,416
this assignment
to begin with.

144
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,833
[Armblast] Thank you. Your
confidence is appreciated.

145
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,041
For the sake
of time,

146
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,958
I'll be limiting my
discussion to include

147
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,000
only the key incidents
since my last report.

148
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,125
The first of these being
the Faunus-Medeia crisis.

149
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,708
In order to prevent
the conflict

150
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,916
from escalating to
a full-scale war,

151
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,791
Éclair and Lumiere
were dispatched

152
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,625
to negotiate a
settlement between

153
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,958
the corporate planet, Faunus,
and the mining planet, Medeia.

154
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,208
But as you know, the
real dispute existed between

155
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:10,166
the two factions of Nouvlesse,
vying for control of Faunus.

156
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,833
I'm told you went to
some lengths yourself

157
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,833
on that case.
Nice work.

158
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,708
I was glad to
do my part.

159
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,583
We now come to
the MAX case.

160
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,958
The investigation following the
arrest of the Nouvlesse Jumeaux

161
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,500
for the illegal
refinement and sale

162
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,916
of the gravity
control medium "Hi-G"

163
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,541
directly resulted
in the downfall

164
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,000
of the criminal
organization, Shopper,

165
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,875
and indirectly, led to
the exposure of a conspiracy

166
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,833
to kidnap the children of
influential Nouvlesse.

167
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,291
Next, the feud within the
Rosenfelt Financial Group...

168
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,833
In this case, we were able
to obtain clear evidence

169
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,375
of the Management
Association's interference...

170
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,708
which the G.O.T.T.
was, in turn,

171
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,500
able to leverage into a
favorable settlement.

172
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,166
[G.U. Official]
Indeed...

173
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,416
[Armblast] The next case dealt
with the illegal distribution

174
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,333
of Geo-Sort
bombs...

175
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,875
[G.U.] So they were involved in
that whole affair as well?

176
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,000
[Armblast] Yes. No doubt,
it began as a matter of

177
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,583
convenience for
the Nouvlesse,

178
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,041
but there's no hiding
from the fact that

179
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,041
an entire planet
was destroyed.

180
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,291
[G.U.] Naturally, a version
of the incident was spun

181
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,125
for the public,
but the truth-

182
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,791
[Armblast] ...Is the privilege
of a select few, I'm sure.

183
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,833
Moving on, then, to
Planet Dardanos...

184
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,625
Which I suspect was part
of a larger experiment.

185
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,708
[G.U.] An experiment?
Interesting.

186
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,625
What are you
implying, exactly?

187
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,708
[Armblast] An experiment
in mass mind-control...

188
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,458
It's not too
difficult to imagine

189
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,541
the ways the Nouvlesse might
benefit from the technology?

190
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,166
[G.U.] Perhaps.
But I assure you,

191
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,000
this was not the general
will of the Nouvlesse.

192
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,375
Merely the folly of a few
within the Dardanos government.

193
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,000
Men with the mistaken
idea that power

194
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,666
was theirs for
the taking.

195
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,791
Still, that they were the ones
assigned this case as well!

196
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,625
It's an amazing
coincidence.

197
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,000
One might even
call it "destiny",

198
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,208
if one believed
in such a thing.

199
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,208
Is it possible Chief Eclipse
had it planned all along?

200
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,458
[Armblast] A good question.
And unfortunately,

201
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,791
one which I was
never able to answer.

202
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,208
However, by
all indications,

203
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,958
I'd say the events
on Planet Aure

204
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,125
came to her as
a surprise...

205
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,291
[G.U.] Ahh, the "Secret
Flower Garden"...

206
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,458
Yes, we were
all shocked.

207
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,250
Suddenly, the
name "Éclair"

208
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,791
was on the lips of every
member of the axis committee.

209
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,291
[Armblast] I've prepared a
full briefing on the incident,

210
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,833
if you'd like.

211
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,000
[G.U.] Not
necessary.

212
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,291
I'm already familiar
with the details.

213
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,166
It's such
a pity.

214
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,791
[Armblast]
That it is.

215
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,458
After the purge
order was issued-

216
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,666
a death sentence
in so many words-

217
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,916
the two of them
fled. And for a time,

218
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,666
they evaded the
S.O. and ES Members

219
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,500
the G.O.T.T. dispatched
to pursue them.

220
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,166
At least until the AI on
both their guard robot

221
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,291
and their high
speed cruiser

222
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,958
was corrupted, and
their own weapons

223
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,250
were turned
against them.

224
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,750
I wasn't there
at the time,

225
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,875
so there's no way to know
exactly what happened.

226
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,833
But the results
are clear...

227
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,833
Éclair and Lumiere were
left with one choice:

228
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,666
A direct assault on the
G.O.T.T. Headquarters.

229
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,291
Three teams of ES Members
were put in place

230
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,791
to intercept
them. Even so...

231
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,583
[G.U.] The
G.O.T.T. crumbled.

232
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,125
[Armblast] Which brings
us to the present date.

233
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,916
Complete details on each
of these incidents

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,833
are provided
in the file.

235
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,083
I've made
no copies.

236
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,708
You've outdone
yourself.

237
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,625
Again,
thank you.

238
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,291
Tell me... What of
the current situation

239
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,083
on Aineias?
What's happening?

240
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,208
The G.O.T.T. has
begun reconstruction.

241
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,083
As you know, Chief
Eclipse is dead.

242
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,500
In her absence, an interim
chief has been elected

243
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,000
from the remaining
ES Members.

244
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,583
A new chief?
Already?

245
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,625
That's right. I was
surprised, myself.

246
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:17,875
The Council was
rather quick

247
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,666
in naming their candidate
for the position.

248
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:25,375
The Privy Council involved
themselves directly?

249
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:30,208
So... Who is it, then?
Just whom did they "elect"?

250
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,875
Éclair. I think
it's safe to say

251
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,583
she's proven her
abilities beyond a doubt.

252
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,333
Éclair...

253
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,916
[Armblast] She's set up
temporary headquarters

254
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,916
in one of the smaller
annex buildings.

255
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,666
Already, many of
the G.O.T.T.'s

256
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,125
day-to-day operations
have resumed.

257
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,125
[G.U.] Amazing.

258
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,666
She certainly doesn't
waste any time, does she?

259
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,500
[Armblast] In addition,
twelve new ES Members

260
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,541
have been placed
in active service.

261
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,500
"Reinforcements
to the G.O.T.T.'s

262
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,833
practical fighting
force"- or so they claim.

263
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,583
In reality, the goal was
to completely replace

264
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,083
the existing
ES teams.

265
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,458
Trouble of this sort
is never welcome,

266
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,875
but the fact that it comes
at this particular time,

267
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,250
when the Atlas project is
so near to completion,

268
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,500
is one that I find
particularly unsettling.

269
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,666
I agree. But that's why
you've hired us. Is it not?

270
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,833
It is one
reason of many.

271
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,666
I want you to continue
your surveillance

272
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,208
until further
notice.

273
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,500
Understood.

274
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,416
If you'll
excuse me...

275
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,625
The man still can't see the
whole picture for what it is.

276
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,833
But then again, perhaps I'm
in no position to judge.

277
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:13,958
Data transfer. Highest
priority. Security level G-5.

278
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,166
The data you
requested...

279
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,625
Again, I apologize for
having to ask this of you.

280
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,333
Please, you're talking as
though I were a stranger.

281
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,625
I think we go
back far enough

282
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,333
that we can dispense
with the formalities.

283
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,208
Thank you.

284
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,958
It seems the G.O.T.T.'s fallen
on hard times as of late.

285
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,083
Yes...

286
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,750
Except there's more
to it than that.

287
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,791
Rather suspicious,
don't you think?

288
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,625
That the Privy Council-
or should I say,

289
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,125
the members of the
axis committee-

290
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,666
have seen fit to take such
an active involvement.

291
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,500
Yes, I think I see where
you're going with this.

292
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,375
I'm sorry. I know
I promised you

293
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,250
I wouldn't ask too
many questions.

294
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,125
But why aren't you looking
into the matter yourself?

295
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,625
Officially,
I mean.

296
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,791
Tell me, can you
see your own back

297
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:25,625
without breaking
your neck? I can't.

298
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,291
I understand.

299
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,500
If you need me, you
know where to find me.

300
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:37,125
Thank you. But you've done
too much for me already.

301
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,500
What is it?

302
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,458
I know it's no use trying
to talk you out of something

303
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,416
once your mind
is made up,

304
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,750
but please, I hope you won't
do anything too reckless.

305
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,208
You are one of the few
friends I have left.

306
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,500
And you,
one of mine.

307
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,833
So...
"Éclair"...

308
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:28,833
