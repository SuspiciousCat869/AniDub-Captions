1
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,458
This just gets worse
every time I see it.

2
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,583
But don't forget
what Nobel said...

3
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,750
Each scholarly
discovery is neutral,

4
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,291
but can be used both
for good and bad.

5
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,875
Well, don't you two
seem enthralled.

6
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,333
So, watching records of
the first Limited War

7
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,666
is more interesting
than your jobs?

8
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,000
No Ma'am! We're just
doing some research...

9
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,333
on the Geo
Sort bomb!

10
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,666
It's an amazing display
of weaponry and-

11
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,833
The Geo Sort is no
longer used as a weapon!

12
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,041
It's classified as a

13
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,541
'planetary restructuring
tool'. That clear?!

14
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,041
Ma'am! Sorry! We were just
getting back to cataloging

15
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,833
all of the active Geo
Sorts when you came in!

16
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:38,333
Oh, brother. Can't leave
those two alone for a minute.

17
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,500
[Éclair] So, it's a
planet being terraformed,

18
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,708
or what do they call it now?
Planetary restructuring?

19
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,500
[Eclipse] Actually,
that's a planet

20
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,000
being destroyed by a
Geo Sort bomb.

21
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,250
[Éclair] Oh yeah! I've seen
the old history films.

22
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,083
This happened about
two hundred years ago,

23
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,875
in the First
Origin War, right?

24
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:03,000
It's current. That's
taking place right now.

25
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,291
That's correct. And the planet
Atoth was heavily populated

26
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,291
at the time the
detonation occurred.

27
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,708
There's more.

28
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,291
Last spring deposits of a
valuable quantum material,

29
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,958
used to run E-3 power systems,
were discovered there.

30
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,458
But that's-

31
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,458
So, someone destroyed an entire
planet just for a profit.

32
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,916
Actually, there were
several companies

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,208
that were trying to buy
out the inhabitants.

34
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,250
I guess they didn't
want to leave.

35
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,541
You should
also know that

36
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,916
the Management Association
of the Global Union

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,041
is already
investigating this case.

38
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,833
It appears that the
rumors are true

39
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,625
about ES members
of G.O.T.T.

40
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,625
not covering their
faces! How foolish!

41
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,541
Most disconcerting
is the fact that

42
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,375
G.O.T.T. is
responsible for

43
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:50,125
possession and distribution
of all Geo Sort bombs.

44
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,583
Then that means the bomb
used on the planet was ours.

45
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,833
So, an inside
job. Not bad.

46
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,458
N-No. Not that I
had anything to do

47
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,041
with this one,
you understand.

48
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:04,000
Éclair, Lumiere - Your mission
is to identify the bomb's

49
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,708
distribution route
and shut it down.

50
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,958
Yes Chief!
Understood!

51
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,125
So, Miss, now that
you've had the tour,

52
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,375
what is your opinion
of our system?

53
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,416
Huh?

54
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,416
Well, I, uh...

55
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,625
I have to say my pupil
is exceedingly impressed

56
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,625
with our
Global Union,

57
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,791
the energy systems you develop
here in order to sustain it,

58
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,458
and, of course, your very
beautiful explanation.

59
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,041
Oh!

60
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:48,625
The problem is, with you around
there's no need for a tutor.

61
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,041
Nonsense!

62
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,666
Since we're on the subject of
developing energy systems,

63
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,208
it might
interest you

64
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,166
to know that here at the Energy
Development Center, or EDC,

65
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,083
we direct and supervise
the energy acquisitions

66
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,208
for systems
E-1 through E-4.

67
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,625
Our laboratories
are also developing

68
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,916
the next generation
of energy systems.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,625
There's the Planck
hyperspace scalar system,

70
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,875
which seems
to be

71
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,750
the strongest candidate
for the upcoming E-5.

72
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,333
Of course, my
personal favorite is

73
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,958
the E-8 dimensional
folding system

74
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,750
for small-scale
stabilization.

75
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,833
But that's far
down the line.

76
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,750
--Well?

77
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,416
It's really
quite easy.

78
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,416
At the moment I am removing the
three-thousand-twenty-eighth

79
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,208
and final
firewall.

80
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,000
It's obviously apparent
they don't follow

81
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,333
the G.O.T.T.'s example
for logical firewalls.

82
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,291
What's
that?

83
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,000
An interceptor? No.
Someone got here before me.

84
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,875
Well, now what do we have
here? An ace hacker?

85
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,000
Wait. Is that
you, Lumiere?

86
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,666
Hello,
Tweedledee!

87
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,625
[Lumiere] I don't
understand.

88
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,458
Chief Eclipse assigned both
of us to the same case?

89
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,750
It certainly
seems so.

90
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,791
Not that we
needed the help.

91
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,791
That's quite enough
out of you, Tweedledum.

92
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,500
Huh?
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,625
Wait. So does this mean
the chief doesn't trust us?

94
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,458
Do you mean for
your abilities?

95
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,583
Or on a
personal level?

96
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:33,208
Gimme that! And just who
are you to talk about trust?

97
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,125
Well, seeing as we're all
members of the G.O.T.T,

98
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,083
we should should probably work
together, don't you think?

99
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,500
That would be the
logical thing to do.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,833
I assume I'll be contributing
in my usual capacity as decoy.

101
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,041
Tweedledum!

102
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,041
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,250
[Tweedledee] Let's get
started, shall we?

104
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,458
If you'll excuse me
for just a moment.

105
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,666
What's
all this?

106
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,041
Ah... It's Lumiere's
little good-luck ritual.

107
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,041
She says it's
grape juice.

108
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,250
Thank you
for waiting.

109
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,166
I'm ready to begin
now, if you'd like.

110
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:57,333
So, you're still using
classic methods. However...

111
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,208
There is an easier
way to search

112
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,000
for information
on the Galactic Net.

113
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:07,000
It's a virtual sphere! You
have the most elegant taste!

114
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:07,916
Well,
thank you.

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,375
Now where's the
data we gathered

116
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,541
from the Energy
Development Center?

117
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,791
Here! I
compressed it!

118
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,000
Great. Let me
have it, please.

119
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,250
That's what I
call compressed!

120
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,708
Okay. Let's
search everything,

121
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,625
starting in order of
highest priority.

122
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,291
Now typically,
secret data files

123
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,958
are encoded with random
number sequences.

124
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:46,291
They're very difficult to find.
It becomes a game of patience.

125
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,500
Not necessarily.

126
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,166
I have a little trick
to speed things up.

127
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,625
Oh, how sweet!

128
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:00,166
Search parameters center
around all Geo Sort Bomb data,

129
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,708
as well as planetary
restructuring information.

130
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,833
Cross-reference
E-3 systems.

131
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:08,625
Refer to earlier data for
priority rank. Everyone ready?

132
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,208
Ready!

133
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,458
They replicate themselves to
perform simultaneous searches.

134
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,125
What a
wonderful tool!

135
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,833
I can make
you a copy.

136
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,958
That's okay. Once
I've seen a tool,

137
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,000
I can usually recreate
it for myself.

138
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,500
We'll have what we
need in no time at all.

139
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,666
[Éclair] You already found
the distribution routes

140
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,333
and the coordinates of
the weapons arsenals?

141
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,166
Even with the latest hardware
at the Office of the Peace,

142
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,916
I would never have dreamed
of finding this so quickly.

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,458
It's not that hard
to believe, is it?

144
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,791
You have
to realize...

145
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,625
We E.S. members
are different.

146
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,291
You see, when it comes
to us and our abilities,

147
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,291
one and one doesn't
always equal two.

148
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,833
Point taken. I
won't argue there.

149
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,291
My only concern
is the fact that

150
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,916
so much power could
be easily abused.

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,416
I can't speak
for her

152
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,708
but my sister would
only do what is right.

153
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,125
Interesting. Do you know the
reason most wars are fought?

154
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,291
Everyone has his or her
own sense of what is right.

155
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,000
[Tweedledee] Transferring
Geo Sort distribution

156
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,375
data to G.O.T.T
headquarters.

157
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,875
Upon completion, C-Squared
and La Muse are bound

158
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,666
for reported coordinates
of the weapons arsenal.

159
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,041
[Worker] Move it!
There's no more time!

160
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,833
Once you've loaded all
you can carry, get out!

161
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,833
C'mon, hurry up with
those data files!

162
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,458
And don't you guys
forget that control core!

163
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,666
Go!

164
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,166
[Tweedledee] Well, they
certainly seem busy!

165
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,000
Hurry! It's a
G.O.T.T raid!

166
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,541
What the- ?

167
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,625
What are you doing, Lumiere?
You know they can't hear me!

168
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,125
The stealth
shield is up!

169
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,833
Éclair, there isn't
a shield in existence

170
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,625
that can silence
your big mouth.

171
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:28,416
Either way, they know we're
coming. We've got to move now!

172
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,375
Come in, Chief. This is
G.O.T.T. E.S. member Éclair

173
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,291
urgently requesting immediate
arrest authorization!

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,791
Hey, Chief!
Where are you?

175
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,666
That's strange. The signal
should be going through.

176
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,791
Talk about
bad timing.

177
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,291
Uh,
Chief?

178
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,875
Don't you
ever knock?

179
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,166
Well, I did, but there's an
important call coming through!

180
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,250
Éclair is requesting immediate
arrest authorization!

181
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,750
Thank you. I know.
Is that all?

182
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,041
But,
Chief!

183
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,791
You may go
now, Mercredi.

184
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:17,541
Pardon me.

185
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,416
Chief Eclipse
speaking. Right.

186
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,750
It's coming through.
That's correct.

187
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,291
Yes sir, I have carried out
your orders as instructed.

188
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,958
Any
problems?

189
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,625
Well, there were a few, but
nothing to be concerned about.

190
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,833
Remember the sensitive
nature of all this.

191
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,583
Yes, of course, sir. I
understand completely.

192
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,333
We can't wait for
the chief to respond!

193
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,625
If we don't
stop them now,

194
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,041
there won't be anyone
left for us to arrest!

195
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,791
Let me guess. Her ability
must be recklessness.

196
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,666
Something
like that.

197
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,708
[Armblast]
Well, well...

198
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:16,125
There it is. It looks
like the show has begun.

199
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,750
Éclair... such
need for extremes.

200
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,708
[Tweedledee]
Tweedledum.

201
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,541
Don't forget. This is
all material evidence.

202
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,333
We need to disable them without
destroying them completely.

203
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,583
Use some
restraint.

204
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,416
Yes, I know.
I know.

205
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,958
Of course, that may
prove to be difficult.

206
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:04,750
Sorry, sister, but...
well, that one had to go.

207
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,625
Tweedledum, don't call
me sister on assignment!

208
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,416
Uh, sorry,
Tweedledee!

209
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,583
[Lumiere] Aw, it's
such a waste!

210
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,708
It's the ships! They're
moving on their own!

211
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,458
It's a genetic beast!

212
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:43,166
And my energy shield
is out of power. No!

213
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,125
Ta-da!

214
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,458
Éclair!

215
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,208
Let's see, if this was
Little Red Riding Hood,

216
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,750
I guess that would
make me the hunter.

217
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,500
What's that?

218
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:06,041
The transport
ships!

219
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,833
Ah, good.
You're awake.

220
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,250
[Lumiere]
Where are we?

221
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,500
I'm not sure. I had to get
out of there pretty fast.

222
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,333
Thank you,
Éclair.

223
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,250
Don't you think the siblings
are going a bit far?

224
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,083
It's not them. The smugglers
must have given up

225
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,625
on escaping and decided
to destroy the evidence.

226
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,083
We've got
to hurry!

227
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,458
[Tweedledee] What
a bunch of fools.

228
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,458
Tweedledee?

229
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,375
We managed to
secure our targets

230
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,666
and restrict the
surrounding area, but...

231
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,166
They did it. They
really are fools.

232
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,625
What did
they do?

233
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,000
They... the smugglers
detonated a Geo Sort bomb.

234
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,833
It didn't leave
us much choice.

235
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,000
We're doing our best
to suppress the blast.

236
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:01,916
Tweedledee!?

237
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,083
Oh no!
Tweedledee!?

238
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,750
Sorry about that. I don't
think we can hold this thing

239
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,291
for much longer.

240
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,125
Take the evidence and
get out while you can!

241
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,458
No! Tweedledee!

242
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,083
You are just a
C-class member!

243
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,625
Your duty is to follow the
orders of your superiors!

244
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,541
Are we clear
on this?

245
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:24,958
Good! Now do as
you're told C-class!

246
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,000
Lumiere. My
only regret is...

247
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,958
Well, it would
have been nice

248
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:34,583
if we could have
become better friends.

249
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,500
Lumiere!
Éclair! No!

250
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,875
Sister, please! You've
got to stay focused!

251
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,291
Why couldn't Cesario and Viola
be here? With their ability,

252
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,958
they can disrupt
intermolecular forces,

253
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,083
the same way
this bomb does.

254
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,208
They could've
nullified this blast

255
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,541
without even
breaking a sweat!

256
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,708
[Éclair] Maybe you
can ask the Chief

257
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,791
to pair you up with
them next time.

258
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,875
Not that you
need the help.

259
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,625
It's Éclair
and Lumiere!

260
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,708
What are you doing?
The mission!

261
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't worry. It's all
been taken care of.

262
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,958
We packed up the suspects
and all the evidence,

263
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,458
and Lumiere
programmed a ship

264
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,458
to take 'em straight
to headquarters.

265
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,833
But what would possess
you to come back here?

266
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,791
There's nothing
you can do now!

267
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:41,166
Don't mind them. They were
just giving us directions.

268
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,666
Oh great,
it's Alv.

269
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,666
This is quite a
mess you've made.

270
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,541
Well, Dvergr,
let's clean it up.

271
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,500
Okay, run
along now.

272
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,083
Unless the two of you want
to be absorbed as well.

273
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,291
All right, fine!
Come on, Tweedledum!

274
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,083
Right behind
you, sis!

275
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:03,625
One!

276
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,625
Two!

277
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,958
Three!!

278
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,708
Oh, yes!
The power!

279
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,250
So this is a Geo
Sort bomb! Amazing!

280
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,833
Raw energy,
feeding on itself!

281
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:28,875
The resonance... It keeps
building! And building!

282
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:41,208
So that's their ability.
Absorb... It's incredible.

283
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,333
What is your
primary duty?

284
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,791
[All] To collect and
secure any objects

285
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,208
that might be used
for evidence! Ma'am!

286
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,333
Very good!
Now snap to it!

287
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,833
[All] Ma'am!

288
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,916
You have...
my thanks.

289
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,166
It's nothing. I understand that
covering for weaker members

290
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,125
is just a part of the job.
Besides, we owed you.

291
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:15,541
[Dverger]
Come in, Chief.

292
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,500
We've completed
our mission.

293
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,458
Dverger. Alv. Excellent
work. Now head back.

294
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:29,208
I'l be looking forward
to your safe return.

295
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,875
Why didn't she
respond to my call?

296
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,458
Something isn't
right here!

297
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:07,041
Chief Eclipse, I'm only asking
that you not abandon her.

298
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,125
I know it's not my place. I'm
sure you know what you're doing

299
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,583
and you obviously
have your reasons.

300
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,041
But what I'm
trying to get at here

301
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,416
is that I want to
make certain that-

302
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,250
Inspector.

303
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:22,291
You're quite correct.
It isn't your place.

304
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:30,041
It poses as a friend. Then
creeps up from behind.

305
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,375
When the truth is discovered,
it's already too late.

306
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:37,750
Next time on Kiddy
Grade: Mirage/Snare
