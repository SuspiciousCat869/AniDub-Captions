1
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,791
Aren't the
stars pretty?

2
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,041
Yeah.

3
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,666
Timmy, one day someone
very special up there

4
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,541
is going to
come for you.

5
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,833
Come for me?

6
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,541
Yes. Somewhere
in those stars,

7
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,458
there's someone who
cares very much for you.

8
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:17,750
And one day, you'll have
to make... a choice.

9
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,833
This is Mister
Timothy Constance.

10
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,416
He hails from
Planet Primavera.

11
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,166
His mother was the late
Marianne Constance.

12
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,458
You may have heard of his
father: Albert Rosenfelt.

13
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,291
Albert
Rosenfelt?

14
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,666
As in the head of the
Rosenfelt Financial Group

15
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,958
who just
passed away?

16
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,125
The Rosenfelt
Financial Group?

17
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,333
They're a giant
banking firm

18
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,416
that controls
six-point-eight percent

19
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,791
of the galaxy's
financial capital.

20
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,875
It's actually
seven-point-one-four

21
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,625
percent
as of today.

22
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,750
You're a really
lucky boy!

23
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,500
Mister Constance has been named
in Albert Rosenfelt's will

24
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,166
as the next leader of the
Rosenfelt Financial Group.

25
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,000
However, the will
stipulates that he must

26
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,000
positively confirm
his identity

27
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,500
at a specific location,
and by a certain deadline.

28
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,166
[Lumiere] Time is of
the essence, I see.

29
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,375
What happens if
Mister Constance

30
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,125
cannot confirm
his identity

31
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,500
by the will's
deadline?

32
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,916
[Eclipse] His inheritance
will be forfeit.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,833
Oh, no.
That's terrible!

34
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,416
Yes. And
without a leader,

35
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,541
the ensuing power
struggle within the group

36
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,958
could result in
its collapse.

37
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,541
The economic
repercussions of which

38
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,833
would be felt on
a galactic scale.

39
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,375
But it seems there
are still those

40
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,916
who don't wish Mister
Constance to succeed.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,375
The data we
received concerning

42
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,916
the location of
the confirmation

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,291
has been
corrupted.

44
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,875
We suspect by a rogue
element within the group.

45
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,500
Try to restore
the data.

46
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,125
Find the designated planet
and deliver Mister Constance

47
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,250
there by
the deadline.

48
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,916
It is imperative
he take his place

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,833
as the Group's
next leader.

50
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,875
[Eclair] This is the only info
we've gleaned so far, huh?

51
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,833
DNA analysis of the
true heir will be held

52
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,833
on the planet of Albert
Rosenfelt's birth.

53
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,333
You got anything,
Lumiere?

54
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,000
Not yet. I'm still
scanning the network.

55
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:10,208
Personal information is
relatively difficult to find.

56
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,750
Difficult, if not
impossible, in this case.

57
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,083
After all, members
of the upper-class

58
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,208
are especially protective
of their privacy.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,458
Don't worry about
a thing, okay?

60
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,833
Lumiere will
track it down.

61
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,166
We will get you to your
father's homeworld on time,

62
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,666
Mister Constance,
I promise.

63
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,333
Please don't
call me Mister.

64
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,125
It makes me sound like
I'm something I'm not.

65
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,125
I found it

66
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,208
It's the
Boldor System.

67
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,416
Planet
Farandole.

68
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,625
That's on the other
side of the galaxy.

69
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,833
Not at all. It's just
a quick warp away.

70
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,916
A poor young boy is
magically transformed

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,291
into a
wealthy prince!

72
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,125
Oh! It's
so exciting!

73
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:07,375
Just like something out
of a fairy tale! Right?

74
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,625
Alright,
be that way.

75
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,541
Just don't lose sight
of the La Muse, okay?

76
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,625
[Eclair]
They eloped?

77
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,375
Well, I guess the
Rosenfelt Group has rules

78
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,791
against its members
marrying commoners,

79
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,500
so my father had to leave them
in order to marry my mother.

80
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,791
They then began a new
life on Primavera,

81
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,041
where he became
a farmer, right?

82
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,333
That's what
I've been told,

83
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:38,250
and he used his real
name, Clifford Constance.

84
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,375
A few years after I
was born, he left us.

85
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,333
He became the leader of
the Rosenfelt Group

86
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,000
and took the name
Albert Rosenfelt.

87
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,041
I don't even
remember his face.

88
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,333
My mother
never told me

89
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,416
that he was part of
the Rosenfelt family.

90
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,833
After she passed away, I went
to live on my uncle's farm.

91
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,583
That's where I was when
the G.O.T.T. contacted me

92
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,625
about my
father's death.

93
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,916
And that's when my
uncle told me the truth

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,333
about who he
really was.

95
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,875
I'll say.

96
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,666
Your father neglects you for
practically your entire life,

97
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,541
and then he expects
you to be the good son

98
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,708
and follow in his footsteps
without question?

99
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,208
Armblast!

100
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,083
I can only imagine how you
must feel at this point.

101
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,750
Like you're not even in
control of your own life?

102
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,541
No. I-
I don't know.

103
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,208
[Armblast] Looks like
we've got the wrong place.

104
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,083
[Lumiere] Someone's
trying to throw us off.

105
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,666
Do you have any
clue as to where

106
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,583
your father
might've been born?

107
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,541
The only thing I know about
my father is his name.

108
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:04,083
His name! Could
that be...?

109
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,375
Albert Rosenfelt
is an assumed name.

110
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,041
He only took it
after he left us.

111
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:13,500
It's like he became a whole
different person then. Reborn.

112
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,708
[Lumiere]
Here it is.

113
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,958
The Sylvia System.
Planet Sylvana.

114
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,875
Where Albert Rosenfelt was
coronated ten years ago.

115
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,958
When he took the name, he was
officially recognized as the

116
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:27,750
25th head of the
Rosenfelt Group.

117
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,583
We only have two hours
'til the deadline.

118
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,750
Don't worry.

119
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,208
[Lumiere] Meteor
storm! Dead ahead!

120
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,500
What a strange
coincidence.

121
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,250
Someone
caused this?!

122
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,208
Yes, it would
appear so.

123
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,708
There's no time
to go around!

124
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,000
Are you
okay?

125
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,541
Scared?

126
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,708
Uh-uh.

127
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,166
No. I didn't think
so. You're very brave.

128
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,458
Éclair!

129
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:02,458
Evade!

130
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,750
We won't
make it!

131
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,458
Wha- What in the
world was that?

132
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,541
Hi there!

133
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,708
[Eclair]
Viola!

134
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,000
[Lumiere]
Cesario!

135
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:24,083
Lummi! Clairey! Long
time no see, huh?

136
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,208
You know I hate it
when you call me that.

137
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,291
[Viola] Why? That's
your name, isn't it?

138
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,500
[Eclair] Whatever.
I give up.

139
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,250
Who are
these people?

140
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,000
Viola's the
little chatterbox.

141
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,333
The quiet one behind
her is Cesario.

142
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,041
[Eclair] What are you
two doing here anyway?

143
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,958
The Chief asked us to be
your secret shadow escort.

144
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,416
Tell you what,

145
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
we'll mop up the rest of the
meteors with The Phoenix.

146
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,791
You guys hurry
up to Sylvana!

147
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,500
We're in
your debt.

148
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,500
[Viola] You can pay us back by
treating us to dinner, okay?

149
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,958
[Eclair]
What? Again?

150
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:57,625
Chinese? No way!
Italian is better!

151
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:02,375
We had Chinese last
night! Italian it is!

152
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,541
It's going to
be so yummy!

153
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,541
[Eclair] You two
never change!

154
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,291
Yeah. We still
get along great!

155
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,166
Except when Cesario acts like
a meanie and wants Chinese.

156
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,000
I take it these
ES Members

157
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,958
aren't quite
what you expected?

158
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,333
I thought...

159
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,458
that the agents of G.O.T.T.
would be a little more-

160
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,958
You thought we'd be bunch
of stiffs, didn't you?

161
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,333
Uh, no I-

162
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,541
We're really no different
from anyone else.

163
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,708
We like to have a
little fun on the job!

164
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,166
Well,
now...

165
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,250
Unless this successor
arrives in sixty seconds,

166
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,458
control of
the group

167
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,458
will fall into the
hands of the committee.

168
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,583
And your successful
management

169
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,250
of the Orion
accounts should give you

170
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,250
quite a bit of clout
in the new scheme.

171
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,541
Exactly. With
Albert Rosenfelt gone

172
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,666
and his mixed-breed
son out of the way,

173
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,833
the Group can finally
be controlled

174
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,458
as it was
meant to be -

175
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,541
by those of pure
blood and birth.

176
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,875
Ta-daa!

177
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,250
Here he is!

178
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:08,041
Timothy Constance, the
heir to the Rosenfelt Group!

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,666
What the heck
is this thing?

180
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,666
It's a
hygienic shield.

181
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,833
A shield
against what?

182
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,000
The DNA analysis
is confirmed.

183
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,333
Timothy Constance is indeed
the son of Albert Rosenfelt.

184
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,875
Per Rosenfelt
tradition,

185
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,166
Timothy Constance is hereby
recognized as the Group Leader.

186
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,041
They sure don't seem
very happy to see him.

187
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,125
[Eclipse] Yes, they've
arrived on-time.

188
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,708
They're now attending
a coronation party

189
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,875
for Mister
Constance.

190
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,541
And yes, I'm sure something
will happen soon.

191
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,791
They'll make
their move.

192
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,708
[D'Autrichie]
Count on it.

193
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,750
This is crazy. How're
we supposed to eat

194
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,500
or drink in
these suits!

195
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,875
The Nobles are
pure humans

196
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,958
who shun all forms of
cybernetic enhancement.

197
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,750
These suits are for
their protection.

198
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,875
They don't want to be
infected by people like us.

199
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,375
So they treat us as though we
were some sort of disease.

200
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,541
Poor Timothy. He's gonna
have to live with these

201
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,250
blueblooded elitists
from now on.

202
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,375
Horses?

203
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,583
Well, Ladies
prefer real horses.

204
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,000
We men prefer steeds
of a different kind -

205
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,458
the kind that can break
the sound barrier

206
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:09,375
in a matter
of seconds.

207
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,916
Mechanical steed
racing is used

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,958
to gauge one's
courage and skill.

209
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,666
I don't suppose our
esteemed leader

210
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,625
would care to show
us what he's made of?

211
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,833
But I've never...
ridden one before.

212
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,583
Oh, how
rude of us!

213
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,125
We forget that young
Timothy isn't yet acquainted

214
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,875
with the ways of
our Nobles culture.

215
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,416
Yes, as I
understand it,

216
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,541
his father left our world
for a backwater planet,

217
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,583
where he married a commoner
and became a humble farmer.

218
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,416
Maybe feeding pigs
is more his style.

219
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,125
So if I
win the race,

220
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,833
will you accept me as the
leader of the Rosenfelt Group?

221
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:44,708
Of course.

222
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,333
However, if you
should lose,

223
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:50,083
we expect nothing less
than your prompt resignation.

224
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,083
[All] What
say you, sir?

225
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,541
We have
a deal.

226
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,666
Servant, fetch a steed
for our esteemed leader!

227
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,000
That won't
be necessary!

228
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,166
You can use
Donnerschlag.

229
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,416
We'll teach these creeps
a lesson they won't forget!

230
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,833
Are... are you
sure about this?

231
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,875
I insist!

232
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,458
Well, this has turned out
exactly as I said it would.

233
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,708
That it has.

234
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,666
I didn't think there'd
be so many contestants.

235
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,666
Plus, most most
of these guys

236
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,833
are flying with
veteran co-pilots.

237
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,208
You'll do fine!

238
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:35,208
Besides, I'm your
co-pilot. Don't worry!

239
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,166
Right.

240
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,875
I'm sure they're
plotting something.

241
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,708
Be careful
out there.

242
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,125
[Eclair]
We will.

243
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,041
That's it! Now turn
up the speed a notch!

244
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,583
Right!

245
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,333
Not bad for
a farm boy!

246
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,500
But the race
has only begun!

247
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,041
There's still plenty
of time to get hurt!

248
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,833
These guys aren't
very subtle, are they?

249
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:13,958
Steed racing
is dangerous!

250
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,041
It's meant
for Nobles!

251
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,458
Not for
commoners!

252
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,125
Hey, hang on!

253
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:25,541
Since they want
to play rough...

254
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:36,041
How's that? You boys don't
look very Noble right now!

255
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,625
You're
incredible!

256
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:41,541
Thank you, Mister Cons-
Uh, I meant..to say..uhh-

257
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,125
My friends
usually call me Tim.

258
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,541
No problem, Tim!

259
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,375
Tim,
heads up!

260
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,500
[Tim] Was that thing at
the starting line?

261
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,208
No. I don't think so. That's
a military-grade speeder.

262
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,583
They're
professionals.

263
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,083
You take
the controls.

264
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,333
I'm gonna get these
guys off our tail.

265
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,833
Right!

266
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,500
You're Management
ES Members, right?

267
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,125
How
perceptive!

268
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,083
Did you enjoy our meteor
storm welcoming party?

269
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,666
It appears that the
rumors are true

270
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,625
about ES members
of G.O.T.T.

271
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,416
not covering their
faces! How foolish!

272
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,333
Only bad guys have to hide
their faces behind silly masks!

273
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,666
Now, Tim!
Floor it!

274
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,916
Gotcha!

275
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,500
Faster!

276
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,208
Donner! A little
help, please!

277
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,541
Impure
mongrels!

278
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,250
Nice flying, Tim!

279
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,708
You're a natural at this
steed racing business!

280
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,166
Hey, are you
all right, Tim?

281
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,958
Say
goodbye!

282
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,833
Titano!

283
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,541
Hey Clairey!

284
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,583
More
G.O.T.T.?!

285
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,458
What a
dumb waste!

286
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:39,083
Titano's armor plating
can resist anything! So there!

287
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,916
Bye-bye,
meanies!

288
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,291
Wha-
What's this?!

289
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,500
It's their power. When
those two join hands,

290
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,666
they have
the ability

291
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,500
to manipulate the bonds
between molecules.

292
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,500
But it only works when
their hands are joined.

293
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,750
Thank a lot,
Cesario! Viola!

294
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:18,791
Don't forget, Clairey! You
owe us a nice Italian dinner!

295
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,833
Cesario!! What are
you doing? Help!

296
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,125
T-Take
my hand!

297
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,375
Okay, we'll
have Chinese!

298
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:32,916
All right, are you
happy now? Come on!

299
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,375
Meanie.

300
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,333
Now, do all of you
accept the fact

301
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,875
that a mixed
breed farmboy

302
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:52,083
has the courage to be
the Group's new leader?!

303
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,500
Indeed
we do,

304
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,458
your father made a wise
selection in choosing his heir.

305
00:17:56,541 --> 00:18:00,750
I now bequeath
the title to you.

306
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,791
Then here's my first
order of business.

307
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,666
I hope you'll
forgive me, Éclair,

308
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,166
especially after all
you've done for me.

309
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,500
It's okay.

310
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,166
I'd planned on doing this
since before we arrived.

311
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,000
There's no way I'd want
to lead these people

312
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,750
after they treated
all of us -

313
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:25,041
and my mother - like we were
some kind of terrible disease!

314
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,416
[Old man] I'm hoping that you
will reconsider, Timothy.

315
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,916
Who are
you?

316
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,833
My name is Isaac Rosenfelt.
I am your grandfather.

317
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,125
You're his
grandfather?!

318
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,833
Mister
Chairman!

319
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,583
[Noble] Sir, you
should be resting!

320
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,125
Timothy, it was I who
stole your father away

321
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,291
from you and
your mother

322
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,375
all those
years ago.

323
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:52,416
I had fallen ill. And I
felt that he was the only one

324
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,750
who could
take my place.

325
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,833
You stole him? So then he
didn't really abandon us?

326
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,875
I had to determine
if you were worthy

327
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,333
of inheriting
Albert's title.

328
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,500
So I devised a ruse

329
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,833
regarding Albert's
homeworld that only his

330
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,833
true son and heir would
be able to unravel.

331
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,250
Lemme
guess.

332
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,875
The Chief probably knew
about this the whole time, too.

333
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,375
Right,
Clairey!

334
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,166
I did not think my
fellow Group members

335
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,458
would act as rashly
as they did.

336
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,875
I will have to garnish their
profits as punishment.

337
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,208
Grandfather, I think I know
why my father chose to leave

338
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,541
my mother
and me behind

339
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,000
when you
called him away.

340
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,416
He wanted me to
have a normal life.

341
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,333
He didn't want me to grow
up here on this planet,

342
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,125
and be raised with the
same old stupid prejudices

343
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,208
that most Nobles
seem to have.

344
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,250
He wanted me to
make up my own mind.

345
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,875
To make my own decisions
about what's right and wrong.

346
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:50,833
That's it. That's why father
left us. Because he cared.

347
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:55,500
He wanted to give me the
freedom to choose my own life.

348
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:59,375
Timmy, when that special
someone comes from the stars,

349
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,625
you'll have to choose which
path your life will take.

350
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,333
Follow your heart.

351
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:08,208
No one can choose the
right path but you.

352
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:13,041
Grandfather, I can't decide
what to do right now. But...

353
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,875
But I can't help but think,
if this group is so weak

354
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,166
that they'll fall apart
without a leader to guide them,

355
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,291
then maybe
they deserve to!

356
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,000
In that case, until you
make your decision,

357
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,958
I shall hold
your place.

358
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,208
The Group is still
yours if you so choose.

359
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,500
Heed my words,
all of you.

360
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,500
If, by chance, anything
should happen to Timothy,

361
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,916
I will dissolve the Group
and liquidate its assets!

362
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,625
You should take your time
thinking this over, Tim.

363
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,750
Just follow
your heart.

364
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,041
I'm sure you'll make
the right choice.

365
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:49,125
You know, Éclair, there's
something about you that...

366
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,500
Ah-h,
it's nothing!

367
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,833
So, Lumiere...
Enjoy the show?

368
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,333
I did. But I think it's
time you started explaining

369
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,166
what all this
was about.

370
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,458
[Eclair]
Visual evidence?!

371
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,958
[Eclipse] Yes.
We suspected that

372
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,083
the Management
Association was trying to

373
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:21,583
interfere with official GOTT
business. Now we have proof.

374
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:25,333
Yeah, and so what if Armblast
had to provoke those guys

375
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,500
into challenging Tim
to a race to get it?!

376
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:30,458
You put his life at
risk! And his title!

377
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,958
With you there
to protect him,

378
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,541
I had faith that everything
would turn out all right.

379
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,750
[Eclipse] That will
be all, ladies.

380
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,458
[Eclair]
Right.

381
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,666
I told you Italian was
better! Yeah? Yeah?

382
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,875
There are those who
seek to control power.

383
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,625
But when it
becomes too great,

384
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,291
it is the power
that takes control.

385
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:37,833
