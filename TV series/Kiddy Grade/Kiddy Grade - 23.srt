1
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,666
The Atlas-class intergalactic
spaceship Deucalion,

2
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,291
as well as the sinister plans
for which it was designed,

3
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,250
have now been seen for
what they truly are

4
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,750
by every man, woman,
and child in the galaxy.

5
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,250
This ship
was meant

6
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,000
to bring about the end of the
human race as we know it,

7
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,416
as it carried one small
group, the Nouvlesse,

8
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,500
the sole inhabitants of
Earth, to a distant galaxy...

9
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,208
Considering this, along
with the history of

10
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,041
greed, corruption,
and genocide

11
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,916
which ultimately enabled
its construction,

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,875
does it perhaps bear
some significance

13
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:22,333
that the Deucalion has now
taken the form of a man?

14
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:29,083
[Alv] I'm raising the
curtain on the final act.

15
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,208
I've taken control over
every inch of this ship...

16
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:46,083
No... more than that. I've
been reborn. I am the ship!

17
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,875
Haven't you
learned by now?

18
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,333
Switching bodies isn't
going to change you

19
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,166
into something
that you're not!

20
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,000
So you say...
But then,

21
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,291
I wouldn't expect a puny
insect like you to understand.

22
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,541
Let's see now... I think I
still remember your power's

23
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,416
distinctive
wavelength...

24
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,583
Somewhere around
here, wasn't it?

25
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,958
Lumiere!

26
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,500
I can buy us
some time.

27
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,625
But I'm afraid this isn't going
to hold her off for long...

28
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:27,291
A little nanomist
shield... how adorable.

29
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,083
Getting tight
in there, huh?

30
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,708
I bet now you're
wishing you hadn't asked

31
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,375
for that little
bit extra up top

32
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,416
when you got
your new body...

33
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,791
That's it... the
shield's fading!

34
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,166
D- Donnerschlag!

35
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,875
Go ahead...
Try to run...

36
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,791
There's nowhere you can
hide that I won't find you.

37
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,833
[Crewman D] G.O.T.T. Cruiser
is currently exchanging fire

38
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:29,750
with the
Deucalion!

39
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,000
[Crewman E]
Confirmed!

40
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,333
[Captain B] Why hasn't
the fleet launched yet?

41
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,750
[Crewman D] 8th fleet,
you are clear for launch.

42
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,916
Repeat, you are
clear for launch.

43
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,250
Pathetic. This isn't the
planet that needs destroying.

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,291
Large-scale phase
fluctuation detected

45
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,083
in the vicinity
of the Deucalion!

46
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,000
It's preparing
to warp!

47
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,083
Are you
sure?!

48
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,291
Yes, sir! Warp
space confirmed!

49
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,208
Then maybe we'll live
to see another day...

50
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,791
Ladies and Gentlemen, this
is truly a sight to behold!

51
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:08,416
The massive Deucalion- all
60,000-plus kilometers of it-

52
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,625
has begun to sink
into warp-space!

53
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,083
It's
disappearing!

54
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,000
The warp-space is
closing! It's gone!

55
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,458
Almost as suddenly
as it arrived,

56
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,250
the Deucalion has vanished
from Aineias' orbit!

57
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:25,000
The only question now is:
where will it next emerge?

58
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:36,875
Why isn't she attacking us?
Overconfidence? Strategy?

59
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,291
Or is it
something else?

60
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,583
You feel
that?

61
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,708
It feels like
we're warping.

62
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:46,041
We must be leaving Aineias...
Guess we're on our own now.

63
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,333
And without the La Muse,
we're stuck on this ship.

64
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,125
In any case, we'd better
think of something fast.

65
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,250
These two aren't
gonna make it

66
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,291
without some real
medical attention...

67
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,250
First thing, we need to figure
out where we've warped to...

68
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,291
I'm afraid I may
already know...

69
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,000
[Crewman X] Detecting a
huge gravitational anomaly

70
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,500
on the near side
of the moon.

71
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,666
Mass levels
also increasing.

72
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,583
Someone, or something,
seems to be warping out!

73
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,375
Wait! Is
that...?!

74
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,708
It's the
Deucalion!

75
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,083
The Deucalion is emerging!
Issue a priority alert!

76
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,541
I repeat: issue a
priority alert!

77
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,833
Contact central
command, immediately!

78
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,958
So this is where all
our troubles began...

79
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,708
The planet of
original sin...

80
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,375
Earth.

81
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,041
[Crewman X] Mayday! Mayday!
Send reinforcements!

82
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,416
We are under attack
by the Deucalion!

83
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,083
The relics... the planetary
standard! Everything!!

84
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,000
The Earth is
being destroyed!

85
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,208
The Earth?
Are you sure?

86
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,083
Yes.

87
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,500
Not our
Earth!

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,375
How can we be
watching this?

89
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,458
The Deucalion was the
salvation of the Nouvlesse,

90
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,375
the great hope of
our Earthling race...

91
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,541
Now it's destroying the very
world we're trying to save!

92
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,583
What's so special
about this place?

93
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,166
What is it about this
puny little world

94
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,083
that we've given the
Nouvlesse control of our lives

95
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,500
in exchange for
its preservation?

96
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,375
How much has
it cost us?

97
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:55,375
The galaxy? The human race?
My pain and suffering!

98
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,541
The Earth?! You really
think that's where she's gone?

99
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,791
I do. If what we've heard
her say in the past

100
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,875
is any indication...
that's my guess.

101
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,916
But now... it's their turn
to suffer, just as I have.

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,041
The Nouvlesse and
all their puppets.

103
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,208
I'm gonna pay
them all back!

104
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,041
So she wants to
destroy it...

105
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,541
the original homeworld of
every human in the galaxy.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,625
[Éclair] We can't
let her do it!

107
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,083
We have to
stop her!

108
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,875
Are those pests still moving
around? How irritating...

109
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,750
Time to dispose
of them...

110
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,208
A trap!

111
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,416
You can do it
Donner! Don't let up!

112
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,833
At least get the
others out...!

113
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,541
Oh, no...

114
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,958
Wire purge!

115
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,583
You're still
here?! I thought-

116
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,916
The Wired Arms only
carry one person.

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,416
Besides, we're
partners...

118
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,208
Where
are we?

119
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,500
Welcome... to the
reception system chamber.

120
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,791
A reception system?

121
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,500
You mean like the
Calliope's shielding?

122
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,125
Basically, yes. It breaks
down and absorbs all matter,

123
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,625
then converts the
particles into energy...

124
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,250
It's also similar
in many respects

125
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,125
to my own
"Absorb" ability...

126
00:09:56,208 --> 00:10:00,333
So much so, that after my body
was converted into energy,

127
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,625
I literally became
one with the ship...

128
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,500
As for you,
Éclair...

129
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,666
with your
"Power" ability

130
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,750
and Lumiere's "Puppet"
ability... well...

131
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,916
They won't do
you much good.

132
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,750
Your navigation is as precise
as ever, Wirbelwind...

133
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,875
We're right under
her nose...

134
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,375
Eclipse... If you came looking
for Éclair and Lumiere,

135
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,041
I'm afraid you're
a little late...

136
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,583
It turns out they weren't
able to stick around.

137
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,791
Of course, knowing them, I'm
sure they're still trying.

138
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,125
Éclair! No!

139
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,041
Donner!

140
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,666
I'm sorry...
Éclair...

141
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,875
[Éclair]
Lumiere!

142
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,958
Éclair... still worrying about
everyone but yourself, I see?

143
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,458
What's that supposed
to be? An attack?

144
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:16,208
Hang on... I won't
let you go, Éclair.

145
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,166
You just don't
get it, do you?

146
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,833
There's absolutely nothing you
can do for her. She's gone.

147
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,625
Éclair...

148
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,958
You see? Now I've absorbed both
of their abilities as well...

149
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,708
Not that it really makes
much of a difference

150
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,625
at this
point...

151
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,458
What's wrong? Why don't
you try bouncing it back

152
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,625
like you
did before?

153
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,083
Evasive!

154
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,583
Divert power to
weapons systems!

155
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,125
Reduce reception
shield 32%!

156
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,666
Initiate attack
pattern 308!

157
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,875
Three seconds after firing
Resonance Explosion,

158
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,583
launch Hedgehog Salvo!

159
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,208
The Nanomist...

160
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:03,625
Nice try. Too bad you barely
managed to scratch the surface!

161
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,416
Energy
satellites...?

162
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,000
That was a clever
little diversion...

163
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,250
You'd better start
paying attention

164
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,625
to your
surroundings...

165
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,333
Good advice. I'll be sure
to keep that in mind...

166
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,916
Capture units? But
when did they-?

167
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,708
I'd tell you how stupid you
were to lower your shields,

168
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,458
but I think you
already know.

169
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,166
It's been
fun, "Chief"...

170
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,041
I get the feeling she's
not too happy to see us...

171
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,541
Really? Was that
before or after

172
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,333
we used our
one-dimensional blade

173
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,250
to slice through
her arm...?

174
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,333
Deucalion
acquired, sir!

175
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,916
Maintain position! We have
just received information

176
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,666
that a G.O.T.T.
ES Member

177
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,750
has taken control of the
ship. Stay alert, soldiers!

178
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,416
Did you really think
this would stop me?!

179
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,750
It's a minor
setback!

180
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,416
So as long as you
have that Nanomist

181
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,000
you're
invincible, huh?

182
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,500
Well, we'll just have to
do something about that!

183
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,875
A little payback for
Éclair and Lummi!

184
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,666
'Kay! That's our
part! You're up!

185
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,208
I see it...

186
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,750
There!

187
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,875
Wow, Alv... you've really been
packin' on the weight, huh?

188
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,500
How 'bout we trim
a couple of pounds.

189
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,666
Wait, you're not using
gravity bombs, are you?

190
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,916
Nope. That was a
"Shrinkburst Torpedo".

191
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,083
It's the same thing! What're
you gonna do if it sets off

192
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,791
a major gravitational
collapse this close to Earth?!

193
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,500
Nevermind. She's already
fixing herself...

194
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,375
Some "window of opportunity"
you opened for us.

195
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,708
What was that,
two seconds?

196
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,583
Let's see you
do better!

197
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,875
What's that?

198
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,250
Umm... What
just happened?

199
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,458
I see we made it
just in time...

200
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,125
Tweedledee?

201
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,708
What did you
guys do?

202
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,875
Sister here released a
computer exo-virus: Hashish.

203
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,375
What?! You mean like the
same virus that you used-

204
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,125
Some poisons can be medicine,
if applied correctly...

205
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,791
And Alv deserves a strong dose.
She'll pay for what she's done!

206
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,708
All shield units, hold your
perimeter around Earth.

207
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,916
7th through 13th
Destroyer Fleets,

208
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,708
assume cluster
formation.

209
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:26,208
Concentrate maximum
firepower on the Deucalion!

210
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,208
Maintain formation, and
pull back toward the sun!

211
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,125
Even if it costs us
every ship in the fleet,

212
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,541
we have to try to draw
her away from the Earth!

213
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,666
What a brilliant
strategy...

214
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,333
Go ahead. Line
yourselves up for me!

215
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,250
Like swatting flies!

216
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,208
Is that...?

217
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,375
It couldn't be...

218
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,416
It's the
La Muse!

219
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,041
Impossible!

220
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,208
You're dead! I killed
you, Éclair! Lumiere!

221
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,875
Even Eclipse! I
killed you all!

222
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,958
Éclair isn't
dead... Not yet...

223
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,083
As long as we're still here,
her spirit lives on, Alv!

224
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,375
Fire-Resonance
Explosion!

225
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:57,041
25% of my nanomists wiped
out with one blast?!

226
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,708
[Éclair]
Hedgehog Salvo!

227
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,791
[Lumiere]
Quantum Warp!

228
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,625
[Alv]
No!

229
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,958
Ready! Phase
Elevate!

230
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,000
Now go, my
Famille...!

231
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,375
I see... so my puppets
have returned, huh?

232
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,708
And they've brought
some new toys, too...

233
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,875
They dare to defy
me yet again? Me?!

234
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,750
The one who gave
them life?!

235
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,458
Ungrateful brats, I made
you! And I can destroy you!

236
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,375
Reflection
Field! Now!

237
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,750
Let's
do this!

238
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,958
Inertial
Drive-engaged!

239
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,916
Hey! Wait
for us!

240
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,708
I'd say that's our
cue. Take us in!

241
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,083
You got
it, Sis.

242
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:22,041
Oh, yeah?! Well, we don't
need that thruster, so there!

243
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,125
C'mon! We're
not through yet!

244
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,125
We've lost
forward visuals!

245
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,291
Activating internal
fire suppressors!

246
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,166
I'm rerouting the displays from
our secondary sensor systems

247
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,250
to the
main monitor,

248
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,041
and switching to
instrument navigation.

249
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,625
For the time being, you'll have
to trust me to be your eyes...

250
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,416
That works for me.
Whenever you're ready!

251
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,958
Well, this is becoming quite
the spectacle, isn't it...

252
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,500
So you just plan to
watch from a distance?

253
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,583
We're auditors,
it's what we do.

254
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,041
I'd think escorting
you to safety

255
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,041
was already
involvement enough.

256
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,416
In that case,
Auditor...

257
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,916
perhaps it would be best
if we took over from here.

258
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,125
Not to say we
don't appreciate

259
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,166
all the trouble
you've gone to...

260
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,875
That's right,
come in closer...

261
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,958
Come on!
I'll kill you!

262
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,291
I'll destroy every
single one of you!

263
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,791
Insufficient
power...?

264
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,083
Not for long... Not when
I'm this close to a star!

265
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,500
What's up
her sleeve?

266
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,333
Is she-?!

267
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,375
Allow me to
demonstrate...

268
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:02,250
the full capabilities of the
Reception System Chamber!

269
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,166
She's absorbing energy
directly from the sun!

270
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,583
Virtually
unlimited power...

271
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,041
Something's happening
down there...

272
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,250
[Alv] These
readings...!

273
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,416
I don't
believe it...

274
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,750
How?!

275
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,250
Ta-daa!

276
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,708
[All]
Éclair!

277
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,916
Moment by moment, we
ride the flow of time.

278
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,458
And within each of those
moments, we must make a choice

279
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,958
that will affect
every moment after...

280
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:37,666
Next, the Kiddy Grade series
finale: "As Time Goes By"
