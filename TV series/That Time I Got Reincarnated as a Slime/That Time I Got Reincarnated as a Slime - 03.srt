[RANGA]
Master, you're awake!

325
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,583
Allow me to express
my utmost joy

326
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,958
that you've finally recovered.

327
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,166
[RIMURU]
Hold on.

328
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,500
Judging by the star
on your forehead,

329
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,625
you're Ranga, right?

330
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,708
Yes!

331
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,208

There's Rigurd.

00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,250
-[laughing]
-And Gobta.

339
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,500
Huh, he really didn't
change that much.

340
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,958
[cheering]

341
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,208
I know Rigurd said
they all evolved,

342
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,208
but they almost seem like
completely different monsters.

343
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,916
[GREAT SAGE] The male goblins
have evolved to Hobgoblins,

344
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,666
and the female goblins
have become Goblinas.

345
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,250
[birds chirping]

346
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,250
[RIMURU]
Hey, Ranga.

347
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,875
You were the only Direwolf
I had a chance to name.

348
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,333
So, why is it that the other
Direwolves evolved, too?

349
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,958
[RANGA]
An excellent question.

350
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,625
It's because all of us
Direwolves act as one entity.

351
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,541
You see, in our pack,
we're all connected.

352
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,583
Therefore, my name has also
become our clan's name.

353
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,250
[RIMURU]
Oh.

354
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,125
I get it, so your whole pack
evolved through a shared name.

355
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,416
[RANGA]
Correct.

356
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,708
We are no longer known
as the Direwolves.

357
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,083
We're now the Tempest Wolves.

358
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,083
[RIMURU]
Tempest Wolves.

359
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,833
That sounds pretty awesome.

360
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,375

00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh, no, forgive
my tail wagging, master!

363
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,166
[RIMURU] You have to be careful
with that thing, Ranga!

364
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,208
[RANGA]
Unh. I really am sorry.

365
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,916
[RIMURU]
Whoa, you can change your size?

366
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,208
That's convenient.

367
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,125
The monsters evolving
is cool and all,

368
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,250
but the bigger problem here
is what we're gonna do

369
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,375
about finding enough food,
clothing and shelter

370
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,708
to sustain everybody.

371

[huffs]

375
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,500
Right.

376
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,583
It took five whole minutes
for everyone to settle down

377
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,000
and stop gabbing.

378
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,708
Man, that was my best village
elder impression.

379
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,333
[RIGURD] Lord Rimuru,
what's that on your face?

380
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,166
[spits]
Nothing.

381
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,166
What's on your face?

382
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,083
Anyway, as you can all see
we're a big happy family now.

383
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,708
In order to avoid complications,

384
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,041
I think we should
set a few ground rules.

385
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,541
[ALL]
Rules?

386
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,333
There are three rules.

387
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,166
Please do your best
to follow them.

388
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,708
First, no attacking humans.

389
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,916
Second, no fighting
amongst yourselves.

390
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,916
Third, no belittling
other races.

391
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,958
That's it.

392
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,208
[GOBLINS]
Huh? What?

393
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,541
[confused chatter]

394
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,500
-Sir?
-[RIMURU] Yes?

395
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,250
You have a question?

396
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,541
Is there a reason why we're not
allowed to attack the humans?

397
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,291
How dare you question him?!

398
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,958
[RIMURU]
Calm down, Rigurd, it's fine.

399
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,375
It's simple, really.

400
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,583
It's just because
I like humans, that's all.

401
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,583
Okay, then.

402
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,875
Makes perfect sense.

403
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,208
[RIMURU]
Wait, it does? Really?

404
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,541
Uh, good.

405
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,833
[clears throat]

406
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,166
Another thing is,

407
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,375
humans typically live
in large groups.

408
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,083
And if you mess with them then
they might retaliate against us.

409
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,958
If they were to
come after us in earnest

410
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,541
I doubt we could handle them.

411
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,875
Besides, getting along with them
is beneficial to us, too.

412
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,958
[ALL]
Mm-hmm.

413
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,708
[RIMURU]
Are there any other questions?

414
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,708
Me!

415
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,041
Yes, Gobta.

416
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,125
When you say
"Don't belittle other races,"

417
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,000
what's that mean?

418
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,541
Well, you've all gotten stronger
by evolving, right?

419
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,291
It means you shouldn't let that
go to your head

420
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,875
and use that strength
to push others around.

421
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,125
It's not fair to think
you're better than they are.

422
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,041
Besides, what if they
get stronger one day

423
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,916
and choose to start
pushing you around?

424
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,583
We understand you, sir.

425
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,166
[ALL]
Mm-hmm.

426
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,333
[RIMURU]
Okay, that's it.

427
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,166
Do your best
to follow those rules.

428
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,583
[ALL]
Right.

429
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,875
[RIMURU]
One more thing.

430
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,541
Elder Rigurd,

431
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,916
I'd like for you to be in charge
of everyone in this village.

432
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,500
You're the Goblin Lord.

433
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,208
[RIGURD]
The Lord?

434
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,750
[RIMURU]
Lead your village well.

435
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,500
Yes!

436
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,708
Thank you, my lord.

437
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,500
I accept this
great responsibility.

438
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,666
I promise I won't
let you down, sir.

439
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,250
[RIMURU] Good.
I'm counting on you.

440
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,541
I don't wanna tell him
I only dumped the gig on him

441
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,625
because I don't
feel like doing it.

442
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:11,000
After that, I assigned jobs
to the rest of the goblins.

443
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,583
I formed a team to keep watch
over the village.

444
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,666
Then I made a squad
to gather food.

445
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,583
Regarding those tasks, I think
everything will be fine.

446
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,166
The real problems are...

447
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,208
the group that builds houses
and the people who make clothes.

448
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,666
You know, two thirds
of the whole

449
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,208
"food, shelter, clothing" thing.

450
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,916
Are you sure that's a house?

451
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
[BOTH grunt]

452
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,708
[RIMURU] Honestly, I only know
the basics of being a handyman,

453
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,333
but I worked
in general contracting

454
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,625
so I know good from bad.

455
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,166
And this...

456
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,375
would probably get a shutdown
by the health department.

457
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,000
This is most embarrassing.

458
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,083
Forgive us.

459
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,375
[RIMURU] Regarding
the clothing problem...

460
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,833
[chuckles]

461
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,833
[RIMURU] I just think we need
more coverage, is all.

462
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,250
[chuckles]

463
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,833
[RIMURU] Not that
I'm complaining, necessarily.

464
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,125
[RIGUR] We don't have anyone
who's skilled at making clothes.

465
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,625
[RIMURU] Huh? Well, if you
can't make them,

466
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,125
then couldn't you go
buy them somewhere?

467
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,916
Hmm. Yes, now that
I think about it,

468
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,791
there are others we trade
with from time to time.

469
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,166
Not only do they have people
who can make us clothing,

470
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,458
but they might also
have somebody

471
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,583
who knows about
building houses, as well.

472
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,416
[RIMURU] Huh. Well, we aren't
getting anywhere this way.

473
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,166
So maybe we should go see them.

474
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,666
Who are these people?

475
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,041
I'm referring to the Dwarves
that live in Dwargon.

476
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,458
[RIMURU]
Dwarves?!

477
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,416
Like the famous masters
of metalworking Dwarves?

478
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,166
That sounds like
that would be so much fun!

479
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,708
Then I'll travel to Dwargon
on our behalf.

480
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,500
Rigurd, are you cool
with looking after the village

481
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,416
while I'm away?

482
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,125
