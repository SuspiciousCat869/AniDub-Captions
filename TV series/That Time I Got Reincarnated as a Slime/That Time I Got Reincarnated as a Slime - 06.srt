1
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,583
So it looks as though
the Eastern Empire

2
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:58,042
has decided to stay put.

3
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,292
For now.

4
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,000
At least there's that.

5
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:07,792
Our intelligence bureau
will continue to monitor them.

6
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:11,500
More importantly, how did it
go in the Forest of Jura?

7
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,833
Not only did it go terribly,

8
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,250
but it kinda seems
like you don't care

9
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,625
that we managed to make
it back in one piece.

10
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,667
Give me your report.

11
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,917
It sounds like you
care more about

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,250
that stupid report than us.

13
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,625
The only thing I want
is a hot bath.

14
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,042
I don't know what the heck
you two are complaining about.

15
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,458
I'm the poor sap who had
to listen you guys argue

16
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,333
the entire time
we were traveling.

17
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:33,292
[growls]

18
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,875
[gasps] So, uh...

19
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,750
[clears throat]

20
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,500
Anyway, we searched the whole
cave like you requested.

21
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,500
And Veldora's
definitely gone, sir.

22
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,625
We weren't able to find
a single thing.

23
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,833
It's empty?

24
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,500
There's nothing there.

25
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,083
[sighs]

26
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,417
Thank you for your
report on the cave.

27
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,750
Righty-o, we'll get
outta your hair.

28
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,125
[FUZE]
I'll give you three days off.

29
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,375
[ALL gasp]

30
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,208
Then I'll need you to
investigate the areas

31
00:02:58,292 --> 00:02:59,625
around the forest.

32
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,500
[GROUP]
Huh?

33
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,458
Keep an eye out for monsters.

34
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,625
They'll be more active
with Veldora gone.

35
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,625
Report any changes,
no matter how small.

36
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,583
Be thorough.

37
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,458
Search every nook and cranny.

38
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:12,375
You're excused.

39
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,542
He is such an ass!

40
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,958
"You're excused," he says,

41
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:17,833
like we should be grateful
for three lousy days off

42
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:20,583
when we're so exhausted
he doesn't even know!

43
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,958
You all talk a big game,

44
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:25,625
but I bet you'd never
say those things

45
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,125
to the guild master's face.

46
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,500
[KAVAL, EREN shouting]

47
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,583
[KAVAL, EREN sigh]

48
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,792
Do we have to go back there?

49
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,083
I guess.

50
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,750
If Fuze gives an order,
then you gotta do it.

51
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,167
[EREN]
I just want a break.

52
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,000
[SHIZU]
Excuse me.

53
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,042
[EREN, GIDO]
Huh?

54
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,792
Huh?

55
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,708
You need somethin' or what?

56
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:49,917
[SHIZU] Did you just say
that you're going

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,083
to the Forest of Jura?

58
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,958
[KAVAL]
And what if we did?

59
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:57,417
[SHIZU] Would you allow me to
accompany you on your journey?

60
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,958
[KAVAL]
Hmm.

61
00:03:59,042 --> 00:03:59,708
Sure thing!

62
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:01,333
Uh! Excuse you?

63
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:02,583
Last I checked, I'm the leader,

64
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,833
so I'll be the one
who says yea or nay.

65
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,292
Oh, come on.

66
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,833
It'll be lots more fun
with another companion along.

67
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:09,958
Eren.

68
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,333
That's Kaval and Gido.

69
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,500
[SHIZU]
Shizu.

70
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,708
We're happy to have you, Shizu.

71
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,542
Fine.

72
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,417
We're leaving here
in three days.

73
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,542
If that's good for you,
then you can join us.

74
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,625
[EREN giggles]

75
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:26,917
[SHIZU]
Thank you.

76
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:35,917
[RIMURU]
Ready, Ranga?

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,417
Check out my new move.

78
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,458
[RANGA]
I shall.

79
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:41,250
[RIMURU]
Rimuru, transform!

80
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,958
[RIMURU]
And now,

81
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:52,375
Black Lightning!

82
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,333
[RIMURU]
Whoa!

83
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:12,292
[RIMURU] I didn't expect my new
skill to be quite that powerful.

84
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,625
Note to self:

85
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,583
Be careful about using
this one in public places.

86
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:17,958
[RANGA]
Black Lightning.

87
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:20,667
You are truly amazing, master!

88
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,042
[sighs]

89
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,542
[RIMURU]
Everything's so peaceful.

90
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:38,083
[RIMURU] Yep. Looks like
things are going great.

91
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,250
[RIMURU]
A few weeks had passed

92
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,583
since Rimuru and his party

93
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:43,208
have returned with Kaijin
and the other Dwarves.

94
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,542
As they say, "Strike while
the iron's hot."

95
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,250
[laughing]

96
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,917
[RIMURU] The village now has
a gifted blacksmith, Kaijin.

97
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,333
[RIMURU] The oldest of the
three Dwarf brothers, Garm,

98
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,625
was now acting as
the town's armor smith.

99
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:05,042
And that's why we tan the hides,
so they're even more durable.

100
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,458
[RIMURU]
The middle brother, Dord,

101
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:11,417
taught everyone his
superb crafting techniques.

102
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,458
[RIMURU] While the youngest
and quietest brother, Myrd,

103
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:17,333
became the town's
new resident architect.

104
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:20,417
[RIMURU] With their guidance,
Rimuru and the Goblins

105
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,167
were well on their way
to building a village

106
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,750
that was guaranteed to thrive.

107
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:28,500
[RIMURU] Man, I'm still
not over the surprise

108
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:32,375
we had waiting for us
when we got back from Dwargon.

109
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,500
[RIMURU] Uh, Rigurd,
who are these Goblins?

110
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,458
They all heard
the rumors about you,

111
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,708
so they've journeyed here
from other nearby villages

112
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,500
to seek your divine protection.

113
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,875
[RIMURU]
Oh. Cool.

114
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:47,292
[GOBLINS] Lord Rimuru,
we're so happy you're back!

115
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,625
[RIMURU]
Yo, Great Sage,

116
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,458
exactly how many
new Goblins are there?

117
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,500
[GREAT SAGE]
Answer: Around 500.

118
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,375
[RIMURU]
What?! Ugh...

119
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,417
Maybe it would be better

120
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,042
if I asked them all to leave.

121
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,167
Uh... What'll happen
if they don't stay?

122
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,083
[GREAT SAGE]
With the disappearance

123
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,208
of Veldora the Storm Dragon,

124
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,250
Orcs, Lizardmen, Ogres,

125
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,333
and the other intelligent
monster races

126
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:14,417
are vying for dominance
in the Great Forest of Jura.

127
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,333
The unevolved Goblins
will likely be eliminated.

128
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:20,333
[RIMURU]
Not what I wanted to hear.

129
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:23,042
[RIMURU] All right.
You're all welcome to stay.

130
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,542
[GOBLINS cheering]

131
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,333
[RIMURU]
So, Rimuru sucked it up

132
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:30,208
and named all 500
of the newcomers.

133
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:33,292
Then spent another three
days in sleep mode.

134
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,917
[RIMURU] I was worried
about how it'd work out,

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,750
but I think everyone'll be able
to live here just fine.

136
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,875
Way to kill it, Kaijin.

137
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:47,375
'Kay. I'll show you all how
it's done, so pay attention.

138
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,083
[RIMURU]
Huh?

139
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:55,125
[GOBTA grunting]

140
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,542
Ha!

141
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,000
[RIMURU]
Whoa! He summoned one?

142
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,167
[GOBLINS gasp]

143
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,458
And that's all it takes,

144
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,625
so why don't you guys
give it a try now?

145
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,667
[chuckles]

146
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,875
[RIMURU]
Gobta is teaching the others

147
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,958
how to summon their
Tempest Wolf partners.

148
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,792
[RIMURU] I can't believe
he's good at something.

149
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,167
[GOBTA muttering]

150
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,833
[RIMURU] Back when Rimuru
almost accidentally left

151
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:22,167
Gobta behind in Dwargon...

152
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,875
...the lazy Goblin prayed for
help with all his might.

153
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,250
Until...

154
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,708
[gasps]

155
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:33,500
[RIMURU] ...he managed
to summon his wolf!

156
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:37,000
He then rode his furry steed
straight out of the kingdom.

157
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,792
Where he rejoined Rimuru's party

158
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,208
and made it back home
relatively safe and sound.

159
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:44,250
[RIMURU] Looks like Gobta
can achieve great things

160
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,333
when he puts his mind to it.

161
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,750
[RIMURU] In that moment,
Rimuru's opinion of Gobta

162
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,667
improved considerably.

163
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,292
No, that won't work at all.

164
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,500
You've gotta make
more of a "ungh" sound.

165
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,333
And poof! There they'll be.

166
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:00,250
[GOBLINS]
Hmm?

167
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,500
[RIMURU] He's not exactly
the best teacher, though.

168
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,917
[RIMURU] In that moment,
Rimuru's opinion of Gobta

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,958
dropped considerably.

170
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,750
[RIGURD]
Lord Rimuru!

171
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,292
[gasps]

172
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,250
[RIMURU]
Rigurd?

173
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,750
[RIMURU]
After the new arrivals,

174
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,333
Rigurd was promoted from
Goblin Lord to Goblin King.

175
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,542
He's in charge of leading
all the other village elders

176
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,833
who joined them.

177
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:23,875
They sort of threw
the job at him.

178
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,125
[RIMURU]
I can't be sure,

179
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,292
but it almost seems like
becoming the Goblin King

180
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,833
made him evolve a bit more.

181
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,250
[RIGURD chuckles]

182
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,708
[RIMURU]
What's up, my guy?

183
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,708
Sir, we've just
received a message

184
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,167
from the security team.

185
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,375
It says they've spotted
suspicious beings in the forest.

186
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,333
[RIMURU]
Monsters?

187
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,000
No. Humans, my lord.

188
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,208
[RIMURU]
Humans?!

189
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,083
Yes, it's possible
that they're scouts

190
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:50,833
sent here from another nation
to expand their dominion.

191
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,625
[RIMURU]
Hmm.

192
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,958
[EREN cries]

193
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,500
This whole mess
is your fault, Kaval!

194
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,667
What kind of idiot goes around
stabbing giant ants nests?

195
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,208
Shut up and show your leader
some respect, dammit!

196
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,583
No, you haven't earned
my respect!

197
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,625
If I die today, I swear that
I'm coming back to haunt you!

198
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,958
[laughing]

199
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:15,833
Well, come on, Eren,
that's not even possible,

200
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,083
and do you wanna know why?

201
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,875
Because I'm gonna
be dead with you!

202
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,792
[EREN screaming]

203
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,542
Shizu, no!

204
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,875
Let's go!

205
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,208
[ALL gasp]

206
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,417
[BOTH gasping]

207
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,167
[gasps]

208
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,000
Wow, she's so strong.

209
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,458
[gasps] Quick, behind you!

210
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:44,083
Do something!

211
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:52,583
[EREN]
Shizu!

212
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,667
Are you okay?

213
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,875
[SHIZU]
Yes.

214
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,292
No way. Was that magic?

215
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,083
It kinda looked like
Black Lightning.

216
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:05,458
[RIMURU] Man, Black Lighting
really is boss-level stuff.

217
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,667
I'd better shelf it after all.

218
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,708
[ALL]
It's a slime?

219
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:17,417
[RIMURU] Yep. You got a
problem with slimes?

220
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,875
Uh, no.

221
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,208
I just never heard one talk.

222
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:23,292
It's kind of hard to believe.

223
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,458
[RIMURU] Here, I think
this belongs to you.

224
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:28,083
I hope I didn't hurt you
with my Lightning Skill.

225
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,000
Nuh-uh. I'm all right.

226
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:40,708
[RIMURU] I met her
sooner than I expected.

227
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,000
[chuckles]

228
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,750
You saved me, thank you.

229
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,583
[RIMURU]
My destiny.

230
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,542
[RIMURU]
So, how are our guests?

231
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,417
[RIGURD]
Well...

232
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
[KAVAL]
What the hell?!

233
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,083
I already called dibs
on that meat.

234
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:55,583
--[RIMURU] Huh?
--[EREN] Back off, jerk.

235
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,708
[EREN] I cooked this piece
myself, so you can go hungry.

236
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,125
[GIDO]
Both of you shut up.

237
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,000
Besides if anybody's eating
that, it's gonna be me.

238
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,542
[RIMURU]
Huh?

239
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,042
It's all my fault.

240
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,625
They said they were starving,
so I gave them some food.

241
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,417
[RIMURU]
Don't feel bad, Rigurd.

242
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,375
Helping people in need
is a good thing,

243
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,875
I'm proud of you, man.

244
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,042
You honor me with
your praise, my lord.

245
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,833
In that case, I will dedicate
myself to helping others.

246
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:18,875
[RIMURU]
Attaboy.

247
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,833
[RIGUR]
Lord Rimuru. After you.

248
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,292
[RIMURU]
Actually, I feel like

249
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,875
I've seen these guys
somewhere before.

250
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,083
[GREAT SAGE]
Answer:

251
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:32,542
They are the trio you saw
in Veldora's cave.

252
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,958
[RIMURU]
Right, the idiots.

253
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,333
[RIMURU]
She ate through her mask?

254
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,958
Now that's what I call a skill.

255
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,458
My apologies.

256
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,583
I fear we have little
to offer you,

257
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:52,375
but we welcome you
as our honored guests.

258
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,417
Please allow me
to make introductions.

259
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,625
Here. May I present to you
the master of our village,

260
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,292
the Great Lord Rimuru!

261
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:04,417
[ALL]
The master?

262
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,125
[RIMURU]
Got a problem with that?

263
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,542
Uh, no, not at all.

264
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,708
We knew that you weren't
an ordinary slime,

265
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:12,167
but it's so shocking.

266
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,000
[RIMURU]
They seem a little overwhelmed.

267
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,708
I need to figure out how to
show them I'm actually friendly.

268
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,042
[RIMURU]
Nice to meet you!

269
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,125
My name is Rimuru the Slime!

270
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,875
I'm not a bad slime, slurp.

271
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,333
[SHIZU snickers]

272
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,833
Something wrong?

273
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:29,875
[RIMURU] Hold up, did she
understand that reference?

274
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,333
[KAVAL]
Forgive our rudeness.

275
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,042
It's just that we thought
we were done for back there,

276
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,542
and we never expected
to be rescued by a monster.

277
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,125
Thank you so much.

278
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,208
Yeah, and thanks a lot
for feeding us, too.

279
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,500
Everything's really delicious.

280
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,458
We appreciate your hospitality.

281
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,292
The last thing we expected
to find here

282
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,667
were a bunch of Goblins
building a village.

283
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,583
[RIMURU]
Hmm.

284
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,083
She sure is quiet.

285
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:55,375
[RIMURU] So, why exactly
are you guys in the forest?

286
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,542
The name's Kaval,
not that it's saying much,

287
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,458
but I'm the leader
of this party.

288
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:00,208
Back there...

289
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:01,667
My name's Eren.

290
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,792
And you can call me Gido.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

291
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,542
While she's not
a permanent party member,

292
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,042
this girl is tagging
along with us

293
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,917
since we were going
the same way.

294
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,458
[SHIZU]
Shizu.

295
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:14,167
[RIMURU] So the one
I'm destined to be with

296
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,250
is called "Shizu"?

297
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,708
She's gotta be from Japan,
too. Look how she sits.

298
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:21,917
[RIMURU]
And?

299
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Well, our boss,
who is this cranky old guy,

300
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,583
ordered us to come here.

301
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,667
[RIMURU]
Kaval told me their entire plan,

302
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,042
because you can obviously
trust a random slime

303
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,375
you found in the forest.

304
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,917
A guild master in Blumund,

305
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,542
one of the kingdoms that borders
the Great Forest of Jura,

306
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,042
had asked them to investigate

307
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,125
the monster activity
in the area.

308
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,458
[RIMURU]
Oh, I see.

309
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,875
[RIMURU]
Looks like Veldora's absence

310
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,833
is having a greater effect
than I imagined.

311
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:49,000
Especially if people are
being sent to check out

312
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,667
not just the cave,
but the whole forest, too.

313
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,833
[RIMURU] Well, as you can
see all we're doing here

314
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,458
is building a Goblin village.

315
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,667
So, uh, you don't think
that'll be a problem

316
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,125
with the guild, do you?

317
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,958
Uh, I don't think so.

318
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,375
It should be fine.

319
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,542
And I don't think the guild
has any say in it.

320
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,375
But I'm not sure
about the country.

321
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,500
Hmm. To be honest,
I have no idea.

322
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,167
[RIMURU] Okay. No worries,
we'll figure it out.

323
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,917
You can stay the
night if you want.

324
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,333
Our village is your village.

325
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,625
[ALL]
Thank you so much.

326
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,917
[RIMURU]
Take care of them.

327
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
[BOTH]
Right.

328
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,750
[RIMURU]
Do you have a minute?

329
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,708
[RIMURU]
I wanted to ask you something.

330
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:45,250
Um, are you from--?

331
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,667
[SHIZU]
That line you said.

332
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,750
It was from a game, right?

333
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,833
[RIMURU]
Huh?

334
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,750
[SHIZU]
"I'm not a bad slime, slurp."

335
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,250
[chuckles nervously]

336
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,083
[SHIZU]
I've never played it,

337
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,542
but I heard about it
from someone else

338
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,792
who's from my country.

339
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,042
[RIMURU]
Yeah!

340
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:06,208
[RIMURU] I've been closer to
boobs way more as a slime

341
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,167
than I ever was as a human dude.

342
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,583
Talk about your perks.

343
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,875
[SHIZU]
Are you from Japan, as well?

344
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,083
[RIMURU]
Yep.

345
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,000
I see.

346
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,708
I'm glad I met you.

347
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:22,625
So tell me, how did you
come to this world?

348
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,750
[RIMURU]
I got stabbed to death.

349
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,875
Very heroically, of course.

350
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,208
[SHIZU]
That's terrible.

351
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:31,458
[RIMURU] And then it was
wham, bam, slime I am.

352
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:33,875
Ah, so you were reincarnated
into this world.

353
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:37,417
I'm sure that was
very difficult for you.

354
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,542
[RIMURU]
Was it different for you?

355
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,250
Yes, a bit.

356
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,542
I'm what you call a Summon.

357
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,667
[RIMURU]
Sounds familiar.

358
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,875
That's right,
Veldora mentioned it.

359
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,875
[VELDORA] It requires more than
30 mages performing a ritual

360
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:57,667
that lasts several days
to bring someone here.

361
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,417
The Summon is expected to
perform as a powerful weapon.

362
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,250
They use magic to carve a curse
into the Summon's soul.

363
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,500
That way they can never
defy their master.

364
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:12,208
[RIMURU] Wait. Does that
mean Shizu's a weapon?

365
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,292
And that she's cursed?

366
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:18,417
I am curious, but it'd probably
be rude for me to ask.

367
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,917
[RIMURU] So, when were you
summoned to this world?

368
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,250
A while ago.

369
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,792
There was fire.

370
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,167
The town was burning.

371
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,000
[RIMURU]
A war?

372
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,625
[SHIZU]
Bombs were falling from the sky.

373
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,542
[RIMURU]
The air raids.

374
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:41,375
My mother and I tried to get
to safety, but then she...

375
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,042
[RIMURU]
What happened to her?

376
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,875
[RIMURU]
Did she make it?

377
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,208
[SHIZU]
Mm-mmm.

378
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,083
[RIMURU] I know. Do you
wanna see something cool?

379
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,875
[SHIZU]
Oh? Like what?

380
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,542
[RIMURU] Great Sage, I'd like
to use Thought Communication

381
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,167
to show Shizu
some of my memories.

382
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,125
[GREAT SAGE]
Commencing.

383
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,625
[RIMURU]
Check this out!

384
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,292
[gasps]

385
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:15,708
[SHIZU]
An Elf?

386
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:16,667
[RIMURU screams]

387
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,667
[RIMURU]
Don't look!

388
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,792
It's not what you
think, I swear!

389
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,083
She's very pretty.

390
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,542
[RIMURU] Ignore that,
and look at this instead.

391
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,833
[gasps]

392
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,875
Amazing.

393
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,167
It reminds me
of New York City.

394
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,458
I saw it on a postcard once.

395
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:52,208
[RIMURU] After the war ended,
peace came to Japan.

396
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,958
The towns and economy
all flourished.

397
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:56,125
That's great.

398
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,792
I'm so glad.

399
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,667
I wish my mother
could have seen this.

400
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:04,750
[RIMURU]
It may be a long shot,

401
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,208
but I wanna make this a world

402
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,667
where everyone can
live in peace, too.

403
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,167
I see.

404
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,250
I hope it really happens.

405
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,167
[RIMURU]
It will, I'm sure of it.

406
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,625
[SHIZU chuckles]

407
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,792
[BOTH gasp]

408
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,000
[RIMURU]
Uh, Shizu?

409
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,875
[SHIZU sighs]

410
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,750
[SHIZU]
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,167
[RIMURU]
Are you okay?

412
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:32,167
I'm fine. Thank you.

413
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,250
[KAIJIN]
Hey, Rimuru.

414
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,708
Can I get your expert
opinion on something?

415
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:43,208
We need to talk to you about
where to build a new house.

416
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:45,583
[RIMURU]
Sure. Bye.

417
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:46,792
[SHIZU]
Bye.

418
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,042
[KAIJIN]
Were you two busy?

419
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,375
[RIMURU]
Shut up!

420
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,708
[KAIJIN]
I think you're blushing.

421
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:53,792
[RIMURU]
I am not.

422
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,542
[KAIJIN]
Lookin' kinda red.

423
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:12,542
[PEOPLE screaming]

424
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,833
[screams]

425
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,125
[SHIZU]
Mommy!

426
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,500
Please, Mommy!

427
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:19,625
[gasps]

428
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:41,083
Great, another failure.

429
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,375
[SHIZU]
Please.

430
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,000
Help me.

431
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,875
I thought she would be useless,

432
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:57,417
but perhaps she has
an affinity for fire.

433
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,500
[gasps]

434
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,333
[LEON] Ifrit, I'm offering
her body to you.

435
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,417
Use it well.

436
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,000
[SHIZU gasps]

[GREAT SAGE] Next time,
"Conqueror of Flames."
