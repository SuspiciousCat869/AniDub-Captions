00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,875
No way!

165
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,333
With just one hit?!

166
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,458
[explosion]

167
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,541
Boom.

168
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,833
That's how it's done.

169
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,291
You're the coolest, Teach!

170
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,708
-[CHLOE] Uh-huh!
-For real.

171
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,875
You might even be stronger
than Miss Shizu was.

172
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,958
[ALICE] Beating that was
the least he could do.

173
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,750
Oh, come on, it's not
like you could do it.

174

[KIDS laughing]

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,083
Now, then,

176
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,875
if you don't wanna join
your tin friend,

177
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,000
then you better show yourself.

178
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,875
I know where you're hiding,
so just give up, already.

[RIMURU gasps]

183
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,791
I'm here, so just hold
your stupid fire!

184
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,208
This thing has been
humiliating enough.

185
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,791
[GALE]
A fairy?

186
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,166
[CHLOE]
She's cute.

187
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,291
Who are you?

188
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,875
Ta-da!

189
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,166
Behold, I'm one of the Ten...

190
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,125
[CHLOE]
The poor thing bit her tongue.

191
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,041
I bet it's because she usually
speaks using telepathy.

192
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,291
You okay?

193
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,500
[FAIRY]
I'm fine, I'm fine.

194
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,000
As I was saying, I'm one of
the Ten Great Demon Lords.

Ramiris of the Labyrinth,
at your service.

-[KENYA] Uh...
-What now?

00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,375
Know your place.

00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,041
[RAMIRIS groans]

200
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,541
[RAMIRIS]
Just what the heck was that?!

00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,083
-A chop?
-[RAMIRIS] Obviously!

202
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,458
[RIMURU] There's no way
you can be what you say you are.

203
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,125
If you're gonna lie,
at least make it believable.

204
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,291
A pipsqueak like you

205
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,250
is a far cry
from a real Demon Lord.

206
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,375
[RAMIRIS] Why, you... How dare
you call me a pipsqueak?

207
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,708
I am a Demon Lord,
what else would I be?!

208
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,375
-An idiot?
-I'm not an idiot!

Yes, exactly, I'm a nice jerk.

Hey!

212
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,708
Putting "nice" in front of it
doesn't make it less mean!

213
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,250
[RIMURU]
Hmm...

214
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,458
I don't know, my friend Milim
is a real Demon Lord.

215
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,833
And when I compare
the two of you,

216
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,500
you definitely seem weaker.

217

[grunts sharply]
Dummy!

[RAMIRIS panting]

220
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,708
Now you listen to me.

221
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,208
The rest of us call Milim
the Demon Lord of Absurdity.

222
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,500
She just skips around punching
anyone who gets in her way.

223
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,875
How dare you compare me,
a beautiful, delicate flower,

224
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,250
to that overly violent,
pink-haired tornado?!

225
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,291
You'd better tone down
the attitude, mister,

226
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,541
or we'll have big problems!

00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:51,000
Huge problems! Giant problems!

228
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,416
[RIMURU]
Damn, she's obnoxious.

229
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,833
On the subject
of "overly violent,"

230
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,958
you, sir, have no business
using dangerous moves like that.

231
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,000
You shouldn't be so reckless.

232
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,333
Is it true
that you really know Milim?

233
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,041
Yeah, we met recently.

234
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,666
[RAMIRIS]
Hmm...

00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,458
Hold on a second.

Could it be that you're
that slime monster

of the Great Forest of Jura?

Wow, that's incredible!

Wait.

You're a slime?

[RIMURU]
Yep.

00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,250
Holy cow, it's true!

244
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,541
No way.

245
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,958

Sorry I didn't tell you guys.

[KENYA]
Awesome!

249
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,500
[RYOTA] You're like
the strongest slime ever.

250
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,333
[ALICE]
It's not that big of a deal.

251
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,833
[GALE] You truly are
a master of surprise, sir.

252
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:41,916
[RIMURU]
Yeah, it's a thing.

253
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,500
I'll tell you about it sometime.

254
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,583
Hello. Did you guys forget
that I was here?!

255
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,041
Oh, sorry.

256
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,541
Anyway, how exactly
did you hear about me?

257
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,583
You know how Milim is, right?

258
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,375
She showed up for
the first time in ages,

259
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,541
bragging about her
"bestie for restie,"

260
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,500
I thought she was lying
but I guess I was wrong.

261
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,416
[RIMURU]
If Milim really was here,

262
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
then that could mean
this fairy is telling the truth

263
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,333
about the whole
Demon Lord thing.

264
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,666
Why do you still look
suspicious of me?

265
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,291
You'd better believe that
I'm a real Demon Lord.

266
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,958
[RIMURU]
It's like she can read minds.

267
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,916
[FAIRIES giggling]

268
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,166
[mouthful]
It's so tasty. Wow!

269
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,958
Tasty, tasty, tasty.

270
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,583
[RIMURU] That cookie
is bigger than she is,

271
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,000
where does she put it?

272
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,500
[RAMIRIS]
Just so you know,

273
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,125
I never intended to actually
kill you or anything.

274
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,250
Seriously?

275
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,416
[RAMIRIS]
Seriously.

276
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,791
I was just gonna toy
with you a bit,

277
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,625
and then rush in
and save you at the last minute

278
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,750
to win your undying respect.

279
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,791
That's terrible.

280
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,583
It was the perfect plan.

281
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,833
But then you vaporized
my poor Elemental Colossus.

282
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,625
I spent all that time tinkering
with it to get it working,

283
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,166
and now it's just gone.

284
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,666
Don't blame me.

285
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,500
I thought it was either kill
or be killed, you know?

286
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,750
You don't get it.

287
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,083
That Colossus was
extra sophisticated.

288
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,625
[RIMURU]
Uh...

289
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,458
[RAMIRIS] I used earth spirits
to control its weight,

290
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,333
water spirits
to move its joints,

291
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,125
fire spirits
to generate power,

292
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,875
and wind spirits
to regulate heat.

293
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,666
It was a work of art.

294
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,958
That machine was the best
in spirit engineering.

295
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,291
Spirit engineering?

296
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,291
That sounds familiar.

297
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,708
[KAIJIN]
One of the projects

298
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,791
that Vesta had been
under pressure to complete,

299
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,458
the Magisoldier Project,

300
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,375
went up in smoke.

301
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,750
Is that like
the Magisoldier project

302
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,791
the dwarves and elves
were working on together?

303
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,666
The ones from Dwargon?

304
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,875
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

305
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,833
Yes, that's correct.

306
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,416
The whole reason
that project failed

307
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,250
is because they couldn't
produce the magicore

308
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,166
to act as the unit's heart.

309
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,500
There's also the fact
that plain ol' boring steel

310
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:43,375
would never be able to withstand
the full power of a spirit.

311
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,916
After it went berserk
and fell apart,

312
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,333
they threw out its shell.

313
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,083
So I bought it here
and restored it.

314
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,875
That's genius-level stuff.

315
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,541
I'm amazing, aren't I?

316
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,333
[RIMURU]
I guess.

317
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,208
It is pretty amazing, though.

318
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,458
I mean, she did manage
to complete the research

319
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,458
that Vesta's team failed at.

320
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,833
She comes off as an idiot.

321
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:06,208
But this Demon Lord Ramiris
is actually pretty smart.
