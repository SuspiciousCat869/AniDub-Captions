Answer.

Judging from the speed at which
it repairs its body tissue,

215

it is safe to assume
that the individual, Charybdis,

00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,916
I see you have a fondness
for pranks, Lord Rimuru.

328
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,416
-[MILIM gasps]
-In the future,

329
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,291
should you possess a similar
powerful magical weapon,

330
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,750
do try and use it at the start
of the battle instead.

331
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,000
It's not a prank,

332
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,083
I'm a real live Demon Lord,
damn it!

333
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,750
I blew Charybdis to pieces!

334
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,958
I see.

335
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,750
You want to keep
your weapon a secret.

336
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,833
Well, I understand.

337
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,416
Keeping your trump card
to yourself

338
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,625
is a wise move, you know.

339
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,583
I'm telling you, I killed it!

340
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,500
[DORF] Charybdis could have
rained all sorts of disasters

341
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,333
down on the world,
so its defeat benefits us all.

342
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,708
I suppose we should
take our leave

343
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,000
and get back to the king,

344
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,833
I'm sure he'll be
awaiting my report.

345
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,625
-[MILIM] Don't ignore me!
-Thank you again for your help.

346
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,083
And please give King Gazel
my regards.

347
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,041
[RIMURU]
Hey. You awake?

348
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,291
[groaning]

349
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,583
What the... Where am I?

350
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,166
And what the heck happened?

351
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,625
[RIMURU] Are you saying
you don't remember what you did?

352
00:17:58,958 --> 00:17:59,875
[PHOBIO gasps]

353
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,250
Please forgive me!

354
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,291
I've done something
unthinkable to Lady Milim!

355
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,250
And worse, I've involved
all of you in it as well.

356
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,875
[RIMURU]
Yeah, but why?

357
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,375
How did you know where Charybdis
was sealed in the forest?

358
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:16,083
It would be nearly impossible
for you to just stumble upon it.

359
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,375
-[RIMURU] Answer them.
-[PHOBIO] Of course.

360
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,375
You see...

361
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,250
Hold on.

362
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,958
Masked Harlequins
named Footman and Tear?

363
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,916
Did the mask look like this?

364
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,958
[PHOBIO]
No, the ones I met

365
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,125
were a girl with a tear
under one eye,

366
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,000
and a heavy-set man
whose mask had an angry face.

367
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,125
[gasps]

368
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,291
Wait. I wonder
if it was Laplace?

369
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,583
-[RIMURU] Who?
-He's a clown, too.

370
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,958
Laplace said he was
a servant of Lord Gelmud

371
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,041
when we spoke before battling
with the Orc Lord.

372
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,541
He was wearing a mask like
the one Treyni drew in the dirt.

373
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,166
[RIMURU gasps]

374
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,916
[GABIRU] Also, I think he said
he was the vice president

375
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,625
of some
jack-of-all-trades group,

376
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,708
called the
Moderate Harlequin Alliance.

377
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,541
[RIMURU] So, the dots
are all connected.

378
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,125
I see.

379
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,125
And you say this man
goes by the name of Laplace?

380
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,083
Footman, huh?

381
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,541
I'll take great care
not to forget that name.

382
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,291
Yes. Me, too.

383
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,333
[RIMURU]
So there's a mysterious group

384
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,791
called the
Moderate Harlequin Alliance.

385
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,250
And they pretend to help you,

386
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,166
but in reality they're
fulfilling their own goals

387
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,166
without getting
their hands dirty.

388
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,083
Sounds like a big bag of nope.

389
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,083
[MILIM]
Hmm?

390
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,875
Hey, why are you looking at me?

391
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,166
I don't know them, though,

392
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,916
if these clown people
really do exist,

393
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,708
I think they'd be fun
to meet one day.

394
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,666
[RIMURU]
Hmm.

395
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,125
And also,
maybe it wasn't Gelmud.

396
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,458
It could be that Clayman's

397
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,500
actually plotting something
in secret.

398
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,083
So there.

399
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,250
[RIMURU]
Why him?

400
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,666
[MILIM gasps]

401
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,458
[MILIM] Well, he's really
scheme-y like that.

402
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,125
[RIMURU]
Demon Lord Clayman, huh?

403
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,583
[PHOBIO] Regardless of
whoever's scheme it was,

404
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,458
what happened
is my own responsibility.

405
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,583
It's not
Demon Lord Carrion's fault.

406
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,375
So please, take my life,
but leave him out of this.

407
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,875
[RIMURU] Meh, next time
don't let a couple of clowns

408
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,125
make a fool out of you.

409
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,916
[PHOBIO gasps]

410
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,291
[RIMURU]
I think we're good here.

411
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,166
See you around.

412
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,833
But I...
What I did was unforgivable.

413
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,125
[RIMURU] Bro, if I say
we're cool, then we're cool.

414
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,583
Right, Milim?

415
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,416
Right you are, Rimuru.

416
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,416
I did think about giving Phobio
just one good punch,

417
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,625
but I'm far too mature
for such actions.

418
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,750
[RIMURU] You admit you thought
about it, though.

419
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:27,125
I'm not still mad at you,
so don't even worry about it.

420
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,208
[RIMURU] There you have it.
We're all good.

421
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,708
For sure.

422
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,791
-Is that okay with you, Carrion?
-[ALL gasp]

423
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,500
[gasps]

424
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,416
[PHOBIO]
Lord Carrion!

425
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,208
[scoffs]
So, you knew I was here, Milim?

426
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,416
[MILIM]
Yeah, naturally.

427
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,875
[RIMURU]
This guy is Demon Lord Carrion?

428
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,166
Hey, thanks for being
so understanding

429
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,208
and sparing my foolish
servant's life.

430
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,583
[RIMURU]
Hmm.

431
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,250
[CARRION]
So you're the masked majin

432
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,208
that defeated Gelmud?

433
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,708
[RIMURU]
Yep, that's me.

434
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,833
Are you here to avenge him?

435
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,833
[scoffs]
I'll pass. Get up.

436
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:08,916
[PHOBIO]
Yes, sir.

437
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:10,875
[gasps]

438
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,833
[loud thud]

439
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,041
-Sorry about that.
-[RIMURU] Huh?

440
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,166
My subordinate got carried away.

441
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,250
And it's my fault for not
keeping a closer eye on him.

442
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,458
Please forgive him.

443
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,791
Uh, yeah, sure.

444
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,916
Thank you. I'll owe you one.

445
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,541
If anything comes up
in the future,

446
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,791
you can count on me.

447
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,500
[RIMURU]
Now that you mention it,

448
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,291
what do you think about
possibly entering

449
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,000
into a non-aggression pact
with our nation?

450
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,750
[CARRION]
Is that all you want?

451
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,958
Fine then.

452
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,000
We can sort this out right now.

453
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,500
On behalf of Eurazania,

454
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,208
in the name of
the Beast Master, Carrion,

455
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,958
I swear that I'll never raise
a blade against your nation.

456
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,958
Thanks.

457
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,208
Sure.

458
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,666
Come on, let's go.

459
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,166
That dude's bleeding everywhere!

460
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,208
We're bound to meet
again soon, Rimuru.

461
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,458
Okay, then.

462
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,333
It's all over.

463
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,208
Let's go home, guys.

464
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,375
[ALL]
Right!

465
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,666
[GREAT SAGE] Next time,
"Yuuki Kagurazaka."
