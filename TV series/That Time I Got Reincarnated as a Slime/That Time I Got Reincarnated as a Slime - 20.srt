What's up?

488
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,958
Starting today,
I'm your new teacher!

489
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:22,875
[RIMURU groans]

490
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,333
[RIMURU]
Wait.

491
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,208
Aren't these kids
supposed to be on death's door?

492
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,416
Shouldn't that excess energy
be incinerating them

493
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,375
or something crazy like that?

494
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,000
[GIRL A]
Whoa, Ken, that was awesome!

495
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,500
[BOY A]
Is that your finishing move?

496
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,000
You totally perfected it.

497
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,416
[GIRL B]
Nah, it wasn't that great.

498
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,000
The teacher even dodged it.

499
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,875
Shut up! I'll get him!

500
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,041
[RIMURU]
What the what?

501
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,666
Did I walk into
the wrong classroom?

502
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,250
These kids are nothing
but hooligans!

503
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:49,083
He kinda looks like Miss Shizu.

504
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,750
Yeah? You think so?

505
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,375
No way he looks like her.

506
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,125

Kenya Misaki, age ten.

507
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,375
Ryota Sekiguchi, age ten.

508
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,791
Gale Gibson, age eleven.

509
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,000
Alice Rondo, age nine.

510
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,375
Chloe Aubert, age ten.

511

[magic reverberating]

512
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,291
Huh?

513
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,958
That was a weird feeling.

514
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,291
Was it Veldora?

515
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,416
Anyway, since these kids
don't have much time left,

516
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,791
I expected them to be more mild

517
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,625
and a little less monstrous.

518
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:53,916
[GREAT SAGE]
Next time.
