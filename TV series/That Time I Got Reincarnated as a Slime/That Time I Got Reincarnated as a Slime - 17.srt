What a delightful
turn of events.

[TEAR]
That's good, I guess.

485
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,916
But what's the real scoop?

486
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,666
Is this majin really so amazing

487
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,583
that even Milim
would stick around?

488
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,166
Only to the point where he can
no longer be ignored.

489
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,500
He'll never be a match for me,
after all.

490
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,083
Laplace thinks differently.

491
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,291
[TEAR]
How so?

492
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,708
[CLAYMAN]
He said there's an eeriness,

493
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,625
or something of that nature.

494
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,083
[TEAR]
Fascinating.

495
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,333
If a cunning guy
like Laplace says so,

496
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,833
then there must be
something to it.

497
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,000
At the very least,
I think we should investigate

498
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,041
why Demon Lord Milim
is so interested in this majin.

499
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,416
I agree.

500
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,583
We certainly need to gather
more information

501
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,833
and give it
all some thought.

502

[TEAR]
Yeah, that would be fun!

503
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,625
But back to what I found out.

504
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,125
Let's hear it.

505
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,750
[TEAR]
As it turns out,

506
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,458
Lady Frey has no interest
in the Great Forest of Jura.

507
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,125
She seems worried
about somethin'.

508
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,625
It kinda looked like she was
preparing for a fight!

509
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,500
And did you find out
what that might be?

510
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,958
[TEAR]
I did, and you won't believe it.

511
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,416
She was freaking out,

512
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
saying Charybdis
was gonna be revived.

Interesting.

You know, Tear,

I think I have another task
for you to handle.

I was hoping you would.

I've already called up Footman,

520
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,833
and we're definitely
ready for a fight.

Good, I'm glad to hear it.

522

However, I'd like you to avoid
violence this time around.

523
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,125
To start, go find
the location of the seal

524
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,875
and see whether or not
it's possible to tame Charybdis.

525
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,833
That's your new mission.

Leave it to me, Clayman.

Okay. I'll see you later.

Charybdis.

I see.

Rumored to have enough power
to rival a Demon Lord.

Yes, it will be
interesting to see
