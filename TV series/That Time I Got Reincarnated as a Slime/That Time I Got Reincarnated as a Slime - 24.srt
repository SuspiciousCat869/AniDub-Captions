because you killed my puppets.

481
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,541
It'll take more than that
to defeat an Archdemon.

482
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,458
A lower demon like you
could never possibly--

483
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,041
[ORTHOS groaning, choking]

484
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,041
Who's the lower demon, exactly?

485
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,666
For a dependent of Red,
you're quite overconfident.

486
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,583
That's why you can't judge
how powerful your opponents are.

487
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,750
[ORTHOS choking]
No, impossible.

488
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,625
You... You can't do this.

489
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,250
[BLACK]
You have disgraced yourself

490
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,416
by aligning
with these lower demons.

491
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,916
You don't deserve
to live anymore.

492
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,166
I think I shall
destroy your soul.

493
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,708
That way there's no possibility
of you ever being revived!

494
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,208
[ORTHOS]
No!

495
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,750
[screaming]
No!

496
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:32,958
[BLACK chuckles]

497
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,833
[birds chirping]

498
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,916
[RIMURU]
After that, all the demons

499
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,208
in the Kingdom of Filtwood
were purged.

500
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,291
The deaths of
the king and minister

501
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,666
were proclaimed to be the work
of a demon named Black.

502
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,916
And the records indicated
that Shizu was the champion

503
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,208
who destroyed the demon.

504
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,208
Now, as long as you keep
your story straight,

505
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,500
it will save me the trouble

506
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,791
of having to come
after you in the future.

507
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,958
[COUGAR] What was the deal with
that demon named Black anyway?

508
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,333
[SHIZU] I think we're better off
not knowing.

509
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:14,666
If you say so.

510
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,125
It's like people always say,

511
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,250
"ignorance is a blessing"
or whatever, right?

512
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,958
Well, I'm heading
in this direction.

513
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,625
Take care of yourself, Shizu.

514
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,833
[SHIZU]
I will. Until we meet again.

515
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:29,916
[SHIZU]
Well, then...

516
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,708
Perhaps one day
someone will be able to handle

517
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,583
that demon better than I did.

518
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,916
[RIMURU]
And so, time passed.

519
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,083
[BLACK chuckles]

520
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,583
It seems that mask
has appeared again.

521
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,791
I suppose the rumors are true.

522
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,041
And the slime monster,

523
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,833
he's very interesting.

524
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,583
[snickering]

525
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,166
[RIMURU] And even though
the whole thing

526
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,125
was one-sided and silent,

527
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:09,083
that's how Rimuru and Black
had their first encounter.

528
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:12,166
Black would later be summoned
by Rimuru himself,

529
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,916
and would receive a new name.

530
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,291
Diablo.

531
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:21,041
