in the dark here.

326
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,708
[evil laughter]

327
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,416
[gasps]

328
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,833
I thought you were brave to
call me baldy after seeing me,

329
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,750
but it turns out
you are blind.

330
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,791
Fine. I shall
bestow sight upon you.

331
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,125
Huh?

332
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,083
However, there are
a few small conditions.

333
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,333
What say you?

334
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,416
[SATORU]
Uh, depends on the conditions.

335
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,958
[MALE VOICE]
They're fairly simple.

336
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,458
You must promise not to fear me

337
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,458
when you gain
the ability to see.

338
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,625
And I'd like for you to come
and visit again sometime.

339
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,791
That is all. Are those
terms agreeable to you?

340
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,333
Wait, is that seriously it?

341
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,708
Yes. You see, small one,

342
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,458
I was sealed in this cave
300 years ago.

343
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,583
Ever since then,
I've had nothing to do

344
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,708
other than be
exceptionally bored.

345
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,416
So, do we have a deal?

346
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,666
[SATORU] Well, I'm kinda curious
about the whole sealed thing,

347
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,375
but, whatever,
you got a deal!

348
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,583
Excellent.

349
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,875
There is a skill
called Magic Sense.

350
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,791
Can you use it?

351
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,541
I don't know what it is.

352
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,291
It allows you to sense
the magicules around you.

353
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:35,500
So if I can detect those
magicules, I'd be able to see?

354
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,083
All right, I'll give it a shot.

355
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,125
[grunting in effort]

356
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,166
Hey, something's happening!

357
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,541
Is this what magicules
look like?

358
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,000
Oh! [chuckles]

359
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,125
[GREAT SAGE] Extra skill:
Magic Sense acquired.

360
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,208
[SATORU]
Oh snap! Wait, "extra skill"?

361
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,041
Skills with power
and efficiency

362
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,291
which are higher
than those of normal skills.

363
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,875
Whoa! That sounds
extra awesome!

364
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,833
[GREAT SAGE] Would you like
to use Magic Sense?

365
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,000
[SATORU]
Yes!

366
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,791
Whoa! [chuckles]

367
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:17,291
I can see! I can see!
I can see, see, see!

368
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,666
Oh, yeah!

369
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,000
Bummer alert.
I really am a slime.

370
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,833
-[MALE VOICE] How'd it go?
-[SATORU] Great.

371
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,750
I did it! Thank you so much.

372
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,583
[groans, screams]

373
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,958
Holy crap! You're a dragon?!

374
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,250
[groaning]

375
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,625
Allow me to formally
introduce myself.

376
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,500
Uh, sure.

377
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,166
I am Veldora.

378
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,625
The Storm Dragon.

379
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,458
That sounds serious.

380
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,000
I am one of only four
True Dragons

381
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,750
that exist in this world.

382
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,750
[evil laughter]

383
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,625
Hey, don't forget
our deal, slime.

384
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,458
I would never!
It's not like I'm scared!

385
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,208
But I gotta run, so I'll come
and visit sometime. Bye!

386
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,458
-Hold it!
-[squeals]

387
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,166
Something is amiss.

388
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,208
Slimes are normally low-ranked
monsters that do not think.

389
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:25,083
Yet you seem intelligent.
Are you Unique?

390
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,333
I honestly don't know
what that means.

391
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,625
It refers to a being
with extraordinary abilities.

392
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,958
[SATORU]
I may be. I don't know.

393
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,000
The truth is,
I used to be a human.

394
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,000
Then I got stabbed
to death and sha-bam.

395
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,333
The next thing I knew
I looked like this.

396
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,166
[VELDORA] Yes, I see.
You were reincarnated.

397
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,583
[SATORU]
I guess.

398
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,958
And now I'm living my life
as a slime monster.

399
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,458
[VELDORA]
It is very unusual

400
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,708
for someone to come
into this world that way.

401
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,708
Huh? It is?

402
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,375
Occasionally,
there are others

403
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,041
who will come here
from a different world.

404
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,083
But you are the first I've known
that was reincarnated here.

405
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,041
Most beings are unable
to withstand

406
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,458
having only their soul
traverse worlds.

407
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,166
[SATORU] Wait, so there are
people who come here

408
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,125
from other worlds,
but never through reincarnation?

409
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:12,041
Hmm. We call them
"Otherworlders."

410
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,416
I've heard that they gain
special abilities

411
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,083
based on their desires
when they cross into this land.

412
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,916
Oh, that makes sense.

413
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,541
That's probably
how I got my skills.

414
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,250
I wonder if there are
other people from Japan here.

415
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,416
I think I'm gonna go try

416
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,791
and find some of
those Otherworlders.

417
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,625
[VELDORA] What's this?
You're leaving so soon?

418
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,250
[SATORU]
The dude's pouting?

419
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,416
Well, uh...

420
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
I guess I could stay
a little longer.

421
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,625
I mean, there's no rush
or anything.

422
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,875
Excellent!
Please stay as long as you like!

423
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,250
[SATORU sighs]

424
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,583
Oh, yeah, didn't you mention
something earlier

425
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,416
about how you were sealed
in this cave, Veldora?

426
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,416
Yes, it's a great story.

427
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,208
It was 300 years ago.

428
00:18:55,916 --> 00:19:00,041
I sort of accidentally
burned down an entire town.

429
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,666
[SATORU]
"Accidentally"?

430
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,750
[VELDORA] So of course,
someone came looking to slay me.

431
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,000
It's possible
that I underestimated

432
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,208
my opponent a bit.

433
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,541
About halfway through the battle

434
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,916
I started using
my full strength.

435
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,666
Yet I still lost somehow!

436
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,041
Seriously?

437
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,000
But you seem like
a pretty strong dude.

438
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,416
Was your opponent
super powerful?

439
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Yes, extremely powerful.

440
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:25,041
The humans called her a hero,
blessed with divine protection.

441
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,916
[SATORU]
A blessed hero?

442
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,333
Sounds like something
out of a video game.

443
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,125
[VELDORA]
Using her Unique Skill,

444
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,291
she overpowered me in battle.

445
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:39,875
And then sealed me away
using Unlimited Imprisonment.

446
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,125
[SATORU]
Is that shiny stuff

447
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,291
her Unlimited
Imprisonment spell?

448
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,791
Yes.

449
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,916
Also, you should know
the hero referred to herself

450
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,708
as something called
a "Summon."

451
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,291
A Summon?

452
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,708
Is that supposed to be
different from an Otherworlder?

453
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,166
It requires more than
30 mages performing a ritual

454
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,041
that lasts several days
to bring someone here.

455
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,250
Sweet! You guys have mages here?

456
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,291
This is starting to sound
more like a game!

457
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:07,125
The Summon is expected
to perform as a powerful weapon.

458
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,208
[SATORU]
A weapon?

459
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,833
[VELDORA]
Yes, for the Summoner.

460
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,708
They use magic to carve a curse
into the Summon's soul.

461
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,500
That way they can
never defy their master.

462
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,500
What the heck?
That's seriously messed up, man!

463
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,041
Is it?

464
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,625
I'm not sure
what your world was like,

465
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,250
but in this world,

466
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,833
the only thing that matters
is survival of the fittest.

467
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,500
[SATORU]
Huh.

468
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,041
So, you've been
stuck in this cave

469
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,750
ever since that hero sealed you
here 300 years ago?

470
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:39,333
That is correct.
I am so incredibly bored.

471
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,208
Man, and here I thought
I was lonely

472
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,750
just because I never had
a girlfriend

473
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,375
in my previous life.

474
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,958
Being all alone for 300 years
would be a real suck fest.

475
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,458
That's it!

476
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,458
Hey, what if you
and I became friends?

477
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,041
Are you serious?

478
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,833
Me, the mighty
Storm Dragon, Veldora,

479
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,208
become friends
with a lowly slime?!

480
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,666
Yeah, you're right.
It was a stupid idea.

481
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,833
Now, hold on.

482
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,958
I never said
that I didn't want to.

483
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,958
So, uh, does that mean
you're cool with it?

484
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,791
I suppose
I could make an exception.

485
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,333
Just this once,
I'd be willing to consider it.

486
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,750
[SATORU]
Playing hard to get?

487
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,708
Fine, that settles it, then.
We're friends.

488
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,666
Unless of course you'd rather
hang out here alone.

489
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,583
No, I wouldn't.
Today is your lucky day, slime!

490
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,875
We'll be friends.

491
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,791
Whatever makes you
feel better about it.

492
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,541
Well, put her there, pal!

493
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,916
Right. Pal.

494
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,083
[SATORU]
It's kind of weird

495
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,583
trying to make
new friends at my age,

496
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,250
-and with a dragon, no less.

00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,958
[SATORU]
Anyway, that's the story

498
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,708
of how I got stabbed, died,

499
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,500
was reincarnated as a slime,
and made friends

500
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,625
with the super powerful
Storm Dragon, Veldora.

501
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,708
My totally normal life
as a 37-year-old man

502
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,541
is ancient history.

503
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,416
I still can't believe
all that's happened.

504
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,291
But this is my new life now.

505
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,041
Or should I call it a "slife"?

506
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,583
Oh, yeah.

507
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,208
I hope Tamura remembered
to wipe my hard drive for me.

508
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,583
Man, I hope he didn't look
to see what's on it.

509
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,708
[grunting]

510
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,166
[crackles]

511
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,583
[hissing]

512
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,125
All done.
Please rest in peace, Satoru.

513
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,791
If I ever have a son,

514
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,583
I'll name him after the hero
who saved my life.
