00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.097 position:50% align:center
[LITTLE SISTER]
Thanks for breakfast!

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.098 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
You're welcome.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.933 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Hey, good morning, Sis.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.185 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Yeah, good morning.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.187 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Oh, Rin's calling.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.439 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
You up, Nayuta?

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:23.440 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
I am.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:24.441 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Good morning.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.692 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Good morning.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:27.027 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Later.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU laughs]

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:29.946 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU] Weren't you
supposed to go out today?

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.032 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Where are my glasses?

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.325 position:50% align:center
[LITTLE SISTER]
Sis, check your forehead.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.952 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Oh.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.246 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU panting]
Thanks!

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.759 position:50% align:center
[RIN] All right, we should
go over last night's show,

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:15.969 position:50% align:center
so let's do it, okay?

00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:17.971 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Okay.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:21.349 position:50% align:center
I dunno, Rin, I thought that
we had a pretty solid show.

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:22.767 position:50% align:center
Right, Fubuki?

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:26.521 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Mafuyu, half the
audience was practically family,

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.189 position:50% align:center
so we really do need
to think about this

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:29.733 position:50% align:center
a little more carefully.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.359 position:50% align:center
That's certainly true.

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
I wonder if it would have been
a good idea to conduct a survey.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:35.739 position:50% align:center
Yeah, about that.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.157 position:50% align:center
I wanted to get all
kinds of opinions,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.533 position:50% align:center
and since we had
the show recorded

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:41.369 position:50% align:center
so we could review it later,
well, I put it online.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
Wow! As usual, you work fast!

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.876 position:50% align:center
Looks like it's not getting
a lot of views, though.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50% align:center
Well, that's to be expected,

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:52.380 position:50% align:center
given the fact we're
relative nobodies.

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:54.132 position:50% align:center
There are all sorts
of comments, too,

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.009 position:50% align:center
so why don't you guys
give them a read.

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:59.262 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] Let's see...
"The stand-up wasn't great."

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:01.056 position:50% align:center
"The comedy routines
were a little hard

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
to understand," they say.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.144 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Some of these
are rather harsh.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center
It's clear that our comedy
didn't hit the mark

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
all that well with some viewers.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.149 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:14.152 position:50% align:center
[gasping] Mafuyu's mood just
went from sunny to frozen!

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.779 position:50% align:center
Not just Mafuyu's.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:16.654 position:50% align:center
No kidding.

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.406 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu!

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
Well, for now, our challenge is
to come up with better material.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:22.702 position:50% align:center
Yes, absolutely!

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:25.413 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu! What happened
to your gloominess?

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.290 position:50% align:center
[laughs] That was just an act!

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:30.043 position:50% align:center
[sighs] And here I thought
you were about to fall down

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:31.544 position:50% align:center
the rabbit hole.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Watching Mafuyu fool
with you certainly is fun.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:38.051 position:50% align:center
W-Was the point of that whole
act just to mess with me?

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:41.137 position:50% align:center
Well, anyone who saw that
could tell she was doing a bit.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Mm-hm.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.726 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] So Mafuyu was messing
with me. I was deceived.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
I wonder if I hit the right
beat with that reaction.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Anyway, the four of us
actually have the same day off

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
for once. What should we do?

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
We obviously need to
work on better materials

00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
as things start getting closer
the New Comedy Kings contest.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.867 position:50% align:center
So why don't we head out and
look for some inspiration?

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
That's a good idea. Let's first
come up with some bits

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.663 position:50% align:center
that'll get us through
the prelims,

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
and then we can polish them!

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] All right!
But before that, excuse me!

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
One supersized
choco-banana parfait!

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
There's no way they have that.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
We have it.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.591 position:50% align:center
Guess there is a way.

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.138 position:50% align:center
Let me think now!
What should we do?

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Ah!

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:25.765 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hm?

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I found turtle food
there at such a great price!

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
[RIN grumbles]

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
--[RIN] Oh.
--[NAYUTA] Hm?

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
[RIN laughs]

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
By the way.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50% align:center
I happened to find a
questionable-looking buffet

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.165 position:50% align:center
the other day in Kawagoe.
Wanna see?

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:54.127 position:50% align:center
What kind of place was it? Huh?

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
[RIN, NAYUTA]
Ahh...

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
That was delicious!

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center
I'm really glad
we came here today!

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait! We're here for jokes!

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hm... Over there!

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Hm?

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.976 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] "We have come here
to invade your planet."

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.394 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
You're just pigeons.

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] "What are you talking
about? We are invaders."

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.523 position:50% align:center
[RIN] You're pigeons,
any way you slice it.

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
"We are parasitic predators."

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Your beaks aren't even moving!

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.029 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
"I could go for some peanuts."

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Thinking like a pigeon.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.950 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] "Not so. Our invasion
is about to--peanuts!

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
A-hoo!"

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Huh?

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
What's with you and
the pigeon dubbing?

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
It was hilarious, wasn't it?

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.919 position:50% align:center
Was it though? There were
too many curveballs.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.922 position:50% align:center
And yet you still hit every
one of them out of the park.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.800 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
[sighs] If we can get into a
nice back-and-forth tempo

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.931 position:50% align:center
like we just did, maybe the
audience would get more into it.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
I suppose. Was our show good?
And please, be honest.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
[RIN] I can't say it was
a huge success.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] And as Fubuki
was saying earlier,

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:00.694 position:50% align:center
the audience was
practically family.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.071 position:50% align:center
But to tell the truth,
I'm happy that the four of us

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.198 position:50% align:center
were able to plan
a show and pull it off.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
It taught us a lot.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
At least we didn't totally bomb.
That's an encouraging thing.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.956 position:50% align:center
Which is why I want to get even
more laughs next time around!

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
Then we'd better start coming up

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
with some new side-
splitting material!

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
Uh. We're totally gonna
bomb at this rate.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:25.343 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU groans] I ate too much.
I need to sit a minute.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:28.346 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed. You finished
that entire parfait.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.932 position:50% align:center
And now that you have, let's
go interview a hundred people

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
to help us find
some new material!

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
What? No way! That's impossible!

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50% align:center
That's what you get
for messing with me.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.107 position:50% align:center
But if we really did
go interview people,

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center
it might give us some ideas.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:44.863 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah, I guess that is true.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
I'll let you do the talking.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.827 position:50% align:center
And why is that?

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50% align:center
You know... I'm awkward.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
That's for sure true.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center
Aw...

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
So then, how should we go
about finding new material?

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.676 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] "You're going to
trip if you run like that!"

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
"Are you okay?"

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
Ah... [laughs]

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center
"Funny face!"

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.270 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI laughs]

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.439 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
What is it?

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.275 position:50% align:center
That just reminded me a
little of my childhood.

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
About how I used to
make my little sister

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.529 position:50% align:center
laugh the same way she just did.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:29.532 position:50% align:center
Comedy sure is a
wonderful thing, isn't it?

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.910 position:50% align:center
And it feels good
to make people laugh.

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Mm.

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
Plus, comedy has fixed
my awkwardness!

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
That's a lie, and you know it.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:40.418 position:50% align:center
Hey, it really has gotten
a little bit better, I swear!

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:46.925 position:50% align:center
Well, it's almost time to meet
up with Rin and Nayuta.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
Oh! We didn't come up
with any new material.

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
Ahh! What are we gonna do?

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.561 position:50% align:center
[KANAE sighs]

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:01.690 position:50% align:center
You seem kind of down,
Kana. What's up?

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
Nothing really--

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:05.568 position:50% align:center
it's just that I went to talk to
the guidance counselor today.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
And I realized I haven't been
thinking seriously enough

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
about my future.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.158 position:50% align:center
You're set on going
to college, right?

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:14.577 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU] Mm. Yeah.
I guess that's the plan.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
I've gotta give this
all some more thought.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU gasps]

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.252 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kana, want to come over?

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.336 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50% align:center
I want to show you something!

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.718 position:50% align:center
Rin has a channel now?

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and this is a video of
their comedy show yesterday.

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center
It's already up?

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.725 position:50% align:center
It doesn't look like it has
a whole lot of views, though.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
Well, it's new but it's gotten
plenty of views from me.

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:39.936 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center
Let's keep that a secret, okay?

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:45.817 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.277 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Are we laughing too much?

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.362 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
It's not like we can help it!

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.614 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] Hey, gotta say, we don't
get to see Fuyu perform

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.450 position:50% align:center
in front of a live crowd a lot.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.952 position:50% align:center
For some reason, she's so
different when she's onstage.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50% align:center
She sure is.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
You're the best
when you're laughing!

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:17.974 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.100 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:21.478 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.271 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:24.773 position:50% align:center
[COMMUTERS chattering]

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA] Your channel's
view count is so low.

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.361 position:50% align:center
Why are you bringing
that up all of a sudden?

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
Don't focus on that, instead
focus on selling tickets

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
or we'll be buying 'em
ourselves again.

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center
You still have
some left, Tomita?

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.495 position:50% align:center
I don't believe it!

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
You've broken your streak
and finally sold some tickets?

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
It's because I made the decision

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:45.001 position:50% align:center
really early on that
I'd buy them all myself.

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.253 position:50% align:center
Just go sell them.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.256 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
How did things go?

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.258 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU groans]
A swing and a miss.

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:54.010 position:50% align:center
We didn't come up with anything.

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:55.011 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
How 'bout you?

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
Uh, well, the thing is...

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
By the way,
what's in these bags?

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.893 position:50% align:center
Well, actually...

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:04.145 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Could it be props
for a physical gag?

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
This is Rin's dinner
for tonight!

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center
That's turtle food!

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
Then what about this.
Look, it's a Frisbee!

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.445 position:50% align:center
You're paying for that
if you throw it.

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.823 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA grunting]

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
So, you just went shopping.

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
Don't pretend like you're
any different from us.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:22.622 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center
Huh? Look, it's
Tomita and Hatsuna!

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Sure is.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:27.419 position:50% align:center
Since they're our elders,

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
maybe they'll treat us
to something here.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
They should!

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.549 position:50% align:center
Hello there! Just two?

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the cafe!

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.429 position:50% align:center
--[RIN] Hey!
--[MAFUYU] Stop him, ma'am

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
On it!

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA] Please get out of the
way, ma'am! I'm begging you!

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:46.521 position:50% align:center
[RIN] So, you're here to sell
tickets to your show?

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA] Yep.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
The Yoshimoto Mugendai
Hall in Shibuya, huh?

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
I've never seen
a show there before.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
Really now, you don't say.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.698 position:50% align:center
Well then, wouldn't you
like to have that ticket?

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
Really? Are you sure?
Thank you so much!

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
For a thousand yen.

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.204 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Uh! You're charging me?

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:04.998 position:50% align:center
Well, it's only because
we've got to buy back

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.083 position:50% align:center
any tickets we aren't
able to sell.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.836 position:50% align:center
So, we're asking... can
you please help us out?

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
So, then the reason you
tried to run just now...

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
Right. We're strapped for cash.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50% align:center
Things this month
are really tight.

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:20.472 position:50% align:center
That's a thousand yen
apiece. Much obliged!

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.557 position:50% align:center
As thanks for your purchase,
I'll treat all of you

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
to your choice of any
one thing on the menu.

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
You'd just be paying
with the money

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
we just gave you
for the tickets.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:30.106 position:50% align:center
That doesn't really feel
like you're treating us.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm excited that we're
gonna get to see their material!

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.486 position:50% align:center
I'm so looking forward to it!

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:38.323 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's all meet up
at Shibuya Station then!

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
I'm home!

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
Hey, welcome back home, sis!

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.120 position:50% align:center
Hey there, Fuyu. Welcome
home, how was your day?

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.373 position:50% align:center
Oh, Kanae!
It's so good to see you.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:49.292 position:50% align:center
Mm. Natsu and I were
just checking out a video

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
of that show you had yesterday.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
That's what you were watching?
That's so great to hear!

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
I just wish the view
count was higher.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:58.051 position:50% align:center
h, don't worry, I'm sure
it'll keep going up, Fuyu!

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
After all, it had me
laughing like crazy!

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:03.640 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Thanks for
saying that, Kanae.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:06.267 position:50% align:center
Actually, we've got another
video up there too--a making of.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
You do?

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see a "Tokonatsu and
RDeco: Behind the Scenes."

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
Is this it?

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Yep!

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasping]

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.577 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] All right, I think
that's enough for tonight?

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
It's kind of embarrassing.

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
What? But it was just
getting good, though!

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:39.467 position:50% align:center
You'd better stop it or...

00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:42.053 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:44.806 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:46.558 position:50% align:center
[ALL laughing]

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU gasps]
It's already this late?

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.062 position:50% align:center
I'd better hurry up
and make dinner.

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.440 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kanae, you're gonna
stay over tonight, right?

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] Huh?

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.152 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I'm gonna make sure
you don't sleep a wink.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center
Cut that out.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:03.074 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
What? You wanna be a comedian?

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:05.744 position:50% align:center
I just kinda feel like I want
to give it a shot, too.

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.162 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
You saw my sister's show.
I kinda wanna be like her.

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:14.085 position:50% align:center
That's why... I was hoping
that you could do me a favor.

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:15.378 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:16.629 position:50% align:center
[KANAE yelps]

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.965 position:50% align:center
I want you to join me
as my comedy partner!

00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:21.217 position:50% align:center
Huh? What?!

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
Is that a no?

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:26.598 position:50% align:center
It's just that you asked
me out of nowhere.

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:29.100 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
How was school?

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:30.977 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
Well, um...

00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:33.229 position:50% align:center
Okay, I had a guidance meeting.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
Gotcha. A guidance
meeting, huh?

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:39.319 position:50% align:center
Hey, since we're
talking about that,

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
why did you want to
get into comedy, Fuyu?

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
Why did I want to?

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:48.995 position:50% align:center
I suppose because it's fun!

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
For a little while,
I guess I could try it.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
Really? All right!

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
Great, so now...
what do you think

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
is the first thing a
comedian would do?

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center
Natsu! You're asking me?

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:07.138 position:50% align:center
Let me think...
Maybe choose a name?

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:08.973 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that is the first thing!

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
I want to shoot for a name that
kinda feels like Tokonatsu!

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:16.272 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] So Tokonatsu,
Tokonatsu. Tsu, tsu, tsu.

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
Tsu... Tsundora?

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:18.650 position:50% align:center
Like "tundra"?

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:19.818 position:50% align:center
Tsu... Tsugether?

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:21.361 position:50% align:center
That's way too forced!

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:24.406 position:50% align:center
All right, I hear you. It's
settled then, we're "Tsundora"!

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
Why don't we keep this
between us for now, okay?

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center
Sis is gonna be so surprised!

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center
She sure is.

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:34.416 position:50% align:center
We should talk about
our material. Let's see...

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.251 position:50% align:center
I wonder how people
come up with it.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
I knew this was gonna happen!

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:42.424 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
I'm here!

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:44.217 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
We made it to Shibuya!

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.427 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Let's get going.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Yes, let's!

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center
Rin, is this the way
to Mugendai Hall?

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.809 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Mm. Mmm-hmm.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:55.812 position:50% align:center
Hey, it looks like JK Cool's
performing today, too.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.564 position:50% align:center
That does appear to be the case.

00:14:57.647 --> 00:15:00.358 position:50% align:center
Perfect timing. Let's go check
out their show to help gear up

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:01.818 position:50% align:center
for the New Comedy
Kings contest!

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.945 position:50% align:center
Oh, we're conducting
some reconnaissance.

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:05.113 position:50% align:center
That's the plan!

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:07.032 position:50% align:center
You bet it is!

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Whoa! So, this is Mugendai Hall!

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.959 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] Hey Rin,
let's go buy our tickets!

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:19.127 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Right.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.379 position:50% align:center
[ERU] Oh, Arashi,
it's so dark, isn't it?

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:23.173 position:50% align:center
The only thing that
the foolish masses

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.424 position:50% align:center
want of royalty such as we,

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
is for us to illuminate
the kingdom

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.844 position:50% align:center
with our complete cluelessness!

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
So, we're doing a
fantasy thing now?

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.222 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone! We're JK Cool!

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:33.516 position:50% align:center
What am I even doing
letting you set the pace here?

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
I just decided to hammer
in an introduction there.

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:37.103 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we all saw that.

00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:38.646 position:50% align:center
Exams are over!

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.857 position:50% align:center
You're talking about that now?
Taking aim at yourself, huh?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
Just listen for a sec.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
Today when I got a good look
at that page of questions

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:47.614 position:50% align:center
on our last test... I knew
that all hope was lost!

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:51.534 position:50% align:center
What? On the last test we had?
That was math, right?

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.537 position:50% align:center
And the first questions were
on trigonometric functions?

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:57.332 position:50% align:center
[ERU] Yeah! I drew a blank
right from the start!

00:15:57.415 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
Sine, cosine, and tangent.

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
The Three Musketeers
showed up all at once!

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] I don't really get it,
but using personification

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:05.715 position:50% align:center
is a great mnemonic device.

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.175 position:50% align:center
And each one of
them was all like,

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:08.885 position:50% align:center
"What in the world
are you trying to do

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.470 position:50% align:center
with just me, mademoiselle?"

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
"You'll need the others.
Use them."

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:14.683 position:50% align:center
You know, trigonometry's
actually useful for all sorts

00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
of things. I hear they use
it a lot in surveying.

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
--In surveying?
--Yeah.

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
You think that's me? Surveying?

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
I'd say that's like if I went
parasailing down in tropical

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
Okinawa, while you got stuck
staring at the ice floes

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
at Cape Soya, all the way
up there in Hokkaido.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
I can see you there now.
You're shivering! Brr!

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.161 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Are you trying to say

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
that it's not remotely
close to something you'd do?

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.709 position:50% align:center
That was my fault. Surveying
might be a little too hard.

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:41.835 position:50% align:center
Yeah...

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.712 position:50% align:center
Um. Then how about,
uh, cake-cutting!

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.088 position:50% align:center
Cake-cutting?

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.298 position:50% align:center
Mm-hm. In order to cut a
round cake into six pieces,

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
you first divide
360 degrees by six.

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
The cosine of 60 degrees is
one-half-- You listening?

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
You're talking about
cake-cutting! I'm so on board!

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.726 position:50% align:center
They had this cake at
my cousin's wedding--

00:16:57.809 --> 00:17:00.603 position:50% align:center
It was this ginormous,
and when they brought it out,

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:01.813 position:50% align:center
the emcee was like,

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:05.233 position:50% align:center
"This is your first
collaborative project."

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.109 position:50% align:center
He really said that!

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:07.318 position:50% align:center
Getting back on track,

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:08.778 position:50% align:center
you need trig to cut
a round cake into six--

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:10.864 position:50% align:center
[ERU]
Stuff like that doesn't matter!

00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:12.115 position:50% align:center
Scuse me?

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
A happy couple's first
collaborative project

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.953 position:50% align:center
doesn't need to be split into
six or however many pieces.

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
"What if they can't cut it
evenly?" Who cares about that?

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
I was just using that
as an example of trig--

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.127 position:50% align:center
[ERU]
Let me just say this!

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.255 position:50% align:center
Here's the thing
about wedding cakes!

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.840 position:50% align:center
The fact is...

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:31.134 position:50% align:center
...they always come out
already cut in Japan!

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.928 position:50% align:center
And I've had it with you
cutting me off! Forget this!

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
[ERU, ARASHI]
Thank you very much!

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:37.599 position:50% align:center

[NAYUTA] Do you think he's
one of the comedians?

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:52.113 position:50% align:center
He might know something.
Let's ask him.

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
Oh, Freak? Their show
is in the Mugendai Dome.

00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
Head on up to
the seventh floor.

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.206 position:50% align:center
The seventh floor?

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
So, this is the Mugendai Dome.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:04.709 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
So tiny!

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
Is there only one other
person here besides us?

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.963 position:50% align:center
It does look that way.

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:11.216 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's starting.

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50% align:center
[SAMESHIMA] Hey, there! The two
of us are BANBANBAN!

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center
So, uh, listen something
terrible happened to me

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
--on my way over here.
--What's that?

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
I didn't know how to
get here, you know,

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
so I was walking around
glued to my phone.

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:23.728 position:50% align:center
That's bad in so many ways.
Just figure it out!

00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:25.105 position:50% align:center
And someone glued to their phone

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:27.607 position:50% align:center
was walking straight at me,
and we collided, boom!

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
Which meant, whoosh,
phone went flying.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.986 position:50% align:center
It bounced off of a
shop sign with a clang

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.113 position:50% align:center
and then landed in the basket

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
of a passing bicycle
with a thud.

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.157 position:50% align:center
Ha. That doesn't sound good.

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center
I was like, "Come back!"
and sprinted after it.

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
The bicycle then
goes down a curb.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center
The wheels go ba-bump.
And my phone just zooms up.

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
You can kiss that
screen goodbye.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:48.253 position:50% align:center
And then, some guy walked by
and it got stuck in his head.

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:49.504 position:50% align:center
Inside? That's crazy!

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:51.756 position:50% align:center
I know! Who has
an afro these days?

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.425 position:50% align:center
Not what I was picturing. And?

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.593 position:50% align:center
The guy could obviously feel
something was up there,

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:58.596 position:50% align:center
so he started shaking his head.
Which made my phone fall out.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.889 position:50% align:center
Well now, that screen's
gone for sure.

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:02.726 position:50% align:center
Actually a cat showed up,
jumped at my phone,

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
and caught it in its
mouth just then.

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
[YAMAMOTO]
A cat? That's unbelievable!

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.690 position:50% align:center
I know! It's usually dogs
who do that kinda stuff.

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:10.275 position:50% align:center
Not the surprising part.

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:12.235 position:50% align:center
Then I'm all like,
"Follow that cat!"

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
--So you lost your phone?
--I didn't.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
I caught up to the cat and
it put my phone right here.

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
And the screen didn't
have a scratch on it.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
How lucky is that?

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.370 position:50% align:center

introduce the main act.

It's probably because
you're my partner.

up suddenly outta nowhere?

[TOMITA]
What?

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:02.577 position:50% align:center
First, you'll have to learn
how to mimic his voice.

his voice is like

00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
These aren't lifts,
and I am not Kento Ito!

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.652 position:50% align:center
Well, now you are.

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:37.904 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA] Why are you staring
at me like that?

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
Try not to get too starstruck.

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center
Something's not right!

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:42.450 position:50% align:center
And what is that
supposed to mean?

00:20:42.534 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
That Tomita stink that you give
off is still so overpowering!

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:46.454 position:50% align:center
Don't talk as if I
smell like an old man!

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:50.166 position:50% align:center
Ugh, my wild imagination as
a huge self-shipper is undone

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.710 position:50% align:center
by that Tomita stink!

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:54.087 position:50% align:center
Everything is completely
powerless before it!

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
Oh, truly, it is a stink
beyond all compare.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
Whatchu you doin' anyway?

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:01.469 position:50% align:center
Tomita, the makeover's a bust!

00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
But you hardly did anything!

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:04.389 position:50% align:center
Never mind.

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] Thanks.
You've been a great crowd!

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
--[NAYUTA] Heh...
--[RIN] Uhh...

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:15.275 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] I have to say--
they sure had some energy.

00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:16.651 position:50% align:center
And not much else.

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:18.403 position:50% align:center
Should we go see them?

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Mmm...

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:22.282 position:50% align:center
Well, it'd be a good idea
to at least say hello.

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:23.116 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
Hey, there!

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:25.910 position:50% align:center
Thank you for coming to see us!

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:27.662 position:50% align:center
Oh! Good work out there.

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
You don't have to say a word.

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:31.332 position:50% align:center
We didn't have that much
of a crowd tonight,

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
but they'll only get bigger!

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:34.544 position:50% align:center
You're such an optimistic fool.

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:35.920 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
That's a bit much.

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:37.380 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA] How are they supposed
to respond to that?

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:38.882 position:50% align:center
Think it through!

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:41.301 position:50% align:center
S'cuse me. I wanted to say
thank you to you two for today.

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:42.927 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll see you
at work then!

00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Yep!

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
You know, I can tell.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
It looks like those four
had a pretty good time.

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:51.728 position:50% align:center
They see us differently now.

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:53.355 position:50% align:center
I'd say it's more like
we clearly need

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:55.231 position:50% align:center
to polish our
material some more.

00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center
[INOUE] You two are pretty
funny. Keep up the good work.

00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:22:04.783 --> 00:22:06.451 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Someday, I want to be standing

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:07.952 position:50% align:center
up there on that stage, too.

00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:09.454 position:50% align:center
In the Mugendai Dome.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:11.706 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but that's only
halfway there.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.209 position:50% align:center
If anything, we should
be aiming for the top.

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:16.544 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Right! Comedy's hall of fame:

00:22:16.628 --> 00:22:19.047 position:50% align:center
the Namba Grand Kagetsu!

00:23:55.477 --> 00:23:58.229 position:50% align:center
I wonder what we have
to do to get more views.

00:23:58.313 --> 00:24:01.983 position:50% align:center
Tomita did an impression
with his rubber-band gag.

00:24:02.067 --> 00:24:03.401 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,

00:24:03.485 --> 00:24:06.738 position:50% align:center
does he have any other
impressions besides that one?

00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:11.701 position:50% align:center
Probably not. Rubber bands, huh?

00:24:11.785 --> 00:24:14.412 position:50% align:center
Yeah, not happening.

00:24:15.997 --> 00:24:17.540 position:50% align:center
[RIN, NAYUTA]
What's next on Maesetsu?

00:24:17.624 --> 00:24:18.416 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI, MAFUYU]
"Business"!

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.959 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA, HATSUNA] Don't miss it!
