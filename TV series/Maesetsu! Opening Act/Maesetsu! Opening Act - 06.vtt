00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.307 position:50% align:center
The results are in!

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.059 position:50% align:center
You should dial
it down, Manatsu.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.311 position:50% align:center
You have to announce all
results in a loud voice,

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:21.312 position:50% align:center
that's the rule.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:22.939 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure
that isn't a rule.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:27.318 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU laughs]
Kana! Kanae, Kanae, Kanae!

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
What's up with all that energy?

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
The moment that we've been
waiting for is finally here!

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.951 position:50% align:center
Let's go ahead and
check out the results.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.953 position:50% align:center
Okay, here goes!

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
[imitating drum roll]

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.636 position:50% align:center
Then how about you give
me your explanation

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.304 position:50% align:center
about why it's so popular!

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:19.222 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.765 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.560 position:50% align:center
Hey, if you're just gonna change
the subject, let's drop it!

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.563 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] Thanks, you've been
a great audience!

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.441 position:50% align:center
Ah. That felt
pretty solid, right?

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:30.775 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
Mm-hm!

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:34.320 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
Okay.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:35.947 position:50% align:center
Well, I think that
ought to do it.

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:37.574 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's really coming along!

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.159 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
Mm-hm.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:40.326 position:50% align:center
By the way...

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.703 position:50% align:center
I actually have
something in here

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:43.455 position:50% align:center
I've been meaning
to show you, Kana.

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.791 position:50% align:center
Oh? I wonder what
I should do now.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.918 position:50% align:center
Wanna know what it is?
You do, don't you?

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
Well, if you want to know
that badly, I'll tell you!

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:52.839 position:50% align:center
Ta-da!

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:54.924 position:50% align:center
We should enter!

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:59.471 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] What's this? The
"High-School Comedy Contest"?

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.640 position:50% align:center
It's the thing my sister and
Fubuki lost two years in a row.

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:03.767 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
You want to enter something

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.894 position:50% align:center
even they couldn't win?

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:07.062 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Like the name says,

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.105 position:50% align:center
it's only open to
high-school students.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.648 position:50% align:center
Which means if we
want to compete in it,

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.859 position:50% align:center
we'll only have three chances.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
In other words, if we don't
do it now, then when will we?

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.367 position:50% align:center
Uh, maybe now I guess?

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50% align:center
So pushy.

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.870 position:50% align:center
It was your setup, Natsu! Why
didn't you do the punchline?

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:26.122 position:50% align:center
I was just kidding!

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center
So? Should we enter?

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.503 position:50% align:center
Okay. Let's try.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
I think that momentum is the
key to this kind of thing.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.007 position:50% align:center
Sweet!

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.896 position:50% align:center
I beg your pardon, Hatsuna,
but it seems you missed a spot.

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
Will you quit bugging me and do
your own work across the room?

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
You're no fun.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.281 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? Is something
upsetting you, Rin?

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.991 position:50% align:center
Those posters outside.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Oh, you're talking
about the JK Cool ones?

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.539 position:50% align:center
It really is impressive
how popular they are now.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
They were last year's
big winners.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:12.168 position:50% align:center
Hey, if you're gonna talk, at
least keep those hands moving.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.712 position:50% align:center
Tomita said he'd treat us all

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.047 position:50% align:center
to a deluxe eel dinner
if we finished up early!

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
That sounds great!

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.677 position:50% align:center
Hey, I never said that! Hold on!

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
I'm back!

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:23.972 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU, KANAE]
Welcome home!

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50% align:center
Kanae! You came back again
to pay me another visit?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
What a sweetheart!

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.312 position:50% align:center
Come on, Fuyu, quit
it already, will ya?

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
I invited her over for dinner

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
since our rehearsals
ran long today.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.444 position:50% align:center
Rehearsals? Rehearsing what?

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center
Stand-up.

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] What? You were
serious about that?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.948 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
And we've also decided
we're going to compete

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
in the next High-School
Comedy Contest

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
since it's coming up soon.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.456 position:50% align:center
Uh. For real?

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
Yep, it's for real.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.834 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm going to get
dinner ready now,

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:57.088 position:50% align:center
so just hold on for
a little bit, okay?

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
Kana, could you give me a hand?

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure thing.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
What can I do to help?

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
Bring these chopsticks
over to the table.

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
You got it!

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Oh, cups too.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.226 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
I'll have an Okinawan Paradise.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.811 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
One fruit parfait, please.

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
[RIN] An iced cocoa, a cola,
and a Young Lady Set.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] A hot cafÃ© au lait,
if you would, please.

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Manatsu and Kanae are entering

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
the High-School Comedy Contest.

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.241 position:50% align:center
And what are you
bringing that up for?

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
Well, it's just kinda...

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's just kinda what?

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50% align:center
Like, if they're gonna
enter the contest,

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.377 position:50% align:center
then that means
they've gotta be serious.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
Hm, there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.005 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know, but still.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.633 position:50% align:center
I can understand why you'd
have your share of concerns,

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
but we ought to support them.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.389 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Of course, we should.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:49.432 position:50% align:center
Though it does also mean
that our list of rivals

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:51.142 position:50% align:center
has gotten even longer now.

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50% align:center
We've gotta nip them
in the bud. [laughs]

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50% align:center
You know, for some reason, you
sounded like Tomita just now.

00:05:58.108 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
Did I really?

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
So? What'll it be?

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50% align:center
[ERU]
Huh? Um...

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll have
something sweet.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
Some jiggly gelatin?

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:12.163 position:50% align:center
No, that stuff is way
too sweet for me!

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:14.374 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] So, we'll wear our
uniforms in the prelims.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU] Aw, I was hoping
for something flashier.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.753 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
And where should we shoot it?

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:20.714 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Uh. How about the roof?

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:23.633 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] Okay. We should
probably get a tripod.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:26.761 position:50% align:center
That's a good point.
Where can we find one?

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:28.013 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] Dammit.
If I had just played "rock"...

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.392 position:50% align:center
Isn't that JK Cool?

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
Let's go over and say hi!

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
Why would we do that?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.023 position:50% align:center
We're going to be in this year's
High-School Comedy Contest.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.107 position:50% align:center
We should pay our respects

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50% align:center
to last year's winners,
shouldn't we?

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.110 position:50% align:center
Hey, hold on!

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50% align:center
You're just awful at
rock-paper-scissors, Arashi.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.031 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] I'll make sure
I win next time.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.532 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Excuse me!

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI, ERU]
Huh?

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sorry, we're making
you wait, aren't we?

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
Look at that. And all because
you can't make a decision.

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
No, you've got the wrong idea!

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center
[ERU, ARASHI]
Huh?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to talk.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.420 position:50% align:center
I'm Manatsu Kogarashi,
a first-year student.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center
And I'm Kanae Kanari.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
The two of us recently formed
a comedy duo ourselves!

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center
Oh, that was you!

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.927 position:50% align:center
I remember seeing you
both messing around

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:10.055 position:50% align:center
out on the terrace
a few days ago.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
Yeah? So anyway, what did
you two want to talk about?

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
We've watched so many of
your routines and videos.

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50% align:center
We'd love it if we
could talk to you

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.605 position:50% align:center
about comedy at some point!

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
Plus, we've decided to compete

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.567 position:50% align:center
in the next High-School
Comedy Contest.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't happen
to have any tips

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
on how to win first
place, would you?

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
[ERU]
Uh...

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.450 position:50% align:center
I'm only gonna to say this once.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.827 position:50% align:center
There's only one thing we
can tell you about that!

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.954 position:50% align:center
Be sure you have fun
when you're out there!

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.331 position:50% align:center
That makes a lot of sense!

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
Hey, come on, Natsu.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.668 position:50% align:center
Huh? What is it?

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.130 position:50% align:center
It sure would be nice
if you managed to win!

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:46.383 position:50% align:center
See you later!

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.470 position:50% align:center
See you! Thank you for the tip!

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:53.056 position:50% align:center
I actually talked to them!

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.977 position:50% align:center
And I got some advice
on how to win!

00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's do this!

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50% align:center
This is the section where
you'll be coming out

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.236 position:50% align:center
of the spaceship
like all "ka-pow."

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
Ka-pow!

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
Like that?

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
Exactly!

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
All right, here we go.

[KANAE grunts]

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
I'll be illuminating
your hearts today,

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
and doing it with
the bright glare

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:22.502 position:50% align:center
of the midsummer sun.
I'm Manatsu Kogarashi!

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
I'll show you the tundra under
the bright glaring sun,

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:26.506 position:50% align:center
and make all your
dreams come true.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.008 position:50% align:center
Kanae Kanari here!

[BOTH] And together,
we're Tsundora!

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:32.512 position:50% align:center
And that's how
we'll open things!

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
Sounds good!

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:35.265 position:50% align:center
Ka-pow!

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:38.018 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Huh? Wait--what is that?

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:39.894 position:50% align:center
Hey, what was gonna
come after that again?

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:42.772 position:50% align:center
This is where the alien is
supposed to introduce itself.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
Right, that was it!

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:45.775 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's try it
one more time.

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU grunts]

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:52.407 position:50% align:center
Quit changing the
subject! Just forget it.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.660 position:50% align:center

been a great audience!

[BOTH laugh]

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.666 position:50% align:center
That really came
together, right?

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.544 position:50% align:center
For sure! I think it's
absolutely great.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:06.921 position:50% align:center
All right, then tomorrow,
we'll finally shoot it!

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
--[KANAE] I can't wait!
--[MANATSU] Yeah!

[MANATSU]
Ta-da!

00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
How is it?

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
Did you seriously just
buy that for the contest?

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
It's something I'm
doing for good luck.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
And I'll send in our video
while thinking about winning.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second.
If we actually win the contest,

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.850 position:50% align:center
that means we're
gonna be famous!

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:02.852 position:50% align:center
Fans could try to talk
to us on the street!

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
It might be a good idea
to buy some sunglasses!

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
I think you're skipping
a few steps there.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.858 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.277 position:50% align:center

[MANATSU] The moment we've been
waiting for is finally here!

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.374 position:50% align:center
Let's go ahead and
check out the results!

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.376 position:50% align:center

Bam!

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
Hm.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.391 position:50% align:center
Say something!
Did you make it in?

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.810 position:50% align:center
Tell us! This is so exciting!

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Huh?

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.317 position:50% align:center
What the heck?

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
Wait. Did I miss it?

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
Uh, well...

00:10:56.239 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
Manatsu. I think that this
means, you know, well, right?

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Huh? That's really strange.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center
Hey, Natsu.

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:21.681 position:50% align:center
We're not here.

We're not on the list.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center
We didn't make it.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.914 position:50% align:center
All right then.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:49.084 position:50% align:center
Why don't we talk about what
we could've done better?

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:50.669 position:50% align:center
No thanks.

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:51.836 position:50% align:center
I'm going home.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.213 position:50% align:center

Whatcha wanna do for breakfast?

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
Should I cook us
something today?

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.447 position:50% align:center
Wait, if I start cooking now,

00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
you're just gonna
end up being late!

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:23.743 position:50% align:center

You can eat it on the run!

[MANATSU]
I'm going to school.

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
O-Okay.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.375 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:36.881 position:50% align:center
That's the gist. It's been three
days since the results went up

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:40.010 position:50% align:center
and she's still walking
around like a zombie.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center
Poor Manatsu.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.638 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
Not even making it past
the preliminary round

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:48.059 position:50% align:center
must have been a real shock.

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:50.520 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] She was totally
sure they'd get in, too.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:51.563 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should have warned them

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
that making the cut
isn't so easy.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:56.776 position:50% align:center
[RIN] What would be the point?
It was their decision.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Still...

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.404 position:50% align:center
If you want to do
something for them,

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
then maybe you should find
a way to lift their spirits.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
After all, doesn't it
make you feel better

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
just to know that you've
got someone out there

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center
cheering you on?

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
I'm rooting for you
sis, keep it up.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center
It makes me feel better.

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:16.713 position:50% align:center
Good point.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.673 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's what I should do.

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center
Pardon. Coffee?

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.552 position:50% align:center
How are you?

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.804 position:50% align:center
I'm doing just fine!

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:26.181 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mister Manager,
I'd like two Omiya Napolitans

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.310 position:50% align:center
with all the fixings
for takeout!

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.187 position:50% align:center
Got it. Two orders to go.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.440 position:50% align:center
Are you really able to eat two
whole portions all on your own?

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
The takeout's for
Manatsu and Kanae.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
Everyone always feels better
after their stomachs

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.321 position:50% align:center
are full of yummy food!

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.698 position:50% align:center
And chicken bites.
I give on the house.

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:45.700 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot, Carlos!

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
Hey, what do you think?
Should we rehearse today?

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:56.836 position:50% align:center
Not today.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.922 position:50% align:center
How about tomorrow, then?

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:05.637 position:50% align:center
C'mon. What's the matter Natsu?

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry Kana.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.432 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:12.727 position:50% align:center
Hey--Natsu!

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:15.730 position:50% align:center
Natsu.

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Hey! Kanae!

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:26.866 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.746 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
Fuyu?

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Here you go.

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:35.125 position:50% align:center
Huh? This is for me?

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.502 position:50% align:center
That was nice of you.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:41.172 position:50% align:center
Having some yummy food to eat
always cheers me right up.

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:47.012 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Fuyu, it means a lot.

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] We didn't make it into
the High-School Comedy Contest.

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.185 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Yeah.

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] I really did want us
to make it past the prelims.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.940 position:50% align:center
I know how it feels.

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:02.652 position:50% align:center
It was super frustrating when
Fubuki and I got eliminated.

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:04.154 position:50% align:center
If only we had made the cut,

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
we could have gone on
to perform so many more

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.908 position:50% align:center
routines together, me and Natsu.

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:11.619 position:50% align:center
From the way you're talking,
it sounds like you really enjoy

00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
doing stand-up with her.

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center
And that's why this has all
been so hard on you, right?

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.212 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU groans]

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Yeah?

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.813 position:50% align:center
Manatsu!

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:42.942 position:50% align:center
Manatsu-tan Mafuyu-tan
Napolitan!

00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:45.695 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Oh, uh, I was just
thinking that we should

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
have it for dinner,
so I went and picked some up!

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center
No thank you.

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:53.078 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Don't be like that.
You haven't eaten today, right?

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
Come on, you'll feel much after
you get some food in you.

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
All right, let's dig on in!

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:05.256 position:50% align:center
You're always cooking
and taking care

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.341 position:50% align:center
of stuff around the house,

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:07.509 position:50% align:center
so I just thought
that this might be

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:09.678 position:50% align:center
a nice change of pace, you know?

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center
You know,
doing this kind of thing

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.852 position:50% align:center
isn't always just fun and games.

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
I felt pretty down, too,
when we got cut.

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:25.193 position:50% align:center
I did, but I had Fubuki.

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
On days when we're blue,
we're both like,

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.368 position:50% align:center
"This really sucks!"
And when we're happy,

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
we're both going,
"This really rocks!"

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.503 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:46.131 position:50% align:center
That's life, right?
Least we're together.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.508 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't be shy,
go on and eat!

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:54.014 position:50% align:center
By the way...

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:55.306 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.850 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
I think that "Manatsu-tan,

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.894 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu-tan, Napolitan" gag
could've been a little better.

00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
You're bringing that up now?

00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
Excuse me.

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
--[ERU] Huh?
--[ARASHI] Eh?

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.413 position:50% align:center
If I'm bugging you, I'm sorry.

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
Oh! It's you!

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
Can we help you?

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:24.544 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry
about the other day.

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center
Oh, that?

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:29.174 position:50% align:center
Well, I might not have had
the best attitude, either.

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.551 position:50% align:center
Oh no, that isn't
the case at all.

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:36.181 position:50% align:center
We didn't get past the prelims.
That taught us a lot.

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50% align:center
Well, at least there's that.

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.185 position:50% align:center
Where is your partner?

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:43.021 position:50% align:center
Huh? The thing is...

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
Were you practicing
on your own?

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:48.443 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:50.111 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
The truth is,
you still love it, right?

00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.455 position:50% align:center
Well, see ya!

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
Later.

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:12.926 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] I like doing this
together with Natsu.

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
You know how bubble tea
is in right now?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Why do you think it is?

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
Because of Instagram
or something, right?

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
I don't think that by itself can
explain why it's popular.

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.314 position:50% align:center
That's why today,
that mystery will be--

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
You came, Natsu.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:35.740 position:50% align:center
Sorry to call you
here out of the blue.

00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:37.200 position:50% align:center
We've spent so much
time here lately

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.494 position:50% align:center
it felt weird without you.

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I had a
question about this--

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.123 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
What are you apologizing for?

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.627 position:50% align:center
Because I was the one
who dragged you into this.

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
You didn't drag me into it!

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.214 position:50% align:center
I forced you to
partner up with me.

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who
decided to do that!

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.885 position:50% align:center
I never felt like I was
forced into it, not once!

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:57.178 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:57.262 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
If I honestly didn't want
to do it back then,

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
I would have just told you so.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:04.227 position:50% align:center
Coming out here and rehearsing
our comedy routines together

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
turned out to be a whole
lot of fun in the end.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:09.941 position:50% align:center
And I totally fell in love
with what we were doing.

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
Because I was doing it with you.

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:17.615 position:50% align:center
I really don't want things
to end like this for us.

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
All I want is to keep
on doing this with you.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
But if we do,
I might wind up

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center
just causing you
problems again, Kana.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.880 position:50% align:center
And I got all carried away
like some idiot, too.

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
We didn't even make the cut--

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:34.132 position:50% align:center
Natsu!

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:35.133 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
Come on, just say
that you'll keep

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
doing comedy with me. C'mon!

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.515 position:50% align:center
Say that you'll keep on
doing comedy with me!

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
Kana.

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and say that you'll
keep on doing comedy with me!

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
Say that we'll do it together.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
[KANAE cries]

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:03.411 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'll do it.

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.831 position:50% align:center
Natsu.

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:15.048 position:50% align:center
I'll keep performing
with you, Kana.

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:23.431 position:50% align:center
You should have just
said so in the first place.

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
You're such a pushy jerk.

00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] Right back at you.
You're a stubborn one.

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
[KANAE, MANATSU chuckle]

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
Manatsu! I'm home!

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
Hey there, welcome back, sis!

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Uh...

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:42.575 position:50% align:center
Oho!

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Whew! I'm really glad those two

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
were able to work stuff out.

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.583 position:50% align:center
Yes, it sure is a relief.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
The downside of this is
that our list of rivals

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:55.588 position:50% align:center
is getting longer and longer.
Gotta nip that in the bud.

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:57.382 position:50% align:center
You know, you really
do sound like Tomita

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.217 position:50% align:center
when you say things
like that, Rin.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.969 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
That's definitely a bad thing.

00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
Oh? Did I just hear
someone call my name?

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
All right then, I'll show you
how to use rubber bands.

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:09.644 position:50% align:center
And not just two.
This time, we'll use four!

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:11.604 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA] Tomita, would you
put a sock in it already?

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
--[TOMITA] Hey!
--[MAFUYU] Oh, hi, Hatsuna.

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:15.734 position:50% align:center
What made you swing
by here on your day off?

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA]
Uh...

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
I was planning on going to
the Namba Grand Kagetsu

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
to catch a show,
and I even got the tickets.

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:23.116 position:50% align:center
But something
came up last minute.

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.534 position:50% align:center
If you're interested.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:27.495 position:50% align:center
--[FUBUKI] Yes, I can go!
--[MAFUYU] Yeah, I can go!

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:28.872 position:50% align:center
I've never had the opportunity

00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:30.874 position:50% align:center
to go to the Namba
Grand Kagetsu Theater.

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:32.375 position:50% align:center
I've never been there, either.

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:33.460 position:50% align:center
Well, I have gone there before.

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:35.712 position:50% align:center
I saw a show there, too!

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:42.802 position:50% align:center
I see. So Fubuki and Nayuta
have never been there, huh?

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center
That's such a shame.

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:46.890 position:50% align:center
For some reason, I'm feeling
left out right now.

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:49.142 position:50% align:center
So, I guess that means all
four of you are going?

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:51.019 position:50% align:center
We sure are! It's a road trip!

00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:52.145 position:50% align:center
--[FUBUKI] Yeah!
--[NAYUTA] Let's go!

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center
You said it!

00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:54.898 position:50% align:center
Just so you know,
I have two tickets,

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:57.650 position:50% align:center
so you're on the hook for the
other two plus transportation.

00:21:57.734 --> 00:21:59.444 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
What?!

00:23:36.124 --> 00:23:38.293 position:50% align:center
[ERU]
It's so hot.

00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:40.337 position:50% align:center
We're just getting
started doing our three

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.672 position:50% align:center
alternating rounds of
saunas and cold baths.

00:23:42.756 --> 00:23:44.674 position:50% align:center
Your sauna-nut side's showing.

00:23:44.758 --> 00:23:46.926 position:50% align:center
No, when you need to unwind
this is the only way!

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.261 position:50% align:center
If you say so.

00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:49.679 position:50% align:center
We should probably
talk about how

00:23:49.763 --> 00:23:52.265 position:50% align:center
our next performance
is gonna be at the NGK.

00:23:52.349 --> 00:23:54.642 position:50% align:center
The Namba Grand Kagetsu
Theater, huh?

00:23:54.726 --> 00:23:56.186 position:50% align:center
I'm really stoked for it!

00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:57.520 position:50% align:center
If that's how you feel,

00:23:57.604 --> 00:23:59.564 position:50% align:center
then let's get out of here
and work on material.

00:23:59.647 --> 00:24:01.941 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go for some
fruit-flavored milk right now!

00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:03.234 position:50% align:center
Why don't you hold on there--

00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:05.070 position:50% align:center
we can work on our
material right here.

00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:07.864 position:50% align:center
We haven't even finished
our first round yet.

00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:10.033 position:50% align:center
[ERU grunts]

00:24:10.116 --> 00:24:12.410 position:50% align:center
[ERU]
No way!

00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:17.290 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
What's next on Maesetsu?

00:24:17.374 --> 00:24:18.166 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
"Osaka"!

00:24:18.249 --> 00:24:19.876 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Don't miss it!
