00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:16.516 position:50% align:center
[RIN] You're going to be in the
New Comedy Kings contest?

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:17.767 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
Yeah!

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Hang on. This sounds
awfully familiar.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.065 position:50% align:center
Mm. Because he was saying
the exact same thing last year.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.234 position:50% align:center
Oh, I've been meaning to
ask you how many years

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.028 position:50% align:center
have you been a team, anyway?

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
Hmph. Two years.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
That's it?

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.034 position:50% align:center
So, you and Hatsuna have
been an established duo

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:36.661 position:50% align:center
for two years, yet you're
still considered newcomers

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:37.746 position:50% align:center
in our world?

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.956 position:50% align:center
That's not it.
We've become newcomers

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.958 position:50% align:center
at long last now
that we're signed.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.251 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA]
Exactly.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.587 position:50% align:center
On top of that, we're only
provisionally signed

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.839 position:50% align:center
with Yoshimoto Kogyo.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:48.965 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.300 position:50% align:center
So, in other words...

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.843 position:50% align:center
The two of us are...

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:55.221 position:50% align:center
Right. Compared to us, you're
not even considered human!

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.599 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
What?

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.193 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Really? Did you
say Tomita and Hatsuna?

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.696 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They said they're
doing it again this year.

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.781 position:50% align:center
"I'm gonna move into
my own studio apartment

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.324 position:50% align:center
with this year's prize money!"

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.577 position:50% align:center
That's how excited he was.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.412 position:50% align:center
This is all sounding
like déjà vu.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.663 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Well yeah.

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:46.207 position:50% align:center
He was saying the same
thing last year, too.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.625 position:50% align:center
Take a look.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.964 position:50% align:center
To be eligible, it says
you have to be pros

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.759 position:50% align:center
who've been a team
for less than 15 years

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.720 position:50% align:center
or amateurs not currently
affiliated with an agency.

00:02:58.803 --> 00:02:59.971 position:50% align:center
Hope it's their year.

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:02.140 position:50% align:center
It'd be nice if they got
past the first round.

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:03.641 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU, FUBUKI]
Mm-hm!

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.393 position:50% align:center
--[RIN] I'm betting.
--[MAFUYU, FUBUKI] Huh?

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:07.771 position:50% align:center
Why do you look so serious, Rin?

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
They'll probably be
competing in it, too.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.066 position:50% align:center
Who are you talking about?

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.610 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Them! The two girls
from the culture festival!

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.654 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU, FUBUKI]
JK Cool!

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center
Man, if they're gonna enter,

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
they'll definitely climb up
the ranks, and fast!

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:23.745 position:50% align:center
I know it's not saying much,
but I don't wanna lose to them!

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:24.788 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Uh.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.873 position:50% align:center
All right then!
We're entering, too!

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:29.668 position:50% align:center
Here we go again.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.587 position:50% align:center
You're always so quick
to overreact to everything.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
It's exactly like Tomita said!

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
Uh, which part...?

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
[RIN] If you're a comedian,
and you aren't with an agency,

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
forget being a rookie, you're
not even a human being! That.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.644 position:50% align:center
Oh, right! He did
say that. [laughs]

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:50.939 position:50% align:center
Fine then! Time for us
to become human beings!

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
M-Mafuyu, Rin, why don't
you just slow down a second.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
Yeah, settle down!

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
that we should be

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
going around entering
each and every contest?

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
There's only one event really
worth competing in anyway.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
And that would be
the Olympics, naturally.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:05.578 position:50% align:center
To be honest with you,

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
I just don't think we're
good enough yet.

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
If we do enter, we won't
make it past the first round.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center
Which would make us failures,
like Tomita and Hatsuna!

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
Nayuta. Those were some
surprisingly harsh words.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA laughs]

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
I guess that might be true.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
We should probably rack up
some more experience.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
I think you're right.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50% align:center
Okay. Then let's put on a show!

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center
There's still time before
the entry deadline.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
Put on a show?

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:35.525 position:50% align:center
Mm-hm. Yeah, that isn't
a bad idea at all.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! Where do you
think we should have it?

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
That's a good question.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.739 position:50% align:center
If we rent out a big venue,

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.783 position:50% align:center
I'm not certain we'll be able
to completely fill the seats.

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:45.660 position:50% align:center
And I imagine it'd be pricey.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.663 position:50% align:center
That's true, so why don't
we look for a smaller club.

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
A smaller club.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
[BARON'S OWNER] You could
hold it here if you'd like.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.086 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Are you serious?

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
[BARON'S OWNER]
We're renovating the area

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.089 position:50% align:center
by the register right now.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Oh, you mean
where the booths were?

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
[BARON'S OWNER] I'm sure we
could build a stage there.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
This place really does have
anything you could ever want!

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Okay, onto the next item.

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
Does anyone want comedy?

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:42.884 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Me!

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.220 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Anybody else?

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:48.098 position:50% align:center
So that's two votes
for comedy, then.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.683 position:50% align:center
Two votes?

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.273 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A] So, it looks like
singing will be on the program!

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
I apologize if this is abrupt.
But Araya, do you like comedy?

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.994 position:50% align:center
Uh. Why do you ask?

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean you do, don't you?

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.499 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:18.753 position:50% align:center
Are you asking because you
like it, too? Uh, Asogi?

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:23.633 position:50% align:center
That's right. Honestly,
I have a great love for comedy.

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
That's it! End of story!
Man, I'm totally done with you!

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.144 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Thank you very much!

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA laughs]

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
It took everything in
my power not to laugh!

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
Well, making you laugh
isn't the goal here.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.779 position:50% align:center
I can't help it, your
material's so funny!

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
And these bowties
are hilarious, too!

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.284 position:50% align:center
We look like comedians, right?

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.578 position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:53.204 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Hey, did you see
yesterday's episode

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
of "Best of Comedy"?

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:56.041 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
I did. I did!

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center
"Super Straight 'n'
Mighty Fastball"

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
were the funniest
ones, weren't they?

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50% align:center
Definitely! They had that
high-speed back-and-forth!

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.966 position:50% align:center
Sure did! I think
that kind of comic style

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.801 position:50% align:center
is the goal that we're
trying to reach.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:09.304 position:50% align:center
The kind where the comedy's
all in the banter.

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.473 position:50% align:center
I think you're right.
You have a wonderful tempo

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50% align:center
with your straight-man
lines, too.

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:16.144 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't you think it's about
time we came up with a name?

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
Oh, of course! That's something
we still haven't done.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:22.609 position:50% align:center
I was thinking...
Maybe something like this?

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
R... Totsu?

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:29.407 position:50% align:center
No, it's RDeco!

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Oh.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.786 position:50% align:center
Heh. It's fitting.

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center
'Cuz "deko" means "forehead"?

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.289 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA laughs]
Well, it does!

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.249 position:50% align:center
Hmm? Hold on.

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:41.920 position:50% align:center
What exactly is the R
supposed to stand for?

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.092 position:50% align:center
[RIN chuckles]

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.721 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
I've gotta get serious here.

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Finished!

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
Like it?

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.482 position:50% align:center
Whoa! This looks amazing, Rin!

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:05.026 position:50% align:center
I have to agree,
this is a fantastic poster!

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.736 position:50% align:center
That's our Rin for you!

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.238 position:50% align:center
Now all we have to
do is print out

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.864 position:50% align:center
some copies and paper the town.

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Mm-hm, mm-hm!

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50% align:center
Mister Manager!
Roughly how many people

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
would you say you
can fit in here?

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.915 position:50% align:center
If we really packed them in,
I'd estimate just under 40.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
I see...

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:23.753 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Oh, one Young Lady Set
and an iced cocoa.

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
The capacity is gonna
be about 40...

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
That means we would
each need to get

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:29.884 position:50% align:center
ten people to come see the show.

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:33.263 position:50% align:center
Hm. I think this could work out.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.639 position:50% align:center
I think it will.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
We've gotta shoot
for a full house.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Mm-hm.

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
Cool so let's talk
about the show.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
How about we do our own bits

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
and then some Q-and-A
improv afterwards?

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.149 position:50% align:center
Oh! That sounds great!

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:46.735 position:50% align:center
I think the entire thing
should last about an hour.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:48.528 position:50% align:center
That's a good length for a show.

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.864 position:50% align:center
And I figured we could
charge 1,500 yen

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
for advance tickets and
2,000 yen at the door,

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.826 position:50% align:center
with one drink included.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:58.038 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Hmm... 1,500 yen
should be all right.

00:08:58.121 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec!

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
If a drink costs 700,
that's 800 for us.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.710 position:50% align:center
And there are two teams.

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
That means we're basically
charging 400 yen per duo.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.423 position:50% align:center
Isn't that a little low?

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
No, it's not.

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
It's fair.

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
But we're selling ourselves
way short if we charge that.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:13.928 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
It's the perfect price!

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
Mm? Come on.

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:18.433 position:50% align:center
What do I look like to you,
some kind of easy cheap girl?

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50% align:center
That isn't what
we were implying.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.436 position:50% align:center
Not in the least.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.396 position:50% align:center
It'll be fine.
It's a fair price.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make
me feel better.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's time to head
to work, Mafuyu.

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:30.528 position:50% align:center
Already?

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
Sorry, girls. We'll pick
this back up tomorrow.

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Oh, right.

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.452 position:50% align:center
Since you'll be at work,
invite Tomita and Hatsuna.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
--[MAFUYU] You got it!
--[FUBUKI] Of course.

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
Hope the night shift
isn't too crazy!

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA sighs]

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
May I ask something?
Were you serious?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.929 position:50% align:center
Um, about what?
About the comedy show?

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.305 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Mm-mm.

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
I'm referring to all
that talk of being in

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.059 position:50% align:center
the New Comedy Kings contest.

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
Oh, I got you now.

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm dead serious.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
Of course. I thought so.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:11.820 position:50% align:center
Are you saying you don't
want to participate?

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:15.657 position:50% align:center
It reminds me of back then.
Do you Remember?

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
NSC? Yoshimoto's comedy school?

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I hear that lots of
high schoolers go there.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center
I figured I'd take a year to
really focus on studying comedy.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA gasping]

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.630 position:50% align:center
So, Nayuta.

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:32.590 position:50% align:center
I've thought about it and
you should come with me.

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:34.926 position:50% align:center
Uh! Actually, I...

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:40.849 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I don't know if
my commitment to comedy is...

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
How should I put this? I haven't
fully thought about it.

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:48.565 position:50% align:center
Gotcha.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
That's fine with me.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.610 position:50% align:center
Oh, Rin I-- It's just that...

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center
I was set on going,
even if I went alone.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:57.282 position:50% align:center
Ever since middle school.

00:10:57.365 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
And even more so
since we formed RDeco.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:05.248 position:50% align:center
After all, I've always been
serious about doing comedy.

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
The truth of the matter is,
at that point and time,

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
I hadn't made up my mind yet

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:18.136 position:50% align:center
about whether I should
seriously pursue comedy.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.388 position:50% align:center
That's why I wasn't clear.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
And in the end, you wound up
going to NSC on your own

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
and RDeco disbanded for a while.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:32.525 position:50% align:center
A whole year was wasted because
I was procrastinating.

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
You know, Nayuta.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Hmm?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center
It was a whole year
but even though RDeco

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:39.616 position:50% align:center
was broken up for a while,

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
that time certainly
wasn't wasted.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:45.330 position:50% align:center
For one thing I learned
a lot at NSC,

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center
but there was something else
more important than that.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Huh?

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.502 position:50% align:center
It was a wake-up call.

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:52.712 position:50% align:center
It helped me figure out
there's only one partner

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:54.089 position:50% align:center
for me, that's you.

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That was such a nice
thing for you to say!

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.386 position:50% align:center
I'm so touched! I love you!

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
Stop! It's embarrassing!

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.811 position:50% align:center
But this time, I can give
the same answer as you.

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
Because I'm serious.

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
Just like you, I'm serious
about my comedy.

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.194 position:50% align:center
I'm going to send in our entry.

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA] So? How are things
with the ticket sales?

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
It's going little by little.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm happy to buy
whatever you can't sell.

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
If you're okay with doing that,

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
why don't you just buy a
bunch of them right now.

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
Hold your horses.

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
Kogarashi and Kitakaze
already invited us.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.761 position:50% align:center
It's just that we were
hoping to sell ten tickets each.

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:43.096 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA]
T-Ten?

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
That's terrible!

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:45.807 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
Hatsuna, you can't measure
this by your own yardstick.

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
This one here can't sell
tickets to her friends

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
since they don't exist.

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
It's not like I can help that.
You know me.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.485 position:50% align:center
I'm a performer
who values privacy.

00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
You say that like its cool.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
This is why you end up
having to sell tickets

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
right before every show.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
On the street, all, "Please,
sir? Buy one?

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.495 position:50% align:center
Won't you help me out?"

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
What am I the Little Match Girl?

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
And that was unoriginal.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.959 position:50% align:center
[BOTH sigh]

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
Earth to Araya!

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:26.491 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hm?

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:28.201 position:50% align:center
You should save the
airhead act for the crowd.

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:29.786 position:50% align:center
It's not like posters can laugh.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.371 position:50% align:center
[RIN grumbles]

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA] D-Don't look at me like
that. You'll freeze me solid.

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDEES chattering]

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
This place looks amazing...

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.302 position:50% align:center
--Yeah.
--...right?

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU] They have a real
stage and everything!

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.850 position:50% align:center
This café turned into a
comedy club in no time.

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
I can't believe how
authentic it is.

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:56.980 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA]
The crowd's coming in.

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:58.606 position:50% align:center
Did you notice anything?

00:14:58.690 --> 00:14:59.983 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.735 position:50% align:center
I'm talking about how they're
selling merchandise

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center
over by the entrance!

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.529 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA] Seems like
something Araya would do,

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
she's a shrewd one all right.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center
Looks like we could learn
a thing or two from her.

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:13.121 position:50% align:center
Do you really think anyone would
buy pins with my face on them?

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:15.373 position:50% align:center
You could use one of your
rubber-band impressions.

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
We can't. We'd-- We'd
never get the rights to do it.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:21.755 position:50% align:center
Here we go!

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
Ladies and gents, RDeco
and Tokonatsu are proud

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.760 position:50% align:center
to welcome you to
our comedy show today.

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.136 position:50% align:center
Thank you for coming.

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
Now without further ado,
let's begin.

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:33.600 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDEES clap]

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.187 position:50% align:center
Hi, Mafuyu Kogarashi
here, and...

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center
...Fubuki Kitakaze!

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
And together...

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
...the two of us are...

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
...Tokonatsu!

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.527 position:50% align:center
Meaning "endless summer,"
which is odd

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
since our names mean
"winter" and "blizzard."

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
Some say we shouldn't
be called Tokonatsu,

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.867 position:50% align:center
and that "up north" is
way more on theme for us.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
But if we're talking
cold weather then...

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.746 position:50% align:center
...you think of snow on
the roads and black ice.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.164 position:50% align:center
One wrong step and whoops!

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:58.416 position:50% align:center
Whoops! You suddenly fall flat,
and that really hurts!

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
And neither of us want that to
happen, so its "Tokonatsu."

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:04.130 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
It's great to be here!

00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:05.590 position:50% align:center
I've been meaning to
tell you something.

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Hm? Go ahead.

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:08.843 position:50% align:center
A few days ago I was at this
all-you-can-eat sweets buffet,

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:10.095 position:50% align:center
you know the kind.

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.638 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah, girls like
us love those places.

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:12.889 position:50% align:center
A thousand yen.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:13.807 position:50% align:center
Before tax.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.683 position:50% align:center
So precise.

00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:16.309 position:50% align:center
Now here's the important part.

I regret complimenting you now.

ripped your show apart

[NAYUTA]
It did!

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
Though it's also true that we
had a receptive audience.

Their laughter made it
easier to keep going.

It isn't like we're

[NAYUTA]
Mm-hm.

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:54.272 position:50% align:center
We've gotta do more and more
to get our names out there!

00:21:54.356 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
And getting ourselves
more and more experience

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.318 position:50% align:center
for the New Comedy
Kings contest!

[BARON'S OWNER] On the house
for a job well done.

00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:03.281 position:50% align:center
This is so nice of you,
thank you!

00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:05.408 position:50% align:center
And no taking any
photos for you Rin!

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:07.160 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Yeah, what she said.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:08.912 position:50% align:center
Okay, okay.

[RIN chuckles]

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.624 position:50% align:center
--[MAFUYU] Hey, no photos!
--[FUBUKI] No photos!

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.678 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] Hmm...
That finger-gun bit needs work.

00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:51.348 position:50% align:center
I really should give
it more thought.

00:23:51.431 --> 00:23:53.475 position:50% align:center
"Or rather a real
gun, apparently!"

00:23:53.558 --> 00:23:55.727 position:50% align:center
That doesn't seem
to flow all that well.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.730 position:50% align:center
"Ta-da! You produced
a real gun!"

00:23:58.813 --> 00:24:00.607 position:50% align:center
I don't know if
that's quite right.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:04.361 position:50% align:center
I could try a serious approach.
"It's a real gun!"

00:24:04.444 --> 00:24:08.239 position:50% align:center
But if I do, I'm not sure
Rin can play off that.

00:24:08.323 --> 00:24:10.200 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA exhales]

00:24:10.283 --> 00:24:13.161 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA blowing bubbles,
coughing]

[RIN, NAYUTA]
What's next on Maesetsu?

00:24:17.582 --> 00:24:18.500 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU, FUBUKI]
"Goals"!

[TOMITA, HATSUNA]
Don't miss it!
