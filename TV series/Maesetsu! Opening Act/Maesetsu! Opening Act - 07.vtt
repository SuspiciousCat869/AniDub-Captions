WEBVTT

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.417
[phone ringing]

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:21.917
[MAFUYU] Osaka!
It's been such a long time!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.792
Growing up, I never had
the chance to go to

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:26.417
the Namba Grand Kagetsu
before, much less Osaka!

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.041
And we owe this entire thing
to Hatsuna and Tomita.

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:31.375
We do still have to pay
for two additional tickets

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:34.333
as well as transportation
for all four of us though.

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:37.333
Then we owe them for
a fraction of this.

00:00:37.417 --> 00:00:40.083
[laughs] You've got that right!

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.583
If you get a bento at the
station, it's gotta be shumai!

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:44.417
Yeah, but you're the
only one who has one.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.333
I had to buy a regular
makunouchi combo,

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:48.041
since they sold out
of shumai ones.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:49.333
[OGAWA]
That's not my problem.

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:50.625
What's with the attitude?

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:52.709
You could've put that
a different way.

00:00:52.792 --> 00:00:54.792
Oh, excuse me, miss!
Could I get a beer, please?

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:55.792
[MATSUURA]
Want one?

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:57.125
[OGAWA]
Ice cream for me, please.

00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:59.458
[MATSUURA] Ice cream?
But the stuff they sell...

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:00.709
Those two ladies.

00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:04.000
Somehow, they seem
rather questionable.

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:39.625
[RIN]
Now then...

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.959
To get to the Namba
Grand Kagetsu...

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:46.291
I guess we'll be leaving
the directions to you, Rin.

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:53.875
It looks like they
don't have turtles here.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.959
[MAFUYU]
Nayuta, let's go!

00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:57.333
Is it this way?

00:02:57.417 --> 00:02:58.625
Huh?

00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:03.542
This coffee shop seems to
have a nice atmosphere!

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:05.583
[MAFUYU]
Fubuki, let's go!

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:07.583
I think it's probably this way.

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:08.875
[MAFUYU]
Huh?

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:14.208
Or I guess there's a
chance that it's this way.

00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:15.583
[gasps]

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:17.375
[RIN]
One, please!

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:22.166
Delish!

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.166
Could I get a bite of that,
Rin? Just a little one?

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:29.750
We're in Sennichimae! All right!

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.750
We got a little lost on the way,
but somehow, we made it here.

00:03:32.834 --> 00:03:36.375
Let us go forth! The comedy
holy land is calling us!

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:37.542
Huh?

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:40.000
All this walking
has me a bit worn out.

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:42.792
Then why don't we go drop off
our luggage at the hotel first?

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:44.166
Good idea.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.458
All right, I wonder where
our hotel could be.

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:53.166
Somehow, I don't think
this looks right.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.542
No, it doesn't.

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:56.041
This is really weird.

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:58.166
Are you certain you
can handle this, Rin?

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.583
What do you think these
titan-y things are?

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:03.333
It looks like they're a
monument or something.

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:06.709
I'll drive them all out!

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:08.625
Every last one of them?

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:13.834
[MANATSU, KANAE]
Hi there!

00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:15.458
Illuminating your
hearts with the glare

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:19.709
of the midsummer sun,
it's Manatsu Kogarashi!

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.375
I'll show you the tundra
under the bright

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:23.750
glaring sun and make all
your dreams come true.

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:25.083
Kanae Kanari here!

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:27.208
[BOTH]
And together we're Tsundora!

00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:28.500
Well, then let me
cut to the chase.

00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:29.542
Sure.

00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:30.542
This kind of elevator
is the pits!

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:32.333
What? Q-and-A improv?

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:33.917
Be careful of
the flooding doors.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.208
Sounds like you'd get all wet.

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:37.083
You misspoke there!
You should've said,

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.667
"Be careful of the
shutting doors."

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.542
Though, if water really
did just keep on gushing

00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:42.750
into an elevator, that
would be pretty scary.

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:46.125
It would be like the elevator of
terror inside a haunted house!

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:47.625
That didn't sound too bad!

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:49.709
But since the name of
your duo is Tsundora,

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:50.917
wouldn't it be a good idea

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.875
to have some routines
that play off that?

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:53.875
Off Tsundora?

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:55.125
Routines?

00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:56.500
Well, I only thought of the name

00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:58.000
because my sister's
duo name means

00:04:58.083 --> 00:04:59.542
"endless summer," so "tundra"

00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:01.333
kind of felt like it was
the opposite of that.

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:02.417
What?

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.792
[HARUNA, SHIHO]
Ohh... Oh, that's why.

00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:11.375
We made it to the hotel!

00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:13.375
Yeah, one way or the other.

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:15.625
I'm so glad we finally
managed to get here.

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:17.291
[FUBUKI exhales]

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.875
[RIN, MAFUYU]
Huh?

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:22.750
I hope it defecates
right from the source!

00:05:22.834 --> 00:05:24.250
I think you mean emanates.

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.792
Don't be greedy. We're lucky
just to have a hot spring.

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:29.250
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:32.500
[CLERK] We'll hold onto
your luggage, then.

00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:35.166
I'll see you all later

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.542
Okay, ready to go?

00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:37.542
[FUBUKI]
Yeah.

00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:40.375
To the Namba Grand
Kagetsu we go!

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:46.250
[ALL gasping]

00:06:02.542 --> 00:06:04.041
[FUBUKI]
This is ridiculous!

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:06.333
I could never finish
all of this on my own!

00:06:06.417 --> 00:06:08.333
It's a feast of food
made of flour!

00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:10.166
I think you might be able
to eat one of those, Rin.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.667
There's no way. Stuff made
out of flour really expands

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.625
in your stomach, you know.

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:18.417
Goodness, this is questionable!

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.125
Hey! Quit playing around
with that, Nayuta!

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:21.500
It's embarrassing!

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:25.083
[laughs] I think that this is
probably an izakaya.

00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:27.875
It looks like it's
only open at night.

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:35.375
[MAFUYU]
What did my 500 yen get me?

00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:36.583
Hm...

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:37.458
Looky here!

00:06:37.542 --> 00:06:39.542
[RIN]
Cut that out!

00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:41.458
[MAFUYU]
Eh?

00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:43.083
Okay.

00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:45.583
So, what do I do with this now?

00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:51.834
This moment we've been
waiting for is here!

00:06:51.917 --> 00:06:53.208
Let us go forth!

00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:55.375
The comedy holy land is
calling us all to its gates!

00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:56.834
We've gotta buy
another two tickets

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:58.250
before we can go in there.

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:00.083
First things first.

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:05.625
I was able to get the
seats next to the other two.

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:06.709
That was lucky!

00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:07.959
All right then,

00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:09.625
where do you think the
entrance to the hall is?

00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:11.750
Looks like it's on
the second floor.

00:07:11.834 --> 00:07:14.709
The Namba Grand Kagetsu Theater
sure has spruced things up!

00:07:14.792 --> 00:07:16.250
[MAFUYU]
They must've renovated.

00:07:16.333 --> 00:07:18.875
The first act is supposed to
go on at six o'clock tonight.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:20.458
We still have quite
a bit of time before

00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:22.875
the start of the show.
What should we do?

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:25.500
Nobody can fight a war
on an empty stomach.

00:07:25.583 --> 00:07:27.125
We should fuel up
before anything else!

00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:29.417
Yeah, let's all go grab
something to eat!

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.875
I've gotten pretty hungry!

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:34.542
[RIN] The first stop is here,
Takoyaki Wanaka!

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:36.125
Since we finally
made it to Osaka,

00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:37.875
we've gotta start with takoyaki!

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.041
I'll get the sampler!
How 'bout you?

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:41.417
I think I'll have the same.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.792
Then I will, too.

00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:44.667
And you're gonna get
the 12 piece, right, Rin?

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.625
Huh? Well, I guess so. Yeah.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.083
I'm really starving!

00:07:53.166 --> 00:07:55.542
If we're talking about takoyaki,
it's gotta be Wanaka!

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:56.583
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:07:56.667 --> 00:07:58.250
Oh, excuse me, could
I get a beer?

00:07:58.333 --> 00:07:59.250
[SERVER A]
Sure.

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:00.834
[OGAWA]
Ice cream for me, please.

00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:03.542
[MATSUURA] Ice cream? They won't
have that at a takoyaki place.

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:04.834
[OGAWA]
Really?

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:08.041
Those two there. They were
on the train, right?

00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:12.333
[MAFUYU]
What's this place?

00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:14.000
[RIN] The go-to spot for
Yoshimoto performers

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:15.542
and employees!

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:19.750
I have to tell you that takoyaki
really whetted my appetite.

00:08:19.834 --> 00:08:20.625
Huh?

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:21.959
This whets your appetite, right?

00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:23.625
If we're talking about
Western-style food,

00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:24.709
it's gotta be Katrine!

00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:26.375
Oh, excuse me,
could I get a beer?

00:08:26.458 --> 00:08:27.500
--[SERVER A] Sure thing!
--[MATSUURA] Want one?

00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:29.000
[OGAWA]
Ice cream for me, please.

00:08:29.083 --> 00:08:31.458
[MATSUURA] Not again with
the ordering ice cream thing!

00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:34.166
Those ladies are
definitely questionable.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.917
[MATSUURA]
Honestly...

00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:40.834
[MAFUYU] We did come all
the way here to Namba.

00:08:40.917 --> 00:08:41.834
You said it!

00:08:41.917 --> 00:08:43.333
We did indeed!

00:08:43.417 --> 00:08:45.917
It's a little bit
embarrassing, but sure.

00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:51.875
[MAFUYU] We did come all
the way here to Dotombori.

00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:52.709
[RIN]
You said it!

00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:53.750
[NAYUTA]
We did indeed!

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:57.250
Sure, I think that's
a great idea!

00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:59.000
That breeze feels wonderful.

00:08:59.083 --> 00:09:01.500
I expected there to be more
people walking around here.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:04.333
It looks like the whole
area got a makeover.

00:09:05.959 --> 00:09:08.375
[MAFUYU]
Wow! Look, it's a tour boat!

00:09:08.458 --> 00:09:12.000
Yeah, that's one from
the Tombori River Cruise.

00:09:12.083 --> 00:09:14.000
Hey!

00:09:18.208 --> 00:09:19.709
[grunts]

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:21.625
Those people totally ignored us.

00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:23.750
They didn't seem very
keen on joining in.

00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:26.083
I've got a question, do
people usually wave back

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:27.500
at you when they're
riding on boats?

00:09:27.583 --> 00:09:28.875
--Yeah, they do.
--Totally.

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:29.875
Of course, they wave.

00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:31.709
What?

00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:36.041
This might be a good
time for a break.

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:36.917
Sure, why not?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.041
That sounds great!

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:41.291
All right, a break it is!

00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:42.166
[MAFUYU, NAYUTA sigh]

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.291
We really walked around a lot.

00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:46.166
Hey, Fubuki do you mind?

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.000
No, of course not.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.917
I didn't think you were
going to drink that much!

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.166
Here, Mafuyu.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.041
Would you like a little
bit of my mango juice?

00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:59.417
Thank you very much!

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.750
Take it easy.

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:04.083
If you get a stomachache,
don't come crying to me.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.417
Do you wanna go ride that?

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.000
Whoa.

00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:22.250
What a view.

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:23.458
It's stunning.

00:10:23.542 --> 00:10:26.375
You can see all of
Osaka from up here.

00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:28.959
We're goin' to make
the city of Osaka ours!

00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:32.208
Uh-huh! Our comedy's definitely
gonna take the world by storm!

00:10:32.291 --> 00:10:33.458
I can't wait!

00:10:33.542 --> 00:10:35.625
It's time to shine!

00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:39.792
It's time to shine! Yeah!

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.208
[GROUP laughing]

00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:50.208
[MAN A]
The 6 PM show is about to begin!

00:10:50.291 --> 00:10:52.959
Come on in and check it out!

00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:56.458
[MAFUYU] Whoa! Lifesize cutouts
of all of the greats!

00:10:56.542 --> 00:10:59.125
They're just enlarged photos,
but they've got a lot of punch!

00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:00.500
Look at those eyes!

00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:01.875
Well, since we're here...

00:11:01.959 --> 00:11:04.500
Rin, Mafuyu, go ahead
and get into place.

00:11:04.583 --> 00:11:06.500
I'm happy to take
a picture of you two.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.000
Yeah! We've gotta do it!

00:11:08.083 --> 00:11:09.250
You said it.

00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:12.125
Ready? Say "cheese"!

00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:21.875
[ERU, ARASHI]
Good morning, Ms. Matsuura!

00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:25.375
Why, if it isn't Arashi
and Eru! Long time no see!

00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:26.959
It really has been a while.

00:11:27.041 --> 00:11:28.750
[ERU] Thanks in advanced
for all your help today.

00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:31.542
You know, I hear that you two
have been pretty busy lately!

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:32.375
I wouldn't say that.

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:33.458
Except totally!

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:35.250
Hey, c'mon!

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:38.250
Well, today's another all-day
affair in front of a huge crowd.

00:11:38.333 --> 00:11:40.208
[BOTH] Right. We'll be
watching closely and learning

00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:41.291
all that we can.

00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:44.041
Ha. You can follow me, ladies.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:52.291
[GROUP gasping]

00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:54.166
So, this is the
comedy holy land,

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.542
the stage at the
Namba Grand Kagetsu.

00:11:57.625 --> 00:12:00.792
It feels like the audience's
seats are about to fall over.

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:02.500
It's because there
isn't much distance

00:12:02.583 --> 00:12:04.166
between them and the stage.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.166
And there's just one condenser
mic for all of this space.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.041
It's incredible.
Everyone's packed in.

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:12.709
And the theater's
filled with excitement.

00:12:12.792 --> 00:12:14.500
[RIN] Do they really perform
new comedy shows

00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:16.458
on this stage every
day using just these

00:12:16.542 --> 00:12:18.417
two speakers and five boom mics?

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.875
That's all they use?
No clip-on mics?

00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:22.458
That's really impressive.

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:26.083
It looks like our seats are in
that section over there, Rin.

00:12:27.542 --> 00:12:30.458
Wow. We're so close
to the stage!

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:32.208
We'll be able to see
the comedians' faces

00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:33.792
really well from these seats!

00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:37.083
The Namba Grand Kagetsu Theater
really is a shrine to comedy.

00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:39.166
All comedians want
to be on this stage.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.834
[gasps] It's starting!

00:12:41.917 --> 00:12:45.041
[NAYUTA] Oh! It's those two.
They're the questionable pair

00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:46.667
we saw on the train
and also in those

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.709
different restaurants
across Osaka!

00:12:48.792 --> 00:12:49.583
Yeah.

00:12:49.667 --> 00:12:50.959
Hi there!

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:53.375
We're Spike, and it's great
to be here with you all!

00:12:53.458 --> 00:12:55.041
I know that this is kind
of out of nowhere,

00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:57.333
but I've been really into
foreign romantic comedies

00:12:57.417 --> 00:12:59.250
lately, 'specially
the ones in schools.

00:12:59.333 --> 00:13:00.750
Whenever I watch them,

00:13:00.834 --> 00:13:03.083
I always wish that I could be
the female love interest!

00:13:03.166 --> 00:13:05.000
[OGAWA] Well, I'll let you
be one tonight.

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:06.750
--Oh, hi there!
--Hi!

00:13:06.834 --> 00:13:08.041
Whoa, look at that, Betty!

00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:09.750
There's a clam sitting
on top of your head!

00:13:09.834 --> 00:13:13.375
Whoa! Really? Was that
there the whole time?

00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:14.583
Am I clam chowder?

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:15.458
What was that?

00:13:15.542 --> 00:13:16.875
I was just talking to myself.

00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:18.458
Well, why don't you
have a seat here.

00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:19.625
[fart sound]

00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:21.041
Now who could've put
this whoopie cushion

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:22.625
down on Betty's chair?

00:13:22.709 --> 00:13:24.458
I swear. It must've been a boy.

00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:26.417
This has been going on
for half a year, too.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.959
They've been doing it that long?

00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:29.250
Pshew!

00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:30.834
--Kersplash!
--What the--?

00:13:30.917 --> 00:13:33.959
Uh, could you not splash
that clam chowder around?

00:13:34.041 --> 00:13:36.667
Hey. Are you bullying me?

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.500
And what's up with
all the clam chowder?

00:13:38.583 --> 00:13:39.750
This stuff is burning me!

00:13:39.834 --> 00:13:42.792
[ALL laughing]

00:13:42.875 --> 00:13:44.625
[OGAWA]
Who shot Betty with that pistol?

00:13:44.709 --> 00:13:45.667
[MATSUURA]
So, I'm dead now?

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.792
[OGAWA]
Could you guys cut that out?

00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:48.041
[MATSUURA] That's enough!

00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:50.959
[BOTH] Thank you,
you've been a great crowd!

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:54.917
I didn't have the slightest idea
that those two were comedians!

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
It's no wonder!

00:13:56.083 --> 00:13:57.792
What do you mean,
"It's no wonder?"

00:13:57.875 --> 00:13:59.917
Still, who would've
ever thought it?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.417
We probably should have asked
them for their autographs.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.166
They were pretty funny,
weren't they?

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.041
Woman Rush Hour here.
Nice to be here.

00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:10.583
Yeah, nice to be here,
nice to be here.

00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:12.375
Looking out at the crowd
we've got here tonight,

00:14:12.458 --> 00:14:14.041
I'd say that there's about,
let's see, let's see.

00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:16.458
Uhhh, about 80% of
the seats filled,

00:14:16.542 --> 00:14:18.041
so we'll try to be
around 80% funny.

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:19.625
Hey, let's give them
all our funny.

00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:20.959
[MURAMOTO]
We're NSC grads.

00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:22.500
That's Yoshimoto's
comedy school.

00:14:22.583 --> 00:14:24.083
[MURAMOTO] But not everyone
goes pro after they graduate,

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:25.875
only the small handful
of people who stick it out

00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:28.000
through a lot of tough auditions
make it big in the end!

00:14:28.083 --> 00:14:29.792
Even if you do go pro, you
can't eat. If you want to,

00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:31.166
you have to enter the
Manzai, King of Conte,

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.333
the M1 Grand Prix tournaments,

00:14:32.417 --> 00:14:33.542
but the only handful
who reach the finals

00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:34.667
in those tournaments
can earn enough to eat.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.709
And even if you do,
you can't win.

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:36.834
Only a handful of
those who reach

00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:37.917
the finals can do that.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.125
And out of that handful
of finalists,

00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:40.542
can you all guess just
how many can perform

00:14:40.625 --> 00:14:42.125
on this stage? A handful.
And we're a real handful.

00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:44.083
Thank you very much, folks.

00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:46.959
But that's okay, it's something
we can brag about, right?

00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:49.083
Now that's what
I call rapid fire.

00:14:49.166 --> 00:14:52.250
I've never heard
anyone talk so fast.

00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:53.834
[MURAMOTO]
I just like it. That's all.

00:14:53.917 --> 00:14:56.959
Thanks, everybody,
you've been a great crowd!

00:14:57.041 --> 00:14:59.000
[NAYUTA]
His memory must be incredible.

00:14:59.083 --> 00:15:01.834
I'd never be able to
remember that many lines.

00:15:01.917 --> 00:15:04.458
[RIN]
Yeah. That was amazing.

00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:06.250
[applause]

00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:09.166
Hello, everyone, we're Teeup.
Hope y'all having a good time.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.125
[MAEDA]
We're happy to be here!

00:15:11.208 --> 00:15:13.375
Huh? I think I know them.

00:15:13.458 --> 00:15:15.291
Okay, here goes!

00:15:15.375 --> 00:15:18.250
[imitating engine]

00:15:22.458 --> 00:15:24.750
And what part of that
was supposed to be fun?

00:15:24.834 --> 00:15:27.500
This is some classic
two-person comedic banter.

00:15:27.583 --> 00:15:29.500
That gravelly voice
has so much character!

00:15:29.583 --> 00:15:32.959
It sure does. It's peculiar,
but it's really funny!

00:15:33.041 --> 00:15:35.083
[AUDIENCE laughing]

00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:37.792
Transform!

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:38.709
[BOTH grunt]

00:15:38.792 --> 00:15:40.208
Hey, hang on there.

00:15:40.291 --> 00:15:41.959
Just now d'you fly?

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:43.417
Little bit.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.709
[HASEGAWA] I'm impressed.
Well, let's try this again.

00:15:45.792 --> 00:15:46.709
Here goes:

00:15:46.792 --> 00:15:50.125
One, two, transform! Hah!

00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:51.750
--[MAFUYU] I'm positive.
--Hang on!

00:15:51.834 --> 00:15:52.625
[MAEDA]
Huh?

00:15:52.709 --> 00:15:54.834
They're the ones that I saw.

00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:56.792
[HASEGAWA]
Forget this!

00:15:56.875 --> 00:15:59.625
Thank you very much!

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:03.875
[NAYUTA] Having the chance

They were the duo I saw
when I was just a kid.

Oh, no. Honestly, it's nothing.

So sorry about that. So?

Oh, right. To do our live show.

I'd love to do it here!
That'd be fun!

But if I could change
the subject.

00:17:34.542 --> 00:17:36.709
There's a comedian photo-sticker
booth over there.

Want to try it out?

00:17:38.083 --> 00:17:41.250
[MAFUYU]
Whoa, photo stickers? I'm in!

00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:42.667

I don't see Mafuyu.
Where'd she run off to?

00:17:52.959 --> 00:17:54.125
Just leave her alone.

00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:56.583
She'll show her face
somewhere down the line.

00:17:56.667 --> 00:17:58.083
[NAYUTA]
That's kind of questionable.

00:17:58.166 --> 00:18:00.291
[MAFUYU] What's going in this

I don't believe them.

00:18:01.875 --> 00:18:04.250
It's like they're both little
kids, they're so immature.

Oh, you're here, Rin!

Fubuki, you too! Come in!

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.166
It isn't like I'm in
high school anymore,

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.166
like I'd wanna pose
for photo stickers.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.792
Heh!

00:18:14.875 --> 00:18:16.917
Okay, here goes!

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.792
We sure did take a lot, huh?

00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:22.542
And made faces in every one.

00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:24.667
There's nothing wrong with us
acting like comedians.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.667
That's true!

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.917

We should've been
buying everyone souvenirs,

but we only bought
things for ourselves.

I'm starving now.

00:18:40.041 --> 00:18:41.291
Well, we did burn a ton

00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:43.458
of mental calories
shopping for this stuff.

00:18:43.542 --> 00:18:45.875
Why don't we eat at that place?

[NAYUTA]
Ah, that looks good!

00:18:47.959 --> 00:18:49.500
I wouldn't mind it
if we ate there!

Okay, Mafuyu,
go score us some seats!

00:18:51.834 --> 00:18:53.959

Nikusui is an Osaka specialty!

00:18:56.333 --> 00:18:57.625
This place is known for it.

00:18:57.709 --> 00:18:59.333
Apparently, it's a dish
that's supposed to go

00:18:59.417 --> 00:19:01.750
extremely well with
raw egg on rice.

00:19:01.834 --> 00:19:03.583
Oh, are you ready
for our orders?

Sure, go ahead.

Could I get a nikusui
and a raw egg on rice?

00:19:07.333 --> 00:19:08.750
Me, too, but a large.

00:19:08.834 --> 00:19:10.625
I'll have the udon
with cracklings.

00:19:10.709 --> 00:19:12.125
And you Fubuki?

00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:14.166
Oh, sorry about that!
I think that I'll have

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.250
the curry udon
with cracklings, please.

00:19:16.333 --> 00:19:18.917
Got it, be right back.

If we're talking about Nikusui,
it's gotta be Chitose!

Let's see now:

00:19:23.542 --> 00:19:25.041
two orders of nikusui
and egg on rice.

00:19:25.125 --> 00:19:26.792
Oh, no egg on rice
for me, actually.

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:28.417
What? But I already paid for it!

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.083

I accidentally bought two,
so you can have one.

The ticket isn't fresh,
but the egg sure is.

Oh, uh, thank you
so much for this.

Oh, excuse me, could I
get a beer please?

They're the same ones who
were on stage today, right?

We've seen them all over.

Ever since we got
on the Shinkansen.

It feels like this is
some strange twist of fate!

loud voices, don't they?

And they've got so
much stage presence!

a city made for food lovers!

eat another bite.

So that's nikusui.

00:20:16.792 --> 00:20:18.583
It seemed more like a drink
than anything else, huh?

Those two ladies were Matsuura
and Ogawa of Spike, right?

perform in Tokyo.

to Tokyo, let's work hard!
