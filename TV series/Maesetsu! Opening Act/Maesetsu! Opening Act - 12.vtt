[MAFUYU]
Nayuta? What's going on?

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:17.267 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] I'm sorry.
We won't be able to make it.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.518 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Huh?

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] We can't go
to the second round.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:28.570 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
The truth is...

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Uh-huh. Okay.

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:37.829 position:50% align:center
I just got off the phone with
them. They're headed over.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.956 position:50% align:center
I let them know
what the doctor said.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.458 position:50% align:center
That your vocal cords
are stripped

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
and you can barely talk,
so there just isn't any way

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.714 position:50% align:center
we can make it to the
second round tomorrow.

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.716 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.477 position:50% align:center
Because I'm your partner and
I should've seen the signs!

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.312 position:50% align:center
A good partner should
be the first person

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.105 position:50% align:center
to notice you
aren't feeling well.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.232 position:50% align:center
I didn't. I was blind to it.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:10.153 position:50% align:center
And if I'd paid a little more
attention, this wouldn't've...

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.615 position:50% align:center
[gasps] But Rin...!

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:18.995 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.919 position:50% align:center
But Rin...

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:31.841 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA gasps]

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.389 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Please. That's not true at all.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:39.307 position:50% align:center
If I didn't have you
as a partner,

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:42.102 position:50% align:center
then I never would have
found my resolve!

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:43.269 position:50% align:center
It's thanks to you saying,

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.105 position:50% align:center
"You're the only
partner for me."

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:48.483 position:50% align:center
Thanks to you saying,
"We're gonna win this thing!"

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:59.285 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA laughs]

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.289 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA laughs]
Well, it's just...

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:05.333 position:50% align:center
Telling me not to cry,
and saying,

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:09.254 position:50% align:center
"This isn't the end." It's like
you and I are dating!

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.634 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] Yes, exactly! Oh,
but Rin will you look at that,

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:17.303 position:50% align:center
you wrote down "barn"
instead of "bar."

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.310 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA laughs]

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:27.397 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.111 position:50% align:center
That's too funny! What if
we did a flipboard act?

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.866 position:50% align:center
But Rin...

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.286 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA gasps]

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:48.418 position:50% align:center
"Sure, we could do that. But no.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.920 position:50% align:center
Ever since we first teamed up,

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.506 position:50% align:center
our act's been a talking act.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.384 position:50% align:center
We compete on the
strength of our banter.

00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:59.929 position:50% align:center
That's the heart of RDeco!"

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.640 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's so right.

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.934 position:50% align:center
You're exactly right!

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
Oh, Rin!

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu? What are you
thinking about?

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.923 position:50% align:center
What're we supposed say to them?

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
I can't find the words.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.844 position:50% align:center
I know I've been
feeling the same way.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.429 position:50% align:center
But you know what, though?

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
I think there's
something we can do.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Hmm?

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
That should be Mafuyu and
Fubuki. I'll go get the door.

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.616 position:50% align:center
Hi, Fubuki. Hi, Mafuyu.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much for
coming over here this late.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:08.123 position:50% align:center
Of course. Heck,
our friend's in a bind.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:11.584 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right.
Don't worry about it.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.296 position:50% align:center
Hey, lookin' pretty
perky, Teller!

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.007 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be
laid up in bed.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you look good!

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
The clinic doctor said
so long as Rin

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
takes her medication
and rests her voice,

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:24.139 position:50% align:center
that she'll be talking like
normal in about two weeks.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:27.017 position:50% align:center
Well, that's good! But, um...

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
Fubuki--

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Oh, Rin.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Rin.

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:38.778 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Anyway,

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:41.031 position:50% align:center
Rin and I gave our
situation some thought.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
We want RDeco to compete on
the strength of our banter,

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
so we're withdrawing from the
second round of the contest.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] "So go out there and do
your very best for us, too."

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50% align:center
Rin, we just...

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
Actually, we talked about it
on the way over here!

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
And we decided we're gonna
sit this one out, too.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:00.925 position:50% align:center
Right, Fubuki?

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:07.766 position:50% align:center
Rin, hold on!

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.270 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
No, no we can't.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
We can't go out there
without you!

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:18.276 position:50% align:center
I mean, the four of us worked so
hard this past year and a half.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.531 position:50% align:center
And you, you and Nayuta, we
can't leave our friends behind!

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu...

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
And when we think
about how you feel,

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50% align:center
we can't do it.

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
Rin, Na, she's right.
Mafuyu and I

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:36.169 position:50% align:center
had a serious talk about it
all on the way over here.

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center
I feel the exact same way.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU gasps]

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50% align:center
We can't say that
without the two of you!

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:54.979 position:50% align:center
We came this far together, and
we should finish this together.

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.064 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Mafuyu?

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:57.440 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it's hard
being a comedian.

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
Even in difficult
times like this,

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
we have to get ready to
make people laugh.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
Right now, RDeco can't do
what it does best

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center
to grab the audience
and make them laugh.

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50% align:center
But Mafuyu, Fubuki--
right now, you can.

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:16.084 position:50% align:center
We want Tokonatsu
to carry the torch.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:17.836 position:50% align:center
Are you sure, Na?

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
For comedians, making people
laugh is everything.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.590 position:50% align:center
And I think that's more or less

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
what Rin is trying
to say to you both.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:28.013 position:50% align:center
Rin.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
Okay. We'll take it from here.

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:38.356 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
And believe me when I say
I feel the same way.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
Go out there, try your hardest

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
and get as far as
you possibly can!

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
You got it!

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:51.077 position:50% align:center
We'll give it our best shot.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
[laughs] That doodle--
is that supposed to be us?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
That's so great!

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] Rin drew that
in a hurry right before

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.798 position:50% align:center
you both came over.

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.842 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU laughs]
Oh? Really?

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.969 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
To support Tokonatsu, she said!

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
You hush!

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.197 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.115 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's so funny, Kana!

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.409 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] Right? Names are
important, after all.

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:32.410 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Good morning!

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, good morning, Fuyu!

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
Good morning sis.

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
Oh, Kanae! I didn't
know you slept over.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.793 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I had to work
something out with Natsu.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:41.920 position:50% align:center
And before we knew it,
it was morning.

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
I'd accidentally
spent the night!

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.173 position:50% align:center
Well, how about that?

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.050 position:50% align:center
--Hey, guess what?
--[MAFUYU] Hmm?

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.510 position:50% align:center
We're gonna be there
with our friends

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
to cheer you on today.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
So just give it your
best shot, Mafuyu!

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
You've got to, for us!

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
Manatsu, Kanae...

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
We will!

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center
--[COMIC A] I'm Oxygen!
--[COMIC B] I'm Carbon!

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.316 position:50% align:center
[COMIC A]
And together...

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.193 position:50% align:center
[COMICS]
...we're Carbon Monoxide!

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.695 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
Absent?

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
I guess something must have
happened to Araya and Asogi.

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.367 position:50% align:center
You haven't heard anything
have you, Hatsuna?

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.619 position:50% align:center
No, I haven't heard anything.

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:15.620 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
I see.

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
There you are!

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Good morning, both of you!

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.875 position:50% align:center
We were starting
to worry about you--

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.128 position:50% align:center
today's line-up says
that RDeco is absent!

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
Me and Hatsuna were
just talking about it.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
So, what the deal here?

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:30.343 position:50% align:center
We're so sorry for making
the two of you worry about us.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA] When we hadn't
heard from any of you,

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:33.263 position:50% align:center
we assumed the worst.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.140 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA] You had us pretty
concerned, you know!

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.350 position:50% align:center
We've got a little
time before we start.

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
Can you fill us in?

00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA sighs]

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:31.648 position:50% align:center
It definitely feels
like winter all right.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.400 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
It has gotten cold lately.

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
It sure took a long time,
but the finals

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:38.154 position:50% align:center
for the New Comedy Kings contest
are coming up this weekend.

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
Hey Mafuyu, that
a comedy notebook?

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I was just thinking

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
it might be nice to write
all our bits down

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:47.539 position:50% align:center
and look them over

00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
Good idea, Mafuyu.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.542 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
It's like a switch inside

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:51.710 position:50% align:center
her got flipped on back then.

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
It's just so frustrating!

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:55.714 position:50% align:center
I wanna make it past the second
round for sure next year!

00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
No close calls!

00:20:57.215 --> 00:20:59.259 position:50% align:center
And for that to happen,
we need more chances to perform

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:00.844 position:50% align:center
in a lot of different venues.

00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:04.180 position:50% align:center
We won't get anywhere without
people seeing us--and laughing!

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:05.515 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu and I discussed
some things after we lost.

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:10.228 position:50% align:center
We think we'll try to
pound the pavement

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
and get in with an agency.

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
We'd finally get in front of all
kinds of audiences that way.

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:17.819 position:50% align:center
Then I guess we all landed
on the same plan in the end.

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:19.738 position:50% align:center
We were talking about
it back and forth

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:23.074 position:50% align:center
and came to the same conclusion
right before the contest began.

00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:25.577 position:50% align:center
Gotta live free and
ride hard, don't we?

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.829 position:50% align:center
Don't say that stuff,
you're not Hajime.

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:29.330 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:30.582 position:50% align:center
[INOUE]
This is it!

00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
[ISHIDA]
Pretty shady place.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
[CARLOS, WOMAN A]
Welcome.

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:37.172 position:50% align:center
Hey, I think I've seen those two
guys over there on TV before!

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50% align:center
[CARLOS]
Ah...

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.550 position:50% align:center
Right over there.
Can't miss 'em.

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
[INOUE]
Much obliged.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.763 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Maybe getting into NSC
would be the fastest way.

00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:46.222 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
How'd you like it, Rin?

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.391 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:49.517 position:50% align:center
--[MAFUYU] Eh?
--[RIN] You're kidding!

00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
A-Aren't the two of you...?

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:52.937 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hi. We're NON STYLE.

00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:54.814 position:50% align:center
Forget that. You're Tokonatsu.

00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:56.191 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu Kogarashi.

00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:57.233 position:50% align:center
Y-Yes!

00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:58.777 position:50% align:center
[INOUE]
And Fubuki Kitakaze, right?

00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.778 position:50% align:center
Wh-What?

00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
And over there is RDeco:
Rin Araya.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.114 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh!

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:04.574 position:50% align:center
[ISHIDA]
And Nayuta Asogi.

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:05.533 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:22:05.617 --> 00:22:07.827 position:50% align:center
Can, uh, how can we help you?

00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:10.330 position:50% align:center
[INOUE] Right, right!
We're here for a favor.

00:22:10.413 --> 00:22:12.207 position:50% align:center
P-P-P-Please!

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.584 position:50% align:center
They're the ones doing
the asking, Mafuyu.

00:22:14.668 --> 00:22:16.836 position:50% align:center
Still doing the over-the-top
panic thing, huh?

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.338 position:50% align:center
--Hilarious!
--Sure is!

00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:20.799 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we wanted to tell
you we're doing a solo act

00:22:20.882 --> 00:22:22.467 position:50% align:center
over at the Omiya Rakuun.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.843 position:50% align:center
é\Oh, we'll be there!

00:22:23.927 --> 00:22:25.011 position:50% align:center
Hey, hang on.

00:22:25.095 --> 00:22:26.846 position:50% align:center
I happened to catch your
act in Isawa Onsen

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.349 position:50% align:center
while I was staying
at a hot-spring inn.

00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:32.852 position:50% align:center
Sure, it was rough around the
edges, but you were funny!

00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:34.646 position:50% align:center
Then he showed me
footage of all y'all

00:22:34.729 --> 00:22:37.107 position:50% align:center
at the New Comedy Kings contest.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.901 position:50% align:center
If you're interested,
we'd like you to open for us.

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:42.737 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Are you serious? The Maesetsu?

00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:45.323 position:50% align:center
Right! Our opening act!

00:22:45.407 --> 00:22:46.533 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Thank you so much!

00:22:46.616 --> 00:22:48.952 position:50% align:center
We would absolutely love to!

00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:50.370 position:50% align:center
[GOUP]
Maesetsu!
