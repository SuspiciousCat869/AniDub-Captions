It's been so long!

What can I help you
with, big sis?

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:19.269 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] I was wondering if
you were free this weekend.

[MAFUYU]
Ah! A gig?

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.524 position:50% align:center
Right. It's for this
weekend, though.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.317 position:50% align:center
That's fine! Totally fine!

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Hold on.
Let's hear the details first.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
Yeah, go ahead, Nayuta.

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.407 position:50% align:center
What else can you
tell us about this gig.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.658 position:50% align:center
Sure.

So Asogi,

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.312 position:50% align:center
your sister married into
this family business,

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.189 position:50% align:center
and works at their
hot-spring inn now?

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:33.570 position:50% align:center
Right. It seems it's a
rather established one too.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:37.323 position:50% align:center
Yamanashi. Isawa Onsen.
I can't wait!

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:41.703 position:50% align:center
That being said, let's take this
nice and slow. Nice and slow.

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:45.331 position:50% align:center
What is this anyway, a bus tour?
Just stop talking for a while.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:48.501 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I can't believe that
your sister's an innkeeper.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:49.836 position:50% align:center
That surprised me.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.463 position:50% align:center
Really? To tell the truth,

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.840 position:50% align:center
there's a rather large
age gap between us.

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:56.968 position:50% align:center
She was already married by the
time I was in middle school.

00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.929 position:50% align:center
I took a trip to the inn
with Nayuta once,

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:03.558 position:50% align:center
right around that time.
It's a super nice place!

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:04.851 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA]
Sounds great!

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:06.978 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] I could really use
something to eat.

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:10.857 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA] Things are
cold out here a-ha-ha.

You're way too peppy.

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:16.237 position:50% align:center
If you keep that up,

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:17.989 position:50% align:center
you're gonna run out of juice
for the main event.

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:19.783 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA] I'm running on
rechargeable batteries

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.159 position:50% align:center
this time.

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.828 position:50% align:center
Lifting our spirits this way
is like plugging me in.

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center
And I've managed to
store up that energy

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.374 position:50% align:center
right here in my own body.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
So, after this, I'll be able
to release even more power!

[laughing]

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA]
That makes no sense.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we can't drag the inn's
name through the mud,

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.092 position:50% align:center
so take this seriously.

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50% align:center

Same to you.

Huh? Who do you think
you're talking to?

Huh? Take the exit on the left!

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.516 position:50% align:center

Follow the river!

[MAFUYU] There!
Head into the parking lot!

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
So, what are we here for?

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50% align:center
For Hoto!

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.830 position:50% align:center
If you don't eat hoto noodles
when you're in Yamanashi,

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.123 position:50% align:center
you're going straight to hell.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't go as far as that.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
But I do agree it's worth a try.

Is it ready?

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
The hoto looks delicious!

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
Whoa! This is amazing!

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
It's even bigger
than I imagined!

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center
What huge portions.

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
Tomita, that's a
lot of chanko hoto.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.571 position:50% align:center
Is that even gonna fit
in your stomach?

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:42.157 position:50% align:center
That bright-red broth
scares me, too.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
Let the battle begin!

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:47.245 position:50% align:center
Tomita are you seriously gonna
be able to eat all of that?

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
This here is a head-to-head
match between me and the hoto!

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.460 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah, I hope
you're victorious.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.680 position:50% align:center
It's so good! What the heck?

That was a lousy
excuse for a review!

[MAFUYU]
Yeah?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.147 position:50% align:center
Then why don't you show us how
they're supposed to be done.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA] These wide noodles are
neither udon nor kishimen!

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.694 position:50% align:center
It's like they're repaying
some favor I did

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.946 position:50% align:center
by weaving a silk
brocade in my mouth!

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
That's what I see when
I eat these noodles!

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.451 position:50% align:center
You realize your face is
bright red, don't you?

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.953 position:50% align:center
That's just the capsaicin
burning inside of me!

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:31.206 position:50% align:center
Why don't you just
admit it's spicy!

[sighs]

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] By the way, we're more
or less acting

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
as pinch hitters for this
gig we're doing, right?

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
What kind of shows do they
usually have at the inn?

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] Well, they put
on a wide variety,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
basically anything that the
guests'll find entertaining.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.432 position:50% align:center
And as I understand it,
on Fridays and Saturdays,

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
they hold a street-performance
type of show

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
in the banquet hall.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.479 position:50% align:center
And they have a regular troupe
that normally performs on

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
those days, but it seems that
they all came down with the flu.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.485 position:50% align:center
Which is why we got chosen to
fill in at the very last minute.

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:01.986 position:50% align:center
So that's it.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
Hey, what exactly is in a
street-performance type of show?

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
They have ventriloquists
and magicians and such.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.619 position:50% align:center
My sister said they always
had acts along those lines.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha. We've got those
guys beat for sure.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.791 position:50% align:center

unjustified confidence

Got a question. What's
that on your face?

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
They look like
lines or something.

rubber-band impressions

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.828 position:50% align:center
a shot yesterday.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center

you finally understand

[MANATSU laughs] This really is
a funny video, isn't it?

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.090 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they've got a nice rhythm.

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
Oh, good ear!
Look at you, Kanae!

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
What? I mean, I have watched
a ton of comedy clips

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.347 position:50% align:center
since we teamed up, on my own

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.099 position:50% align:center
and because you
showed them to me.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.601 position:50% align:center
Of course, I'm able to
tell that much by now.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:39.936 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.146 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
It's JK Cool!

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hi there!

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.774 position:50% align:center
[ERU] We're here to fill up your
heart-tank with happy energy!

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
As always, I'm reluctant
sweetheart Eru!

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
What are you, some TV host?

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
I'm Arashi, the doorstop
that's jammed in there

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
to keep Eru in place.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
And the two of us are JK Cool!

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
I know this is abrupt, but I'd
like to have an honest talk

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.954 position:50% align:center
about some of the
world's current problems.

00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:59.706 position:50% align:center
You suddenly sound
like your test scores

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.082 position:50% align:center
are through the roof,
Eru, but go on.

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.792 position:50% align:center
There's this witch with
a huge red ribbon

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:03.960 position:50% align:center
who flies on a broom

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.587 position:50% align:center
and who's popular
all across the nation.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know her, she's the one
with the delivery service.

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center
Though I'm not big on
saying things are

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center
"popular all across the nation"
since not everyone may agree.

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm not sure you should
be poking fun of that film,

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:16.848 position:50% align:center
but what was your point?

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
Well, her cat stops being
able to talk in the middle

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
of the story, and I thought
that was a problem.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:21.853 position:50% align:center
That's not a world problem.

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
That's just a problem
that she had with Jiji.

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.899 position:50% align:center
So, I happened to be on
the train the other day.

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
Way to ignore me.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.276 position:50% align:center
This old guy sitting
next to me sneezed,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.986 position:50% align:center
and his dentures flew
out like a rocket.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50% align:center
There's no way they did.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
And an old guy sitting
across from him used a cup

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
of cleaning fluid he was
holding to make the catch.

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
--What?
--A denture strike!

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.661 position:50% align:center
What the heck are you
talking about?

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
Plus, this isn't
some anime or manga.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center
There's no way that happened.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.875 position:50% align:center
I saw this and thought to
myself that a guy cleaning

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
his dentures on the train
was kind of a problem.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center
That isn't a problem
in the world,

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
that's a problem
with one old man.

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.132 position:50% align:center
Their style is high-tempo,

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:53.218 position:50% align:center
surreal humor with
snappy comebacks.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
Sure is. Hey, that reminds me.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:58.223 position:50% align:center
They're a year or two ahead
of us here, aren't they?

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They won last year's
High School Comedy contest

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:02.852 position:50% align:center
and signed with
Yoshimoto Kogyo.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
And after that, they
got on TV right away.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
It seems they got super
popular in no time.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
The material that
they're performing

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.360 position:50% align:center
is pretty much classic stand-up.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
You hit the nail on the head.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
That mismatch of modern teens
doing old-school-style comedy

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.242 position:50% align:center
is one of the secrets to
their popularity, so I hear.

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
I see.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
That's enough.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] Enough, Eru!
That's more like a prank.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.959 position:50% align:center
Even if it is like one, I'm just
pretending to fall for it,

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
and that's when we oughta
go in for the laughs!

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
It's totally just a prank.

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
[ERU]
Like I said...

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
Was that just...?

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
Yeah, just as we were
talking about them.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
It was kind of amazing.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:38.638 position:50% align:center
Huh? What was?

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
They spoke like real pros!

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.391 position:50% align:center
Oh, you meant that.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center
Their aura was something else!

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:44.144 position:50% align:center
It sure was.

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
I think my sister
and her friends

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:46.771 position:50% align:center
have them on their radar.

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.314 position:50% align:center
They do, huh?

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it, I
wonder how those guys are doing?

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
Right, cause they all
went to Yamanashi

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
to do a gig at a
hot-spring inn?

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
They did. I'm guessing
that they're probably

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center
rehearsing like crazy
right about now.

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU, FUBUKI sigh]

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
The warmth is soaking right in.

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
It really is. I can feel my
fatigue just melting away.

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
But shouldn't we be
rehearsing for the show.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50% align:center
Ahh. It feels like I've turned
into a capybara in here.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
Ah, we really should
rehearse, though.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI sighs]
The capybara's natural habitat

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
is around the Amazon
River, isn't it?

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
--[FUBUKI] We have to...
--[MAFUYU] ...rehearse.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:36.112 position:50% align:center
Hey, isn't the Amazon,
like, unexplored?

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:38.531 position:50% align:center
Capybaras sure do live
in a pretty rough part

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:39.783 position:50% align:center
of the world, don't they?

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
That's what I've heard.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
You know about that area's
rainy season, right?

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:47.499 position:50% align:center
All that rain makes the Amazon
River's water level rise.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hey!

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.920 position:50% align:center
[RIN] What are you two
lounging around for?

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
Get out of there already,
we need to start our meeting!

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
--[MAFUYU] Oh, okay!
--[FUBUKI] All right!

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.348 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA] So, let's talk about
our audience, whadda they like?

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.683 position:50% align:center
Well, I think it's
safe to assume

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
that they're mostly people
who like hot springs.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.771 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not
talking about what they like,

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
what are they like?

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center
Oh! There really aren't
any large groups today.

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.694 position:50% align:center
A lot of the guests are elderly

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:18.363 position:50% align:center
and the rest are families,
or so I was told.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
In other words, it sounds like
a mixed crowd, more or less.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.450 position:50% align:center
Then I'll say this right now,

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
your rubber-band routine is
completely off the table.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.038 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
So's your self-shipper gag.

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
What routine should we do?

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
That's a good question.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.167 position:50% align:center
Why don't we figure out

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:32.711 position:50% align:center
the order before we
go off and rehearse?

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:35.046 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sounds good. Although,
we ought to leave closing out

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
the night to the old pros.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:37.632 position:50% align:center
Obviously.

00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:39.259 position:50% align:center
So go out with a bang, okay?

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.261 position:50% align:center
Sure, we've got it covered!

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.388 position:50% align:center
I wonder if we actually do.

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:45.140 position:50% align:center
Who will open then? You or us?

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:46.891 position:50% align:center
We'll rock paper
scissors for it.

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:48.893 position:50% align:center
That's how you wanna settle it?

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:51.771 position:50% align:center
I think it's fine.
For this, anyway.

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
I'm leaving it in
your hands, Rin.

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:54.649 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
Let's do it!

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
--[MAFUYU] First is paper!
--[RIN] First is rock!

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.196 position:50% align:center
And second round... rock.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.407 position:50% align:center
--Ah, man.
--Yeah! All right! I won!

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.909 position:50% align:center
That means you and
Nayuta are going first.

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:06.453 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU laughs]
Woo-hoo!

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
I seriously hate being the first
one at bat, it's the worst.

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
That's that, I guess.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.045 position:50% align:center
Well, time for us
to go rehearse.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:18.798 position:50% align:center
So, what do you wanna do,

00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center
you wanna go with the
sweets buffet routine again?

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
Sure, that sounds good.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:24.679 position:50% align:center
Plus, it is the newest
of all our material.

00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:26.222 position:50% align:center
Great. Now that it's settled,

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center
we should give it a quick
run-through to prep.

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
Let's do it!

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.936 position:50% align:center
[RIN, NAYUTA] Thanks a lot,
you've been a great audience!

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
Did that feel good to you?

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.648 position:50% align:center
Mm-hm. I think we're ready.

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] The "hold time"-iness
feels about right, too.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Yeah, it does.

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:40.612 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
How about a break?

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Good idea.

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Should I brew some tea?

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
You know, this inn
hasn't changed at all,

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
it's still so calm
and laid-back here.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Mm-hm.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.083 position:50% align:center
When I first heard that my
sister was going to marry

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
It was like we were performing
to a pack of Tibetan foxes!

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:23.890 position:50% align:center
Making that audience laugh was
clearly beyond our abilities.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
We're changing things up.
No music today.

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.562 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
You can leave the rest
to Hatsuna and me.

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:34.192 position:50% align:center
You might have bombed, but we
won't let it end like this.

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.403 position:50% align:center
All right, let's go.

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
[clapping]

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:45.954 position:50% align:center
Junki Tomita here and...

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center
Hatsuna Ubuno.

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
And we're Freak!

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:49.833 position:50% align:center
--How're y'all?
--Thanks for having us here.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
Ahh, Isawa Onsen.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center
Is everyone here for the
famous old hot-spring cure?

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
I've heard the water
here is good

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:57.298 position:50% align:center
for all sorts of
different problems,

00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:59.634 position:50% align:center
like nerve pain, digestion
issues, gout, and chills.

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:01.469 position:50% align:center
Whoa, then you should
all have a good soak

00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
and get nice and healthy.

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:04.472 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it'll help you
live even longer!

00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
You want them to live
longer than this?

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:09.644 position:50% align:center
Why would anyone want to?
I mean, enough is enough!

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
Don't say that. Living is
just about the only thing

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:12.981 position:50% align:center
they have to look forward to!

00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:14.566 position:50% align:center
You do make a good point.

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
--Right?
--People are living

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
too darn long. I went for
lottery tickets the other day,

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:20.155 position:50% align:center
and this old guy in front
of me had to be at least

00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:21.031 position:50% align:center
a hundred years old.

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:22.574 position:50% align:center
Wow, good for him!

00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
Yeah. He said he was hoping to
win the billion-yen jackpot

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
since he was worried
about his old age.

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:29.039 position:50% align:center
Crazy, right?
Worried about his old age?

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:30.790 position:50% align:center
--[laughing]
--That's right now.

00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:32.500 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA] I'd say that he's got
one foot in the grave...

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:33.877 position:50% align:center
They're really killing
it out there.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.254 position:50% align:center
And they're using gallows
humor to get the laughs.

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:37.756 position:50% align:center
They changed their
material to something

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
the audience could relate to.

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:43.887 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Experience really does
make a big difference, huh?

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.389 position:50% align:center
If you were to compare us to
them, it's like night and day.

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:49.768 position:50% align:center
We don't even hold
a candle to them.

00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
We really don't.

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:52.771 position:50% align:center
--[TOMITA] Right.
--[HATSUNA] I misunderstood.

00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:01.821 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Thanks for helping out.

00:22:06.618 --> 00:22:07.827 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.498 position:50% align:center
I-I'm gonna take a bath.

00:22:23.885 --> 00:22:27.055 position:50% align:center
"I'm serious about comedy."

00:22:27.138 --> 00:22:29.307 position:50% align:center
Guess I can't say it yet.

00:24:05.403 --> 00:24:08.656 position:50% align:center
[GROUP humming]

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.908 position:50% align:center
A bench press!

00:24:09.991 --> 00:24:11.159 position:50% align:center
Bubble bun!

00:24:11.242 --> 00:24:12.410 position:50% align:center
Who's calling?

00:24:12.494 --> 00:24:14.579 position:50% align:center
We are done washing up!

00:24:15.914 --> 00:24:17.457 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA, HATSUNA]
What's next on Maesetsu?

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.291 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
"Comeback"!

00:24:18.375 --> 00:24:19.876 position:50% align:center

Don't miss it!
