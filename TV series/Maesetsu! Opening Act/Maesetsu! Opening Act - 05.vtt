[phone ringing]

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:31.750
[HATSUNA groaning]

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:35.375
Huh? What the heck?
Is that someone's alarm?

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:39.417
It sounds like it's
coming over by Hatsuna.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.375
It must be her phone.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.875
Hatsuna...

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:45.875
I think your cell
phone's ringing.

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:49.000
[snoring]

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:50.375
Hatsuna...

[HATSUNA grumbles]

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:55.291
Hey, Hatsuna!

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm impressed you can
sleep through this noise.

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:03.834
Hatsuna, wake up.

00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:07.125
Could you please answer
your phone already?

00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:10.041
[HATSUNA grunts]

[TOMITA]
Hey, we're headin' out!

[ALL groan]

00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:53.208
[TOMITA]
Is everyone here?

00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:54.834
Well? What is it?

00:02:54.917 --> 00:02:56.709
Heh. Leave everything to me.

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:58.500
[ALL]
Just answer the question.

00:02:58.583 --> 00:03:00.667
[MAFUYU grumbles]

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.166
[TOMITA]
Hmph.

00:03:08.417 --> 00:03:10.834
[yawns]

00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:12.667
So, spill, just
where in the world

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.583
are we going so early
in the morning?

00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:19.375
[GROUP sighs]

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:21.750
Come on. Where are we headed to?

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.375
[laughs] To paradise.

00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:25.583
Paradise, huh?

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:26.959
I don't think that's a
word you should say

00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.875
with an evil look on your face.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.500
So where are we going?

00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:33.417
Here's a hint: Remember
that one camping anime?

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.625
[HATSUNA]
Hey!

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.750
Sleepy. So very sleepy.

00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:40.250
You said it.

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:43.333
I don't think you could
even call it dawn yet.

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:53.000
[TOMITA]
We're here!

00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:55.000
What is this, Tomita?

00:03:55.083 --> 00:03:56.500
Where are we?

00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:58.125
[TOMITA]
A hot spring!

00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:00.208
[GROUP]
Uhh...

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:03.917
We're going to soak in
their open-air baths!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.375
If that's what you wanted to do,

00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:07.917
they've got open-air
baths at our inn.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.417
I'm still sleepy.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.792
Well, the baths
here are special,

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.834
so quit all the bellyaching
and just jump on in!

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.667
[gasps]

00:04:24.208 --> 00:04:26.500
[ALL gasping]

[TOMITA screaming]

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:37.709
[TOMITA]
Every dawn has its dawn!

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:39.375
Well, that ruined it.

00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:42.500
[GIRLS laugh]

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:44.166
[GIRLS sigh]

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.667
Do you think Tomita
was trying to...?

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.500
Mm-hm. This is definitely
his way of being thoughtful.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.542
[RIN]
Yeah...

00:04:57.834 --> 00:05:00.041
[TOMITA] A Hottarakashi
Hot Spring specialty:

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:01.542
fried soft-boiled eggs!

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:03.417
Frying high!

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.667
Huh?

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.041
They actually deep-fried
a whole soft-boiled egg?

00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:09.417
I have some serious
doubts about this.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.208
Normally you'd just
boil eggs or roll them

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:12.667
into Japanese-style omelets.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.041
Or just scramble them
up in a frying pan.

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.834
What else is there?
Filled omelets?

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:20.667
[TOMITA] Well, at Hottarakashi
Hot Spring, they deep-fry 'em!

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.500
Just think of it as a gimmick
and give 'em a try!

00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:25.959
[GIRLS gasp]

00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:28.750
[TOMITA grunting]

00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:31.458
It's hot! Hot! Hot!

00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:33.709
But it's delicious!

00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:38.166
[HATSUNA chuckles]

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.500
Mm. It works.

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:42.959
[RIN]
What the heck? This is great!

00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:45.208
[NAYUTA]
The yolk's nice and runny.

00:05:45.291 --> 00:05:46.792
[FUBUKI]
Yes, hot and runny.

00:05:46.875 --> 00:05:49.333
Hot, hot, hot...

00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:50.208
[TOMITA]
All done?

00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:52.917
Okay! It's time for this!

00:05:58.917 --> 00:06:00.417
[laughs]

00:06:01.917 --> 00:06:04.208
Ah, I finally feel awake now!

00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:06.375
Really? It took this long?

00:06:06.458 --> 00:06:07.792
Well, girls? I know you've got

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:09.834
a lot of little things running
through your minds,

00:06:09.917 --> 00:06:11.500
but out here in this fresh air,

00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:14.375
all your worries just seem
to go away, don't they?

00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:16.000
Standing before Mother Nature,

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:19.125
you start to realize just
how small we humans are.

00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:21.875
What's with the phony
street-poet vibe you've got?

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:24.750
Look at him go. He really
has impressed me today.

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:26.625
Yeah, he's in the
zone, all right.

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:29.625
He hasn't said it, but I think
everything he's done today

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:31.500
is probably meant
to encourage us.

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:33.125
You said it.

00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:35.125
[TOMITA] All right! Now that
you've soaked your worries away,

00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:37.375
we're headin' out!

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:39.625
Tomita. Your fly is open.

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:41.500
What?!

00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:44.250
That's what you get for
not acting like yourself.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.792
[TOMITA]
How about a little detour?

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:49.333
[GIRLS]
Okay!

00:06:51.583 --> 00:06:52.917
[RIN]
Where are we?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.166
[MAFUYU] The sign says:
"Village Station Ichinomiya."

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.417
[NAYUTA] What do you think
that is? Is it a chicken?

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.000
[FUBUKI]
Mmm... maybe a pigeon?

00:07:02.083 --> 00:07:05.000
Just so you know, something
special is found here.

00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:07.000
Why do you have that
evil look on your face?

00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:09.291
You see, they have
the rare delicacy known

00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:11.000
as fresh Shingen mochi, madam!

00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:13.250
Would you stop that
in every way please?

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:16.041
And they're limited in quantity,
only ten per day!

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:18.333
The competition for one
has to be fierce!

00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:19.458
Now that he said that,

00:07:19.542 --> 00:07:21.583
it's suddenly got my
curiosity piqued.

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:23.709
You all are so predictable.

00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:25.667
Though I'll admit,
I'm curious as well.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.291
But isn't fresh Shingen mochi
still just Shingen mochi?

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.834
[sputtering]

00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:35.750
[GROUP]
Aw...

00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:36.917
[EMPLOYEE A ]
I'm so sorry.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.834
We haven't gotten
today's delivery yet.

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:41.041
When? When will they
be coming back in?

00:07:41.125 --> 00:07:44.125
There's no need to get
so worked up, Mafuyu.

00:07:44.208 --> 00:07:47.417
It arrives when it arrives.
Sorry. There isn't a set time.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.750
Aw! This feels like
the taste of defeat.

00:07:50.834 --> 00:07:53.041
It's not like you were all that
interested in trying them

00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:54.625
to begin with.

00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:57.792
[MAFUYU] Ugh. That was before
I saw they were all sold out.

00:07:57.875 --> 00:08:00.542
It can't be helped.
Let's move on.

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:03.166
S'cuse me. Could I ask
you just one more thing?

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.917
Mafuyu, why don't you just
give up on it for today.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.792
It's about that thing up there.

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:10.458
Is it a chicken or
pigeon or what?

00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:11.333
That's your question?

00:08:11.417 --> 00:08:13.208
What is it?

00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:15.250
Oh, that's our pigeon mascot.

00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:19.208
It has a name, too, of course.
We call it Poppo.

00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:21.625
It's called Poppo, huh?

00:08:23.083 --> 00:08:24.709
[TOMITA]
Moving on!

00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:29.125
Aw... It's awful!
I can't get the thought

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:31.208
of that Shingen mochi
out of my head!

00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:34.709
You're the one who was saying it
was just Shingen mochi earlier.

00:08:34.792 --> 00:08:36.458
Hold on. Now that
I think about it,

00:08:36.542 --> 00:08:38.709
Shingen mochi isn't
baked to begin with.

00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:40.041
So, if what they have over there

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:42.083
is specifically
fresh and unbaked...

00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:46.417
Stop that! You're only making
me wanna eat them even more!

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:49.125
[TOMITA]
We're here!

00:08:50.166 --> 00:08:52.417
[MAFUYU] Fubuki!
They have ninja croquettes!

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.625
[FUBUKI]
Wow.

00:08:53.709 --> 00:08:56.291
Huh?

00:08:56.375 --> 00:08:59.625
[RIN] Are they roasted?
Or are they cold?

00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:01.000
Which is it?

00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:04.625
Curious? They're cold
and delicious, try one.

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:05.583
[NAYUTA]
Are you sure?

00:09:05.667 --> 00:09:07.291
Mm-hm! Come on, Come on.

00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:10.125

Thank you very much.

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:11.583

00:09:12.291 --> 00:09:14.333
[PROPRIETOR A]
Go on. Go on.

00:09:14.417 --> 00:09:15.458
Well? You see?

--Heck it's great!
--It really is good!

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.834
Isn't it though?

Hold on. Try this one now,
it's a favorite.

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:25.125
What the heck?
It's so sweet!

00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:27.500
I'd say you could even
eat this as a dessert!

00:09:27.583 --> 00:09:28.792
This really is delicious,

00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:30.250
I'd like to actually
buy one from you!

00:09:30.333 --> 00:09:34.000
[laughs] It's fine,
don't worry about it.

00:09:34.083 --> 00:09:36.583
Help yourself to some tea over
there and take your time.

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:37.625
Okay.

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:39.959
Thanks again for
the sweet potatoes.

00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:43.542
And here's one for you, Rin.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:44.917
Thanks a lot.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.166
[laughs] Refreshingly cold
and tasty!

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.583
Huh? Nayuta.

00:09:52.667 --> 00:09:53.583
Look.

00:09:53.667 --> 00:09:55.542
[NAYUTA]
Hm?

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:56.792
[RIN]
Huh...

I asked myself.

when they're cold.

Then he said, "Try one,"
