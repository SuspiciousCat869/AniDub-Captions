This should be their regular
business hours, shouldn't it?

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:22.480 position:50% align:center
Things are looking strange
around here, as usual.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:26.234 position:50% align:center
Oh, there they are!

May I take order?

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.204 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:41.708 position:50% align:center
For today, I suggest
ripe mango juice.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.835 position:50% align:center
Okay, then I guess
I'll take one of those.

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:45.920 position:50% align:center
I'll have one of those, too.

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.715 position:50% align:center
[CARLOS]
Two mango for young ladies!

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:51.092 position:50% align:center
Sure. Two mangos
coming right up.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:54.304 position:50% align:center
All right. Let's get down
to business, shall we?

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.474 position:50% align:center
It's October, and that means
that the preliminaries for the

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center
New Comedy Kings contest
are just around the corner.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.187 position:50% align:center
I thought we should take
this time to review

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.605 position:50% align:center
what it is we're up against.

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:06.316 position:50% align:center
The preliminaries are all
held at Yoshimoto theaters

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.693 position:50% align:center
all around the country.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:11.446 position:50% align:center
According to the rules,
two teams will be chosen

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:14.074 position:50% align:center
from each site to compete
in the main event.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:15.617 position:50% align:center
Of course, that's where
the ranks are gonna be

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.202 position:50% align:center
thinned out even further.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:19.954 position:50% align:center
Those who clear that hurdle and
make the cut will ultimately get

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:21.247 position:50% align:center
to compete in the finals.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.874 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Ah...

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.918 position:50% align:center
The competition
is stiff this year.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.878 position:50% align:center
There were more sign ups
than ever before!

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:28.380 position:50% align:center
What?

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:30.548 position:50% align:center
We already made it through a
narrow gate, and now we need

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.092 position:50% align:center
to pass through
the eye of a needle.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:35.387 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a very
lovely way to put it!

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.596 position:50% align:center
You can only compete in this

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.265 position:50% align:center
if you have less than
15 years experience,

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.227 position:50% align:center
although apparently, that
includes people already active

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.812 position:50% align:center
in TV or with a
theatre background.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.271 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
What the--?

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.024 position:50% align:center
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
JK Cool is gonna be a judge!

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.401 position:50% align:center
What? Is that true?

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.528 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's amazing for them.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.905 position:50% align:center
Not competing?
Afraid they'll lose.

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:55.532 position:50% align:center
Hey, come on, don't
think of it that way.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.283 position:50% align:center
Oh! This is news.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:58.535 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what is it?

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.578 position:50% align:center
Spike is going to
be there as well.

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:01.413 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:02.914 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Spike, too?

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:04.416 position:50% align:center
Wait, who are they again?

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.793 position:50% align:center
Was that the comedy duo you
met when you were in Osaka?

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:09.421 position:50% align:center
Yup! Ms. Matsuura
and Ms. Ogawa.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:10.964 position:50% align:center
Now that you've said that,

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:13.425 position:50% align:center
to think we'll be in the same
arena as an impressive team

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.427 position:50% align:center
that's played the
Namba Grand Kagetsu...

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.303 position:50% align:center
It's pretty intimidating.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
Hey, I found our
assigned preliminary site.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.268 position:50% align:center
It's not gonna be at our
local place, Omiya Rakuun--

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.811 position:50% align:center
It's Shibuya Mugendai Hall!

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:26.563 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Whoa! You serious?

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.106 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.066 position:50% align:center
Well, even if we were assigned
that site simply by chance,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.444 position:50% align:center
I have to say, I'm very excited
at the thought of being able

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:33.570 position:50% align:center
to perform there.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:34.738 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.573 position:50% align:center
Just thinking about it
has me trembling!

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.074 position:50% align:center
Why's that? Are you scared?

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.201 position:50% align:center
No, I'm trembling
with excitement!

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50% align:center
All right! Listen up!

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.705 position:50% align:center
Let's get through
those preliminaries,

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:45.040 position:50% align:center
conquer the main event--

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:47.584 position:50% align:center
and make it all the way
to the finals in December!

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:48.960 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:50.712 position:50% align:center
Now, to start things
off right...

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:53.715 position:50% align:center
Carlos! I'd like to order six
Young Lady sets, please!

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:55.216 position:50% align:center
Yes, okay!

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.802 position:50% align:center
I don't know if I
can eat all of that.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50% align:center
The portions are
supersized as always, huh?

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
Wha? The toppings are a little
different today, aren't they?

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
You can order the same thing
over and over again.

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
It always changes!

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
It's one of their quirks here.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.872 position:50% align:center
I won't lose to her!

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna eat it all!

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
Bring it on, little sis!

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
I'll turn those tables
right back on myself!

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.838 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu, that isn't how the
saying is supposed to go.

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
That's like stabbing
yourself in the back!

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
It's me you're supposed
to turn the tables on.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Hmph!

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.684 position:50% align:center
This isn't a competition.

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
I actually finished.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:18.985 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU groans]

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna burst. I can't
believe I ate all that.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
Hey, does everybody
have their materials

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.368 position:50% align:center
for the preliminaries
figured out?

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.995 position:50% align:center
Oho! So, you wanna
talk about that, huh?

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.748 position:50% align:center
Kana and I are going to use our
real-life experiences about

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
the struggles of trying to save
money as high schoolers.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:36.461 position:50% align:center
That's the reason why we
decided to change our name

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
to "Money Honey."

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
Get it? Now the
name says it all!

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
That's a great idea.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.635 position:50% align:center
You have a real solid
theme all figured out.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
And what about the both of you?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
Our bits, huh?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.516 position:50% align:center
[laughs] It's a secret.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
Aw! C'mon, we told you ours!

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
If you insist...
But just a small taste.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.564 position:50% align:center
It's not really a big deal.

00:05:56.648 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50% align:center
We're gonna be using elements
from our usual comedy skits.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
It'll be a culmination
of everything we've done

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center
up to this point.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.406 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Mm-hmm.

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
What about Tokonatsu?
What are you doing?

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:07.951 position:50% align:center
Top secret!

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.412 position:50% align:center
Stop being like that
and just tell us already!

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center
We don't have a whole
lot of material just yet.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.916 position:50% align:center
We made some big
changes in our act.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50% align:center
I almost forgot that
you two switched your

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
comic and straight man roles
around not too long ago,

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
that's what happened, isn't it?

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
We did.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.550 position:50% align:center
We tried out a bunch of material
with the change over

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
at Hajime's place. We definitely
have some ironing out to do.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.681 position:50% align:center
We can't decide if we should use
that or come up with new stuff.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.558 position:50% align:center
It's such tough call to make!

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center
We need to make our choice soon.
Time is already running out.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.688 position:50% align:center
You're right about that.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:39.315 position:50% align:center
The preliminaries will be here
before we even realize it.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they will.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
Then we'll all compete and
give it everything we've got.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.822 position:50% align:center
Huh, oh! We really
gotta head on out.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
Kana and I rented
a private karaoke room

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
and we're gonna
use it for practice.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.828 position:50% align:center
It was great to
see you all today.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing
your stories with us.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.334 position:50% align:center
You really inspired me
to work my butt off today!

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:03.923 position:50% align:center
Those two make me nostalgic.

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:08.386 position:50% align:center
They remind me of us
when we were younger.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] During our second year,
we teamed up on a whim.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:13.516 position:50% align:center
We had so much fun
that we decided to enter

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
the High School Comedy Contest

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.854 position:50% align:center
where we completely bombed!

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
Back then, I was only half-
serious about pursuing comedy.

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
And when we failed, it ignited
a spark in both of us,

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.613 position:50% align:center
and those tiny flames turned
into raging infernos.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's definitely
what happened, all right.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
We went down in flames,
in front of everybody.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
I can't describe how I
was feeling after that!

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.249 position:50% align:center
Hey, what are some stronger
words for "frustrated"?

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
Maybe something like regretful?
Or maybe vexed?

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
I was vexed!

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
Are you some samurai?

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:45.924 position:50% align:center
You know what's sweet?

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
Natsu is now following
in your exact footsteps.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:49.594 position:50% align:center
You've really inspired her!

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.096 position:50% align:center
That is true.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50% align:center
Maybe comedy's in
your family's DNA?

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:55.809 position:50% align:center
You know what? There's
something I'd like to say.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
Listen up.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.982 position:50% align:center
We need to get serious
and plan for the future.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
It's time for us to think
about what happens

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
after the preliminaries.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
We absolutely have to impress
the judges at the main event.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:12.409 position:50% align:center
Enough so that we get
offers to sign with an agency.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
We can't fail.

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
[RIN laughs]

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.252 position:50% align:center
What is it? What's so funny?

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:25.296 position:50% align:center
I meant every word
that I just said, okay?

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.506 position:50% align:center
Oh, man.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since
I've seen that face.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
You look so serious!

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.177 position:50% align:center
Nayuta.

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.388 position:50% align:center
Do you remember that very
first time we met Mafuyu?

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.891 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yes, I do! It is that face!

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Huh? What do
you mean? What face?

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.937 position:50% align:center
I believe I was there, too.

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
Was it that one time
at Omiya Rakuun?

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.275 position:50% align:center
That's right! We we're
in the same aisle

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
and she was wearing the
most intense expression!

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] I've been super
into this comedian lately.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
Oh, it that right?

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center
I've decided he's
my spiritual teacher!

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:00.415 position:50% align:center
Does that make you his
spiritual student?

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
Okay! It's mine!

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.044 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's the last one! Lucky--

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:06.421 position:50% align:center
Uh? Uh, go ahead.

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:07.672 position:50% align:center
No, it's yours.

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
Please, I live here in
Omiya so I can come back

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
whenever they
restock. It's fine!

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:15.555 position:50% align:center
I live in Kawagoe, so it's
not a problem at all.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.557 position:50% align:center
You two are acting like
a couple of old ladies.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.435 position:50% align:center
Why don't you settle this
with rock, paper, scissors?

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center
Sure, why not?

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.271 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:24.397 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Ready, and...

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[laughs]

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU, RIN]
Ready, and...

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:29.778 position:50% align:center
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
Rock, paper, scissors!
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
They're on the same wavelength!

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center
Here, pull lots instead.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.624 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU, RIN]
Ready, and...

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
--All right!
--Aww...

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
Oh, you two. Your
reactions are backwards!

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.302 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it.
The clerk said that they'll be

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:55.845 position:50% align:center
getting a new shipment
in any day now.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
It's like Mafuyu said earlier.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:00.266 position:50% align:center
We live right here in Omiya,
so we'll be back.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.976 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Yup, bye!

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.353 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:10.360 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.237 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
Would you maybe...?

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
Yes, for sure!

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
You like Nakagawake?

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.622 position:50% align:center
They're my favorite!
I love Reiji.

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:25.333 position:50% align:center
His impressions are so quirky.
They're the greatest!

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:26.376 position:50% align:center
You said it!

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.169 position:50% align:center
My personal favorite
has to be Wagyu!

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center
The way they deliver
their punchlines

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
is so incredibly smooth.

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center
Plus, their pacing is perfect
and it sucks me right in!

00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I completely agree!

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
So, who do you like?

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.849 position:50% align:center
It's a tough choice but recently
I've been loving London Boots.

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:43.685 position:50% align:center
Akiyama of Robert is
also personal favorite.

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
He's in that show
"Creator's File," right?

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:46.855 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:48.898 position:50% align:center
The mockumentary format
works well for him!

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
It does, right?

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
What about Sissonne?
Have you both heard of them?

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.905 position:50% align:center
They're great! Nothing compares
to just how on point they are!

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I can see that!

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:00.160 position:50% align:center
So then, does that mean
your style of comedy

00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:01.578 position:50% align:center
leans more towards skits?

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.247 position:50% align:center
Well, basically we've been
riffing off of each other

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
since middle school, and we
use that in our sketches.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:08.418 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Wow!

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:09.794 position:50% align:center
So, you two improvise?

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
Mm! I-I mean, that's
the goal, anyway.

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't say we've settled
on a particular style just yet.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50% align:center
We're still figuring things out.

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:21.431 position:50% align:center
We definitely have
a lot in common.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
But one day,
we'll be on keychains!

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.439 position:50% align:center
That sure takes me back.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me too.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:33.151 position:50% align:center
It was right after that you
two ended up telling us

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center
about those job openings.

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
Time sure flies.
It feels so long ago!

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] Oh, look at that!
It's all crooked!

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
[BARON'S OWNER] It is?
How should I fix it?

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:45.330 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Raise it up a little.

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
[BARON'S OWNER]
On which side?

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
--The right!
--The left!

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
So which side is it?

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking...
She really got to me.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
Is this about what
Mafuyu said earlier?

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
About the main event and
signing with an agency?

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.307 position:50% align:center
Well, being signed
doesn't automatically mean

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
we'd be getting any job offers.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
True. Nothing is guaranteed.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.564 position:50% align:center
We're still pretty green. Our
comedy isn't even at the point

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
where we can make
lots of people laugh.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
I guess I just really want to
pin down how to do all of this.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
After that's all figured out

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.239 position:50% align:center
then I can practice
and get better.

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Mm-hm. I agree but--

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.369 position:50% align:center
I realized something
after Osaka.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
And after we tried out our
new material in front of

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:28.998 position:50% align:center
a live audience at
my sister's inn.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.543 position:50% align:center
It just opened my eyes.

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:34.713 position:50% align:center
Entertainers have to be seen,
have to make people laugh--

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
or they won't go anywhere.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.800 position:50% align:center
Which is why we have to
think about performing

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
for all kinds of people,

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center
not just agency audiences
at large events.

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:46.891 position:50% align:center
We need to put ourselves
out there. No matter what!

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
It's the only way we'll
make it as comedians!

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
Ooh...

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:54.399 position:50% align:center
I'm right, aren't I?

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center
Nayuta?

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.821 position:50% align:center
We're gonna win this thing!

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.869 position:50% align:center
I'm only hoping for one thing--

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.538 position:50% align:center
that this time next year,
we'll be working comedians!

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:09.748 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:11.541 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.338 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Hey, Eru.

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:17.547 position:50% align:center
I have a proposition to make.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center
[ERU]
Yeah, what is it?

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.051 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking that we
could use a little cushion.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
So, with that in mind, how do
you feel about having one brand

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.681 position:50% align:center
new set of event material ready
by the end of the year?

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
Huh? That's a pretty tall
order coming from you.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50% align:center
It'll give us some
cushion, remember,

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
if we don't do at
least that much.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center
You don't agree with me.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:37.692 position:50% align:center
No, no, I like the idea.

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
I was just distracted thinking
about how stoked you are.

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
Of course, I'll do it.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
Eru.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center
It's challenging, but it's all
gonna be worth it in the end.

00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
So anyway, take a look.

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:52.665 position:50% align:center
[ERU]
Oh? Whatcha got?

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.876 position:50% align:center
Well, I came up with
some new material.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.086 position:50% align:center
Ooh!

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Tomorrow's the big day!

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Everyone's together
in the first half, huh?

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:44.634 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Money Honey, Freak!,

00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:47.887 position:50% align:center
Tokonatsu, and
us, in that order.

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
Aw, my heart is pounding
super-fast right now.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.143 position:50% align:center
Natsu.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:56.146 position:50% align:center
--[chuckles]
--[yelps]

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
What was that for?

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
I'm just psyching you up!

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:01.151 position:50% align:center
I'm already psyched,
don't do that again!

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
Great idea!
Thanks for your help!

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:04.279 position:50% align:center
Jeez, Kana!

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.990 position:50% align:center
Now that we're all psyched
up, let's do this Natsu!

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.159 position:50% align:center
[STAFF A]
BANBANBAN, you're up!

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.745 position:50% align:center
Participants will be called
in order--please be ready.

[ALL gasp]

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:14.372 position:50% align:center
Hey there!
The name's Sameshima.

I just said "schaping"--
is something wrong with that?
