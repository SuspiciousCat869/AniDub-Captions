00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.432 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
We made it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.683 position:50% align:center
Man, that was way better than

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.435 position:50% align:center
dealing with Tomita's
driving, wasn't it?

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.561 position:50% align:center
It sure was.

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:21.312 position:50% align:center
Oh, you two are terrible!

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.566 position:50% align:center
Tonight's show might just be our
last chance to run through our

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:27.569 position:50% align:center
material live before the New
Comedy Kings contest starts.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:28.945 position:50% align:center
That's very true!

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.196 position:50% align:center
Also...

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.240 position:50% align:center
I have another critical
mission I gotta complete

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
while we're here!

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:35.535 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah that thing.

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Wasn't Hajime supposed
to come pick us up?

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:39.205 position:50% align:center
That was the plan.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
Where could she be?

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.917 position:50% align:center
Oh, here she comes!

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:47.047 position:50% align:center
Hey there girls. Sorry I'm late.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.509 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Oh, wow.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:52.886 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
That's Hajime for ya.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.221 position:50% align:center
She used to have
a really edgy vibe.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.974 position:50% align:center
I've never seen a car like this
before, it's something else.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.226 position:50% align:center
She's such a boss.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.519 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] It would have been
nice if Freak! had come, too.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.449 position:50% align:center
Yes, but there's nothing
we could do--

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
they already had
another gig scheduled.

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:41.453 position:50% align:center
They both seemed pretty
disappointed, though.

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:42.954 position:50% align:center
"I need my Vitamin H!

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:46.416 position:50% align:center
I've got a Vitamin Hajime
deficiency!" That was Tomita.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.876 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
It sure was.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center
He even asked for Hajime's
soaking water as a souvenir.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:51.713 position:50% align:center
See, that's how he winds up

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:53.798 position:50% align:center
getting uninvited
to the next trip!

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center
He won't be getting any
souvenirs from us, then.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:59.346 position:50% align:center
You girls certainly came in
on an early train, didn't you?

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
Yeah, because there's this
one place I wanted to go.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:05.101 position:50% align:center
Come on, Mafuyu. Please
don't bother her with this.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.978 position:50% align:center
Oh? Where exactly?

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50% align:center
I wanted to buy some of
that fresh Shingen mochi

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.483 position:50% align:center
I couldn't get last time.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:13.860 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's too bad. I wish
I could have driven you

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:16.237 position:50% align:center
to get them earlier,
but I had to work.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
No, no, it's really
not a big deal.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.076 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50% align:center
How about you lend us your car?
I can drive now, remember?

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:27.040 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, that's right, Nayuta--
you just got your license!

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.919 position:50% align:center
I know, but you've
barely done any driving.

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:34.047 position:50% align:center
I'll be just fine. Plus, the
roads out here are so wide.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
All right but you'd better
drive safely, got it?

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.803 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course!
Just leave it to me.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:43.807 position:50% align:center
Woo-hoo! Oh yeah, fresh
Shingen mochi, here we come!

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
[RIN] You're a surprisingly
good driver!

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.271 position:50% align:center
Oh, driving here
isn't hard at all.

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50% align:center
[sighs] It's starting to feel
like I was born under

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
an unlucky, can't-buy-fresh-
Shingen-mochi star.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
Come on, don't be so dramatic.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
I know, but what if fresh
Shingen mochi has me on

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.830 position:50% align:center
some sort of "do not
collaborate" list?

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.707 position:50% align:center
I don't know what that means.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
So, what do we do now then?

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
I won't give up yet! I'll wait
till they're restocked!

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
You're welcome to wait, but I'm
afraid it might take a while.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.425 position:50% align:center
Uh... Okay then.

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Since we have the car and all,

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
there's someplace
I want to check out.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
What that?

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.557 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Here, it's called
the Seven Lucky Gods tour.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
The Seven Lucky Gods tour?

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
Visit them all and you'll
get an arrow talisman.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
You know, to ward off evil.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.815 position:50% align:center
We can offer prayers, 'cause
with the New Comedy Kings

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
contest comin' up,
we could use a little luck.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
That's a great idea!

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:39.446 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's Hajime.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50% align:center
Give me a second.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
Hey, is the car okay, Nayuta?

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
It's not scratched up at all?

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA laughs]
Everything's fine!

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
[sighs] So everything's all
right with it? That's good.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.960 position:50% align:center
Any luck with those
fresh Shingen mochi?

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] They were out
when we got there.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
We're thinking about doing
the Seven Lucky Gods tour

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
while we wait for
them to restock.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
What? In the car?

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
No way! Are you kidding me?

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
So is that a no?

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.976 position:50% align:center
I mean... [exhales]

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
All right, but please
drive safely.

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:13.563 position:50% align:center
Don't do anything dangerous!

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] I know, I know!
I'll be careful. Thanks, sis!

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
I hope she'll be okay.

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Let's see...

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
I think the turn is coming
up ahead soon?

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50% align:center
No! This street! You gotta make
a hard right turn here!

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
What, here?

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Huh? Hang on--this is it?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
[grunts] I think so.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
This is tight! We're barely
squeezing through!

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.677 position:50% align:center
It sure is.
Are we gonna be okay?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
Will you two be quiet?

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI, MAFUYU gasp]

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.181 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Na's acting like a
totally different person!

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.058 position:50% align:center
That's not the Nayuta we know.

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Oops!

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
What now?

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.729 position:50% align:center
My bad. Looks like we turned
one street too early.

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.275 position:50% align:center
Rin, why didn't you say
something earlier?

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
Just three more and
we're done--5, 6, and 7.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
And everything turned out
just fine. Just fine!

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
Hajime was worried,
but I'm a great driver!

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.370 position:50% align:center
You're being awfully quiet, Rin.

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
If the sun is over
on that side...

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.707 position:50% align:center
I can't tell my direction
from the sun.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.750 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
Uh, well...

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center
Well? What is it?

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
It looks like we sorta
missed our turn back there.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.465 position:50% align:center
Don't freak out, it's okay!

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:06.301 position:50% align:center
It's barely even out of our way,
we can just take the next turn.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:07.969 position:50% align:center
--Right there!
--What, here?

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna turn right here! Okay?

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
--No, wait! Um...
--I'm waiting!

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.391 position:50% align:center
It's actually even better
if we turn further ahead!

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.018 position:50% align:center
Really? Then I'll keep going.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Yeah, that's fine.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.271 position:50% align:center
Wait! No, you gotta
turn right here!

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.482 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] Are you sure?
Okay I'm turning--for real!

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Oh, wait hang on!

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.318 position:50% align:center
I'd had my suspicions earlier,

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.779 position:50% align:center
but Rin really cannot read
a map to save her life.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.947 position:50% align:center
That may be true, but
since I'm doing the driving

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center
we should be fi-- [gasps]

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
Oh no, are we stuck
in the gutter?

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center
Yep, it sure looks that way.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.253 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Nayuta.
This all happened because

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:44.923 position:50% align:center
I wanted those
fresh Shingen mochi.

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
Yeah, this does look pretty
bad. But what's worse...

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
My sister's going to be so mad.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
[RIN] That part has
a huge crack in it.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
I have a feeling we might
end up seeing the old Hajime.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.398 position:50% align:center
Maybe some spit will
make it look better.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
That won't help at all.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
You can sample all kinds of food
at department stores, right?

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
But people always hold
back a little, don't they?

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.283 position:50% align:center
Except little kids who'll
eat everything in sight.

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
I feel a little bit jealous
whenever I see them.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
One time, I actually managed
to get at least three rounds

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.248 position:50% align:center
of the food samples.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.749 position:50% align:center
--[SHIHO] Really?
--Yeah.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
Turn your jacket
inside-out, wear a hat--

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
you can do three rounds,
it's super easy.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.922 position:50% align:center
Uh-uh, they'd totally catch you.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
[KANAE grunts]

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.801 position:50% align:center
Nah. On my fourth round,
I'll wear an afro.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
Then a hairband, fake glasses,
cowboy hat, Hawaiian shirt,

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center
and some platform shoes.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
Now don't you totally stand out?

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
And then,

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
a platinum blonde wig
with a big fake moustache!

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.187 position:50% align:center
That's gonna look
very unnatural!

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center
Department stores really
do sell everything!

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
If you can afford
all those disguises,

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.735 position:50% align:center
just buy your food
instead of sampling it!

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:47.777 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS laughing]

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
That was some great
banter just now!

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.156 position:50% align:center
It might be kinda funny

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
if you two did stuff
that feels like that.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.492 position:50% align:center
Stuff that feels like what?

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
I think she means you should use
more things you've actually

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
experienced or any stories
that stand out to you.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.331 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:02.959 position:50% align:center
[HARUNA] Yeah, that's what
I was trying to say.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
I see...

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.838 position:50% align:center
[KANAE grunts]

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME growls]

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.183 position:50% align:center
Was I not clear when I
said to drive safely?!

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:19.476 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.770 position:50% align:center
Now thanks to you,
the air dam's cracked!

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME sighs] Still, I have to
say I'm glad no one got hurt.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Mm.

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
Well, did you finish your
Seven Lucky Gods tour?

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
We have three left.

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:34.908 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Then, shall we?

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.743 position:50% align:center
Uh, you mean finish the tour?

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
You can't very well
quit part way through.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
I handed off my work
and left early.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:44.709 position:50% align:center
Besides, Nayuta's probably
done enough driving today.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.868 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Yes! We got our arrow!

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:22.539 position:50% align:center
And after going through all that
today, I'm even more gratefu--

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
Well! So much
for a lucky charm!

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.381 position:50% align:center
My bad.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.633 position:50% align:center
Aw, a little spit and we'll have
it looking like new again!

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
That'd curse us with worse luck!

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.429 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry.
I'll take it home for now

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
and put the bells back on
if that's cool with you.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
Still, we did manage
to visit them all--

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center
after Hajime came
to the rescue.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
Oh man, I'll never forget that
priceless look on Nayuta's face

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
when Rin told her she
took the wrong turn.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
That was Rin's fault for
giving bad directions!

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
I said I was sorry!

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:56.990 position:50% align:center
We still finished the
tour though, right?

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:59.409 position:50% align:center
And it worked out in the end.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
It would've been perfect
if I had just snagged

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
those fresh Shingen mochi.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
Well, then let's go.

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center
Huh? Where are we going now?

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:08.793 position:50% align:center
Back to the store for the fresh
Shingen mochi, of course.

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:11.171 position:50% align:center
They should be restocking
any minute now.

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:13.631 position:50% align:center
How do you know that, sis?

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.050 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I looked it up.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
Now, let's go!

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What a boss.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.513 position:50% align:center
Let's do it!

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
[KANAE] So, I basically
embroider a little design

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
over any holes in my socks.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU] Really?
That's very crafty of you.

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
Like that pair of socks I
saw you wearing earlier?

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.357 position:50% align:center
--[KANAE] Uh-huh!
--[MANATSU] Wow!

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.317 position:50% align:center
Those were super cute, Kanae!

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.653 position:50% align:center
Thanks! And sometimes I also
take extra scraps from curtains

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:37.489 position:50% align:center
and turn them into
cushions and bags!

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:40.575 position:50% align:center
You mean all those are
handmade, too? That's great!

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.203 position:50% align:center
Maybe one of these days you
can make something for me.

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.580 position:50% align:center
Also, I like to use
permanent markers

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50% align:center
to add brand names
to T-shirts!

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
Now that's kinda tacky.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.629 position:50% align:center
I think maybe Haruna
and Shiho were right--

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
we can get inspiration for
comedy material out of my life.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:59.594 position:50% align:center
It's not a bad idea but are
you okay? It is personal.

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, totally.

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center
It really made those two
crack up, after all.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
It's true that my family
did struggle with money

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
when I was growing up,

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:08.937 position:50% align:center
but it was fun finding
clever little ways

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
to make the best of it.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50% align:center
This new material
really feels like us.

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
Natsu, how about
we give it a try?

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:16.611 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Hm...

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:18.238 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
Hey, I think we should
take this opportunity

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
to pick out a new name--

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.910 position:50% align:center
since we have fresh material
maybe it's time for a rebrand.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:24.786 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
We need a name that's really us,

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:28.123 position:50% align:center
one that goes with
our new material.

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:31.001 position:50% align:center
A new team name that
feels like us...

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.460 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right!

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU] Hmm... But what
should we change it to?

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
We could go with something
simple: "Manatsu &amp; Kanae,"

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
how's that?

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.468 position:50% align:center
"Manatsu &amp; Kanae," huh?

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
It could also be shortened
to make "Mana &amp; Kana."

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
That kinda sounds
like we're twins.

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
Fair enough, but how about we
play with that rhyme a little?

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
"Money Honey"?
Something like that?

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.896 position:50% align:center
Ooh, that's nice!
It's like, rich and sweet!

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
Then I guess that settles it.

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:56.192 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] The two of us
are now Money Honey!

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU] It's official!

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.696 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
--Oh!
--What?

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
Let's go say hi to them.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.455 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:10.415 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Can't believe I lost again.

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
If your losing streak is this
bad, maybe you shouldn't play.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:14.919 position:50% align:center
I'll never quit until I win!

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
And one day I will beat you,
and you will buy me a drink!

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.300 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Excuse me!

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Hm?

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:22.552 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey!

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
What is it?

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.931 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
We'd like to apologize.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.434 position:50% align:center
Wh-What's all this?
What happened?

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
Um. I was pretty rude to you,
the first time that we met.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh...?

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:36.941 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's totally fine,
don't worry.

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:40.945 position:50% align:center
We decided, from now on,

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
we're going to be more serious
about performing comedy!

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
We narrowed down the kind
of material we want to do

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
and even chose a new
name to go with it.

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:50.038 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Money Honey
is our new name!

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
Huh! Money Honey, you say?

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
I like it!

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.670 position:50% align:center
So, you two are sticking with
the whole comedy thing, eh?

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:57.921 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Yes!

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
Awesome! That's good to hear.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.550 position:50% align:center
Well, guess we'll see you
around, Money Honey.

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
Till next time!

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.681 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU, KANAE] All right!
Thank you very much!

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:09.683 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's do this!

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.017 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
All set. Here's
your room key, sir.

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
[INOUE]
Thanks.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.359 position:50% align:center
Oh, there's going to be a live
comedy show in the main hall

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:21.569 position:50% align:center
tonight, if you're interested
in that sort of thing.

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
[INOUE] Oh? You have
live comedy shows here?

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
I think I might have
to check that out.

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
We got our live show
right after this.

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
It'll be our first performance
as the reborn Tokonatsu!

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:38.211 position:50% align:center
We've already rehearsed a ton,
so let's just dive right on in!

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:39.462 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.339 position:50% align:center
We're debuting some new
material tonight, too.

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:42.841 position:50% align:center
And we're going to be first.

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:45.218 position:50% align:center
We'd better get the audience
nice and warmed up for them!

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center

are some old dudes with
vacuums on their backs.

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:16.216 position:50% align:center
What the--?
Who the heck are these guys?

00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:18.093 position:50% align:center
Well now, this is
a haunted house?

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
So naturally you need
someone who can help

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
you get rid of the ghosts.

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:22.389 position:50% align:center
That's the Ghostbusters!

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] What do you think of my
amazing haunted house idea?

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:25.725 position:50% align:center
Spooky, huh?

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
No way, that's not
spooky at all!

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
Forget it! And...

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
...thank you very much!

00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center
[INOUE]
Excuse me.

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.828 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
To a great show!

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
We really had the audience
laughing tonight, didn't we?

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
The show's structure
was perfect.

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:52.043 position:50% align:center
We warmed them up
with the improv,

00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:53.628 position:50% align:center
then dove into our routines.

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yeah,

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
and the order we did the
acts in was just right.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.467 position:50% align:center
It felt like we really
connected with the audience.

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:01.219 position:50% align:center
Just like you thought
we would, right?

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
I hope we can keep up
this same level of energy

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:06.725 position:50% align:center
when we do the New
Comedy Kings contest.

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
That sure is coming up soon.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
It's a good thing we
were able to try out

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:12.355 position:50% align:center
our new switched-up
material beforehand!

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:14.482 position:50% align:center
And it went just like
we'd rehearsed.

00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center
You two were on
fire out there!

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:18.611 position:50% align:center
Probably because you had
us to warm up the crowd.

00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:20.155 position:50% align:center
You said it!

00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
Rin really was the most nervous
one out of all of us though.

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:24.743 position:50% align:center
Now hold on,
I wasn't that nervous.

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:28.246 position:50% align:center
She's right.
I could totally tell!

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:31.249 position:50% align:center
Still, even though it went well
we should keep practicing.

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:33.877 position:50% align:center
Fubuki, I'm going to come up
with the goofiest setups

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.295 position:50% align:center
you've ever heard!

00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:36.629 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] And I'll punch right
back with my comebacks!

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:37.505 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Yeah!

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:38.381 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Woo! Do your best!

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Look who's talking.

00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center
Thank you for inviting us.

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:48.016 position:50% align:center
And thank you for giving us the
chance to perform so many times.

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:50.018 position:50% align:center
No, I should be thanking you.

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:51.519 position:50% align:center
You were all so funny,

00:21:51.603 --> 00:21:54.064 position:50% align:center
the guests loved it and I was
laughing along with them.

00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:55.398 position:50% align:center
I would love to have you back.

00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
Great! We're looking
forward to it!

00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:01.404 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Sis.
See you next time.

00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:04.783 position:50% align:center
Nayuta, you're a performer.
Stay straight on that path.

00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:06.284 position:50% align:center
No veering into gutters!

00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:08.620 position:50% align:center
I don't believe you, sis,
you're still bringing that up?

00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:09.871 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS laughing]

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:48.803 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
I'm home!

00:23:48.887 --> 00:23:50.555 position:50% align:center
What-- What's going on?

00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:52.932 position:50% align:center
There's something important
we have to tell you.

00:23:53.016 --> 00:23:54.559 position:50% align:center
Huh? What is it?

00:23:54.642 --> 00:23:56.061 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:57.854 position:50% align:center
We've decided we're
going to be competing

00:23:57.937 --> 00:23:59.564 position:50% align:center
in the New Comedy
Kings contest, too!

00:23:59.647 --> 00:24:02.067 position:50% align:center
We're super serious about
becoming comedians!

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.526 position:50% align:center
Really?!

00:24:06.738 --> 00:24:09.407 position:50% align:center
So those two are
actually going for it.

00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:12.327 position:50% align:center
I have a feeling this is
going to be so much fun!

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.745 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:24:15.997 --> 00:24:17.457 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
What's next on Maesetsu?

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.375 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
"Showdown"!

00:24:18.458 --> 00:24:19.959 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
Don't miss it!
