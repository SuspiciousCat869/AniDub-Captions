Osaka...

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:14.931 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
...day two!

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
Let's set out on another day...

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.143 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
...and enjoy it to the fullest!

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:19.769 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.062 position:50% align:center
[CROWD]
Huh?

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Some sports team, maybe?

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:24.315 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
Here for a camp?

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.193 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] Wow, such loud voices,
these kids just have no manners!

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.987 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
They're fired up.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.781 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Not cool.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:07.669 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Okay.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.754 position:50% align:center
This is what we're
gonna do for today.

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:10.714 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU grunting]

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:11.715 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Huh?

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.717 position:50% align:center
Yum, I really love
this sandwich!

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.218 position:50% align:center
[RIN growls]

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.721 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] They really roll their
sweet omelets thick here!

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:21.307 position:50% align:center
And a thick sweet
omelet reminds you of...

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.643 position:50% align:center
...the kindness of others!

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:25.103 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Because at their core...

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:27.605 position:50% align:center
...they both make you feel
all warm and fuzzy inside.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.357 position:50% align:center
Or something like that.

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:31.735 position:50% align:center
Oh. I think I see.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.611 position:50% align:center
But maybe you should
explain that to me.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.113 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.365 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to tell you
what our plans are today.

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.868 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's right.
Sorry about that.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.327 position:50% align:center
I apologize, Rin.

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.204 position:50% align:center
But I did think it
was funny, Mafuyu.

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:46.374 position:50% align:center
Those were some witty comebacks.

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.668 position:50% align:center
There's just something about
being in Osaka that makes it

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:51.504 position:50% align:center
feel like every conversation
should end in a laugh, right?

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.256 position:50% align:center
Yes, it does feel that way.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.759 position:50% align:center
But you still have to listen
when people are talking.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.762 position:50% align:center
By the way, Mafuyu you've been
slipping into the local accent

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.263 position:50% align:center
a lot since yesterday.

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:02.640 position:50% align:center
It's just, you know when
you hear it all around you,

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.017 position:50% align:center
it ends up being contagious!

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.019 position:50% align:center
It's like you're a
true Osaka native.

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:08.480 position:50% align:center
Oh, you were talking.
What's on the agenda?

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.357 position:50% align:center
Right back on track.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.902 position:50% align:center
I was thinking we could go
check this place out.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:16.738 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Cool Japan Park Osaka, huh?

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:18.406 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Yeah. They have
all kinds of events,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
like Yoshimoto Shinkigeki shows.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.119 position:50% align:center
That sounds like it'll
be a lot of fun!

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
It sure does.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:28.249 position:50% align:center
What? I thought we were going
to head over to Dotombori.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
Don't worry,
we're going there, too.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.169 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:33.630 position:50% align:center
The four of us are here to
have some fun, aren't we?

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
I'd work on the accent.
It sounds really funny.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna hear it.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.389 position:50% align:center
It looks like the comedy shows
all start in the afternoon.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
We can spend the day in
Dotombori and eat there.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.267 position:50% align:center
Hooray!

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.519 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that'll be fun.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:48.770 position:50% align:center
That's a great idea!

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:52.273 position:50% align:center
But before we get
to all of that...

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
When I have a bite
of this sandwich,

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.027 position:50% align:center
I'm reminded of Tokonatsu!

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.529 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Because at their core...

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
...no matter what
way you look at it,

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
they're both full of eggs!

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.783 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.673 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
One ice pop, please!

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
[AUNTIE]
Sure thing. Which flavor?

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Hmm, what should I get?

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
All right...

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
The mikan!

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
[AUNTIE] Coming right up.
That's four million yen.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:30.437 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that's not cheap! You're
an Osaka auntie all right!

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.606 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Like you're
one to talk!

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu, you're being rude.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.317 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
[AUNTIE]
Oh, it's totally fine.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.654 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
You're such cute young ladies,
so I'll let it slide.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Yeah? That so?

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
Then how 'bout a discount
for us, auntie?

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:46.911 position:50% align:center
You can help me out
here a little, can't you?

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
She fits right in.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.165 position:50% align:center
[AUNTIE]
Let me think.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.879 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Goodness me!
Hearing that "million yen" gag

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:59.382 position:50% align:center
from an Osaka auntie
sure was somethin' else!

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:02.594 position:50% align:center
Would you please stop
saying stuff in that accent?

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.406 position:50% align:center
Say, I think it's about
time for some lunch.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.575 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu, you've had nothing
but food on your mind

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.660 position:50% align:center
for a while now, don't you
think you've had enough?

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
But we're in Osaka, this is
a food-lover's paradise!

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
You've got even
my jaw on the floor

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:33.667 position:50% align:center
and we're talking about me here.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.210 position:50% align:center
Honestly...

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
Should we just go ahead and find
someplace to eat lunch then?

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
It looks like it's a
little early for that.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
But we are gonna
move on pretty soon.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center
What do you think
we should eat, then?

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.762 position:50% align:center
I believe the choice is obvious.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:49.099 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Uh?

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.559 position:50% align:center
Takoyaki again?

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
When it comes to Osaka...

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
...it has to be takoyaki.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
I'll never get tired
of this flavor!

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.612 position:50% align:center
Took the words
right outta my mouth!

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:07.617 position:50% align:center
I'm with you. I'll never
get tired of eating them!

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.828 position:50% align:center
Hot, hot, hot!

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:13.581 position:50% align:center
Why don't we swallow our food
and then start talking, Mafuyu?

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.625 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Mmm-hmm.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Cool Japan Park Osaka is here.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
It'll take us just under
30 minutes to get there.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised that
it's so close.

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
It is, but we've
never been there,

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:28.346 position:50% align:center
so we should leave
a little earlier.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.472 position:50% align:center
Yes, we should.

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Mm-hm.

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:31.891 position:50% align:center
Really, Mafuyu.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.352 position:50% align:center
Didn't I just remind you not
to talk with your mouth full?

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Okay!

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI sighs]

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
[RIN] We still have a
little time to spare.

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.110 position:50% align:center
Should we wander around?

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:44.529 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Ah, before that,

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
would you mind it if I got
another order of takoyaki first?

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.617 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA giggles]

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:57.625 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hm...

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
I think it's this way.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Um...

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you know
what you're doing, Rin?

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think I'm good.
Let's get going.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.138 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA gasps]

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:12.599 position:50% align:center
Look, it's Osaka Castle!

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Whoa!

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:19.189 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
[CHILD A]
Hey! I'm over here!

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] This must be
the place. Right, Rin?

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.782 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Yup. We made it!

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50% align:center
We've still got a little
time before the doors

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center
are supposed to open.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
[KEIKO]
Hello there, ladies!

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:34.746 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh?

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
There's going to be comedy
show in this hall soon.

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.042 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll join us for it.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
Oh, this is the show
we came here to see.

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
Really, you don't say!
Is this your first comedy show?

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
No, we just caught one yesterday
at the Namba Grand Kagetsu.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.805 position:50% align:center
Wow. Do you like comedy?

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.933 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess you
could say that.

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.184 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Oh!

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:57.769 position:50% align:center
Sorry, what she's trying
to tell you is that

00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50% align:center
we're a pair of comedy duos.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.858 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Plus, we are in Osaka to
relax and get away from Tokyo,

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
but we're here to learn.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center
Actually, we already have
tickets for the show, too.

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.700 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that right?
Well, I appreciate that!

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
We work with another
comedian, and he said,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
"You've got to see the real
thing at least once."

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
Ah, so that's why you
came all the way from Tokyo!

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.458 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Right.

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
I'd better get ready. Hope you
enjoy yourselves, ladies!

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind,
I'd love to hear

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.342 position:50% align:center
your impressions of the show.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:31.219 position:50% align:center
I'm Keiko Matsuura, by the way.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:34.139 position:50% align:center
So, if you've got the time,
could I ask you to wait for me

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.849 position:50% align:center
in the lobby after the show?

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.100 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.977 position:50% align:center
Great, I'll see you all then!

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.562 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Okay!

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center
Miss Keiko Matsuura...

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.902 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Found her.

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
[RIN] What? She won the Osaka
Prix Ballet Competition!

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.367 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Huh?
Then why's she in comedy?

00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] All guests in the
lobby, please make your way

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
back to your seats.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.753 position:50% align:center
The show will begin momentarily.

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
[KEIKO]
Excuse me!

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.427 position:50% align:center
[SHOP OWNER]
Welcome!

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
[KEIKO]
Pork-cutlet curry!

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
Hold on, this is a
ramen shop, you know.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
I was asking if you had
pork-cutlet curry as a topping!

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:21.394 position:50% align:center
You really ought to let
people finish talking

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:23.271 position:50% align:center
before you go pointing
out the obvious.

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
First of all, pork-cutlet
curry isn't a topping.

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you
know what ramen is?

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
[KEIKO] Well, there's
curry udon, isn't there?

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
So, there should be
pork-cutlet curry ramen, too!

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:33.907 position:50% align:center
It just makes sense!

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.325 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it does. I don't get it.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
It's about branching
out these days.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.662 position:50% align:center
You've got to respond to
your customers' needs!

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
Well, you could at least put in
a sushi-go-'round, couldn't you?

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
Uh, no, pretty sure I can't.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
Fine. Then watch.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center
I'll just do the
go-'round part myself.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.298 position:50% align:center
Do the what? Whoa!

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:53.218 position:50% align:center
You're really going 'round!
Why are you so good at that?

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:55.845 position:50% align:center
Never mind that. This is
just a regular ramen shop!

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:56.930 position:50% align:center
Would you quit spinning!

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.348 position:50% align:center
You're so inflexible.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
This isn't 'bout flexibility!
Get outta here!

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
Hey, chef, this broth was great!

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
How about some rice porridge
for the last course?

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
Get out!

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.239 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
The back and forth
was just so funny,

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
and they performed the bits
with a lot of punch, too!

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh And I kept thinking,
"This part is great!"

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.497 position:50% align:center
at so many points!

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.290 position:50% align:center
It even managed to get
a little touching

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:25.625 position:50% align:center
toward the end of the show.

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
It really did! They
were great at striking

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:30.630 position:50% align:center
the balance between
laughter and tears!

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Well, then, should we
go see Ms. Matsuura?

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.092 position:50% align:center
--[MAFUYU] Yeah!
--[FUBUKI] Sure.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Mm-hm!

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
I'm a little bit nervous.

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:42.392 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU laughs]

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center
Oh! Ms. Matsuura!

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:47.147 position:50% align:center
Oh, there you are!

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.898 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Thanks for putting on the show!

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.650 position:50% align:center
[KEIKO]
Thank you for waiting up.

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
So, what did you think?

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
I'd hate to use such
typical words to describe it,

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50% align:center
but the show
was funny! Really!

00:10:58.408 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:02.412 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank goodness!
I'm so glad that you liked it!

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.789 position:50% align:center
I don't really know how to put
this, but what stood out to me

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
were the specialties that you
both brought to the table.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center
You can stop
buttering me up now.

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:10.795 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
I'm not!

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
You know, it doesn't make sense
to stand here and talk,

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
let's sit down.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it,

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
you never told me
your names, did you?

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
Oh, my name is Rin Araya.
And this is my partner.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.559 position:50% align:center
I'm Nayuta Asogi.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:27.812 position:50% align:center
And as far as our comedy
duo name, we go by RDeco.

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:30.648 position:50% align:center
Deco, huh? Right.
That makes sense.

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
Uh. That's not why.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
[KEIKO] Oh, I apologize.
I just assumed.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
Well, if that's the impression
people get from the name,

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
maybe we can turn it
into a bit down the line.

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:42.202 position:50% align:center
Exactly, I thought the same
thing when I heard it.

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center
Come on, keep up
with me would ya?

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:44.579 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Uh?

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:47.582 position:50% align:center
How about you?

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:50.085 position:50% align:center
--[MAFUYU] Oh.
--I'm Fubuki Kitakaze.

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:52.712 position:50% align:center
Uh, and I'm Mafuyu Kogarashi.

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
A-Are those actually
your real names?

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
--Uh-huh.
--Mm-hm.

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.344 position:50% align:center
[KEIKO laughs] I'm guessing you
two probably get this a lot,

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50% align:center
but those are some chilly names.

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.472 position:50% align:center
They totally are, right?

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:05.100 position:50% align:center
Not really the best names
to have if you're comedians.

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:06.643 position:50% align:center
And that's why we
picked "Tokonatsu"

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
as the name of our comedy duo.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50% align:center
Oh, "endless summer"!
You really thought that through.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
Oh, wasn't there something
we wanted to ask her, Rin?

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:15.985 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hm?

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
It's just we were
wondering if you could

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:20.031 position:50% align:center
explain something to us.

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
[KEIKO]
Hm?

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.368 position:50% align:center
You see, we were looking
at your profile earlier,

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
and we saw that you
were a ballet dancer.

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
[KEIKO]
Mm-hm, that's right.

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:29.541 position:50% align:center
If you started out in ballet,
what made you join

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.751 position:50% align:center
Yoshimoto's Shinkigeki troupe?

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
You were shooting
for prima ballerina.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
What? You even know about that?

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do. But only because
I looked into it some more.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:42.012 position:50% align:center
Oh! That still makes me happy.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I'm not trying
to put you on the spot here.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.018 position:50% align:center
[KEIKO laughs]
You really aren't.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center
So, what you're asking for is
the reason why I quit ballet

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.147 position:50% align:center
and joined a comedy troupe.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:58.903 position:50% align:center
I dreamed of being a ballerina
ever since I was a little girl.

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
And the truth is, I was really
close to fulfilling that dream.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
But thanks to my grandma's
influence, I grew up loving all

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
of Yoshimoto's comedy shows
from a pretty early age.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
Whenever I had even
a slightly bad day

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:11.666 position:50% align:center
or was feeling kind of down,

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
I'd just watch one of their
shows and laugh like crazy.

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
It was like the gloominess
vanished right into thin air.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:21.676 position:50% align:center
Maybe it was all because
of times like that.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
And so, that's when I
decided to pursue comedy.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center
Then, I joined the troupe.

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
But it wasn't as
easy as all that.

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:32.062 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh...

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.897 position:50% align:center
Let's just say that I
clawed tooth and nail

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
to where I am today.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:37.233 position:50% align:center
Um, what was the
most important thing

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:38.568 position:50% align:center
you learned in your career?

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
Heh, first off, you have
to make sure to listen

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.698 position:50% align:center
to all kinds of
different people.

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:46.076 position:50% align:center
You can't let them
push you around, though.

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:49.287 position:50% align:center
Still, I think it's important to
accept all sorts of opinions

00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:51.956 position:50% align:center
as you push onward
and do your own thing.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.958 position:50% align:center
Your own thing?

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.128 position:50% align:center
Also, as a performer...

00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:01.341 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Whoa!

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center
It's good to have
signature moves!

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:07.138 position:50% align:center
I see! You added your ballet
skills to your routines!

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:09.391 position:50% align:center
[KEIKO]
Precisely. I think everyone

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:12.602 position:50% align:center
really should have a
genuine forte of their own.

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:14.354 position:50% align:center
Forte?

00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
I mean something that you can
do better than anyone else.

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
Something better
than anyone else...?

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
I hope that we can share
the same stage someday!

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center
If we wanna play a hall like
this one, we'd better make sure

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:32.872 position:50% align:center
we keep on improving
as comedians.

00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Mm-hm.

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:35.375 position:50% align:center
I'd love to perform here.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
Then let's do it someday!

[ALL grunt]

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.131 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Well, we'd better
go swing by the hotel,

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
pick up all of our luggage,
and head out.

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.552 position:50% align:center
Back to Tokyo! Right, girls?

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Right.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:47.929 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:50.265 position:50% align:center
Tomita and Hatsuna's souvenirs!
We didn't buy them yet!

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:52.183 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Ah!

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:55.895 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Should we get them sweets?

00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:58.857 position:50% align:center
We could do that for Hatsuna,
but I'm not 100% sure

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.525 position:50% align:center
that it's something
Tomita would like.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:03.153 position:50% align:center
The guy's an omnivore,
he'd probably eat anything.

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:05.196 position:50% align:center
Rin, you really shouldn't
talk about Tomita

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
like he's some kind of animal.

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:08.324 position:50% align:center
It's true though.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.243 position:50% align:center
He probably would be happy to
eat whatever we got for him.

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:11.786 position:50% align:center
So...

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.371 position:50% align:center
I think this is it!

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Yeah, that oughta do the trick.

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:17.792 position:50% align:center
Aha, you're totally
settling, aren't you?

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.419 position:50% align:center
No, that isn't true at all!

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.004 position:50% align:center
I'm not.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
You know, since we took a few
days off of work maybe we should

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:25.800 position:50% align:center
buy some souvenirs for
everyone at the restaurant.

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.929 position:50% align:center
Then we should get something
for everyone at The Baron, too!

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:31.890 position:50% align:center
After all, they helped
with our show.

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:34.184 position:50% align:center
And they occasionally give
us things on the house.

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.019 position:50% align:center
You said it!

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
Okay, we just have to pick up
our bags at the hotel

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.776 position:50% align:center
and head to Shin-Osaka Station.

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
We still have a
little time, though.

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:47.447 position:50% align:center
Oh! Well, in that case...

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.699 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Not again!

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu...

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.953 position:50% align:center
But we might not be able
to eat takoyaki even close

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:55.872 position:50% align:center
to this delicious once
we're back in Tokyo!

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
She has a point.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.917 position:50% align:center
This is our last chance to!

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
Who knows if we'll ever
come across it again!

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.089 position:50% align:center
And there you go blowing
things out of proportion.

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.590 position:50% align:center
C'mon, let's have takoya--

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:07.217 position:50% align:center
Okay, enough already.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
All right! But don't you pretend

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
like you didn't want
to have some, too, Rin.

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:13.973 position:50% align:center
Let's just go order!

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:16.101 position:50% align:center
Hit the nail on the head!

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Oh! It's them!

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:24.776 position:50% align:center
That's the questionable
comedy duo

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
that we keep seeing
everywhere, Spike!

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
We've bumped into
them so many times,

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:30.031 position:50% align:center
is this the red thread of fate?

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's the red shoelace
of fate that was promised

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.869 position:50% align:center
to us all in some
long-forgotten time.

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
One that goes on
a pair of cleats.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
Because they have spikes.

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I don't think so.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI gasping]

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:44.838 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?!

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center
Fubuki?

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
Hey, Fubuki, hold on!

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
--Pardon.
--[BOTH] Huh?

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
Sorry, do you have a moment?

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, you're the ones we
gave that extra egg to, right?

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
And the ones at Chitose
are fresh, aren't they?

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.772 position:50% align:center
Oh, did you mix it
into your rice?

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
Yes, we did.

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
So, can we help you?

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:06.818 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.779 position:50% align:center
We saw your act at the Namba
Grand Kagetsu theater yesterday.

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:12.157 position:50% align:center
I thought that you two
were really funny.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.033 position:50% align:center
You saw the show?

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
Thanks for saying that!

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:16.453 position:50% align:center
In the interest of
full disclosure,

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
we all do comedy, too.

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, you do?

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
Then why don't we all chat
over some takoyaki?

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
Yeah, while they're
nice and fresh.

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
[MATSUURA] We teamed up when
we were classmates at NSC.

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:35.805 position:50% align:center
I was looking for a partner, and
she was sitting in front of me

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.140 position:50% align:center
in our first class.

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
I think I was the one who
approached you, right?

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
That's right.
It really was as simple as that.

00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:46.066 position:50% align:center
And what made you want to
team up with Ms. Ogawa?

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:48.568 position:50% align:center
Hm. I guess it was
because I felt like

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center
she had this kind of edge
to her, or something.

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
We were just birds of a feather.

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:55.450 position:50% align:center
May I ask how long you two
have been comedy partners?

00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
Around ten years?

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.079 position:50% align:center
Yeah, ten years.
We just keep on going.

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:01.081 position:50% align:center
For sure, like there's no end.

00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:04.084 position:50% align:center
That's quite a long time to be
partners, what's your secret?

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:06.836 position:50% align:center
I'd say it's to make sure that
you talk everything through.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.714 position:50% align:center
If partners can't do that much,
then I don't think they'll last.

00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:11.216 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I think it's really
great to see that more and more

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
young women are starting their
own comedy duos like you four!

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.724 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it really is.

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:22.477 position:50% align:center
There weren't a whole lot of us
out there back in our day.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
No kidding! When we attended NSC

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.981 position:50% align:center
the men outnumbered
the women seven to one!

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:29.025 position:50% align:center
Hang on, isn't this the
perfect chance for us

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:30.610 position:50% align:center
to start the Sorority of Spike?

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:33.363 position:50% align:center
Ooh, like one big faction
of female comedians!

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's the point
of forming that?

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
[OGAWA]
Mmm.

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:38.993 position:50% align:center
So, we can ask for more
bathrooms at Yoshimoto HQ!

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
Or maybe for a bigger dessert
menu in the cafeteria!

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
That's small potatoes!

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
You've gotta start small
when thinking big.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
You swiped that bit
from a comedy legend!

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.504 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center
Hey, we'd better get going now.

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:52.257 position:50% align:center
Guess so.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.425 position:50% align:center
If you have some time,

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.093 position:50% align:center
do you want to come
check out the stage?

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.595 position:50% align:center
Oh, we're heading home tonight.

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
You are? Too bad.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
Since we're based in Tokyo,
too, you should catch a show!

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
[OGAWA]
We'll be waiting!

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:19.451 position:50% align:center
We've gotta do
whatever it takes.

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:20.952 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:22.579 position:50% align:center
And we've also got to make sure
we somehow leave our mark

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
in the New Comedy Kings contest.

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
Sure do.

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Fubuki?

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
Is anything wrong?

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.547 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI grunts]

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.947 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
Hey, you're back safe and sound!

00:19:58.031 --> 00:19:59.407 position:50% align:center
And from the looks
on your faces,

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
you really enjoyed
yourselves there.

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:02.952 position:50% align:center
All thanks to you!

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
I know this isn't much.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
If you know it isn't much,
then get me something better!

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.042 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.960 position:50% align:center
But I was just saying the same
polite thing everyone does!

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
That schtick's
been done to death.

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:15.423 position:50% align:center
If that's how you're talking,
no souvenir for you!

00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
You should start off by
thanking them, Tomita!

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
All right.

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I gratefully take 'em.

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50% align:center
You mean "accept them."

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. When we were
there, we met this duo

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.686 position:50% align:center
from NSC's fourteenth
graduating class called Spike--

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?!

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
You actually ran into
Matsuura and Ogawa there?

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
That's just terrifying!
And you talked to them?

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:36.319 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Yeah...

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:38.238 position:50% align:center
And you didn't get
turned into stone?

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
Who are they, Medusa?

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
No, they're something
even scarier than that.

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
That sure paints a questionable
picture. That is scary.

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA]
Thanks for the souvenirs.

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:51.918 position:50% align:center
It was nothing.

00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:54.129 position:50% align:center
I'm really glad we made
the trip to Osaka.

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:56.464 position:50% align:center
By the way, Tomita and I
are planning to perform

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50% align:center
at an event with a bunch
of our comedian friends,

00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:01.344 position:50% align:center
and it'll be over at Mini Hall
Pu. If you're okay with it,

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center
why don't RDeco and
Tokonatsu join us?

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center
What? Is that okay?

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:08.643 position:50% align:center
We've already got
another live show?

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:10.270 position:50% align:center
You can count us
in for that, too!

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:12.856 position:50% align:center
Right? It sounds like fun!

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:21:19.654 --> 00:21:21.614 position:50% align:center
Hey, I've been playing around
a little bit with some

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
new material, and I'm gonna
email it to you later, okay?

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:26.619 position:50% align:center
Why don't we rehearse it and
get it good enough to debut

00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:29.080 position:50% align:center
at that event Hatsuna
was just telling us about?

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
You know, it never crossed my
mind that Spike and Freak might

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
know each other,
never mind have a history.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:37.339 position:50% align:center
The four of them did come
out of NSC, after all.

00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:39.591 position:50% align:center
Oh, makes sense!

00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
Osaka sure was fun, wasn't it?

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.846 position:50% align:center
Our time there really was
a thrill ride--start to finish!

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
It was.

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:54.606 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kana, what do you want
to do for dinner tonight?

00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:56.691 position:50% align:center
Wait, hang on. I thought
Fuyu was cooking,

00:21:56.775 --> 00:21:58.985 position:50% align:center
she texted she'd be
showing off her skills.

00:21:59.069 --> 00:21:59.986 position:50% align:center
That's what I thought.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.237 position:50% align:center
Natsu?

00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:02.822 position:50% align:center
Ever since she got
back from Osaka,

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:04.866 position:50% align:center
we've been having
takoyaki every night.

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
Yeah? That's fine.
I really like eating takoyaki!

00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:11.498 position:50% align:center
I like it, too, but we've been
having it night after night!

00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:14.167 position:50% align:center
She told me that she ate some
really good takoyaki in Osaka,

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.752 position:50% align:center
and it's been
nonstop ever since.

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:18.672 position:50% align:center
She does change up the flavor by
doing curry or pizza versions,

00:22:18.755 --> 00:22:21.007 position:50% align:center
but takoyaki's still takoyaki!

00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:23.385 position:50% align:center
Really? That sounds delicious.

00:22:23.468 --> 00:22:26.012 position:50% align:center
Great! Then tonight,
I'm leaving it all to you!

00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:29.265 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, you're
leaving what all to me?

00:24:15.622 --> 00:24:17.415 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI, ERU]
What's next on Maesetsu?

00:24:17.499 --> 00:24:18.249 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU, KANAE]
"Partners"!

00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:19.751 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Don't miss it!
