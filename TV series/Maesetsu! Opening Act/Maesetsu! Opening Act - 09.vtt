00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] You turtles sure know
how to take it easy.

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:24.983 position:50% align:center
And I'm the same way.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
Because I'm a turtle, too.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.195 position:50% align:center
My favorite parts?

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.448 position:50% align:center
I'd definitely have to say it's
the emotional encounters!

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.991 position:50% align:center
Emotional?

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:35.994 position:50% align:center
Ah, well it's when something
stirs up deep feelings within

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
you and moves your heart
in a very powerful way.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.622 position:50% align:center
I wasn't asking you
for the definition!

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
I know what it means!

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
I just wanted you
to be more specific!

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:45.378 position:50% align:center
Well, for instance, that moment
when those two realized

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.505 position:50% align:center
they loved each other,
but then were cruelly driven

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.175 position:50% align:center
apart by inevitable
circumstances.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:51.926 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Mmm.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.721 position:50% align:center
Then a few years later, the
woman's in some bookstore

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:56.514 position:50% align:center
and reaching up for
a reference guide.

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.308 position:50% align:center
She brushes against a hand.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.226 position:50% align:center
And it's him,
the man that she loved!

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.479 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Oh! Yeah,
that is a nice moment.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.480 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Then it goes like this:

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.731 position:50% align:center
"Did you want this book,
as well?

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:06.066 position:50% align:center
'A Guide to Personal
Bankruptcy'?"

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.776 position:50% align:center
They're not really clicking
out there, are they?

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:08.985 position:50% align:center
No, they're not.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.904 position:50% align:center
But it'll work out!
Their shared struggle

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.740 position:50% align:center
of personal bankruptcy
deepens their love!

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:16.284 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Something's wrong.
My setups are off.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:18.995 position:50% align:center
What do finances have
to do with romance?!

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.040 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] My comebacks aren't
landing at all today.

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:23.792 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] I think this would
make more sense in, say,

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.460 position:50% align:center
a sport manga.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.215 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Right. So, I've been thinking.

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:31.883 position:50% align:center
Relationships are a game.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.134 position:50% align:center
Oh, are they?

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:36.304 position:50% align:center
That's right.
Get this AEIOUs of attraction.

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:37.764 position:50% align:center
Never heard of it.

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.475 position:50% align:center
These five simple phrases
will really make men happy.

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:43.436 position:50% align:center
Think about this for a
second. First up: "A."

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.147 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] Hmm...
"Apply some deodorant, please."

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:47.649 position:50% align:center
No, that isn't even close.

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:49.776 position:50% align:center
What guy would be happy to
hear that he needs deodorant?

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.653 position:50% align:center
One so used to his own
BO he can't smell it.

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:52.821 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he can!

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.740 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] Oh, I know!
A is for "Amazing!"

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.075 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Yes, you got it!

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:58.284 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
I see where this is going.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:00.120 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Try using it in a sentence.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.997 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] That's amazing!
Now go apply some deodorant.

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.125 position:50% align:center
Enough with the deodorant talk!

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.043 position:50% align:center
Next is "E."

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.503 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
E is for "Extraordinary!"

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.088 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Wow, first try!

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:11.548 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] You think that top
matches those pants...

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:15.176 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's up? Are you not
feeling well or something?

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50% align:center
I'm fine, it's nothing like
that. But I was thinking.

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.223 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
What is it?

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.308 position:50% align:center
It feels like we're not
getting anywhere.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:24.811 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, we'll nail
it at next show!

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:26.604 position:50% align:center
It would be nice if we could.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:27.814 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:29.899 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Nothing.
Don't worry about it.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.193 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Do you wanna stop by
The Baron after?

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:35.697 position:50% align:center
I'll just head home.
I'm pretty exhausted.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.198 position:50% align:center
You are?

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:38.575 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center
[KEIKO] I think everyone
really should have

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.881 position:50% align:center
a genuine forte of their own.

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
Forte?

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50% align:center
I mean something that you can
do better than anyone else.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Something better
than anyone else...

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
I really am a turtle, aren't I?

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hey, where's Fubuki?

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.522 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
I invited her.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.524 position:50% align:center
But she wanted to go home
right after the show,

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
said she was feeling too tired.

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Oh...

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] All of my comebacks
were so sluggish today,

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
everything fell flat.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.075 position:50% align:center
Do you think she went home
because she's mad at me?

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.244 position:50% align:center
No way, Fubuki isn't
like that at all.

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:47.370 position:50% align:center
I agree, Rin.

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center
She doesn't have a
temper like you do.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?
I don't get angry!

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.209 position:50% align:center
Except for the times you do.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hey!

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA laughs]

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Honestly, though.

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
We've been rehearsing a lot,
but even with all that work,

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
something just isn't meshing.

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
They're not really clickin'
out there, are they?

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.265 position:50% align:center
No, they're not.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
What do you think
the problem is?

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.603 position:50% align:center
When it comes right
down to it, it's me.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.104 position:50% align:center
Why do you say that?

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
Because... during
that last show,

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50% align:center
I didn't have snappy comebacks
for the setups she made.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
That was great!
I'm so happy we went to Osaka!

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.989 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I can't say
that I disagree.

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.492 position:50% align:center
There was all that
hustle and bustle!

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center
Definitely.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
Fubuki?

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
Oh, I mean, it's just there were
so many amazing things there.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
I'm still a bit overwhelmed.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50% align:center
I get that.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.170 position:50% align:center
We're going to have to
work even harder now.

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:38.421 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Yeah!

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:43.093 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mafuyu, what would you
say our comedic style is?

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.844 position:50% align:center
Huh? Where'd that come from?

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking,

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:48.306 position:50% align:center
there are lots of different
styles out there, right?

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.016 position:50% align:center
Of course, there's the
simple back-and-forth

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
of setup-punchline--

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
But sometimes both performers
play the comic role.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:54.771 position:50% align:center
Like there's no straight-man,

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
instead you get punchlines
from both sides.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
Then there was that rapid-fire
style we saw in the show.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center
I remember Rin said that act
could teach her a thing or two

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.822 position:50% align:center
about fast-paced comedy.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU grunts]

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
I know I learned a lot
from everything we saw.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] At the time, I didn't
think very much of it.

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
I thought that Fubuki was
just making conversation.

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:14.916 position:50% align:center
But now when I look back,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
there was something deeper
she was trying to tell me.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50% align:center
Maybe what she was saying

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
is that I'm not good enough
of a straight-man

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
to be her partner anymore!

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
What if the worst thing happens?

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
I'm outta here!
I just can't with you anymore!

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50% align:center
Ah! What am I gonna
do without her?

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.600 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
I'm a total turtle.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.895 position:50% align:center
Total turtle turns
tenacity to trouble.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
Good one, now let's see you
try to say that five times fast.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on. That's hardly
a tongue-twister!

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
That wasn't good.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.700 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
So, what do you two think?

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:49.868 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA]
Hmm...

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a slump.

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
Believe me when say it
happens to every team

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
some time or another.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center
I mean, the two of us even came
close to splitting up one time.

00:06:58.043 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
Huh? We did?

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
What? No way!
You brought it up, you said,

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
"I think I'm done with you."

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.551 position:50% align:center
Come on, I'd be too
embarrassed to use some

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:08.345 position:50% align:center
cheesy farewell
cliche like that.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50% align:center
And when I heard
your harsh words,

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.473 position:50% align:center
lemme tell you,
I was super shocked!

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
I can't believe the instigator's
claiming ignorance.

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
That's an even bigger shock.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.103 position:50% align:center
So, about the other two.
Will they be okay?

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.480 position:50% align:center
She ignores me!

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:21.399 position:50% align:center
I mean... Mafuyu and Fubuki
are such close friends,

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:24.361 position:50% align:center
I don't think it's likely the
team will actually split up.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.030 position:50% align:center
Yes, but if you set their
friendship aside from all this.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] What?
Doesn't it count for something?

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.826 position:50% align:center
It does, but slumps
are tricky to navigate.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:32.952 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
Heh.

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
It appears the time
has come at last!

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.915 position:50% align:center
All brave explorers
must tread this path

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
on their way to greatness.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:41.336 position:50% align:center
This thorny path that pricks and
scratches the weary travelers

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:42.629 position:50% align:center
as they trudge by.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:45.382 position:50% align:center
Until they cry in pain,
"It hurts! Yow!

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.258 position:50% align:center
I got all these thorns
poking into me!"

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:49.386 position:50% align:center
I did notice the two
of them seemed a bit

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
off at the last show.
Did you feel it?

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Mm-hm.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
After watching all that comedy
at the NGK, I'm willing to bet

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
that it started getting the
wheels turning in their heads.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.231 position:50% align:center
Like thinking about what
they could improve on.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.858 position:50% align:center
I remember this one time, I was
watching a more seasoned duo

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
perform and their
act was so snappy.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:09.072 position:50% align:center
Their on-stage chemistry was
amazing--but at the same time,

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.907 position:50% align:center
it also bummed me out a little.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.492 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA] Like, "Will we ever
be able to reach that level?"

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Mm.

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.790 position:50% align:center
But I realized just being bummed
out wouldn't make us better.

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
You know?
Have you two felt that way?

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
Yeah, for sure. There have
been times when it

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.172 position:50% align:center
really stung to see how short
we fell compared to others.

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:27.757 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center
But we just need to move forward
and keep working hard--together.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
Nicely put.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:36.516 position:50% align:center
And maybe that's what those
two need to be reminded of.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
That's right! They'll have to
find their own unique keys

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
to unlock the gates
to the next level!

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
First, they'll need to
summon an ancient hero

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
to take care of those demons--

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
Okay, we are done with this.
Shush, please.

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.614 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
Aw!

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
I admit, I'm pretty concerned

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
about both of them.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me too.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
I've never seen Mafuyu so
down in the dumps before.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
It wasn't like her.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
True, but on the other hand,

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
I think I'm actually more
worried about Fubuki.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess this just goes to
show that they aren't immune

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.551 position:50% align:center
to falling into slumps, either.

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU grunts]

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center
Hi! I'm Mafuyu Kogarashi!

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:30.987 position:50% align:center
I'm Fubuki Kitakaze!

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.238 position:50% align:center
And together...

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:33.740 position:50% align:center
...the two of us are...

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
...Tokonatsu!

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wow, you seem sleepy,
Fubuki, what's up?

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
How could you tell?

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
It's your eyes, they
make you look tired.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.376 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they look like
two tiny hacksaws.

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
Well of course they do, because
they are two tiny hacksaws.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.257 position:50% align:center
Who needs hand tools this small?

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Way to "hammer"
in the punchline.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.594 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Anyway, I think
you're exaggerating.

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.137 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
How so?

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
These right here are
my sleepy eyes.

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:03.603 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] And these
are hacksaw eyes, see?

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:04.938 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
They're the same!

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
Why so sleepy, anyway?

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:10.151 position:50% align:center
Ahh, not good. The audience
isn't reacting at all.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:14.114 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI sighs]
It's just not resonating.

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:17.117 position:50% align:center
It doesn't click.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50% align:center
They're not laughing.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.996 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
This is all...

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.333 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
...my fault.

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:27.252 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Mafuyu.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
Fubuki.

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] I'm sorry,
I've been holding you back.

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
This looks serious.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.227 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Uh-huh.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
When things go downhill, you've
gotta do all you can to stop it.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Yeah.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:50.942 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.656 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.743 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
So?

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:02.162 position:50% align:center
It's just I keep coming
back to one thing.

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
I think our problems
are all my fault.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:08.001 position:50% align:center
Remember when we went to
the Namba Grand Kagetsu?

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:10.754 position:50% align:center
After watching all those
performances, I realized:

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
whoever's responsible
for the punchline

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
is responsible for the act.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
So, you're saying comedy hinges

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.971 position:50% align:center
on the comic partner?

00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Yes, at least
in Tokonatsu's case.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.601 position:50% align:center
I just can't shake the feeling
that my inadequacy

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
is the real reason
we've been struggling.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
If that's the case, then
I guess Rin must be pulling

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
way more weight than me.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean it like that!
You're both amazing!

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50% align:center
Uhh... Sorry about that.

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.991 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.161 position:50% align:center
You can say whatever's
on your mind.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
I'm here,
if you want to talk.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
That's why I chased you down.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.209 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Uhh...

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
To be honest with you,
I've sensed that things

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:53.421 position:50% align:center
between you two have
been off for a while.

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:56.925 position:50% align:center
Both Rin and I, we've been
worried about you two.

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
You've been worried?

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.345 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] There's no need
to apologize, truly.

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
You can just talk to me.

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu has always been really
passionate about comedy,

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
and she's the one who
pulled me along into it,

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
it was all her idea
to start this team.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.194 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Mm-hm.

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:18.780 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] She's serious about
building a real career in comedy

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
and dedicating her life to it,

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:23.326 position:50% align:center
and I really believe
she can do it, too.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
But recently, I've just been
wishy-washy about things,

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
and it sort of feels like I
might be holding her back.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
That's pretty much what's
been on my mind.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:37.674 position:50% align:center
During our last performance,
my setups went over so badly.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
And I think that's why

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
we couldn't get the
audience to laugh at all.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.099 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I wonder...

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.101 position:50% align:center
...if maybe there's
another partner out there

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.728 position:50% align:center
who's a better match than me,

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.980 position:50% align:center
who can really help bring
out Mafuyu's humor.

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50% align:center
Someone who can help
her reach her full potential.

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:58.069 position:50% align:center
If that's the way
you're talking...

00:12:58.153 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
Does that mean it's over?

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:02.198 position:50% align:center
The only thing I know for
sure is I'm totally hopeless!

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who's always
dropping the ball on stage.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
All of this is my fault.

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.459 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] Our new material
feels pretty fresh!

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
It was a good idea to mix it up
and give you the punchlines.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:16.713 position:50% align:center
Totally.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
And since we're trying it live
for the first time today,

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:21.468 position:50% align:center
we need to pay attention to
which parts get the most laughs.

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
[ASSISTANT DIRECTOR]
JK Cool?

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center
You're up next!

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
[RIN] So basically,
they've both completely

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:34.272 position:50% align:center
lost their self-confidence.

00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:36.358 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
That's how it seems.

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
I wonder what we can do.

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] And never mind Fubuki,
it's really cause for concern

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
if things are making
Mafuyu feel down.

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
You said it.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
And Mafuyu probably
thinks it's all her fault

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:49.037 position:50% align:center
that Fubuki's feeling
so depressed lately.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.413 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Uh-huh.

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
[RIN] By the way, I've been
thinking for a while.

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
You know, something's
been bothering me lately.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.254 position:50% align:center
Yeah sure, what is it?

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.382 position:50% align:center
Any time you go to a bank
there's an ATM, right?

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.094 position:50% align:center
Fundamentally speaking it's just
a huge box with money in it.

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.637 position:50% align:center
Hmm, there's a little
more to it than that.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Fine, fine.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.181 position:50% align:center
But as I was saying,
when you put in your card,

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.016 position:50% align:center
a picture of a woman
comes up on the screen.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.518 position:50% align:center
[ERU]
Of course--the virtual teller.

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.019 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:14.938 position:50% align:center
Have you ever noticed her
expression changes sometimes?

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
It's subtle.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.023 position:50% align:center
--Whoa, seriously?
--Yep.

00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:18.233 position:50% align:center
When you type in the wrong PIN

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:19.943 position:50% align:center
or don't have enough
in your account,

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:22.028 position:50% align:center
she furrows her brow and
the corners of her mouth

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
turn down just like this.

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
Oh, c'mon, there's
no way! No, no, no!

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:26.991 position:50% align:center
--[ARASHI] No, it's true!
--[RIN] Huh?

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:28.535 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Uh? What is it, Rin?

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.787 position:50% align:center
Nayuta! Get to a TV!

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.163 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
What, right now?

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:33.665 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
[ERU] It's so subtle, I never
even noticed it myself.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.003 position:50% align:center
I think I just got an idea!

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:40.547 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU, FUBUKI]
A team shuffle?

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.174 position:50% align:center
That's right. Well,
do you wanna give it a try?

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:44.551 position:50% align:center
Where'd that come from?

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
I see comedians do it on
variety shows all the time!

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
And I've always wanted
to try it out myself.

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
I think that the
change could be fun!

00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:54.936 position:50% align:center
Okay, sounds good.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center
Uh! If Fubuki's in,
then I am, too.

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
Okay, cool! How 'bout
I partner up with you,

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
and Nayuta can
partner up with Fubuki?

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
That sounds perfect!

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:05.822 position:50% align:center
I'm willing to try it.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:06.948 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center
I'll take on the
straight-man role

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:09.951 position:50% align:center
and Mafuyu will be the comic.

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:11.077 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:12.996 position:50% align:center
And I'll take on
the comic role--

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
Fubuki, you'll be the
straight man. Okay?

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:15.790 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:17.125 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
All right, should we jump in?

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:20.003 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Yes, this is gonna be fun!

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:23.465 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Um. I fell back asleep twice

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:26.343 position:50% align:center
this morning--and before I knew
it, it was already lunchtime.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
But after eating some
lunch I found myself

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.221 position:50% align:center
getting sleepy again,
so I took a little nap.

00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:33.475 position:50% align:center
So, all in all I slept about
20 hours yesterday. A-yup!

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
What are you, a koala?

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Uh.

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.730 position:50% align:center
That was amazing! [laughs]

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:40.857 position:50% align:center
What? Did you really
think that was funny?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.233 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Oh, yeah,
that was hilarious!

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center
Ooh, my stomach hurts!

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:46.404 position:50% align:center
Yeah? If it's got you
laughing that much,

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:47.989 position:50% align:center
I feel kinda good about it.

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:49.699 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
You know, Mafuyu,

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:51.034 position:50% align:center
now that I've seen
you try it out,

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
I'm actually thinking
you might be a better fit

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.246 position:50% align:center
for the comic role, since you're
naturally a total goofball.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
Huh? [exhales]

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
Do you really think that I am?

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.461 position:50% align:center
Yeah, definitely.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:03.880 position:50% align:center
How'd you end up as Tokonatsu's
straight man in the first place?

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
Huh? Uhh, to be honest,
I don't know!

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:07.884 position:50% align:center
There wasn't a reason?

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.303 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:11.638 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
And in the end,

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:14.057 position:50% align:center
I wound up making the
whole thing way too salty.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.017 position:50% align:center
So, I added water to dilute it.

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
But all that water made it taste
bland again, so I added

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
soy sauce, but that wasn't right
either, it tasted quite odd.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center
One shake of pepper later and
the whole dish got away from me.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
Somebody help me!
Rescue this food!

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.239 position:50% align:center
Fweet!

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
A thoroughly ruined failure
of a dish like this

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
can only be turned into curry!

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
That was it!

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
Huh? Uh-- What do you mean?

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
That gently-worded
yet harsh comeback.

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
The line "a thoroughly ruined

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
failure of a dish"
is just hilarious!

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:45.213 position:50% align:center
You know, you're really good
at those snappy retorts.

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:46.548 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] I actually think
the straight-man role

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.384 position:50% align:center
suits you better.

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:50.635 position:50% align:center
And what's more,

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:52.470 position:50% align:center
given that Mafuyu's such
a natural class clown,

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:54.597 position:50% align:center
I think you'll do
even better with her.

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:56.099 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Uh?

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:58.101 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] Fubuki, why is it that
Mafuyu is the straight man

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
and you're the comic?

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
Well, we talked about it way
back when Mafuyu first asked me

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.109 position:50% align:center
to do comedy with her.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
Well, then? Which one?

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.112 position:50% align:center
Which one for what?

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
Straight-man or comic?

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
At the time, I thought the
straight-man was the tougher

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:17.370 position:50% align:center
role, and I was worried
I wouldn't do well in it.

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:18.747 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll be the comic.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.916 position:50% align:center
Okay! Then I'll be
the straight-man.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
There were all sorts of things

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:26.254 position:50% align:center
that I was totally clueless
about back then.

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
It's kind of embarrassing,
but we picked our roles

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
from the very beginning
without any rhyme or reason,

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
without even thinking about
who would be better where.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.681 position:50% align:center
It was kind of a careless way
to start off our comedy team,

00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:39.642 position:50% align:center
especially compared to
you and Rin, wasn't it?

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.144 position:50% align:center
Maybe so.

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
But those comebacks
I heard today...

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center
They may not be the same
as Rin's rapid-fire style,

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:47.525 position:50% align:center
but they're funny.

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center
I think that we just might have
discovered your specialty.

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI gasps]

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
Those gentle, scathing
comebacks of yours are so good.

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:54.824 position:50% align:center
Why don't you try them

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
with Mafuyu?

00:17:58.078 --> 00:17:59.829 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Remember what you said earlier?

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
About how you were worried you
might be holding Mafuyu back?

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50% align:center
Apparently, she told
Rin the same thing,

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
except that it was her
holding you back.

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:09.089 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] I think the two
of you should talk it out.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.929 position:50% align:center
You know, there was a point
when I was going through

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
something similar.

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
Rin asked me to enroll
at NSC with her,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
but I was really
unsure of myself.

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:24.354 position:50% align:center
I ended up not going.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:25.772 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
One reason is at the time
I hadn't decided if I was

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:29.984 position:50% align:center
all that serious about comedy.

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:31.695 position:50% align:center
And as for the other reason...

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:33.988 position:50% align:center
I didn't think that I
shared Rin's talent.

00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
Which is why I can understand
your feelings right now.

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:38.618 position:50% align:center
I've had them.

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:41.454 position:50% align:center
People like Rin and Mafuyu,
they're natural comedians,

00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
it's just part of
their personality.

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
The thing is,

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:48.086 position:50% align:center
a comedy team should consist
of two different people.

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
And what does it even mean
to be talented, anyway?

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:51.756 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.925 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] Later, when I finally
decided I was ready

00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
to team up with Rin again,

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.054 position:50% align:center
I needed to bring
something to the table,

00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
something I could
do better than her.

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:01.766 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Did you find it?

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
It wasn't easy, but yes,

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.395 position:50% align:center
I did find one thing
that I was better at.

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
That's great, what was it?

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center
Putting in effort.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.775 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:12.527 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] Rin is such
a talented performer,

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center
I realized she probably
didn't have to try too hard.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:18.033 position:50% align:center
So, I told myself I would make
more of an effort than she does

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
in order to keep up.

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:22.579 position:50% align:center
Of course, even with her talent,
she still does work hard.

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
So, keeping up is pretty
difficult to say the least.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.918 position:50% align:center
But even if it is, I'm
determined to work harder.

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:30.378 position:50% align:center
What I'm trying to say is--

00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:32.756 position:50% align:center
Yes! I think I
understand it now!

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.716 position:50% align:center
If I put in the effort,
I'll catch up!

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
I'll have to, after all, she
can be such a lazybones!

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
--True enough.
--[phone ringing]

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Okay, same here.
See you soon.

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
Shall we go back?
In every sense.

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
I'd say it's to make sure that
you talk everything through.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.155 position:50% align:center
If partners can't do that much,

00:19:57.238 --> 00:19:59.240 position:50% align:center
then I don't think
that they'll last.

00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:01.701 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
They were absolutely right.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:07.374 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
So, I'll be the comic.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.339 position:50% align:center
And I'll be the straight man.

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU grunts]

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
All right! It's gonna be a
whole new era of Tokonatsu!

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.806 position:50% align:center
And no more of that "The Gift
of the Magi" business, okay?

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:24.849 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Huh? The gift of the what?

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
It's a short story. It's very
famous, you don't know it?

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
In the story, a loving husband
and wife try to pick out

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
the perfect gift for one
another on Christmas Eve.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
Since they don't have much
money, the wife sells her hair

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:40.365 position:50% align:center
to buy her husband a chain for
his beloved gold pocket watch.

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:43.326 position:50% align:center
But unbeknownst to her, the
husband sells his pocket watch

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
to buy his wife a set of
beautiful combs for her

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:48.498 position:50% align:center
luxurious hair, which
she had just cut off.

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
That's such a beautiful story!

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
But what's it got to do
with me and Fubuki?

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:56.256 position:50% align:center
Well, I didn't mean
the plot exactly.

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:58.299 position:50% align:center
I meant the whole thinking-
about-the-other-person

00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
part more. That part totally
reminds me of you two.

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're right.

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center
We really gotta thank you
for helping us both today.

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:07.267 position:50% align:center
Yes, we do.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
Thank you both so, so much.

00:21:09.352 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
It's just... Why put in
all that effort?

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.481 position:50% align:center
It was for Tokonatsu.

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
I mean, heck you're our
favorite rivals after all.

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
Rin's right.

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
I don't know what we'd ever
do without team Tokonatsu!

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:24.743 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
That's perfect!

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:26.327 position:50% align:center
And I'll say something like,
"Does she have a few screws

00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:28.913 position:50% align:center
loose, or what?" That should
set you up for the comeback.

00:21:28.997 --> 00:21:30.331 position:50% align:center
What's that all about?

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:32.876 position:50% align:center
Well, in any case, that's where
I'll flash a huge smile

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:35.545 position:50% align:center
and then respond with a
devastatingly biting remark.

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:37.297 position:50% align:center
Heh! That's perfect.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:43.219 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Well, I'm glad that's settled.

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:44.804 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Uh-huh.

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:46.514 position:50% align:center
[RIN] Even though we wound up
having to offer a huge helping

00:21:46.598 --> 00:21:49.059 position:50% align:center
hand to people who are
basically the competition.

00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:50.894 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA] True enough.
And to be honest with you,

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:53.688 position:50% align:center
Fubuki's comebacks were
really impressive today.

00:21:53.772 --> 00:21:55.273 position:50% align:center
So were Mafuyu's setups.

00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:57.734 position:50% align:center
She's just so naturally goofy
that there's no imitating it,

00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:59.569 position:50% align:center
even if you tried.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.738 position:50% align:center
We can't fall behind then.

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:04.324 position:50% align:center
All right! You wanna practice
some new material?

00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:07.160 position:50% align:center
Mm. Why not?
But we have class early.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:10.288 position:50% align:center
The homework is due.
Did you finish it?

00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:11.873 position:50% align:center
Don't ask.

00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:48.970 position:50% align:center
[HATSUNA]
So, they got out of their slump?

00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:49.804 position:50% align:center
Sure did!

00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:51.306 position:50% align:center
That's great to hear.

00:23:51.389 --> 00:23:52.640 position:50% align:center
It sounds like our brave heroes

00:23:52.724 --> 00:23:54.809 position:50% align:center
have finally made it
to the next stage.

00:23:54.893 --> 00:23:55.727 position:50% align:center
Don't look at them.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.104 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:23:59.147 --> 00:24:00.690 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:24:00.774 --> 00:24:01.816 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi there.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.942 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Giving things your all?

00:24:03.026 --> 00:24:04.944 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Of course, sis, more or less.

00:24:05.028 --> 00:24:06.321 position:50% align:center
Is that Hajime?

00:24:06.404 --> 00:24:08.239 position:50% align:center
Tell her I said hi!

00:24:08.323 --> 00:24:10.075 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I was calling to ask--

00:24:10.158 --> 00:24:12.869 position:50% align:center
want to put on another
show at the hot spring?

00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:14.996 position:50% align:center
We would love to!

00:24:15.914 --> 00:24:17.123 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
What's next on Maesetsu?

00:24:17.207 --> 00:24:19.459 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
"Prayers"! Don't miss it!
