[MAFUYU] I wish...
I was in front of that mic.

[MAFUYU] I want to make
everyone laugh, too!

[EMCEE A] Well, folks,
things are slowly heating up

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.815 position:50% align:center
here on the main stage!

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.444 position:50% align:center
Your patience has been
abbre-- a, a- ppreciated.

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:13.114 position:50% align:center
[EMCEE B] Moving on.
We have guests as our next act.

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:16.284 position:50% align:center
They're two comedy duos who
are also Shoka-Yono alums.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:19.454 position:50% align:center
Tokonatsu and RDeco are here!

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:20.497 position:50% align:center

Encore!

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center
Okay. Then how about this?

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.282 position:50% align:center
I'd like to do a fun
impression for you all!

This is Konata Izumi
doing her Shin-chan,

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50% align:center

[exhales]

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:22.762 position:50% align:center
They liked our airband,

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center
but they didn't like
my impression.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
I don't know how to feel.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.310 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't say I recall
that routine of yours

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
ever landing with a crowd.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
Ah... Fubuki, now you're
rubbing salt in the wound!

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
Out of all the bits you could've
done, you chose that one?

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.489 position:50% align:center
Oh, it was just the sudden shift

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
from a girls' air band
to that impression.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
I kind of get the sense
that it was quite a shock

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
to the audience.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
[whines]

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center
Still, I thought we'd
be doing comedy,

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
not something like this.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.044 position:50% align:center
I certainly never
expected us to be here

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
performing in an air band.
We're comedians after all.

[MAFUYU whines]

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
Hey, sis! Hi, girls!

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
Hey there, Fuyu!

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's Manatsu and Kanae!

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.223 position:50% align:center
Manatsu!

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
H-Huh? Wha... What?

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50% align:center
Manatsu! This whole
thing is your fault!

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:18.651 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] And then I'll react
here before you're done talking.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Mm. Great.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
And then that's when I'll
pile on with another gag.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
I wonder if it would be better
to put a little pause in there.

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
How was that timing?

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.292 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Nope! Too long.

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:35.168 position:50% align:center
--Okay.
--[phone rings]

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[phone rings]

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
Your phone's ringing.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.300 position:50% align:center
It's Manatsu.

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
Hey there, sis,
is something up?

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.220 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
I need some help, Sis!

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
Can Tokonatsu do
me a huge favor?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.556 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU] You two graduated
from Shoka-Yono,

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.102 position:50% align:center
so you probably
know this already

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.689 position:50% align:center
but our school's culture
festival is starting today.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.607 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. It is
that time of year.

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, it sure is.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center
So? What's up?

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
The thing is...

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.905 position:50% align:center
I'm the stage manager,
and some performers

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
in today's afternoon act just
got rushed to the hospital!

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center
I'm going crazy right now
trying to find someone

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:10.995 position:50% align:center
to fill their spot!

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.205 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Uh, wha...?

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be the afternoon
in like no time!

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:18.003 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] But you know, this
could be the perfect chance...

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
...to try out that
new act of ours.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.507 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Mm.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.675 position:50% align:center
We'll do it!

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:26.511 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
You will? The only thing is--

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
We've gotta call Rin and Nayuta!

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
And since you needed some
help to fill in the time

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
you decided to recruit
the two of us

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
and got us mixed up in all this.

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:39.274 position:50% align:center
Don't say it like it
was my fault!

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.026 position:50% align:center
Manatsu's the one
who made me do it!

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
That isn't true at all!

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
I was trying to explain the
whole situation to you,

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
but you hung up on me
before I could

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:47.282 position:50% align:center
tell you everything!

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.659 position:50% align:center
Man, you totally jumped
the gun, didn't you?

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50% align:center
Come on, girls, why don't we
all just settle down a bit.

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
Whatever the case may be,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.292 position:50% align:center
I still thought it was
super fun. Didn't you?

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS cheering]

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:05.675 position:50% align:center
[EMCEE A] Okay, folks, your
patience is appreciated!

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
[EMCEE B] This next duo won the
last high-school comedy contest

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:10.972 position:50% align:center
and have been the
hottest guests on TV.

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:14.309 position:50% align:center
Please welcome the pride of
Shoka-Yono High...

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center
JK Cool: Eru Kusaba
and Arashi Waraino!

[STUDENTS cheering]

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
Winners of the high-school
comedy contest, huh?

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:33.203 position:50% align:center
I hear that they're signed
with Yoshimoto Kogyo now.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:36.331 position:50% align:center
What? Even though both those
girls are still in high school?

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
They are rising new stars.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
They were featured in all
sorts of magazines recently.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:44.047 position:50% align:center
[whines] I guess we
should've just stuck

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.840 position:50% align:center
with the air band after all.

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:49.344 position:50% align:center
Here we go. Mafuyu's
running her mouth again.

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center
Uhh, Mafuyu what
were you saying?

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] 'Cause we'll get
compared to them.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:53.973 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50% align:center
Our gags, punchlines, tempo.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
If their comedy
outshines ours,

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna feel even
more down. Oh!

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50% align:center
Hey, should we go up on stage
again with that air band thing?

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:07.070 position:50% align:center
Honestly, Mafuyu.
Forget feeling down!

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
You're practically
subterranean with negativity!

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
But you know, the four of you
really saved us today,

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.495 position:50% align:center
and that's the truth.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.997 position:50% align:center
So once again, from the
bottom of our hearts...

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] Thank you so
much for your help!

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.167 position:50% align:center
The next time you're here,

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
it'll be as the comedy duos
Tokonatsu and RDeco.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:28.717 position:50% align:center
We'll be sure to give
you a proper invite!

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Mm!

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.811 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU groans]
The air band killed,

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center
and my bit bombed. This sucks.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.399 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
You're still on that?

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:46.109 position:50% align:center
Changing the mood
with a one-off gag

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
is a hard thing to do--
that isn't surprising.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
You have to set it up
better than that.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center
Exactly. Just think about
how the crowd was earlier;

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:56.536 position:50% align:center
we had them all pumped up
with that air band act of ours.

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:59.539 position:50% align:center
hen you went and shoved that
gag in from out of nowhere.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center
Read the atmosphere.

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50% align:center
It wasn't a light read. [laughs]

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50% align:center
I think that the audience
didn't really know how

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
to react to that sudden
shift in tone.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Hmm.

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:11.426 position:50% align:center
So, if we were talking desserts
you wouldn't want to have

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50% align:center
a xiaolongbao instead of mochi
in your sweet-bean soup.

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
Is that it?

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
That's a good analogy!

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.184 position:50% align:center
Mm. I dunno if that's
what it was like.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.936 position:50% align:center
[NAYUTA]
Hmm.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
I think I'd actually like
to give that a taste.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:27.192 position:50% align:center

You can. We serve it.

[GROUP]
What?

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:29.652 position:50% align:center
You do?

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:32.572 position:50% align:center
The secret menu's nuts!
What don't they have here?

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
That flat-udon-and-
sweet-bean-paste Napolitan

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.785 position:50% align:center
was truly horrifying.

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
Though I have to admit it had
a depth of flavor all its own.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
[BARON'S OWNER]
Mm-hm.

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hey, come to think of it,

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.170 position:50% align:center
didn't you two graduate
from Shoka-Yono High?

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Yeah.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.464 position:50% align:center
And in all your years there,

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:52.217 position:50% align:center
you never once went on stage
for the culture festival?

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
No, we never got the chance to.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:57.013 position:50% align:center
Heh. Unfortunately not.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Fubuki and I only
paired up three years ago.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
It was during our second
year of high school.

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:05.730 position:50% align:center
It's our anti-smoking week!

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
Rock 'n' roll!

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU grunting]

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.363 position:50% align:center
Rock 'n' roll.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.823 position:50% align:center
Shake it up, baby, now.

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:17.409 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLGIRLS giggling]

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:19.744 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] We used to just mess
around between classes

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
with little gags and stuff,

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:24.833 position:50% align:center
but all our classmates thought
we were really funny.

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:29.004 position:50% align:center
So, we rolled with it and
teamed up. And then...

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
Oh! Wait I remember now.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
Huh? What?

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about
it, that gag...

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
"Please don't rush when
entering the train."

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center
Here they go. Pshh. Pshh.

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
[spluttering]

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Not to sound
like a broken record,

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:52.902 position:50% align:center
but it always bombed
back then, too.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50% align:center
Every time she did it,
there wasn't even a chuckle.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
I guess that is how
things kinda went.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50% align:center
Aw, I could've done any bit,
why'd I do that one?

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
I wonder if being back
at Shoka-Yono High

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
just made my muscle memory
kick in or something.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.169 position:50% align:center
Hey, I think this story's
getting off-track.

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:10.670 position:50% align:center
So, what happened next?

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
You got caught up in the moment,
formed a duo, and then...

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
Right. We weren't getting
caught up in things though.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
Just kinda giving in to it all.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.430 position:50% align:center
Then we got into the
High-School Comedy Contest.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.682 position:50% align:center
Only as far as the
preliminaries, though.

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
We lost, but it's
because we got cut

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:26.269 position:50% align:center
that we felt like there's
no way we could

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:27.479 position:50% align:center
let things end with that.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.564 position:50% align:center
And if we had given up
on comedy back then,

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
we wouldn't be here today!

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.317 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Mm.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.735 position:50% align:center
I do wonder, though.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.695 position:50% align:center
Maybe it would have been
better if we had given up.

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
What? You really think
we should have?

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
Just kidding!

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.659 position:50% align:center
You really had me going.

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:47.207 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Maybe we should just
join a talent agency already.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
Even if we did it
doesn't guarantee that

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50% align:center
we'll get work out of it.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
Though, it sorta
seems like JK Cool

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
is getting a steady
stream of gigs.

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.259 position:50% align:center

have the late shift today.

[FUBUKI]
Oh, you do?

to be on the early shift

get through the first day.

have to become superstars

between now and then.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
If they're already really
popular, it'll make convincing

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center

whole lot easier!

"Please don't rush when
entering the train."

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:17.649 position:50% align:center
Sorry. It's that bit she always
does of an impression

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:21.903 position:50% align:center
of an anime character doing an
impression of another character.

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
She's been doing that routine
ever since her high school days!

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
She's been doing it that long?

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.328 position:50% align:center
What'll we do with her.

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:33.915 position:50% align:center
And just like today,
it would never fail to bomb.

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
I hadn't seen it in a while,
and I couldn't stop laughing.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:43.258 position:50% align:center
Ms. Hirano, that bit of
hers isn't funny at all.

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:44.592 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
Mm-mm.

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
Please don't feel like
you need to be polite!

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.973 position:50% align:center
I did think to myself,
"Wow, she's still doing

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
that oddball impression?"

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
But for some strange reason,
it's really grown on me!

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:56.730 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh...

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:58.481 position:50% align:center
[MS HIRANO]
Well, it's like this:

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
I've seen her do it
over and over again,

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
and now after like
seeing it a million times

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:04.988 position:50% align:center
it's starting to be funny to me!

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:10.243 position:50% align:center
If my sister heard you say that,
she'd be so happy she'd cry!

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
Even at home, that
impression always bombs.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:16.041 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. There's something
I wanted to tell those two.

--[KANAE] Uh?
--[MANATSU] Mm?

"Keep on doing
your best, girls."

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:23.757 position:50% align:center
Would you mind
passing that along?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
Ah. Of course!
I'll let them know.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center

day two of the festival!

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:32.557 position:50% align:center

Thank you, Ms. Hirano!

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.185 position:50% align:center

[BOTH laugh]

00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:45.028 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] So, our hook is
the bottom half of a moai.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
Does that sound good?

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Do we sit knees-up,
cross-legged, formally,

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:50.658 position:50% align:center
or with legs to the side?

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:52.660 position:50% align:center
I dunno. Why don't we
just sit however

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50% align:center
we want and see
how things turn out?

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
But if we end up shifting
around during the bit,

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:58.416 position:50% align:center
won't it ruin the tempo?

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.503 position:50% align:center
I guess that's true.
It's like da-da-da-da-DA!

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:04.047 position:50% align:center
That's the kind of pace we
should be shooting for.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.423 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Hmm...

00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
Well, why don't we just
try it and see how it goes.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
And then we'll know if
our feet cramp up or not.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.181 position:50% align:center
You sound like an old lady.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
Well, we're not going to
be teenagers for much longer.

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
No one stays young forever.

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:23.316 position:50% align:center
You're right. Can't deny that.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? Is something
bothering you?

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:26.945 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
That chat with Rin and
Nayuta today about how

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.907 position:50% align:center
we teamed up has
just been on my mind.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.701 position:50% align:center
It really got me thinking.

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:34.869 position:50% align:center
Oh, you mean about how your
train-door gag is still

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:35.704 position:50% align:center
falling flat with crowds?

00:16:35.787 --> 00:16:37.205 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
No not about that!

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
Then what?

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.709 position:50% align:center
The High-School comedy contest.

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.627 position:50% align:center
After we got cut in
the preliminary round

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
for the second year in a row.

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
Looks like we're
eliminated. Again.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:56.016 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu, what are you thinking?
Say something.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
I just don't want things
to end this way.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.407 position:50% align:center
I feel the same as you.

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Nothing's changed.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
Which is why we aren't gonna
let things end this way.

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
Of course not!

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:34.888 position:50% align:center
So, on that note, let's talk
about that impression of yours.

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
Are you still on that?

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
I am! Ninety percent
of honing one's craft

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
is about constructive criticism.
So, let's start!

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
Ugh... Who said that?

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.566 position:50% align:center
I just did!

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU groans]

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I was just thinking
something about that gag.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:55.075 position:50% align:center
Is it possible that it
might be too faithful?

00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
Hmm... What if you gave
it a little twist instead?

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:02.082 position:50% align:center
Wait do you mean my Konata?
Oh no is it my Shin-chan?

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:05.085 position:50% align:center
Neither of them! If you rework
that part of the routine,

00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:06.836 position:50% align:center
then it wouldn't be an
impression anymore!

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
Change the train-door part!

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:12.008 position:50% align:center
I dunno. If I did that,
the audience

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:13.968 position:50% align:center
wouldn't be able to tell
what the joke's about.

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:16.096 position:50% align:center
I suppose that's true.

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU] Hmm, what other
part can I tweak.

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
That is the question

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
Hey, look. Isn't that
Fuyu and Fubuki?

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:25.188 position:50% align:center
Oh, it sure is!

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
Natsu?

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
She looks so focused.

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:36.866 position:50% align:center
I have to say, this
might be the first time

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.828 position:50% align:center
I've ever seen her serious side.

00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:43.748 position:50% align:center
[KANAE]
Hm. Huh?

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:45.750 position:50% align:center
Guess that's true.

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.255 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Well, what if you
change the sound of the train?

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
You could make it
some other melody.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! I think I see
where you're going.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:57.595 position:50% align:center
Like maybe something
you would never ever hear.

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
That could really work.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50% align:center
I wonder if there's
one that'll do the trick.

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Hey, Sis!

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU]
Oh, Manatsu! Kanae!

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
What're you doing here?

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
We were just on our way home.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
Thanks again for
all your help today.

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
Don't mention it!

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
Honestly, we ought to be
thanking you for inviting us.

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
What she said! Thanks a ton!

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
--Wha--?
--[laughing]

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
Heh, oh, Kanae. You're
the best audience ever!

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:27.876 position:50% align:center
She really is, isn't she?

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
Hearing her laugh
really perks me up,

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:32.714 position:50% align:center
especially on days like today
when I'm feeling blue.

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:35.133 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Kanae!

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
You should take a page
out of her book Manatsu.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:39.220 position:50% align:center
[MANATSU]
Oh, really.

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
You know, there was something
really nice I was gonna share

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
with you, but if you're
gonna talk like that,

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna say it.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.770 position:50% align:center
Well, wait, now I
wanna know what it is.

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:49.981 position:50% align:center
Come on, quit acting all high
and mighty and just spill it.

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:53.276 position:50% align:center
Sure. You remember
Ms. Hirano, don't you?

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course!

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
How is she doing?

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:02.285 position:50% align:center
[RIN]
Hey, Nayuta.

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna come over
to my place after work?

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:06.831 position:50% align:center
Huh? I guess I can.

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:09.042 position:50% align:center
Did you want to
go over some skits?

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:11.294 position:50% align:center
That's not why I'm asking.

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:14.798 position:50% align:center
It's because my report's not
finished, and it's due tomorrow.

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
Another one?

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:18.802 position:50% align:center
You're hopeless, what are
we going to do with you.

00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:21.763 position:50% align:center
One deluxe set!
Dipping sauce only.

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center
That was nice.
Ms. Hirano said that, huh?

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
She actually complimented us.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.319 position:50% align:center
Huh? Fubuki!

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
Know what this means?

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
I don't think so...

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:41.616 position:50% align:center
It's like Ms. Hirano said: if
you see it over and over again,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
it'll eventually grow on you!

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.788 position:50% align:center
Where are you going with this?

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
I'm talking about
the train-door gag!

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:51.918 position:50% align:center
If I just keep doing it nonstop
"Not again!" will turn into

00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
"It still doesn't
sound quite right."

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.797 position:50% align:center
Till at last it becomes
"You know what?

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
I'm actually sensing a
deeper meaning here!"

00:20:57.841 --> 00:20:59.551 position:50% align:center
So, it's the kind of shtick
that people learn

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:01.678 position:50% align:center
to appreciate over time!

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:03.430 position:50% align:center
How does that even work?

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
It means if I keep hammering
away, it may never get

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:08.435 position:50% align:center
huge laughs, but I bet
it'll get some chuckles!

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center
I think this could
really work, Fubuki!

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
Let's go all in on this!

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
So, what you're saying is that
you'll do that bit forever,

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.192 position:50% align:center
even if it bombs?

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
I have a feeling you're
going to get discouraged

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:20.697 position:50% align:center
long before you get a chuckle.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
Think of this mental image:

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:25.243 position:50% align:center
it'd be like spending
a freezing winter

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.787 position:50% align:center
at the South Pole wearing
nothing but a T-shirt.

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.957 position:50% align:center
Do you want to freeze to death?

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
Ahh! I've changed my mind!
That's sounds awful!

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
A train door, huh?

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:47.557 position:50% align:center
Mafuyu's not that great at
impressions in the first place,

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.559 position:50% align:center
so that's a tough one.

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.519 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:55.607 position:50% align:center
"Please don't rush
when entering the train."

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.651 position:50% align:center
Here they go. Pshh...

00:21:58.735 --> 00:22:00.362 position:50% align:center
Pshh, pshh.

00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:02.989 position:50% align:center
Do, do, do, do...

00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
Ohh, ohhh, ohhh...

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:12.665 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI laughing]

00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:19.464 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA]
Hey, I heard the news!

00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:21.591 position:50% align:center
There was a big hit
and a huge miss

00:22:21.675 --> 00:22:23.259 position:50% align:center
at that festival yesterday, huh?

00:22:23.343 --> 00:22:25.970 position:50% align:center
Tomita. C'mon quit
talking about that.

00:22:26.054 --> 00:22:28.139 position:50% align:center
You know that she's
bummed out over it.

00:22:28.223 --> 00:22:31.726 position:50% align:center
Nu-uh! I think that bit
is great just the way it is.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.729 position:50% align:center
Not again. Is she back on that?

00:22:34.813 --> 00:22:38.733 position:50% align:center
Hey guys, have you ever
heard of a "way homer"?

00:22:38.817 --> 00:22:40.235 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:24:15.955 --> 00:24:17.457 position:50% align:center
[MAFUYU, FUBUKI]
What's next on Maesetsu?

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.458 position:50% align:center
[RIN, NAYUTA]
"Thrills!"

00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:19.793 position:50% align:center
[TOMITA, HATSUNA]
Don't miss it!
