on this remote planet.

The entire galaxy
belongs to Galaxia.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.569
As its ruler, I
can't allow such
filthy creatures...

... to exist here.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:55.843
Prepare to perish.
[evil laughing]

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:58.445
This is what happened
to our home planet.

isn't much time

Oh no.

Where could she
be hiding?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.155
I'm checking now.

If you attack head

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:42.155
So what?!

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.427
You see... Our only
purpose in life was
to protect our

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:50.898
princess and see to
the revival of our
home planet.

00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:53.300
Now that our hopes
have been crushed,

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:56.570
we have no
reason to live.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:04:00.541
But first, we must
make sure Galaxia
pays for what she did.

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:03.844
You can't! Your
princess would never
have wanted that!

00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:04.978
Nuh-uh.

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:06.246

about it?

Good luck trying to
protect your own

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:18.559
You'll definitely
need it.

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:25.065

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.871
I'm sorry. I have
to go, Sailor Moon.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:34.007
The princess' death
must be avenged.

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:06.306

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:05.465
This isn't good. It
appears we've been
trapped.

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:07.201
<i>Damn it!</i>

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:09.269
We don't have
any time to waste
here!

00:06:09.303 --> 00:06:11.939
We have to hurry up
and find Galaxia
before--

00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:13.774
[evil laughing]

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:15.976
That won't be
necessary.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:17.311
Galaxia!

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:20.747
Relax and enjoy your
stay, because you
won't be leaving...

00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:24.651
... ever again.
[chuckling]

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.725
The town...

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:34.027
We have to
do something!

00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:36.964
Yes, but... this
enemy is too
powerful.

00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:39.233
Galaxia has already
taken control of a

00:06:39.266 --> 00:06:40.667
large part of
our galaxy.

00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.303
Her powers are on a
completely different
level from the

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:45.506
enemies we've faced
before this.

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:46.773
Wait, seriously?

00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:49.510
Are you saying there
isn't anything we can
do to stop her?

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:50.644
There has
to be a way.

00:06:50.677 --> 00:06:55.249
Even as we speak,
our town is being
torn apart.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.555
I hope the Star
Lights are okay.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:04.691
I think we should
help them. We can't
let Earth end up the

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:06.193
same way their
planet did.

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:08.161
We must
stop Galaxia!

00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:10.364
Yes, although we're
at a disadvantage.

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:12.666
Give what you've got
for what you can
accomplish today.

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:17.137
'Cause by doing so,
it'll lead to a
better tomorrow.

00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:17.971
Right?

00:07:19.173 --> 00:07:22.442
I won't let Galaxia
do as she pleases.

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:25.979
It's our planet, so
we must be the ones
to protect it.

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:34.555
Haruka, you sure
you're okay with not
telling her goodbye?

00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:37.524
Oh, come on, you're
making it sound like
we're never going

00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:38.825
to see her again.

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:40.827
Well, that's
possible, isn't it?

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:45.666
So what? As long as
you're still with
me, it's fine.

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:46.567
You're right.

00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:07.921
Please let us join
you on this mission.

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:10.457
As the Guardians of
the Outer Planets...

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.460
... we cannot
ignore Earth's
greatest danger.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.563
Yes. And if things
take a turn for
the worst,

00:08:16.597 --> 00:08:18.565
... at least one
of us...

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:20.567
... must remain
alive...

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.402
... and defeat
Galaxia.

00:08:24.538 --> 00:08:26.073
Let us go.

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:29.042
And protect our
planet.

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:33.480
They're not here.

00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:34.381
Or here.

00:08:35.249 --> 00:08:37.184
Where could they have
gone off to?

00:08:38.652 --> 00:08:39.486
Oh, no!

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.023
Did those four...
head off to fight her?!

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:45.259
<i>The destruction's</i>
<i>really spread.</i>

00:08:45.893 --> 00:08:47.461
If this
continues...

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:49.429
... our world will
be destroyed.

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:54.034
It'll be all right,
Chibi-Chibi.

00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:56.336
We'll make sure to
protect everyone.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.972
Usagi's right. This
planet is our home!

00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:01.141
We met here. It
brought us together.

00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:03.944
We've been through
so much, haven't
we, girls?

00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:06.446
This planet is
precious to every one
of us.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.283
And that's why
it's our job to
protect it!

00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:13.053
Mm!

00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:15.556
Please be careful
everyone.

00:09:15.589 --> 00:09:17.524

Clearly, we can't
get in this way.

00:12:07.995 --> 00:12:10.197

up already.

And how will you
accomplish that when
you're so powerless?

That's what you
think? Then we'll

here and watch?!

00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:17.558
But we--we
have to-- no!!

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:20.460
[gasping]

00:14:20.827 --> 00:14:21.895
[whimpering]

00:14:21.929 --> 00:14:23.197
Sailor Moon!

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.032
I can't believe
we were so close,

00:14:25.065 --> 00:14:27.467
yet there's nothing
we can do to help.

00:14:28.602 --> 00:14:30.838
It's just...
too cruel.

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:36.810
[sobbing]

00:14:36.844 --> 00:14:38.011
[lightly gasping]

00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:43.584
[gasping]

00:14:46.486 --> 00:14:47.454
Uh--

00:14:54.828 --> 00:14:56.263
Chibi-Chibi Moon?!

00:14:56.864 --> 00:14:58.165
No way!

00:14:58.198 --> 00:14:59.600
How'd she get here?

00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:02.436
Chibi-Chibi!

00:15:09.543 --> 00:15:12.212
[chuckling]

00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:14.748
What's wrong? Giving
up already?

00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.519
[panting]

00:15:18.552 --> 00:15:20.354
How's this
possible?

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:22.723
Did we really put in
all of that effort

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:24.258
just for it to
amount to nothing?

00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:28.228
[panting]
Don't say that! Pull
yourselves together.

00:15:28.262 --> 00:15:30.430
We still have
a chance!

00:15:30.464 --> 00:15:33.400
Ha! You're just
wasting your breath.

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.537
You're going to die
here like the trash
you are.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.804
Is this it?

00:15:37.838 --> 00:15:39.506
I'm afraid so.

00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:42.342
A light?

00:15:53.921 --> 00:15:55.222
Where are we?

00:15:55.722 --> 00:15:56.723
Girls!

00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:57.691
[grunting]

00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:01.562
Chibi-Chibi Moon, did
your power bring us
here?

00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:04.331
Power?

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:07.835
So, you've made it
into this dimension.

00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:09.536
I commend you
on such a feat.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.073
Now I shall destroy
you, along with those
three!

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.341
Huh?

00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:16.543
Why did you come
here?!

00:16:17.945 --> 00:16:20.214
If you're trying to
make us feel indebted
to you, it won't work!

00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:21.348
That's not why
we came!

00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:23.317
All we want is to
protect our planet

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:24.952
and the people
living on it.

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:26.220
Fighter.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.754
Huh...

00:16:29.056 --> 00:16:32.025
I thought... that
I would never see
you again.

00:16:33.727 --> 00:16:35.963
[laughing]

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:40.868
Now That was a very
touching reunion. I
almost shed a tear.

00:16:40.901 --> 00:16:45.072
You listen here! Stop
doing such horrible
things to our people!

00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:46.373
We're sick of it.

00:16:46.406 --> 00:16:49.243
So, leave this planet
now and never come
back!

00:16:49.276 --> 00:16:52.513
Why would I leave
when I still
haven't obtained

00:16:52.546 --> 00:16:53.680
your Star Seed?

00:16:54.815 --> 00:16:58.051
You'll never have
it! I won't let you
near her!

00:16:58.085 --> 00:17:00.354
Really? You
won't let me?

00:17:00.387 --> 00:17:03.257
Just who do you
think you're speaking
to?!

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.526
[grunting]

00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:06.693
Be gone!

00:17:07.895 --> 00:17:10.330
[screaming]

00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:11.398
You guys!

00:17:11.431 --> 00:17:12.699
I said, stop!

00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:14.635
I don't know what
your problem is, but
if you really think

00:17:14.668 --> 00:17:17.738
you can have
everything go your
way, you're dead wrong!

00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:22.009
Such insolence. I
will always have
everything go my way!

00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:32.486
I was planning on
getting to enjoy
torturing you a bit

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:35.923
longer, but,
unfortunately for
you, I changed my

00:17:35.956 --> 00:17:38.926
mind. This place will
be your grave!

00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:40.427
[chuckling]

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.628
[grunting]

00:17:43.363 --> 00:17:44.731
[struggling]

00:17:45.332 --> 00:17:46.567
Ah!

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.434
[yelping]

00:17:50.571 --> 00:17:52.005
[gasping]

00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:57.644
[screaming]

00:17:59.713 --> 00:18:01.648
[gasping]

00:18:07.721 --> 00:18:08.722
[gasping]

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:10.190
Oh my god.

00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:17.531
The lights of four
stars are...

00:18:17.564 --> 00:18:20.167
... about to fade
out...

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:30.477
Sailor Jupiter. Sailor
Mercury, Sailor Venus.
Sailor Mars.

00:18:35.883 --> 00:18:49.196
[laughing]

00:18:51.598 --> 00:18:57.271
No. Why? Why did
you all take the hit
for us?!

00:18:57.304 --> 00:19:03.210
We wanted... to
protect... the
friends... we love.

00:19:03.243 --> 00:19:05.279
Protect your
friends?

00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:09.016
That's right. We
love Sailor Moon, but
we love the three of

00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:13.086
you just as much.
You're all special
to us.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.990
But that's-- Was
it worth risking your
lives for?!

00:19:17.024 --> 00:19:19.193
Please, just--
please take our
place.

00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:22.996
And protect Usagi
and our world.

00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:25.566
Uh-

00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:32.706
Rei, come on... Wake
up! Please, Rei!
Everyone!

00:19:35.242 --> 00:19:36.376
No!

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:42.049
Please, come back!
Don't leave me! I
need you! Mako,

00:19:42.082 --> 00:19:46.286
Ami, Minako! I
don't wanna be
alone.

00:19:46.787 --> 00:19:48.856
Uh!

00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:54.628
Don't be such a
baby. I know you're
better than that, Usagi.

00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:56.263
You can't
go, Rei.

00:19:56.296 --> 00:19:59.433
You promised you'd
be with me 'til
the very end.

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:02.436
You can't break a
promise like that.

00:20:02.469 --> 00:20:06.740
Don't leave me. I
can't do this
without you.

00:20:06.773 --> 00:20:10.577
Dummy, you won't
be alone, you still
have Mamoru,

00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:11.512
remember?

00:20:12.679 --> 00:20:16.316
Sorry that I won't
be there to protect
you anymore.

00:20:18.852 --> 00:20:20.454
Rei, wait!

00:20:20.921 --> 00:20:25.359
[whimpering]

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:30.063
No.

00:20:30.764 --> 00:20:34.568
No!

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:40.240
Give them back!
Give Rei back to me!

00:20:40.274 --> 00:20:46.046
Minako. Mako and
Ami, too! Give
my friends back!

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.549
Do it, now!

00:20:48.949 --> 00:20:49.850
[grunting]

00:20:49.883 --> 00:20:50.450
Hmph.

00:20:50.484 --> 00:20:52.019
[screaming]

00:20:52.686 --> 00:20:54.488
So beautiful.

00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:58.225
Since I'm in a good
mood, let me show you
something. Behold,

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:01.728
all of the true
Star Seeds I've
collected so far.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.435
[lightly gasping]

00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:15.275
[gasping]

00:21:19.513 --> 00:21:25.118
[trembling]

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:30.390
Is that Mamo?

00:21:30.424 --> 00:21:31.358
[gasping]

00:21:32.492 --> 00:21:35.062
Well, now. I see
you're attracted to
that golden Star

00:21:35.095 --> 00:21:38.232
Seed. You have
impeccable taste.

00:21:38.265 --> 00:21:41.668
<i>That is the Star Seed</i>
<i>representing this</i>
<i>planet.</i>

00:21:43.337 --> 00:21:46.640
Hold on... If
that's his
Star Seed...

00:21:46.673 --> 00:21:48.442
Then that can
only mean...

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:53.580
That Mamo must be...
he must already be...

00:23:35.082 --> 00:23:37.518
<i>That Star Seed.</i>
<i>It's Mamo's!</i>

00:23:37.551 --> 00:23:40.954
Yes. I hold the light
of the one you love
most.

00:23:40.988 --> 00:23:42.022
<i>No, it</i>
<i>can't be!</i>

00:23:42.055 --> 00:23:43.891
Go, my loyal
servants!

00:23:43.924 --> 00:23:45.926
Retrieve Sailor
Moon's Star Seed!

00:23:45.959 --> 00:23:48.262
<i>Uranus? Neptune? Why?!</i>

00:23:48.295 --> 00:23:50.697
These two are no
longer your friends.

00:23:50.731 --> 00:23:52.099
They obey
me now.

00:23:52.132 --> 00:23:54.301
<i>Next time</i>
<i>on Sailor Stars:</i>

00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:57.204
<i>Ruler of the Galaxy:</i>
<i>The Menace of Galaxia.</i>

00:23:57.237 --> 00:24:00.407
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
