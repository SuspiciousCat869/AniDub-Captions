<i>(Rei) Is Misa's illness really</i>

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.763
Yes. Unfortunately, it's so
complicated...

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:53.267
there wasn't a doctor anywhere
in the country who was able to
cure her of it.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.606
So that's why a famous foreign
doctor is doing the surgery,
which may sound great, but...

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.842
Hey, Mako, who's Misa anyway?

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:05.779
Oh, she's a little girl staying
at the hospital where Ami's mom
works.

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.447
Ami goes to visit
her a lot.

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:11.285
And she apparently loves the
Three Lights, so she's got
good taste.

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:11.985
Oh.

00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:15.722
The sad thing is, Misa's
really terrified of the
surgery.

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:20.694
She's convinced that even if
she has it done, she's not
going to end up surviving it.

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:25.032
So my goal is to help Misa
build up her courage before
the surgery.

00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:29.670
I thought of giving her some
kind of present, but I'm not
really sure what to get.

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:34.675
Hey, I have an idea. She's a
fan of the Three Lights,
right?

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:37.845
I know the perfect present to
help raise Misa's spirits!

this woman she suddenly
appears to you?

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:52.873
Yes. But lately they don't
work.

00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:54.174
What?

00:12:55.742 --> 00:12:59.179
The lady just stopped
appearing.

00:12:59.213 --> 00:13:02.449
So I can't draw her.

00:13:04.551 --> 00:13:05.552
[gasps]

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:14.394
We always give it our all no
matter how exhausted we are!

00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:15.229
He's right!

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.633
We've gotta keep pushing
through, hoping the message in
our songs will reach her soon.

00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:23.003
<i>Seiya and Yaten were right.</i>

00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:33.547
(Taiki) Our songs were reaching
people. Maybe not everyone, but
<i>at least this little girl.</i>

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.151
<i>But I was so full of doubt, I</i>
<i>wouldn't allow myself to see</i>
<i>it.</i>

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:42.589
I'm scared.

00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:43.724
[gasps]

00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:47.661
Taiki, I don't wanna die.

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:53.166
You won't. Because you're
going to survive this surgery,
and come out better than ever.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.370
<i>(Taiki) But only if you truly</i>
<i>believe it!</i>

00:13:56.403 --> 00:13:57.604
[gasps]

00:13:59.173 --> 00:14:03.577
(Taiki) So, have faith, Misa. Do
<i>all you can to make your wish</i>
<i>come true.</i>

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.012
[giggles]

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:15.088
Excuse us. We have to move her
over to surgery now.

00:14:18.425 --> 00:14:20.994
<i>Good luck and thank you, Misa.</i>

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:26.834
The next time you hear us
sing, I'll make sure that
woman appears to you again.

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:29.169
Taiki! Where are you going?

00:14:29.937 --> 00:14:32.372
Now I have to fight my own
battle.

Hey guys, bad news.

00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:48.889
(Seiya) Unfortunately, Taiki...

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:53.060

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.377
You seriously couldn't come up
with a better excuse than that?

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.679
You're ruining my public image,
Seiya.

00:15:13.814 --> 00:15:14.948
Hey, that's what you get.

00:15:14.982 --> 00:15:15.749

We still haven't heard from

We've been expecting you,

I'm sorry I'm so late. The
traffic getting here was the
worst I've ever seen.

Oh, don't worry. I know a

Aww, you're ill. Let me give you

Hmm. Ooh! [creepy chuckle]
Why, everything, of course!

Misa's small, but resilient. I
could tell she was fighting
hard to stay alive.

(Doctor) Her strong will is the

as well without the power of the

You know it's thanks to you...

that Misa was able to find the
strength to make it through her
surgery.

No, she's the one who helped
