<i>made it to the finals for an</i>
<i>idol audition! If she wins...</i>

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:17.184

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.152

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.990
I'm afraid her true talent won't

[sighs]

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:37.024
Are you sure you're not gonna
go to the audition finals?

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:40.994
Mina... seriously?

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:43.997
[grunt] Uh-huh!

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:46.967

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:00.547
<i>Wow...</i>

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:04.918
Look, it's the Three Lights...
They've been working hard
lately.

00:03:04.952 --> 00:03:10.457
That explains why they haven't
been in school. Their schedule's
all booked up with idol work.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.658
Idol work, huh?

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:13.260
[gasp] Huh?!

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:17.431
Well, that's cool... but I think
school is of the utmost
importance.

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:20.868
We need to study hard,
especially while we're young!

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:21.635
Uhhh...

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.738
(MINAKO) <i>It'll help us open</i>
<i>doors to new possibilities!</i>

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:26.273
Isn't that right, Ami?!

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:29.209
Huh? Y-yeah... [coughing]

00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:29.343
Uhhh...

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:34.581
Well... see ya later! It's time
for me to go home now. I've got
a ton of homework.

00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:38.986
You guys should study too if
you don't want to fail like
Usagi.

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.020
[biting] That's mean, Minako!

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.989
Buh-bye! Study hard!

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:43.624
Mina...

00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:48.362
Amazing! I never thought I'd
hear the word "study" come out
of Minako's mouth.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.564
Does she have a fever or
something?

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:55.002
I think it's a good thing. You
should try and follow her
example, Usagi.

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:58.572
[gasp] My makeup exam buddy has
forsaken me...

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:02.042
She's always been strange, but
now she's really outdone
herself.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.378
I wonder if something
happened...

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.680
Ah, well actually...

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:08.081
Artemis... what is it?

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:11.351
She got some news she hasn't
told any of you...

00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:12.519
You mean Minako?

00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:13.020
Yeah.

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.823
She got a notice in the mail
that said she passed the
semi-finals for the Idol Talent

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:20.027
<i>Search audition. All that's</i>
<i>left is the finals...</i>

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.629
<i>but she doesn't think now is a</i>
<i>good time...</i>

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:26.333
It's true. Not only do we have
the Three Lights to worry
about...

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.769
we also have to
watch out for Galaxia.

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:31.104
So then, she's just gonna
give up?

00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:32.506
It seems that way.

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:36.376
Well that definitely explains
why she was acting so bizarre...

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.746
And if she actually were to win
the finals...

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.984
...then she gets to have Takuya
Moroboshi, the most popular
producer out there...

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:47.487
write her a new song for the
whole world to hear!

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:48.155
[giddy breath]

00:04:49.523 --> 00:04:51.825
Wow, that's incredible! Then
she's guaranteed to become a
superstar!

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:56.496
It's Minako's lifelong dream to
become an idol. She can't miss
this opportunity!

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.939
I wonder why the princess hasn't
shown up. We all felt her
energy.

00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:09.910
Look on the bright side. At
least we know she received our
message.

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:14.081
Actually. I picked up a trace of
her scent just the other day.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:15.649
What? Really?

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:16.650
Where was that?

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:30.030
I'm sure it was her, but
why would I sense her there...?

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:34.935
It seems like there might be
something that's preventing the
princess from wanting to appear

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:35.602
before us.

00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:48.782
(MAKOTO) <i>You've got to go to the</i>
<i>finals, Minako.</i>

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:50.884
Seriously! We're all rooting for
you.

00:05:50.918 --> 00:05:53.620
It's your big chance to become
an idol, right?

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:57.558
[gasp] Not at a time like this!

00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:01.728
That's all the more reason why
we want you to go and do your
best.

00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:02.062
Huh?

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:06.667
You have to hold onto your
dreams in good times and bad
times, no matter what!

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.467
It's all the same...

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:09.636
Usagi...

00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:14.208
We all have our own hopes and
dreams that we hold dear to our
hearts...

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:15.809
whether it's friendship or
love...

00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:19.146
...I believe that's what brings
us together to fight on.

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:21.748
Because those hopes and dreams
are worth fighting for.

00:06:21.782 --> 00:06:25.018
She's right, Minako, and even if
something were to happen...

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:28.522
we would cover for you so
there's no need to worry.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:29.489
Please go, Minako.

00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:42.069
Are you sure?

00:06:42.436 --> 00:06:43.637
Uh-huh!

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.607
Thanks, you guys are the best!

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.844
Oh! And you're more than welcome
to come watch me become an
idol!

00:06:50.878 --> 00:06:51.512
Watch it!

00:06:52.112 --> 00:06:53.046
Yeah, don't get too cocky!

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.948
Or you'll never pass the finals!

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:55.616
My bad!

me!

So do your friends know about
this?

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.825
O-of course they do. They're the
one who encouraged me to come.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:45.158
What?!

Yes, of course I do.

Well if that's the case, then
how can you explain what you're
doing here!

I think... I think it's
important to try and make my
dream come true!

your dream... is more important
than being a Sailor Guardian?

00:12:58.846 --> 00:13:03.684
Take it from me, it's kind of
easy to get lost in a TV studio.

Hm? [groggy breaths and snoring]

00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:33.714
Sorry, you okay?

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:41.154
Mina... remember Usagi's words-
you can do this! C'mon!

00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:43.156
I won't give up!

00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:47.027

(ARTEMIS) <i>That's the spirit,</i>

00:14:07.548 --> 00:14:09.983
Hm, is this the right way?

00:14:10.017 --> 00:14:12.319
Nope... looks like it's a dead
end.

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:13.687
Awww!

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.492
[chattering]

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.360
Next, our judges will ask you
some questions...

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:25.799
so please come up five at a time
in numerical order and be
prepared to give a thoughtful

00:14:25.832 --> 00:14:26.233
response.

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:30.137
<i>Alright judges, ask away!</i>

Number five.

00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:35.142
Y-yes?

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:38.779
Please tell us what made you
want to apply for the Idol
audition?

00:14:38.812 --> 00:14:44.384
I was hoping to inspire as many
people as possible with my dream
of acting, singing, and dancing.

00:14:44.418 --> 00:14:46.753
<i>Just like the members of The</i>
<i>Three Lights.</i>

00:14:46.787 --> 00:14:51.358
So you think being an idol is
easy and our success just
happened overnight?

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:52.159
Well, ah...

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.329
Aren't there more important
things to do before becoming an
idol?

00:14:55.362 --> 00:14:58.198
Or is that something you
thought you'd figure out
afterwards?

00:14:58.232 --> 00:15:03.170
When it comes to realizing your
dreams, there's no such thing as
before or after.

00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:08.175
I think she's really got you
there, Yaten.

00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:13.814
She's a superstar in the making.
She's determined not to give up
on her dream.

00:15:13.847 --> 00:15:14.515
[gasp]

00:15:18.986 --> 00:15:21.355
Awww, we gotta hurry before it's
over.

00:15:21.388 --> 00:15:22.489
(CHIBI-CHIBI) <i>Over, over...</i>

00:15:23.357 --> 00:15:24.691
Didn't we already come down this
hall?

00:15:24.725 --> 00:15:26.527
What? No way, are you sure?

00:15:27.661 --> 00:15:28.495
(USAGI) [groan]

00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:29.329
See?

00:15:32.533 --> 00:15:34.001
[gasps and giggles]

00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:35.169
Excellent job, everyone!

(YATEN) <i>Hey...</i>

00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:38.639
Huh?

00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:43.210
I don't understand why you're
trying so hard.

00:15:43.243 --> 00:15:46.313
Because I'm determined not to
let my friends down.

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:47.314
Let them down?

00:15:49.316 --> 00:15:54.321
That's right- it was Usagi who
told me I should hold on to my
dreams, especially in times like
this.

00:15:54.588 --> 00:15:55.189
Mm.

00:15:56.857 --> 00:16:02.029
My dream is their dream... and
their dream... is my dream.

00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:06.500
[chuckle] I guess one's duty as
a Guardian isn't everything
after all...

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.467
Huh?

00:16:08.936 --> 00:16:13.073
Maybe we were getting a little
impatient about our princess...

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:14.474
What do you mean?

00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:18.912
We know she's nearby, but she
has yet to appear before us.

00:16:18.946 --> 00:16:23.784
I'm starting to wonder if it's
The Three Lights who are the
ones lacking something...

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:26.119
You are not lacking anything!

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:27.154
Huh?

00:16:28.922 --> 00:16:32.993
You and your friends are really
shining bright... brighter than
any other star I know.

00:16:33.594 --> 00:16:34.328
[chuckle]

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:42.336
They're all amazing. It's hard
to choose just one...

00:16:42.369 --> 00:16:46.306
(SUZU) <i>Well... I've already</i>

W-what's going on?

00:16:53.947 --> 00:16:57.150
I want your Star Seed... It's
mine!

00:16:57.751 --> 00:16:58.385

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:06.059
Hm. Chibi-Chibi, you stay right
here!

00:17:06.093 --> 00:17:07.861

(SUZU) <i>What?! Darn it...</i>

00:17:12.566 --> 00:17:15.569
I should've known Crow's targets
are no good...

Huh?

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.344
Mr. Moroboshi is an incredible
producer and amazing songwriter
who is constantly cheering

00:17:24.378 --> 00:17:28.282
people up with his wonderful
songs! How dare you attack him!

00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:30.217
I am the Pretty Guardian...

...who fights for love and for
justice!

And in the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

Yeah? What can a nuisance of a
girl like you do?

00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:49.469
Hold it right there!

00:17:52.272 --> 00:17:55.843
Mr. Moroboshi was one of my
judges and he was awesome. How
dare you attack him!

00:17:55.876 --> 00:17:57.978
A second nuisance of a girl?

00:17:58.745 --> 00:17:59.980
Hold it right there!

00:18:00.013 --> 00:18:03.183
Oh no, a third nuisance of a
girl?!

Ah!

00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:05.152
Uh-oh!

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:09.356
How dare you tie me up and steal
my target! Unforgivable!

You're playng really dirty here,
you know that?!
