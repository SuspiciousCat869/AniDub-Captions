00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.523
Well... that's not really my
style.

00:10:56.557 --> 00:11:00.260
[chattering]

00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:01.595
Huh? Awww!

00:11:02.563 --> 00:11:04.998
Butterfly! Butterfly!

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:16.009
[giggles]

00:11:19.513 --> 00:11:20.180
Oh!

00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:23.016
You mind handing that over to
us?

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.977
(REI) <i>It looks so good, Mako!</i>

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.246
Yeah? I hope Seiya likes
it...

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:53.247
He will!

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:53.714
Look!

00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:54.014
Hm?

00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:56.183
It's Taiki and Yaten...

00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:58.085
(CHIBI-CHIBI) <i>It's mine!</i>

00:11:58.118 --> 00:11:59.820
There's no mistake.

00:11:59.853 --> 00:12:03.757
That burner belongs to the
princess!

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.694
Now... You must hand over that
incense burner you're holding.

00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:09.997
[whimpering] No! No!

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.998
She's in trouble!

00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:12.065
Those jerks...

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:13.867
Hurry! Go get help!

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:15.002
Right!

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:21.608
[heavy breathing] Huh?

00:12:21.642 --> 00:12:24.077
Look, just give it to me.

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:26.180
Nuh-uh...!

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:29.983
[heavy breathing] Ah!

00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:36.990
Chibi-Chibi...! [gasp]
Chibi-Chibi?

00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:40.727
Hey, I got you. Are you okay?

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.196
Chibi!

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.032
Don't you worry, you're safe
now.

00:12:45.832 --> 00:12:47.034
What is your problem?!

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:48.368
Don't interfere!

00:12:49.303 --> 00:12:51.972
We don't have to explain
ourselves to you.

00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:53.607
Just save your breath.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.810
I don't need excuses from people
who harass little girls!

00:12:56.844 --> 00:13:01.348
You're wrong if you think women
and children should be given
special treatment.

00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:02.449
What's that?!

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:03.584
Or maybe...

00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:05.252
[gasp]

00:13:06.553 --> 00:13:09.389
What you're really saying is
go easy on you cause you're a
girl.

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:11.592
[grunting]

00:13:13.827 --> 00:13:15.395
I'll say it once again.

00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:18.966
It doesn't matter who you are.

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:20.534
<i>Stay out of our way...</i>

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:22.603
You got it?

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:23.537
(SEIYA) <i>Stop it!</i>

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:26.773
[gasps and grunt]

00:13:26.807 --> 00:13:27.774
Mako!

00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:29.009
What're you guys doing?!

00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:30.677
We should be asking you that!

00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:34.882
I really hope you didn't come
here just to see that girl.

00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:36.817
And what if I did?

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.886
What is wrong with you?!

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:40.053
It's all her fault!

00:13:40.087 --> 00:13:41.622
Leave her out of this!

00:13:41.655 --> 00:13:44.925
Don't let that witch put her
spell on you, Seiya.

00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.126
Excuse me?!

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.195
Why is it always like this?!

00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:53.200
All of us... should be able to
work together.

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:56.170
<i>We've just gotta be willing to</i>
<i>understand each other!</i>

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:58.639
Let's go and regroup.

00:13:59.373 --> 00:14:02.009
You too, Seiya. We need to talk.

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:04.745
Wait, where are you two going?

00:14:04.778 --> 00:14:09.383
This is our own problem to
handle. It doesn't involve you
people.

00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:11.985
Gotta go. I'm sorry.

00:14:22.296 --> 00:14:24.531
(MINAKO) <i>Can you believe those</i>
<i>guys?</i>

00:14:24.565 --> 00:14:27.367
I'm still shocked they were
harassing Chibi-Chibi...

00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:30.370
Just thinking about it makes me
so mad.

00:14:30.404 --> 00:14:32.005
Stop it already...

00:14:32.673 --> 00:14:34.308
Usagi...?

00:14:34.341 --> 00:14:39.880
Seiya, Taiki, and Yaten aren't
bad people. You know that.

00:14:39.913 --> 00:14:42.816
<i>Their voices and songs are so</i>
<i>beautiful.</i>

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.052
There's no way they could be
bad.

00:14:45.085 --> 00:14:46.820
(AKANE) <i>Found you at last.</i>

00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:47.321
Huh?!

00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:48.989
What the...?!

00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:54.828
Before my friend passed on, she
wrote in this. And it's filled
with some great info.

00:14:54.862 --> 00:15:00.834
<i>Who knew the true Star Seed</i>
would be in the possession of
<i>such an ordinary girl.</i>

00:15:00.868 --> 00:15:06.473
That made it quite hard to find,
<i>Usagi Tsukino. Or should I</i>
<i>say... Sailor Moon!</i>

00:15:06.507 --> 00:15:07.174
[grunt]

00:15:08.041 --> 00:15:10.277
I'm here to take your true Star
Seed!

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.379
So you know our secrets, huh?!

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.014
In that case...

00:15:14.047 --> 00:15:15.916
No need to hold back!

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:17.718
It's time to Transform!

00:15:18.886 --> 00:15:19.553

(SEIYA) <i>The princess?!</i>

Yes, that's right. We've smelled
traces of her.

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:54.388
That little girl carries her
scent. Haven't you noticed it?

00:15:55.756 --> 00:16:00.194
Then what I sensed at Bun-head's
<i>house last night was...</i>

00:16:00.227 --> 00:16:03.630
We saw that the child has the
princess' incense burner.

00:16:03.664 --> 00:16:04.364
What?

00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:09.636
If we can retreive it, then we
can find out why the princess
won't appear before us.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:13.574
I get what you're saying, but
let's talk to the girls first!

(YATEN) <i>There's no time!</i>

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.180
We know that the princess is
nearby! And I can't wait any
more...

00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:42.803
It's useless. You can't stop me.
Now get out of my way, unless
you want to get hurt!

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:46.006
Ahhh! [pained grunts]

00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:46.874
Ahhh!

Ahhh! [pained groans]

You guys!

00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:59.653
I intend to finish what Siren
started by bringing your true
Star Seed to Master Galaxia.

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:00.320
Now then...!

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:02.155
(SEIYA) <i>Get away from her!</i>

00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.256
Huh?

00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:06.527
Why in the world did the
princess lead us over here?

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.028
S-Star Light...

00:17:09.563 --> 00:17:12.466
Well, whatever the reason,
we'll get rid of anyone who
stands in our way.

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:15.936
Oh you guys? I know about you,
too.

00:17:15.969 --> 00:17:17.938
You're that teen idol group
aren't you?

00:17:17.971 --> 00:17:19.740
How did you know that...?!

00:17:19.773 --> 00:17:21.008

Since you've traveled across the
galaxy, you must know this is a
black hole.

00:17:30.784 --> 00:17:35.923
Those who fall in will never
return. It's a tear in the
fabric of space and time.

00:17:35.956 --> 00:17:40.627
If I unleash this black hole...
<i>it'll certainly swallow this</i>

There's a festival happening
now, isn't there?

If you do that, you'll be sucked
in too!

I don't have that much time to
live, anyway!

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.208
Get to somewhere safe,
Chibi-Chibi...

00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:56.310
Unless I bring back a

We did it, Siren...

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.372
Now to take it...

00:18:59.506 --> 00:19:00.707
Ahhhh!

Why, you...!

Don't worry. I'll make sure the

00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:04.972
[smirking]

00:20:05.672 --> 00:20:05.906
(CHIBI-CHIBI) <i>Chibi-Chibi!</i>

00:20:05.939 --> 00:20:06.406
Hm?

00:20:06.707 --> 00:20:07.941
No touch!

00:20:07.975 --> 00:20:09.376
Move it, brat.

00:20:09.743 --> 00:20:10.377
No!

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:11.778
Huh?

00:20:11.812 --> 00:20:12.079
[gasp]

00:20:12.913 --> 00:20:14.515
Chibi-Chibi! Ah!

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:15.349
[grunt]

00:20:16.817 --> 00:20:17.718
Watch out!

00:20:17.751 --> 00:20:18.352
Usagi!

00:20:20.654 --> 00:20:26.927
Aw man... Bye, pretty Star
Seed... Well, I guess that means
it's time to go.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.895
(TAIKI) <i>Hold it!</i>

00:20:27.928 --> 00:20:28.362
Huh?

00:20:29.162 --> 00:20:30.898
That was our led to the
princess!

00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:33.100
The hell are you even talking
about?

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:37.171
Anyway, you guys might also
wanna make a run for it.

00:20:37.204 --> 00:20:39.373
Nothing can stop that thing
anymore.

00:20:40.641 --> 00:20:42.376
What?! [flinching]

00:20:43.977 --> 00:20:45.379
This energy...

00:20:45.979 --> 00:20:47.714
Could it be?

00:20:47.748 --> 00:20:49.416
[struggling] Eh?

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.859
What the hell is she...?!

00:20:58.892 --> 00:21:02.029
She destroyed the black hole!
Ah!

00:21:10.337 --> 00:21:11.305
[sigh of relief]

00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:11.972
Usagi...

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:13.841
She's alive...!

00:21:13.874 --> 00:21:14.842
[sigh of relief]

00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:17.377
This energy... It's really
her...!

00:21:25.219 --> 00:21:27.988
[groggy moans and gasp]

00:21:29.022 --> 00:21:31.058
The princess...

00:21:41.902 --> 00:21:43.370
Princess...?

00:21:45.005 --> 00:21:49.009
<i>Is this the woman the three of</i>
<i>them have been searching for</i>
<i>this whole time?</i>

00:21:49.543 --> 00:21:50.577
[happy gasp]

00:23:35.182 --> 00:23:37.117
(USAGI) <i>What's all this, Minako?</i>

00:23:38.785 --> 00:23:40.654
(MIANKO) <i>Pepper spray, a stun</i>
<i>gun, and lots of other</i>
<i>self-defense items!</i>

00:23:40.687 --> 00:23:41.755
(USAGI) <i>Whoah... calm down.</i>

00:23:41.788 --> 00:23:44.458
(MINAKO) <i>But the enemy could</i>
<i>show up as anyone!</i>

00:23:44.491 --> 00:23:47.761
A sweet little old lady, or even
<i>a police officer!</i>

00:23:47.794 --> 00:23:49.429
(USAGI) <i>I kinda doubt it...</i>

00:23:49.463 --> 00:23:52.866
<i>Though at least I know I'm</i>
<i>well-guarded by the Sailor</i>
<i>Guardians!</i>

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:53.667
The moonlight is a messenger of
<i>love.</i>

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:53.967
(MINAKO) <i>Oh brother...</i>

00:23:55.869 --> 00:23:58.972
(USAGI) <i>Next time on Sailor</i>
Stars, "Crusade for the Galaxy:
<i>Legend of the Sailor Wars."</i>
