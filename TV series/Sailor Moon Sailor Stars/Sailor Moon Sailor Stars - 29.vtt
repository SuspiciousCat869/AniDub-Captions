00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.811
<i>The Three Lights</i>
<i>suddenly announced</i>
<i>they're disbanding,</i>

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.747
<i>and they're doing</i>
<i>one last concert to</i>
<i>say goodbye.</i>

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.751
<i>So, could this mean</i>
<i>our final battle with</i>
<i>Galaxia is getting closer?</i>

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.921
<i>Just as that thought</i>
<i>crossed my mind,</i>
<i>Galaxia appeared at</i>

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:23.657
<i>the concert! What</i>
<i>should I do, Mamo?!</i>

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:18.372
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>I miss you, Mamo.</i>
<i>I'm alone without you!</i>

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:19.573
[weepy]

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.646
Am I not good enough?

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:29.316
Uh-

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:40.127
<i>Princess Kakyu</i>
<i>Perishes: Advent of</i>
<i>Galaxia!</i>

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:45.999
Oh!

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.935
<i>R-Rei?</i>

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:49.469
What are you gonna
tell him?

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:50.704
Huh?

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.606
You know what I'm
talking about! We
need you to make a

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.475
decision here or
you're going to put
all of us at risk!

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.710
But--

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:59.313
I don't want to
hear any excuses! You
need to be honest

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:02.216
with Seiya or
you'll end up
hurting his feelings!

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:03.450
Mm.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.953
I know it sounds
harsh, but it's not
fair to him when you

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:07.621
already have someone.

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:14.428
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>Mamo.</i>

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:17.664
You love Mamoru more
than anyone, don't
you?

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:18.599
Mm.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.869
Then, you know what
to do. We don't
have time to be

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:23.070
distracted.

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:25.339
What's wrong?

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:28.242
I wonder what Mamo
is doing right now.

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:29.209
Huh?

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:32.846
It's morning
there... so maybe
he just got up.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.517
He's probably fine,
but I wonder if
college has been hard

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.618
for him at all.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.688
Well, knowing him, I
bet he's made a lot
of friends.

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.390
He's always been
good at that.

00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:44.525
Usagi?

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.494
I hope he's been
taking care of
himself properly...

00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:50.430
W-Wait. What are you
talking about?
You've been keeping

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:52.566
in touch with Mamoru,
haven't you?

00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:56.703
But why not?!

00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:59.540
He hasn't
written back.

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:02.042
What do you mean he
hasn't written
back?!

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:03.977
Since when...?

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.716
[exhaling]
Since he left.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.387
<i>That was months ago!</i>
<i>Why didn't you</i>
<i>mention it sooner?!</i>

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.888
<i>This is serious!</i>

00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:16.323
Chibi-Chibi?

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:19.960
Sorry, Chibi-Chibi.
We're having
grown-up talk,

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:21.795
so could you go and
play for a little while?

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:24.831
I'm still in total
shock over the Three
Lights suddenly

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:25.999
announcing their
break up.

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:27.134
[gasping]

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:29.236
The Three Lights are
breaking up?!

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.605
It was a hard
decision, but we
wanted to let our

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:34.441
fans know that
tomorrow's concert
will be our last

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:35.642
performance as a
group.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.745
<i>Does that mean</i>
<i>you'll be working</i>
<i>on solo careers?</i>

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.583
<i>Taiki... Can you tell</i>
<i>us why the three of</i>
<i>you decided to split?</i>

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:54.928
Princess. We shall do
our best to summon
the Light of Hope at

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:57.297
our final concert,
just as you wished.

00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:00.868
Thank you, Maker. But
now is the time for
us all to unite our

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:02.603
hearts and work
together as one.

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:06.106
You needn't worry.
As long as you're
here with us, then we

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.574
can manage on our
own.

00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:10.410
That's right.
We're gonna find it
in the exact same way

00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:12.446
our song eventually
reached you!

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:18.218
<i>(Usagi sobbing)</i>
<i>I miss you, Mamo!</i>

00:05:18.252 --> 00:05:20.888
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>Am I not good enough?</i>

00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:24.925
Before Galaxia makes
her way here, we will
find the Light.

00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.660
Right, Seiya?

00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:30.030
Seiya?

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:32.666
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Of course.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:36.570
<i>How'd it go, Ami?</i>

00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:43.110
I contacted the
university in
America. When I asked

00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:45.512
them about Mamoru,
they said he never
showed up.

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:48.315
Do you think he got
caught in some sorta
trouble?

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:49.683
Hm.

00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:54.755
And just when we
needed him the most
to be here for Usagi.

00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:58.292
<i>I can't even</i>
<i>imagine how worried</i>
<i>sick she's been.</i>

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:02.296
<i>And to think, she</i>
<i>never showed it in</i>
<i>front of us.</i>

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:04.264
I can't believe she
actually tried to go

00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:06.200
through this all
by herself.

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:10.204
If only she had told
us sooner. We could
have helped her.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.377
Huh?

00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:17.845
[squealing]

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.580
Oh, come on!

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:23.617
Going somewhere?

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.052
[gasping]

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:27.554
Please tell me you're
not thinking of going
over to see that guy.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:29.323
Mm.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.426
I wanted to talk
before their final
concert.

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:34.294
How many times do I
have to tell you not

00:06:34.328 --> 00:06:35.829
to see him before
you'll listen?!

00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:37.497
You already have
Mamoru, don't you?

00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:42.636
Yes, and I love him!
But the thing is...
I love all the

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:44.037
people who
are in my life!

00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:47.074
I doubt your lofty
ideals mean anything
to those guys.

00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:48.342
You're wrong!

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:52.145
Yeah? Then why don't
you go over and try
telling him goodbye?

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:52.613
Uh!

00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:59.219
Go tell him this
is the last time
you'll see him.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.060
[chatting]

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.068
Well, this is it.

00:07:16.303 --> 00:07:18.472
If we don't find the
Light of Hope, we'll
ready ourselves.

00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:19.173
[agreeing]

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.141
[knocking]

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:22.676
Come in.

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:24.811
[grunting]

00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:25.846
Bun-head.

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:30.417
[breathing]

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.455
I wanted to wish you
good luck on your
concert. Also...

00:07:35.489 --> 00:07:37.124
Would you mind giving
us a second?

00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:39.860
I'd really like to
speak to her in
private.

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:41.261
Seiya...

00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:43.630
It won't take long,
I promise.

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:45.465
Five minutes.

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:45.766
Uh!

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:48.936
Uhhh...

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:50.704
Go wait outside
for a bit.

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:53.073
Chibi-Chibi!
[giggling]

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:54.007
We should go.

00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:55.676
[grunting]
Princess!

00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:11.992
About yesterday... I
meant what I said.
[chuckling]

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.661
Seiya...

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:17.464
Sorry, but--

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.234
Hey, it was me who
couldn't stop
myself from falling

00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:23.504
for you. So, don't
go blaming yourself
about it.

00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:25.906
Uh-[lightly gasping]

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:27.841
As soon as this
concert is over,

00:08:27.875 --> 00:08:30.110
I'll steal
you away.

00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:32.212
[lightly gasping]

00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:36.984
Well, to be honest,
I've grown to like
you so much, I'd

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.219
actually consider
doing that.

00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:43.991
I just wanted to make
sure you knew how I
felt about you.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:48.495
Especially since my
time as Seiya's quickly
coming to a close.

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:49.630
Seiya.

00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:51.965
Now that's off
my shoulders, I can
give everything

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:53.767
I've got for this
last concert.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.904
I really hope you can
see your boyfriend
soon.

00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:58.605
[lightly gasping]

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:01.408
I'm sorry...

00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:05.312
There's really no
need to apologize.
Although...

00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:06.680
[lightly gasping]

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:17.891
I just wish that I
had met you sooner.

00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:19.593
Bun-head.

00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:22.296
[crying]
Seiya.

00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:30.904
You don't understand
the enemy like we do.

00:09:30.938 --> 00:09:32.806
Soon, this planet will
become a battlefield

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.909
and that's when the
true horrors of war
will begin.

00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:39.079
You guys don't
stand a chance
against Galaxia.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.216
Let's see how long
you're able to keep

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:44.051
up those brave
faces of yours.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.620
No matter what
happens, we're
going to make sure

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:47.888
our mission is
completed.

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:51.191
Please understand.
There's something
we must defend even

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:53.060
if our lives are
at stake.

00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:57.364
It's almost time.

00:09:57.397 --> 00:10:00.534
If we're unable to
find the Light of
Hope by the time

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:01.668
the concert's over...

The galaxy belongs to
Master Galaxia!

00:13:50.597 --> 00:13:52.032
Not on our watch!

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.903
That's right! Please
don't let Galaxia
take control of you!

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:57.237
Huh?!

00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:59.840
No! Now hand your
Star Seed over to
me or else!

00:13:59.873 --> 00:14:00.741
[grunting]

00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:02.376
Please, you must
be careful!

00:14:02.409 --> 00:14:05.412
If she takes
your Star Seed,
then it's--

00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:07.014
Why is she acting
so strangely?!

00:14:07.047 --> 00:14:10.450

<i>Sailor Guardians.</i>

00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:17.391
She's been
brainwashed?!

00:14:17.424 --> 00:14:20.661
Yes, but now that one
of the bracelets has
been removed, it

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:24.731
seems she's reverting
back to her good self
as a Sailor Guardian.

00:14:24.765 --> 00:14:26.099
Uh!

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:29.269

[grunting]

00:15:31.198 --> 00:15:33.300
It's sad the Three
Lights are breaking
up, but that

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.302
doesn't mean I'll
forgive you for
interrupting a

00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:38.739
passionate message to
their fans during
their final concert!

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.874
I am the Pretty
Guardian!

00:15:40.908 --> 00:15:43.343
Who fights for
love and for justice!

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:50.284
I am Sailor Moon!

00:15:50.317 --> 00:15:54.521
And now, in the name
of the Moon, I'll
punish you!

00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:57.624
You're right... I
really deserve to
be punished.

00:15:57.658 --> 00:16:01.395
No! You're the ones
who are going to be
punished!

00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:03.764
<i>Hold it right there!</i>

00:16:05.098 --> 00:16:06.800
We're going to
protect this planet
ourselves!

00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:08.735
So you three stay out
of this!

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:13.307
No. It was our show, so
we're going to defeat
this concert crasher!

00:16:13.874 --> 00:16:14.741
[gasping]

00:16:15.609 --> 00:16:16.710
Sailor Star Lights!

00:16:16.743 --> 00:16:19.379
Please, just let us
handle this! We
don't want her

00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:21.648
dead, we wanna see if
we can help her!

00:16:21.682 --> 00:16:23.483
Well, this isn't
your fight!

00:16:23.517 --> 00:16:24.284
[grunting]

00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:25.252
That's enough!

00:16:26.453 --> 00:16:30.324
Please stop. We
cannot win like this.

00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.526
But, princess...

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:35.996
She's right. We
should all work
together.

00:16:36.864 --> 00:16:38.665
Sailor Moon, I--

00:16:47.808 --> 00:16:48.909

[evil chuckling]

00:17:00.988 --> 00:17:04.191
This... this aura is
full of hatred!

[gasping]

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:15.202
Galaxia?

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.572
Master Galaxia, I
shall bring you the
Star Seeds--

00:17:18.605 --> 00:17:21.775
No, please! I beg
you, take me instead!

00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:24.545
Enough. You have
done well.

00:17:25.512 --> 00:17:31.018

You are from Planet
Kinmoku.

00:17:50.604 --> 00:17:53.774
Are you the one who
is trying to awaken
the power that could

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:55.475
oppose me, Princess?

00:17:55.943 --> 00:17:56.643

The three of you
cannot defeat Galaxia
with your current powers.

I'll hold her off,
