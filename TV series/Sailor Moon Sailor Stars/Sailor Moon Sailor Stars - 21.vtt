00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:10.844
<i>My dearest Mamo,</i>
<i>It's time for our</i>
<i>annual Fall sports</i>

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:14.047
<i>meet! Curveballs,</i>
<i>forkballs, and</i>
<i>fastballs, oh my!</i>

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.616
<i>I'm gonna do my</i>
<i>best!</i>

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:18.819
<i>Or, that was the plan</i>
<i>anyway... Some Three</i>
<i>Lights fans started</i>

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:22.189
<i>picking on me, so</i>
<i>Seiya's making me</i>
<i>train super hard! I</i>

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:25.759
<i>can't take it!</i>
<i>I'm not even good</i>
<i>at sports!</i>

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:10.697
Do you know what
you're entering for
the sports meet, Usagi?

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:12.232
Hmmm...

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.936
I've never been
good at sports, so I
haven't decided yet.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.405
You're going for
volleyball, right,
Minako?

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:22.276
Of course! And I know
Taiki is, too!

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:23.577
Uhh-

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.547
<i>I'll start the</i>
<i>match with my set of</i>
<i>love... and Taiki</i>

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.019
will do his spike of
love... and then, well--
[exhaling]

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:33.086
Gimme a break...

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.155
Come on, just let her
dream, Usagi.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.592
So which event did
you sign up for?

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:39.693
Mm!

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:41.762
Uh, I chose
basketball, but not
'cause Yaten was

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.064
entering or
anything.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.867
Sounds like you're
planning to score a
slam dunk.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.903
You guys better hope
Ami doesn't find out.

00:02:49.937 --> 00:02:52.306
That you signed up
just for the boys?

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.641
[panicking]

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:55.876
Hey, Ami!

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.478
So? What did you
pick?

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:00.280
Uh- I'm still
undecided!

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:02.516
<i>She's playing</i>
<i>softball with me!</i>

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.817
[grunting]

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.552
Excuse me?!

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:08.355
I already went and
told our Homeroom
Teacher.

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:09.756
W-Wait a sec!

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.558
Oh-ho?

00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:13.794
You must be so
excited.

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:15.162
Knock it off!

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.198
You probably
couldn't decide
what to do anyway.

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:21.468
But I'm not even good
at softball!

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:23.437
Then I'll just have
to train you.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.105
Wait, train me?!

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:28.242
Ha! Celebrities sure
have lots of free
time...

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:32.145
You should be grateful.
I'm using my precious
time just for you.

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:34.748
Oh okay, how
generous of you!

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.385
What makes them so
special that they get
to hang out with Seiya?!

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.753
Not fair!

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:40.921
Don't worry, girls.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:41.622
Huh?

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.524
Sonoko!

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:48.629
I have a plan to get
rid of them. Just
leave this to me.

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:57.237
<i>The Shining Power of</i>
<i>a Star: Chibi-Chibi's</i>
<i>Transformation!</i>

00:03:57.271 --> 00:04:01.141
So... I heard you got
stuck playing
softball with Seiya.

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:04.545
Can you believe it? I
told him I'm not
good.

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:06.813
Well, you should have
turned him down, then!

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:09.550
You already have
Mamoru, remember?

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:12.152
What does Mamo have to
do with any of this?

00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:15.155
You don't even know
how lucky you are, do
you?!

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.957
Uh, Rei? Don't
bother.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.193
Usagi just doesn't
understand Seiya's

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:21.295
star power like
the rest of us.

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:22.529
How rude!

00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:23.730
Hey!

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:24.565
Hm?

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:25.699
Let's get started!

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:27.835
Okay, okay.

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:29.069
[sighing]

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:32.139
Why's he so serious
about this? It's
only a game.

00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:34.675
Guess he's aiming
for first place.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.643
<i>I'm sure that's</i>
<i>the intention.</i>

00:04:36.677 --> 00:04:37.477
Huh?

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:39.913
It's Yaten and
Taiki!

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:40.647
Hi.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.383
Seiya hates
losing. A lot.

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:46.386
Well, that's too
bad because I doubt
they're gonna win.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.387
Why's that?

00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:50.490
Oh, I think you'll
find out soon
enough.

00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:52.626
Hey, Bun-head! You
ready?

00:04:53.327 --> 00:04:55.295
Yeah!

00:04:57.064 --> 00:04:58.265
You're mine!

00:04:58.632 --> 00:04:59.466
Oh!

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.667
Uh!

00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:02.936
Ahhhhhh--

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.938
[yelling]

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:06.273
Seriously?

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:08.208
[groaning]

00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:10.444
She's worse than I
thought.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.012
[laughing]

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.681
Yeah, she's
awful!

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:16.717
Are you all right?!

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.821
Yeah, I'm--uh--
not okay at all.

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:23.690
You've played
softball before,
haven't you?

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:26.126
I have, but I
forgot how.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.594
You're kidding me.

00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:29.463
<i>[laughing]</i>

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.765
Huh?

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:34.368
<i>You're really</i>
<i>teaming up with Seiya</i>
<i>while having that</i>

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:39.072
<i>level of skill?</i>
<i>That's the funniest</i>
<i>thing I've ever heard.</i>

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:41.675
That red Love Love
Three Lights
banner!

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:43.177
There's no mistake!

00:05:44.378 --> 00:05:47.247
<i>That's Sonoko</i>
<i>Ijyuin from third</i>
<i>year class two.</i>

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:49.783
<i>She's the captain</i>
<i>of the softball team</i>
<i>and leader of the</i>

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:52.953
<i>Three Light Support</i>
<i>Community. Not to</i>
<i>mention she's</i>

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:55.088
<i>number one in the fan</i>
<i>club!</i>

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:57.057
Wait, seriously?!

00:05:57.658 --> 00:05:59.126
[admiring]

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.962
[laughing and struggling]

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:04.765
Sorry, girls. I'm a
little tied up now.

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:08.001
While we realize
we're overstepping
our boundaries...

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:10.504
<i>We've reached the</i>
<i>limit of our</i>
<i>patience...</i>

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:13.841
... of seeing you date
that annoying girl!

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:14.641
What?!

00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:18.078
We're not dating!
I already have a
boyfriend who's way

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:19.947
better than Seiya!

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.015
Way better than
Seiya?

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.550
[yelling]

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:25.986
[grunting]

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:27.421
What was that for?

00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:29.823
It's not a good
idea to provoke
them.

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:32.025
They're scary when
they're angry.

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.860
[grunting]

00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:34.261
For the record...

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:38.632
If Seiya had a proper
girlfriend, we'd
gladly show support,

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:39.399
however...

00:06:39.433 --> 00:06:41.935
Instead, he likes
that doofus.

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:43.504
What did you just
say?!

00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:44.171
[grunting]

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:46.073
How could we convince
you?

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:50.410
What would you say to
resolving this issue
with a softball match?

00:06:50.444 --> 00:06:51.411
Go on...

00:06:51.445 --> 00:06:54.014
If we beat you in the
upcoming sports meet,

00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:57.050
I want you to cut off
all ties with that girl.

00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:59.353
And what happens if
we win?

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:04.057
If you win, then
we'll give you two
our full blessing.

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:08.061
Sounds fair. We
accept. Bring it!

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.063
Don't decide
for me!

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:12.866
I believe we have a
deal then.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.672
I look forward to the
day we settle this
matter. [laughing]

00:07:18.705 --> 00:07:20.240
Are you even
listening?!

00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:22.209
Huh?

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.711
Why are we doing
this? We're not
dating!

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:25.913
Usagi!

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:26.847
Hey!

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.515
This is your chance!

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:29.283
Hm?!

00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:31.218
Even if you give
this your all...

00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:32.886
... there's no way
you can win.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.354
Gee, thanks.

00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:37.191
Meaning, you can
finally get rid of
Seiya.

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:40.494
And we'll gladly
take him off your
hands when you do.

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:41.361
Listen here...

00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:42.296
<i>Bun-head!</i>

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:43.297
What?!

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:45.866
We'll be fine. All we
gotta do is show them

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:47.034
the power of
our love!

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:48.435
Show 'em what?

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.338
Now, what do you say
we get back to
training?

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:52.539
Yeah!

00:07:52.573 --> 00:07:54.041
Yeah.

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:58.812
Sailor Aluminum
Siren. Have you
been able to find

00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:00.614
a true Star Seed yet?

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:01.548
No...

00:08:01.582 --> 00:08:02.783
Uh!

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:03.584
No?

00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:05.485
Master Galaxia!

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.720
She's doing her
best--

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:08.155
Was I speaking to
you?

00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:10.691
Please, forgive me!

00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:14.828
I despise
incompetence. Do you
understand?

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:18.532
Yes. I'll do my
best, Master Galaxia.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.673
[grunting]

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:28.742
What's wrong? On
your feet!

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:30.043
Chibi-Chibi!

00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:32.279
But I'm
too tired.

00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:34.281
Doesn't it make your
blood boil?!

00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:35.482
Doesn't it?!

00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:37.951
You're gonna let
her call you a stupid
girl who's not good

00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:38.819
enough for me?

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.787
Chibi?

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:43.023
She didn't call me
stupid...

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:45.158
Are you gonna let her
break us up?!

00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:47.427
We are not dating,
okay?!

00:08:47.461 --> 00:08:50.264
Looks like you've
got enough energy
to keep going!

00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:52.566
Hey, wait a minute,
that's no fair!

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:53.534
Heads up!

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:55.569
[screaming]

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:00.107
Good work, bun head.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.441
Thank you, Seiya!

00:09:01.475 --> 00:09:02.442
Thank you!

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.211
So, how was it?

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:06.713
Way too intense for a
girl like me.

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.283
[gasping]

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:11.585
How pretty!

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:15.522
Did you know? Every
living being that
exists in this

00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:19.026
universe carries a
shining star within
them.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.128
A shining star?

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:24.631
It's a saying from a
far-off place.

00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:28.502
We all have one. That
includes you and me.

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:29.503
Chibi-Chibi?

00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:31.772
Yeah, you too kiddo.

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:33.707
[giggling]

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.011
The stronger
someone's spark is,
the brighter they shine.

00:09:38.045 --> 00:09:41.515
<i>I've noticed yours</i>
<i>is especially bright.</i>

00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:44.818
Your bad pickup lines
aren't gonna work
on me!

00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:46.887
No, I'm being
serious.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.989
Serious about
seducing me?

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:50.691
Stop joking!

00:09:50.724 --> 00:09:55.028
Listen. I don't
wanna see that spark
in you fade away.

00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:57.764
That's the main
reason I want us to
win.

00:09:57.798 --> 00:09:59.233
Yeah, but...

00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:02.236
Sonoko's the
softball team
captain. She's

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:06.740
better than I'll
ever be. I can tell
just by looking at her.

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.543
Sorry, but it's
hopeless.

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:10.611
<i>You can't give up!</i>

00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:12.346
But...

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:15.349
If you give up,
then you've
already lost.

00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:16.483
Yeah, you lose!

00:10:16.517 --> 00:10:20.153
It seems like the
little one gets what
I mean.

00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:23.557
By the way, I...
don't give up so
easily.

00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:27.728
Don't give up
easily, huh?

00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:31.565
<i>I actually like the</i>
<i>sound that. Thanks,</i>
<i>Seiya.</i>

00:10:56.023 --> 00:10:59.193
<i>The last match of the</i>
<i>Juban High School</i>
<i>Sports Meet softball</i>

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:00.961

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.130
<i>Hey! What are you</i>
<i>doing?!</i>

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:05.299
Advancing to the
finals are...

00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:08.735
...our very own first
year, class one and
third year, class two,

00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:11.205
led by Sonoko
Ijyuin!

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:13.607
Which of our two
teams will the
goddess of victory

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.142
smile down upon?

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:18.078
Speaking of
goddesses, I'm
your commentator,

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:21.114
Minako Aino. Joining
me here is...

00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:23.083
The lovely Rei Hino!

00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:24.484
What the...?

00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:28.956
Are you sure there's
really a person with
a true Star Seed

00:11:28.989 --> 00:11:30.357
inside this place?

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.560
There's someone
nearby with a passion
for sports.

00:11:33.594 --> 00:11:35.162
She's a softball
star.

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.364
Well, if you
say so.

00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:38.966
[grunting]
Listen.

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:41.602
Can you not eat while
I'm talking to you?!

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:43.604
Did you want one?

00:11:43.637 --> 00:11:44.605
Oh, come on!

00:11:44.638 --> 00:11:47.341
Do you understand the
position you're in, Aya?!

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.042
If you don't
produce results--

00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:50.744
<i>Don't worry</i>
<i>about me.</i>

00:11:50.777 --> 00:11:52.646
Things'll work out
just fine.

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:53.780
[grunting]

00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:56.316
I don't even know
why I bother.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.319
Anyway, leave the
Star Seed to me this
time. I'll make

00:11:59.353 --> 00:12:02.456
sure things gets
done. You just eat
your potato chips.

00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:03.423
Right field!

00:12:03.457 --> 00:12:07.294
[struggling]

00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:10.097
Uh-oh! Tsukino has
fumbled yet again!

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.467
It doesn't look
like all that training
did very much...

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.435
Don't worry, okay?

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:17.104
I'm sorry.

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:21.175
<i>Seiya takes out yet</i>
<i>another batter to</i>
<i>close out the inning!</i>

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:23.343
<i>It's still</i>
<i>anyone's game, folks.</i>

00:12:23.377 --> 00:12:26.980
<i>But Ijyuin is making</i>
<i>some great pitches of</i>
<i>her own. No one can</i>

00:12:27.014 --> 00:12:27.981
<i>touch the ball!</i>

00:12:28.015 --> 00:12:30.017

<i>the final inning with</i>

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:46.567

<i>It just started</i>

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.434

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:49.169

[chatting]

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.608
<i>I'm sorry, Seiya.</i>

00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:55.342
Why?

00:12:56.343 --> 00:12:57.911
You practiced with me
to help me get better,

00:12:57.945 --> 00:12:59.546
but I'm
still bad.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.348
Don't worry
about it.

00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:01.915
[groaning]

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:03.617
<i>Cheer up, Usagi!</i>

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.351
Hm?

00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:06.320
You don't wanna lose,
right?

00:13:06.353 --> 00:13:08.655
Then all you
have to do is
your best.

00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:09.690
That's right!

00:13:09.723 --> 00:13:11.892
I agree. Hang in
there.

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:13.760
We won't let you
date Seiya,

00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:16.363
but we will root
for you to win.

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:17.331
You guys.

00:13:17.364 --> 00:13:19.299
Chibi-Chibi!

00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:21.502
Are you cheering me
on now, too?

00:13:21.535 --> 00:13:22.803
No, pee-pee.

00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:24.838
Oh, gotta go
potty!

00:13:24.872 --> 00:13:26.340
[grunting]

00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:27.140
Bun-head.

00:13:27.174 --> 00:13:28.575
Hm?

00:13:28.609 --> 00:13:30.043
Let's win this.

00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:31.478
Yeah!

00:13:31.512 --> 00:13:32.946
[giggling]

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.548
Can you go
on your own?

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:35.282
<i>Uh-huh!</i>

00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:40.420
I wonder if the
rain'll stop.

00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:41.288
<i>It will.</i>

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:41.922
Huh?

00:13:41.955 --> 00:13:43.390
Sonoko!

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:46.727
I'll be up to bat in the
final inning when the
game resumes.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.864
I already know where
Seiya will pitch the
ball. So get ready

00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:53.133
because I'm hitting
it towards you.

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:56.603
I'm still gonna
try, though.

00:13:57.538 --> 00:13:58.505
Uh-

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.575
Even though Seiya
helped me practice,
I'm no better at

00:14:01.608 --> 00:14:05.279
softball than I was
before... And I'm
pretty sure you like

00:14:05.312 --> 00:14:08.582
him way more than I
do. He's just a
friend to me.

00:14:08.615 --> 00:14:12.786
But still, I don't
want to lose this
match!

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:15.455
Seiya spent time
helping me get
better...

00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:18.325
So I'm doing it for
him and for myself.

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:19.826
Chibi-Chibi.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.662
Uh!

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:22.563
Are you done?

00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:24.064
Chibi!

00:14:25.265 --> 00:14:26.266
Tsukino.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.067
Yeah?

00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:30.204
You know, I was
wrong about you. Good
luck out there.

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:32.105
Thanks!

00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:34.341
So are you ready to
head back?

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:34.942
Head back!

00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:36.443
Well, see ya out
there!

00:14:37.778 --> 00:14:42.149
So she wants to win.
She does have a spark
to her, it seems.

00:14:42.182 --> 00:14:43.984
Not as bright as
yours.

00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:46.053
Who are you?!

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.655

That's Sonoko!

00:14:51.158 --> 00:14:53.327
Chibi-chibi. You stay
here!

00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:54.461
Huh?

00:14:55.662 --> 00:14:59.566
This is awful... The
downpour soaked my
precious suit.

Hold it right there!

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.288

And in the name of
the Moon, I'll punish
you!

You again?! Why don't

No, don't!

[panting]

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:27.614
Where do you think
you're going,
little lady?

00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:29.449
Chibi-Chibi!

00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:30.617
Don't hurt her!

00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:31.685
Get over here!

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:33.720
Chibi!

00:17:33.754 --> 00:17:35.389
No!

00:17:35.422 --> 00:17:37.424
Chibi!

Ooh!

00:17:48.869 --> 00:17:50.337
What's this
light?!

00:17:56.977 --> 00:17:59.213

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:01.515
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>It feels so...</i>

00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:03.217
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>...warm.</i>

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.453
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>Almost like a...</i>

00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:08.655
It's the birth of a
new star...!

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:10.657
This energy...

00:18:10.691 --> 00:18:12.125
The princess?

00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:15.696
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>The light that could</i>
<i>change my fate?</i>

00:18:15.729 --> 00:18:19.032
<i>To think, it was</i>

<i>this time!</i>

00:18:24.872 --> 00:18:27.007
It's so warm...

[gasping]

00:18:29.076 --> 00:18:32.012
Chibi-Chibi...
you're a--

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:34.748
Sailor Guardian,
too?

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:36.183
Chibi.

00:18:37.251 --> 00:18:38.285
Uh-

00:18:46.293 --> 00:18:49.129
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>Her energy feels</i>

00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:52.332

<i>Tell me,</i>
<i>Chibi-Chibi,</i>

Uh!

00:19:00.507 --> 00:19:01.542
[gasping]

00:19:04.678 --> 00:19:08.248
Giving me that scary
look... changes
nothing.

00:19:08.282 --> 00:19:12.619
Alright, Miss Sailor
Leaguer! Neutralize
them!

00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:14.655
Sure, coach!
They're mine!

00:19:15.689 --> 00:19:17.424
Chibi-Chibi!

00:19:17.457 --> 00:19:18.692
You got it!

00:19:42.983 --> 00:19:45.018
Silver Moon...

00:19:52.059 --> 00:19:57.164
...Crystal Power
Kiss!

00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:06.707
[screaming]
Beautiful!

00:20:13.146 --> 00:20:15.148
You're good, I'll
admit.

[grunting]

00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:19.453
Guess it's time...
for me to get
serious!

<i>Hold it right there!</i>

00:20:22.089 --> 00:20:24.091
Sailor Star Lights!

00:20:24.124 --> 00:20:27.060
It seems that we have
even more uninvited
guests...

00:20:27.094 --> 00:20:28.362
Let's finish this!

00:20:29.563 --> 00:20:32.032
I'll have to take a
rain check. See you
next time.

00:20:32.499 --> 00:20:33.300
Farewell!

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:37.171
What in the world
happened here?

00:20:37.204 --> 00:20:38.005
Uh--

00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:41.642
Honestly? I'm not
really sure myself.

00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:42.009
[groaning]

00:20:42.042 --> 00:20:43.143
[giggling]

00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:46.013
Not sure! Not sure!

00:20:47.514 --> 00:20:51.185
<i>The stalemate has</i>
<i>finally been broken!</i>
<i>Seiya from our</i>

<i>first-year class</i>
<i>managed to hit a</i>
<i>homerun!</i>

00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:55.522
However!

00:20:55.556 --> 00:20:58.458
<i>The other team has</i>
<i>runners on second and</i>
<i>third. One hit could</i>

<i>turn the tide!</i>

00:20:59.326 --> 00:21:01.728
Uh-oh. Look who's
up to bat!

00:21:04.298 --> 00:21:06.867
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>This is it...</i>
<i>Seiya.</i>

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.035
<i>Tsukino!</i>

00:21:08.368 --> 00:21:10.103
[grunting]

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.072
[yelling]

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:15.375
She hit it! The ball
is heading straight
to right field!

00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:16.577
Usagi!

00:21:17.845 --> 00:21:20.013
<i>÷[{thinking÷]}</i>
<i>This is it! I'll</i>
<i>catch it! I have to!</i>

00:21:20.047 --> 00:21:22.282
Bun-head! You got it!

00:21:22.316 --> 00:21:24.384
[yelling]

00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:26.186
<i>Reach!</i>

[grunting]

00:21:34.194 --> 00:21:35.462
Hm?

00:21:35.495 --> 00:21:37.064
I caught it!

00:21:37.097 --> 00:21:38.699
[cheering]
Yeah!

00:21:38.732 --> 00:21:42.870
<i>What a play! First</i>
<i>year, Class one wins</i>
<i>thanks to Usagi Tsukino!</i>

00:21:42.903 --> 00:21:45.405
<i>She did it!</i>

00:21:45.439 --> 00:21:48.842
And so, we ended up
winning the sports
event, Mamo. Pretty

00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:54.081
<i>amazing, huh?</i>
<i>Aren't you proud?</i>
<i>P. S. You don't need</i>

00:21:54.114 --> 00:21:57.184
<i>to worry about me,</i>
<i>'cause I'm doing</i>
<i>just fine.</i>

00:23:36.683 --> 00:23:38.185
A movie screening?!

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:40.854
We're renting out
a plane for our fan
club members to watch

00:23:40.888 --> 00:23:42.556
a movie starring us.

00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:43.657
<i>I wanna go too!</i>

00:23:44.725 --> 00:23:46.460
Sorry, Bun-head.
You're not a member,
so you can't.

00:23:46.493 --> 00:23:47.661
<i>But I wanna go!</i>

00:23:47.694 --> 00:23:51.231
Well, maybe I can
prepare a special
room, just for the

00:23:51.265 --> 00:23:51.932
two of us.

00:23:51.965 --> 00:23:53.800
<i>Ugh- No thank you!</i>

00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:57.171
<i>Next time on Sailor</i>
<i>Stars: Invitation to</i>
<i>Terror:</i>

00:23:57.204 --> 00:23:58.972
Usagi's Night Flight.

<i>The moonlight is a</i>
