<i>Dearest Mamo,</i>
<i>Listen to this: Rei</i>
<i>is posing as a</i>

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.749
<i>fortune teller so she</i>
<i>can find out Seiya</i>

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.084
<i>you believe her?!</i>

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:22.189
<i>Huh? Who does my</i>
<i>heart belong to, you</i>
<i>ask? ÷[{chuckling]</i>

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.691
<i>You'll just have to</i>
<i>watch and find out!</i>

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.101
Fighter Star Power
Make Up!

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.670
<i>Seiya?!</i>

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:28.849
<i>Duty or Friendship:</i>
<i>Conflict Between the</i>
<i>Sailor Guardians!</i>

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:33.420
I guess Seiya, Yaten,
and Taiki chose not to
come to school today.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.023
It's fine! I'm sure
they'll show up
tomorrow!

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:37.724
Do you really think
so?

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.059
Eh-em!

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.961
[sighing]

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.029
Oh! You're Right!

00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:43.697
Yeah, don't worry!

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.268
But can you believe
that the Three Lights
were actually girls

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:51.405
this whole time?
There goes my shot at
a famous boyfriend!

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:53.941
Yeah, but we're
still friends with
them. After all, it

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:55.709
doesn't change who
they are, right?

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.110
Eh--

00:02:57.144 --> 00:02:59.513
There are more
important things to
worry about here!

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:00.314
[grunting]

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:02.082
W-What?

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.918
I assume they have a
good reason for
hiding their true

00:03:04.952 --> 00:03:07.888
identities. And
also for becoming
idols.

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:11.458
It does make me
wonder why they came
here from outside the

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:12.659
solar system.

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:16.063
Usagi... What's
wrong?

00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:21.001
Well, I guess I'm
still in shock about
all of this.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.236
In shock?

00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:25.639
It felt like we were
starting to get along
with those three

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.374
pretty well, but
in the end,

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:29.610
we knew nothing
about each other.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.478
Yeah, you're
right.

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:33.780
Well, we didn't
actually tell them
anything about

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:35.249
our secrets,
either.

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:52.432
<i>Bun-head!</i>

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:56.370
I--

00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:06.480
Oh?

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:09.016
Why are you sitting
alone in the dark?

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:17.624
Seiya! Snap
out of it!

00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:18.392
Uh?

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.061
Oh, uh, sorry. What
was that?

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:24.431
Listen, now's not
the time to be zoning
out, okay?

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:25.766
Did you forget?

00:04:30.838 --> 00:04:32.105
[exhaling]

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.108
You remember our top
priority, don't
you?

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:39.012
Yeah... it's to
find our princess.

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.214
That's right.

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.018
But the problem is
those five girls keep
showing up.

00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:47.221
Maybe its not a
problem.

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:52.459
Every time they cause
a scene out there, it
draws Galaxia's

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:54.995
attention further
away from us.

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:57.231
That's a good
point.

00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:02.769
In fact, it would be
much better for us if
the battle between

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:05.339
Sailor Moon and
Galaxia escalated.

00:05:05.372 --> 00:05:06.406
Thats enough!

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:13.547
Those girls are
putting their lives
on the line in order

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.882
to protect their
planet!

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:18.552
And you guys intend
on using them?! You
should be ashamed!

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:23.023
I see. So
that's it.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:23.991
[gasping]

00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:26.393
You're just mad
'cause you're
worried about that

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:27.561
girl, aren't you?

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:28.462
What?!

00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:31.064
Humph! Well, I'm
right, aren't I?

00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:32.566
Knock it off,
both of you.

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.034
[grunting]

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:38.138
Look, I know you're
getting so defensive
about Sailor Moon

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:40.574
because you see too
much of our princess
in her.

00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:43.810
There is only one
princess for us, Seiya.

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:46.046
Please remember that.

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:48.348
Hm.

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:07.234
I, Sailor Tin Nyanko,
along with Crow
here...

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:08.535
Mm.

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.071
... have agreed to
team up so that we
could hopefully be of

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:14.908
greater use to you,
Master Galaxia.
Isn't that right?

00:06:14.942 --> 00:06:16.276
Excuse me?

00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:18.378
Mm.

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:22.216
You do remember our
agreement, don't
you, Crow?

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:23.183
Come on!

00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:27.221
No, wait! Please,
forgive me!

00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:29.156
That planet...

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.857
Huh?

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:30.557
Huh?

00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:33.727
<i>Oh, the solar system.</i>

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.762
That third planet
there.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.967
I sense a huge wave
of power from it.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.003
Huh? From that remote
planet? No way!

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:47.808
I plan to conquer the
entire galaxy and no
one shall interfere.

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:49.810
Oh, right. Yes of
course.

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:53.380
I refuse to even
allow the existence
of those who oppose

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:57.251
me. That entire
planet could die for
all I care.

00:06:57.284 --> 00:07:00.821
Hurry and bring me
every last Star Seed
you find there.

00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:02.623
There is not a
moment to lose.

00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:04.525
Hm.

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:06.126
Just as you wish.

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:08.929
[grunting]

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:11.331
Ugh, how annoying!

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:14.401
Just when I thought
this job couldn't
get any worse.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:17.838
And that Crow chick
doesn't seem too
useful either.

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:19.339
The hell this?

00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:22.676
Once trash, always
trash.

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:27.447
Excuse me, what are
you doing?

00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:30.884
Oh look, Trash Part
2. Can't you tell?

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:32.653
I'm getting rid
of garbage.

00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:34.054
What? How dare you?!

00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:37.457
Siren took her job
seriously until her
last breath!

00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:38.525
Yeah, right.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:41.962
Master Galaxia killed
her off because she
was a loser who

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:44.831
couldn't complete
the task she was
assigned.

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:46.033
[grunting]

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:49.336

<i>careful, then</i>
<i>it's likely</i>

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:51.138
<i>you'll end up the</i>
<i>same way.</i>

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:54.174
Just shut up!

00:07:55.676 --> 00:07:59.613
Listen... No need to
get worked up.

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:06.486
You'll see. I'm
going to prove you
wrong about Siren.

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:11.291
Yep, she's gonna be
as useless as I
thought.

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:19.099
<i>Visit Fuku-Fuku</i>
<i>Department Store's</i>

<i>area and enter a</i>
<i>world of mystery.</i>

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:25.572
Can't believe
Grandpa volunteered
me for this job

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:28.475
without asking.
And what's with
this weird get up?

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:30.978
If someone from
school sees me
like this,

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.613
then my life
is over.

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:33.881
<i>Um...</i>

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:35.115
You open?

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:37.584
O-Oh! Come in.

00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:42.089
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>Wow, he's pretty</i>
<i>cute.</i>

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:48.595
<i>Seiya?! Of course I</i>
<i>see someone I know</i>
<i>right away.</i>

00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:55.936
You see, I keep
thinking about
this girl.

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:58.772
<i>Could he be talking</i>
<i>about Usagi?!</i>

00:08:58.805 --> 00:09:02.876
One who I've
actually been lying
to for some time now.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.078
I was going to tell
her the truth,

00:09:05.112 --> 00:09:07.781
but she found out
before I had a
chance to.

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:12.152
<i>What do I do? He's</i>
<i>confessing things I</i>
<i>can't help him with!</i>

00:09:12.186 --> 00:09:14.888
It's obvious my
friends aren't
happy about me being

00:09:14.922 --> 00:09:17.424
distracted by how I
feel about all this.

00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:20.594
But it's not like I
don't already know
that this isn't the

00:09:20.627 --> 00:09:22.262
time to get
sidetracked.

00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:27.534
And besides... She
may not even decide
to forgive me for

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.236
lying to her.

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:31.939
But all I wanna do is
see her again!

00:09:31.972 --> 00:09:34.741
I just... don't know
what to do anymore.

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:43.317
[chuckling]
I'm an idiot.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.520
Seeking out an
answer from some
fortune teller.

00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:49.857
Well... sorry.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.624
Wait!

<i>Crap. But I can't</i>
<i>let him leave like</i>
<i>this.</i>

If you could please
sit back down, sir.

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:03.070
<i>Great. Now what</i>
<i>do I do?</i>

00:10:04.338 --> 00:10:07.441
<i>It wouldn't be a</i>
<i>problem, if I had an</i>
<i>answer for this.</i>

00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:13.146
Do you see something?

00:10:16.517 --> 00:10:18.652
The answer
that you seek.

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:19.486
[gasping]

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.058
It's--

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:27.761
Unclear.

[grunting]

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.833
It's important that
you be sincere.

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:36.470
If you truly feel bad
about lying, then go
apologize to this

00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:39.606
girl. I think
that's a good place
for you to start.

00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:42.676
Ya know...

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:43.443
Hm?

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:47.481
You got a pretty keen
eye there.

00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:50.384
It was silly of me to
go straight to a
fortune teller

00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:52.953
instead of just doing
what needed to be
done.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:56.523
But I'm glad that I
did, 'cause you helped
me see the light.

00:10:57.024 --> 00:10:58.425
So Thank you.

00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:08.435
I almost had a heart
attack. Can I go
home yet?!

00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:09.536
[panicking]

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.737

Well, something
kind of awkward
happened recently and

00:11:44.304 --> 00:11:46.573
I wanted to talk to
him about it in
person, but he

00:11:46.607 --> 00:11:50.410
hasn't been at
school. I don't
know what to do.

00:11:50.444 --> 00:11:52.779
You're better at
taking action than
you are at thinking,

00:11:52.813 --> 00:11:56.617
right? So just do the
first thing that
comes to your mind.

Telling yourself
you can't find him
without even trying

00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:16.436
is merely an excuse!

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.206
You're worried that
he might reject you
or refuse to talk to

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.675
you. But if you're
afraid and keep
running away,

00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:25.412
you'll only end up
losing what's
really important!

is it you know so
much about me?!

having the courage to
do what needs to be

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:41.395
done. You can dwell
on what he thinks
after you go see him

been on your mind.
