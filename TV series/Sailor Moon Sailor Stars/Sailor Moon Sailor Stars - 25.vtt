00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:11.712
<i>(Usagi) Dearest Mamo. I heard</i>
there's going to be a video game
<i>event happening today.</i>

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:15.415
<i>You get to play all the games</i>
you want and meet a famous game
<i>idol.</i>

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.652
<i>Even Taiki will be making a</i>
<i>live appearance!</i>

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.622
It's too bad I'm not in the mood
<i>for it, Mamo.</i>

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:25.392
<i>It'd be so much better if you</i>
<i>were here to help cheer me up.</i>

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.667
Hm?

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.173
Chibi-Chibi?

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:37.991
[panting]

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.228
Hm.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.510
Ooh.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:22.569
(Usagi) "Butterflies of Light: A
<i>New Chapter on the Horizon."</i>

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:29.843
It can't be.

00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:32.079
No, it's definitely hers!

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:34.481
It's the energy of our
princess!

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:41.622
It's gone!

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:45.592
It was faint but I'm absolutely
certain that it was the
princess's energy.

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:49.329
If it really was her, that
means she has to be nearby.

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:59.206
[gasps] What?!

00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:04.511
<i>(Sailor Tin Nyanko) Master</i>
<i>Galaxia?</i>

00:04:04.545 --> 00:04:08.182
It disappeared, but it was
definitely hers.

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:09.683
Is there something the matter?

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:11.218
Silence! Be quiet!

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.119
Meow.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.493
It's the energy waves of the
one who opposes me. So she
must be close to awakening.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:38.545
(Usagi) I had no idea about the
<i>Star Lights' planet.</i>

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.648

Chibi.

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:03.937
Hi Usagi, how are you?

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.707
Hey, there's a video game
event going on today.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.277
You wanna go? We can play all
the games we want for free!

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.513
You should come with us it'll be
super fun!

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.081
Chibi?

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.318
That's nice, but I'm not
really in the mood for any
games right now.

00:05:18.352 --> 00:05:23.190
Oh all right, well I hope you
can at least get some rest
today.

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:28.028
But listen! If you end up
changing your mind, feel free
to come and join us, okay?!

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:31.899
So, what'd she say?

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:33.567
She's not in the mood right
now.

00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:37.237
I was hoping our invitation to
play video games would help
cheer Usagi up.

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:39.907
Her depression seems to have
gotten worse these past few
days.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.612
It's true. Ever since she
went to go see The Three Lights
concert she's been so quiet.

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:47.080
She's hardly talked to anyone.

00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:48.715
The Three Lights, huh?

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:54.121
I don't know why but they
really hate Usagi.

00:05:56.056 --> 00:06:01.061
You're the reason for everything
bad that's happened to us,
Sailor Moon!

00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:04.331
But Usagi's wants to be their
friend.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:08.068
Yeah exactly. Why can't they see
that?

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:11.305
Isn't there any way we can
make them understand?

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:15.876
How can we make them
understand when they won't
even see us anymore?

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.147
I was meaning to tell you girls
about this sooner but I tried
emailing...

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.052
Taiki just the other day.
Actually I did it through his
official fan club page.

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:27.721
Huh?! Really?! So what did he
say?!

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:31.925
I asked him to write back but
I haven't heard anything.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:37.130
Wow it almost sounds like you
were writing him a love letter,
Ami. You're quite the sly one!

00:06:37.164 --> 00:06:40.400
No it's not like that. Can we
please stay on topic here?!

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:45.572
We can't let it go on like
this. I'm sure that Seiya and
the others will understand.

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:46.807
Mhm.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.275
Yeah you're right, Ami.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.612
Let's create an opportunity
where we can get together and
talk things out.

00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:52.846
Good idea.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.414
Yeah, let's give it a shot!

00:06:54.448 --> 00:06:55.549
Mhm.

00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:00.721
[sighs] Still no reply.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:05.058
It looks like there's no use
in sending emails through
their fan club page then.

00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:07.794
Maybe they got it and they're
just ignoring it.

00:07:07.828 --> 00:07:09.196
[sighs]

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.267
There's got to be another way
we can reach them. Huh?!

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.435
<i>(Minako) Hey, this article</i>

events today, so have fun
everyone!

And later, you can look forward
to a special present from both
of us!

All right, let's go!

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.298
Yeah!

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:46.500
You're really wearing those
silly outfits?

Come on Ami. This is how it
always works at game
conventions!

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.871
Hurry up and change!

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:52.439

Woohoo! Taiki!

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.313
Guess we're not the only ones
with that plan.

00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:05.419
(Ami) [sighs] He's so close but
<i>we can't even get near him.</i>

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:08.822
We've got to do whatever it
takes to stand out in the crowd!

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:10.958
Yeah we just have to get
Taiki's attention!

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.993
Ami! Hurry up and go change
already!

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:14.561
No, no, no, no, no, no!

games!

(Ami) Special attacks. Nine-hit
<i>combos.</i>

What do you say Ami, you think
you can manage?

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:55.302
I don't know, I've never
played a fighting game before.

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:58.405
But I think I've got most of
the basic moves down for
this game.

Is that Ami?

00:10:18.619 --> 00:10:21.154
Please go ahead and introduce
yourselves!

00:10:21.188 --> 00:10:24.424
I'm Ami Mizuno, a first year
high school student.

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:27.027
I'm here today because I
had to meet Ko Taiki.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.665
I see, so you're a big fan of
Ko Taiki, huh? Best of luck to
you!

00:10:31.698 --> 00:10:35.335
I'm Yukihide Obayashi, known
as the Fighting Wolf.

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:39.139
I've never lost a video game
match to anyone, I mean...

00:10:39.173 --> 00:10:41.241
...especially not to some idiot
fangirl!

00:10:41.275 --> 00:10:45.245
<i>(Emcee) We haven't even begun</i>
<i>and things are already getting</i>
<i>pretty intense!</i>

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:51.518
Now it's time to get this game
started! Let's begin by having
you select your characters!

00:10:54.054 --> 00:10:56.523
This one will easily kick
her butt!

00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:01.461
Then I'll go with this
character!

00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:04.631
Ready set go!

00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:13.440
<i>She's such an amateur. There's</i>
<i>no way she can beat me with</i>
<i>that character!</i>

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:17.744
If I beat him, I can meet Taiki.
<i>I've got to win at all costs!</i>

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:22.216
<i>She's actually pretty good!</i>

00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:25.786
[screaming and cheering]

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:29.523
<i>I have to win! I have to meet</i>
<i>with Taiki and make him</i>
<i>understand!</i>

[grunting]

00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:35.996
<i>I have to win! I just have</i>
<i>to!!</i>

00:11:38.565 --> 00:11:39.533
I did it!

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:40.467
[gasps]

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:45.372
(Emcee) K. O.! Ami Mizuno is the
<i>winner!</i>

00:11:45.405 --> 00:11:46.640
Impossible.

00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:48.575
She did it! All right!

00:11:48.609 --> 00:11:52.579
Thank you. Good match. It was
nice playing with you.

00:11:52.613 --> 00:11:54.815
And now the moment we've all
been waiting for.

00:11:54.848 --> 00:11:59.052
Ko Taiki will present our winner
with the commemorative shield
and prize!

00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:01.154
Congratulations.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.224
Huh?

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:07.494
Taiki, please, we need to
talk.

00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:42.029
So go ahead. I'm listening.

00:12:42.062 --> 00:12:44.798
I wanted to talk with you
about Usagi.

00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:49.102
Oh well if that's the case,
then I'm not interested. You
can leave now.

00:12:49.136 --> 00:12:53.340
No. I won't leave until you
hear me out. Please!

00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:58.512
Fine then let's get it over
with.

00:12:58.545 --> 00:13:02.549
Taiki, please give Usagi
another chance to explain.

00:13:02.583 --> 00:13:05.919
She isn't the one who's causing
any of your problems.

00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:11.124
She's an honest and kind-hearted
girl who brings joy and love to
everyone around her!

00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:17.431
Maybe that's how she is with
you girls, but that's definitely
not what she represents to us.

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:20.634
The fact that she almost got
Seiya killed not once but
twice...

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:23.237
just proves that Usagi's nothing
but trouble.

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:26.240
You really believe that?

00:13:26.573 --> 00:13:27.441
Uh.

00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:32.212
Because what you said just now
didn't sound like you really
meant it.

00:13:32.246 --> 00:13:38.552
Please, I'm begging you to open
your mind and heart so you can
see Usagi for who she really is!

00:13:38.585 --> 00:13:42.322
She's someone who gives
unconditional love and
compassion to everyone.

00:13:42.356 --> 00:13:45.526
No matter who they are I think
you already know this!

00:13:47.194 --> 00:13:51.765
Yes it is a fact that Seiya got
hurt by trying to protect Usagi
that day.

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:54.134
But I think I know why
he did it.

00:13:54.168 --> 00:13:56.703
Imagine if the roles were
reversed.

00:13:56.737 --> 00:14:00.274
Taiki. If you saw someone that
you cared a lot about...

00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:03.610
and it was clear they were in
great danger, what would you do?

00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:07.915
I'm sure that, you would have
done the same thing.

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:08.682
<i>(Reiko) [scream]</i>

00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:09.449
Huh?

00:14:09.816 --> 00:14:13.654
[scream]

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.526
[sly laugh]

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:30.737
I am Sailor Gamer!

00:14:30.771 --> 00:14:31.939
Hold it right there!

00:14:31.972 --> 00:14:33.006
Who are you?

00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:37.311
How dare you terrorize
everyone's favorite game idol,
Reiko Kanagawa!

00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:39.913
Douse yourself in water, and
repent!

00:14:39.947 --> 00:14:44.284
I hate water, so no thanks.
Sailor Gamer, take care of that
girl!

00:14:45.619 --> 00:14:47.454
Wind Forest Fist!

00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:48.889
Tornado Cooling Fist!

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:54.528
Mercury Aqua Rhapsody!

00:14:56.697 --> 00:15:00.501
Banishing Explosive Kick!

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:04.438
[grunting]

00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:08.475
[grunting]

00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:12.246
Taiki. Wait, don't go.

00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:18.352
<i>It's all for the best. This</i>
<i>planet's problems are none of</i>
<i>our concern.</i>

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.193
Chibi?

00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:28.395
[sigh]

00:15:39.673 --> 00:15:42.309
[sigh] What a nice smell.

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:45.913
Hm?

00:15:45.946 --> 00:15:47.414
Chibi-Chibi!

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.583
Chibi-Chibi, where did you get
that?

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.018
Get that!

00:15:52.219 --> 00:15:55.656
The smell of that incense
burner. It makes me feel calm.

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:57.558
<i>(Usagi) I wonder why?</i>

00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:59.226
Chibi-Chibi.

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:01.728
Mhm. Oh, I almost forgot.

00:16:01.762 --> 00:16:07.301
Let's go check out this video
game event. All the games are
free!

00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:09.703
[grunting]

00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:12.206
[grunting]

00:16:12.606 --> 00:16:14.908
[grunting]

00:16:14.942 --> 00:16:17.544
[chuckles] Are you ready to
give up?

00:16:17.578 --> 00:16:22.449
<i>I can't lose here. I can't</i>
<i>keep relying on Sailor Moon!</i>

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.484
[snickers] I guess not.

00:16:24.518 --> 00:16:28.722
<i>If I do, then it's no</i>
<i>different than being a burden</i>
<i>to Usagi!</i>

00:16:28.755 --> 00:16:31.525
Special Kill: Sonic Beam!

00:16:31.925 --> 00:16:33.160
[gasps]

00:16:33.193 --> 00:16:39.533
Jupiter Oak Evolution!

00:16:43.504 --> 00:16:45.939
You can leave the real battles
to me!

00:16:45.973 --> 00:16:47.808
We're ready to fight some
battles too!

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:52.179
And since today is a special
occasion, I'm gonna fight you
in this outfit!

00:16:52.212 --> 00:16:54.281
You guys are ruining my moment
here.

00:16:54.314 --> 00:16:57.484
Hmph! Your dumb outfits are no
match for me.

00:16:57.518 --> 00:16:58.485
Fullstun!

00:16:58.519 --> 00:16:59.286
[screams]

00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:00.754
Mathunder!

00:17:00.787 --> 00:17:02.289
[screams]

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:04.725
I can't believe you just
abandoned her like that!

00:17:06.827 --> 00:17:10.597
Don't you think we're all
forgetting something important
here?!

00:17:11.765 --> 00:17:14.568
We shouldn't be ignoring someone
who needs our help.

00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:18.172
What would the princess say if
she saw how we were acting?

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:20.407
Hm.

00:17:21.675 --> 00:17:23.544
As far as I'm concerned, what
we've been doing here is wrong!

00:17:26.647 --> 00:17:27.681
I just...

00:17:29.016 --> 00:17:31.685
I just can't do this anymore!

00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:38.091
(Ami) I'm sure that you would've
<i>done the same thing.</i>

00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:43.497
<i>I guess she's right. If I were</i>
<i>in that situation, I'd do the</i>
<i>same thing.</i>

00:17:44.798 --> 00:17:47.734
Taiki! What is it with those
two?

00:17:48.502 --> 00:17:49.436
[attack yell]

00:17:49.469 --> 00:17:50.671
[screams]

00:17:50.704 --> 00:17:53.574
[groaning]

00:17:55.442 --> 00:17:56.977
[grunts]

00:17:58.145 --> 00:17:59.313
<i>I can't lose.</i>

00:17:59.346 --> 00:18:03.517
[chuckles] It's
game over for you!

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.319
<i>I just can't.</i>

00:18:05.352 --> 00:18:06.086
[chuckles]

00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:08.255
<i>No matter what I can't lose!</i>

00:18:09.223 --> 00:18:11.592
This fight is not a game to
me!

00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:24.571
Star Gentle Uterus!

00:18:25.472 --> 00:18:27.040
[screams]

00:18:27.074 --> 00:18:30.010
I can't watch this anymore.

00:18:30.043 --> 00:18:31.612
Let's settle this quickly!

00:18:32.012 --> 00:18:33.046
Please stop!

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:36.216
Listen to me, don't kill her!

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:41.121
Don't be so naive. Your life
is in danger ya know! Fighter?

00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:44.758
You see that? They haven't
given up yet.

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:51.365
They're risking their lives to
save everyone even that Phage.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.604
When we were attacked by
Galaxia, all of us abandoned
our home world.

00:18:57.638 --> 00:19:01.008
But now I wonder was that really
for the best?

00:19:01.041 --> 00:19:04.611
Are you saying we should have
stayed and died along with our
people?

00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:08.415
I'm saying that if we give up,
it's all over.

00:19:10.017 --> 00:19:11.852
<i>(Sailor Moon) Hold it right</i>
<i>there!</i>

00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:13.453
Is that her?

00:19:13.487 --> 00:19:14.855
[quite cheers]

00:19:14.888 --> 00:19:16.256
How dare you!

00:19:17.624 --> 00:19:18.659
These kids spend all their
allowance to play these video
games.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.628
And you're ruining their
favorite pastime. It's
unforgivable!

00:19:21.662 --> 00:19:26.200
I am the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for
justice.

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:32.940
I am Sailor Moon!

00:19:32.973 --> 00:19:37.444
And in the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

00:19:37.477 --> 00:19:38.712
Sailor Moon!

00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:40.013
You made it!

00:19:40.047 --> 00:19:42.115
Now! It's time to lend us your
power!

00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:44.051
[chuckles] Right!

00:20:07.774 --> 00:20:10.110
Silver Moon!

00:20:17.084 --> 00:20:22.155
Crystal Power Kiss!

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:31.365
[screams] Beautiful!

00:20:40.474 --> 00:20:46.079
Now I get it. Sailor Moon truly
<i>is a light of hope to you</i>
<i>people.</i>

00:20:46.113 --> 00:20:49.082
She's got a radiance that
refuses to go out.

00:20:51.151 --> 00:20:54.454
We didn't stand a chance
fighting in our cosplay
outfits.

00:20:54.488 --> 00:20:57.591
Yeah, I sure learned my
lesson! [laughs]

00:20:57.624 --> 00:20:59.760
[laughs] Learned my lesson!

00:20:59.793 --> 00:21:01.128
For the record...

00:21:02.663 --> 00:21:04.531
what happened today doesn't mean
we're ready to accept everything
about you.

00:21:04.565 --> 00:21:06.066
Fair enough.

00:21:07.734 --> 00:21:10.504
But something tells me that
eventually, we will all come to
understand each other.

00:21:17.644 --> 00:21:19.446
Are your wounds ok?

00:21:19.913 --> 00:21:21.815
Yep, don't worry.

00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:22.883
[sigh of relief]

00:21:22.916 --> 00:21:24.785
But thanks a lot, Bun-head.

00:21:24.818 --> 00:21:26.320
[laughs]

00:21:27.354 --> 00:21:28.255
Chibi-Chibi.

00:21:29.556 --> 00:21:32.926
Huh? Yeah, let's go home.
Mom's probably starting to
worry.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.294
Probably!

00:21:34.328 --> 00:21:37.664
[laughs] Awe, don't be in such
a rush. [laughs]

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:40.767
[laughs]

00:21:42.402 --> 00:21:47.174
<i>This scent. It's the princess!</i>
<i>But why is it coming from</i>

00:23:35.983 --> 00:23:38.185
