00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.510
<i>What do I do?</i>

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:12.613
<i>Galaxia's taking</i>
<i>the Star Seeds of</i>
<i>people I care about</i>

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.682
<i>one after another!</i>

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:19.119
<i>Wait a minute... that</i>
<i>golden Star Seed that</i>
<i>she's holding in</i>

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:23.290
<i>her hand. Could it</i>
<i>be... Mamo's?!</i>

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:11.865
<i>Ruler of the Galaxy:</i>
<i>The Menace of</i>
<i>Galaxia.</i>

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:18.739
[chuckling] Beautiful.
The Star Seed that
represents Earth.

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:21.975
It would've been a
waste for this strong
radiance to remain on

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.844
a remote planet.

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.546
The Star Seed...

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.747
... of Earth?

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:28.715
That's right.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.020
Every single being
that lives in the
galaxy carries its

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:34.488
own Star Seed.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.758
But... only
Guardians, with the
energy of the stars,

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:41.228
carry a Star Seed
that shines for
all eternity.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:45.265
[whimpering]
Mars.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.003
Mercury.

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.342
Jupiter.

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:00.480
Venus.

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:05.719
Mamo!

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:13.427
[crying]

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:15.996
Feast your eyes!

00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.132
I will obtain the
Star Seed of each and
every planet and

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:22.569
become Star Galaxia,
conquerer of the
galaxy!

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:26.139
How could you?
How could you
do this?!

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:30.878
Why are you doing
such horrible things?

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.847
What reason could
justify all this?!

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.782
You're asking why?

00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:37.618
[chuckling]

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:41.755
Come to think of
it... The man I
retrieved this Star

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.358
Seed from said the
exact same thing.

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.425
[gasping]

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.133
Usako.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.269
Huh? Uh?

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:09.650
What just happened?!

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:13.253
<i>[chuckling]</i>

00:04:13.287 --> 00:04:17.090
<i>I can feel it!</i>
<i>The shining energy</i>
<i>of a star!</i>

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:19.860
<i>The power of a</i>
<i>true Star Seed!</i>

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:21.028
Who are you?!

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.164
I am the ruler
of the galaxy!

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:26.500
Galaxia!

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:30.170
Why are you doing all
this?! What will you
accomplish by making

00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:32.206
innocent people
suffer?!

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:35.309
This entire galaxy
belongs to me!

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:38.779
So I am free to do
whatever I want
with it!

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:41.014
The galaxy belongs
to no one!

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:44.384
Care to test that?

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.254
[grunting]

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:50.357
[grunting]

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.028
[screaming]

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:07.674
Ah, yours is the
Star Seed of Earth.

00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:09.910
This planet is
now mine.

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:10.711
Think again.

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:11.578
What?

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:16.316
This planet still has
them defending it.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.088
The Sailor Guardians
who fight for love
and for justice

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:23.090
to protect people.

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:28.428
They'll crush your
evil plans. I know
they will.

00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:31.298
You don't stand a
chance against them.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.735
Usako.

00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:49.082
[chuckling]

00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:52.753
[whimpering]
No.

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:58.058
[crying]
Mamo. You
killed him.

00:05:58.892 --> 00:06:01.128
<i>Hmph! That man</i>
<i>was a fool.</i>

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:05.766
There is no love
or justice in
this galaxy.

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:07.701
There is
only light.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:11.872
And only those who
shine the brightest
will reign supreme!

00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:17.010
Now... hand over your
Star Seeds before I
take them by force.

00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:22.482
<i>He's dead. Mamo's</i>
<i>really dead.</i>

00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:24.384
[gasping]

00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:25.185
Ha!

00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:31.859
[chuckling]
What the--?!

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:34.394
They're gone!
It's that light
again.

00:06:34.428 --> 00:06:37.264
It managed to bring
them into my throne
room so easily,

00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:39.933
and removed them
just as fast.

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:42.769
What exactly is
that light?!

00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:44.738
Well, it doesn't
matter now.

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:48.709
The galaxy is within
my grasp!

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:58.485
[screaming]

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.022
[gasping]

00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:03.657
Sailor Moon.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.625
Huh?

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:07.294
How are you feeling?

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:08.662
Saturn?

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:10.898
You're back at
Ginga TV.

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:13.467
Where's Mamo? And
the others?

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:22.376
A sudden burst of
light brought you and
the Star Lights back here.

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:23.744
As for the others...

00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:28.549
She must be
exhausted. She's
asleep.

00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:34.755
So then... it
wasn't a dream.

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:39.493
[crying]

00:07:39.526 --> 00:07:43.130
Mamo, Rei and all
the others... they're
gone now.

00:07:43.163 --> 00:07:45.666
What am I
going to do?

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:47.367
Sailor Moon.

00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:51.271
This isn't the time
for tears.

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:53.207
While we're just
standing around,

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.509
Galaxia's invasion
continues.

00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:59.012
Getting emotional
is not going to
change the situation!

00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:00.981
What's your
problem?!

00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:03.483
Don't you care that
your friends just
died?!

00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:06.587
As the Guardians of
the Outer Planets,
the four of us were

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.256
planning to settle
this matter
ourselves.

00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:12.092
But... we
messed it up.

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:17.998
[wincing]

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.501
Come on.

00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:22.469
Wait! We're coming
with you!

00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:25.138
You are? And what do
you expect to
accomplish

00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:27.107
with those
injuries of yours?

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.041
Uh--

00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:29.743
<i>Just leave</i>
<i>this to us.</i>

00:08:32.546 --> 00:08:37.150
Once again... we
lived, but at what
cost? We caused more

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:40.454
casualties and
couldn't avenge
our princess.

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:43.323
She was right about
everything. We
don't stand a

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:46.927
chance against
Galaxia. There's no
way we'll be able to

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.229
beat her unless
we find the Light
of Hope.

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:50.664
That's not true.

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:51.532
Huh?

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:55.636
Fighter, you do like
Sailor Moon, don't
you?

00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:57.137
[lightly gasping]

00:08:57.171 --> 00:08:57.638
Uh--

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:16.757
Yes. I do.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.624
[gasping]

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:21.261
I'm glad. Then
it seems you're
holding onto the

00:09:21.295 --> 00:09:22.863
same hope as
the rest of us.

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:23.363
Uh?

00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:27.668
Have faith in our
princess. Okay?

00:09:27.701 --> 00:09:32.039
I promise. We will
defeat Galaxia once
and for all.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.442
So, please,
watch over us.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.215
Uh.

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:53.760
Deep Submerge!

00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:01.068
[gasping]

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.669
Is that all
you've got?

00:10:02.703 --> 00:10:05.472
I was kind enough
to invite you to my
throne room...

00:10:05.506 --> 00:10:09.142
... so I'd appreciate
it if you put up more
of a fight.

00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:12.379
Well, aren't you
confident? We'll
see for how long.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.255
[grunting]

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:24.057
[yelling]

00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:26.894
[chuckling]

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:27.861
[gasping]

00:10:27.895 --> 00:10:28.862
[grunting]

00:10:28.896 --> 00:10:30.864
[chuckling]

00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:33.767
[struggling]

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.736
[grunting]

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.504
Huh!

00:10:37.538 --> 00:10:39.039
[screaming]

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:43.577
[grunting]

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.313
Heh. That didn't
work out like I
thought it would.

00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:47.981
Guess my sword's
getting dull.

00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:50.284
You're blaming this
on your weapon?

00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:53.720
Well, it's not my
fault. I haven't
lost my edge.

00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:55.489
Care to test that?

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:58.125
Let's save it for
when we're alone
together.

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:01.595
I'll gladly send you
both to the netherworld,
if you wish.

00:11:02.863 --> 00:11:03.997
Be gone.

00:11:04.031 --> 00:11:04.765
[gasping]

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:07.000
Silence Wall!

00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:07.835
[grunting]

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:09.069
Who did that?!

00:11:11.572 --> 00:11:15.209
Sailor Saturn,
Guardian of Ruin
and Rebirth!

00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:19.146
And Sailor
Pluto, Guardian
of Revolution.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:22.649
Galaxia! We demand
that you leave this
planet now!

00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:26.420
And should you refuse,
you will have to fight
the both of us!

00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:28.689
Heh. How
amusing.

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.559
Uh!

00:12:05.592 --> 00:12:07.427
[groggy breathing]

00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:12.065
Chibi-Chibi?

00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:13.767
You awake now?

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:18.138
Eh-uh... huh?

00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:20.340
She should have just
stayed asleep.

00:12:20.374 --> 00:12:23.076
Then she wouldn't
have to face this
awful reality.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.311
Stop it, Maker.

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:27.581
But she does have a
point. We can't
exactly fight

00:12:27.614 --> 00:12:31.251
anymore. There's
nothing left for us
to protect.

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:33.287
To protect?

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:33.654
Huh?

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:38.425
Huh?

00:12:41.028 --> 00:12:45.899
Nothing left... to
protect? Are you
sure?

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:47.100
[gasping]

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:55.375
We wanted... to
protect... the
friends... we love.

00:12:57.744 --> 00:13:01.248
That's right. We
love Sailor Moon, but
we love the three of

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:05.118
you just as much.
You're all special
to us.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.455
Please just... please
take our place.

00:13:08.488 --> 00:13:12.226
And protect Usagi
and our world.

00:13:15.596 --> 00:13:20.000
Don't be such a
baby. I know you're
better than that, Usagi.

00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:24.638
You do like Sailor
Moon, don't you?

00:13:25.439 --> 00:13:28.342
Have faith in our
princess, okay?

00:13:28.942 --> 00:13:30.711
[lightly gasping]
Mm!

00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:36.316
Let's go try one
more time.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.385
Those girls gave
their lives for ours.

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:40.220
We can't just let
that go to waste.

00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:44.191
I won't allow Galaxia
to take any more people
we care about.

00:13:44.224 --> 00:13:45.025
Mm.

00:13:46.727 --> 00:13:48.161
Let's go, everyone!

00:13:50.464 --> 00:13:52.232
Chibi-Chibi!

00:13:54.568 --> 00:13:57.037
Dead Scream.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.548
World Shaking!

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:13.954
Still can't
touch her!

00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:15.489
[chuckling]

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.692
You could throw a
whole army at me and
it wouldn't be enough.

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:21.895
None of you will
ever be able to lay
a finger on me.

00:14:21.929 --> 00:14:22.763
Fine!

00:14:24.231 --> 00:14:27.701
In exchange for my
life, I'll destroy
you and bring peace

00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:28.969
to the solar system!

00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:31.071
[laughing]

00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:32.406
What's so funny?!

00:14:33.574 --> 00:14:36.043
You're so clueless.
Who do you think
helped restore your

00:14:36.076 --> 00:14:37.945
powers in the
first place?

00:14:37.978 --> 00:14:39.213
What are you saying?

00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:42.549
Just try and think
back. What was it
that forced you to

00:14:42.583 --> 00:14:45.686
return as a Guardian
so soon after your
rebirth?

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:47.254
[gasping]

00:14:48.422 --> 00:14:49.790
[yelling]

00:14:49.823 --> 00:14:51.325
[screaming]

00:14:57.497 --> 00:15:00.234
<i>But she was a baby</i>
<i>just a minute ago...</i>

00:15:03.971 --> 00:15:06.974
A great change is
about to happen.

00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:09.676
Stop it! Don't look
at me like that!

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.511
[struggling]

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:16.984
It can't be!

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:21.154
That's right. I
freed the Queen of
Darkness, Nehalennia.

00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:25.192
And that prompted
Saturn's awakening.
It was all me!

00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:28.795
<i>And now, I will</i>
<i>free you from this</i>
<i>despicable seal that</i>

00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:30.497
<i>you are imprisoned</i>
<i>in.</i>

00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:31.598
You, what?!

00:15:31.632 --> 00:15:33.634
[screaming]

00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:35.669
Mm.

00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:38.172
[gasping]

00:15:43.644 --> 00:15:47.047
What you're saying
is... the battle with
Nehalennia was staged

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.448
from the beginning?!

00:15:48.482 --> 00:15:49.783
That's a lie!

00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:54.087
My goal is to harvest
every true Star Seed
in the galaxy.

00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:57.257
And for that to be
realized, I couldn't
have one

00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:59.193
that hadn't
ripened yet.

00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:02.429
So, I presented a
catastrophe that
would help quicken

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:03.597
your awakening.

00:16:04.898 --> 00:16:07.301
The Queen of Darkness
willingly offered her
services to me.

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:10.838
That's how badly
she wanted her
revenge on you.

00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:13.807
Liar! I bet you
tricked her into
doing it!

00:16:13.841 --> 00:16:16.109
By fueling her
envy of Sailor Moon!

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.544
Silence!

00:16:19.713 --> 00:16:20.614
[screaming]

00:16:21.782 --> 00:16:23.317
[screaming]

00:16:23.684 --> 00:16:25.052
[screaming]

00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:27.554
I rule over this
entire galaxy!

00:16:27.588 --> 00:16:30.958
And I'm free to use
it however I see
fit!

00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:33.727
[struggling]

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.096
Okay. Looks
like I was wrong.

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:38.532
You're clearly the
strongest being in
the galaxy.

00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:41.635
So you finally
realized how
great I am.

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:45.072
But it's too late.
You will all have
your Star Seeds

00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:47.608
removed and then
disappear.

00:16:47.641 --> 00:16:50.711
Of course, there is
one more option for
you...

00:16:50.744 --> 00:16:53.180
I'm listening.

00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:56.250
It's really
quite simple.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.519
Become my servant!

00:16:58.552 --> 00:16:59.319
What?!

00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:00.387
We would never!

00:17:01.455 --> 00:17:03.457
<i>All you have to do is</i>
<i>hand me your Star Seeds</i>

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.626
<i>and pledge your</i>
<i>allegiance to</i>
<i>me.</i>

00:17:05.659 --> 00:17:08.562
These bracelets are
imbued with my
energy. And by

00:17:08.595 --> 00:17:11.598
wearing them, it is
possible for you to
survive even without

00:17:11.632 --> 00:17:12.833
your Star Seeds.

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:15.969
So that's the source
of Galaxia's energy.

00:17:18.472 --> 00:17:22.075
Well? Which will
it be, then? Give
in, or die?

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.679
I'd much rather die
than serve the likes
of you, Galaxia!

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:28.182
That's right! We'd
never obey you!

00:17:28.215 --> 00:17:28.916
I'm in.

00:17:28.949 --> 00:17:30.117
[gasping]

00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:32.119
Uranus?!

00:17:32.152 --> 00:17:33.887
If I choose to wear
those bracelets,

00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:35.556
I get to keep
living, huh?

00:17:37.524 --> 00:17:42.429
Becoming Galaxia's
servant might not be
such a bad idea.

00:17:42.462 --> 00:17:45.465
Will you join me,
Neptune? I'm willing
to sell my

00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:48.235
soul to the devil to
be with you forever.

00:17:49.837 --> 00:17:51.905
Uh. Of course.

00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:54.908
Wait, you two. Have
you lost your minds?!

00:17:54.942 --> 00:17:57.110
Don't tell me
you've forgotten
our mission!

00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:59.913
We must protect
this planet and our
princess!

00:17:59.947 --> 00:18:01.448
Shut your mouth!

00:18:01.481 --> 00:18:03.217
[lightly gasping]

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:07.588
Go on, take it.

00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:09.923
You made the correct
choice.

00:18:09.957 --> 00:18:12.993
And now... I'll
take your Star Seeds.

00:18:13.026 --> 00:18:16.029
Uranus. 'Til death
do us part.

00:18:16.063 --> 00:18:18.131
Yeah. Let's meet
in hell.

00:18:18.165 --> 00:18:20.167
Uranus! Neptune!

00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:24.037
[screaming]

00:18:28.342 --> 00:18:30.043
[gasping]

00:18:34.982 --> 00:18:37.885
Ah, yes. This
beautiful radiance.

00:18:37.918 --> 00:18:40.487
As promised... Take
my energy!

00:18:41.989 --> 00:18:43.090
gasp)

00:18:44.925 --> 00:18:48.095
I feel it... So this
is the energy she
holds.

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:51.164
This is... a power I
could get used to.

00:18:52.533 --> 00:18:56.670
Sailor Uranus and
Sailor Neptune, arise
before me!

00:18:56.703 --> 00:18:57.838
For your first task,

00:18:57.871 --> 00:19:00.541
remove the Star
Seeds from those
other two.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:07.281
Why did you choose to
betray us? What about
your duty? We have

00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:10.684
come too far for both
of you to simply
abandon your pride as

00:19:10.717 --> 00:19:12.586
Sailor Guardians!

00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:15.923
It's pointless. As
long as they wear
those bracelets,

00:19:15.956 --> 00:19:18.625
Uranus and Neptune
are under my control.

00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:22.930
Show me your loyalty.
Retrieve their Star
Seeds!

00:19:22.963 --> 00:19:24.898
Why are you
two doing this?!

00:19:24.932 --> 00:19:26.300
Surely, you must
know.

00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:29.036
This is how we fight
no matter what the
cost!

00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:30.971
[gasping]

00:19:31.405 --> 00:19:32.573
Uranus?

00:19:32.873 --> 00:19:33.907
Oh!

00:19:33.941 --> 00:19:35.209
Neptune.

00:19:35.709 --> 00:19:36.677
[gasping]

00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:38.111
Pluto!

00:19:38.145 --> 00:19:39.980
Yes. I just
felt it, too.

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:42.416
They're quite
serious about this.

00:19:43.784 --> 00:19:45.686
In that case, we
won't hold back.

00:19:45.719 --> 00:19:47.354
We'll give you
all we've got!

00:19:47.387 --> 00:19:49.356
We'll fight to the
death if we must!

00:19:49.389 --> 00:19:52.759
That's right!
Sailor Guardians who
have sworn to protect

00:19:52.793 --> 00:19:55.829
the planet
together. Nothing
excites me more than

00:19:55.863 --> 00:19:58.465
watching them kill
each other!

00:19:58.498 --> 00:20:00.868
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>Countless planets</i>
<i>have succumbed to me.</i>

00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:04.271
<i>And each time their</i>
<i>Guardians have brought</i>
<i>about their own doom</i>

00:20:04.304 --> 00:20:06.206
<i>by an act of</i>
<i>betrayal.</i>

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.642
<i>Friendship is but a</i>
<i>fragile illusion.</i>

00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:12.679
<i>The only thing you</i>
<i>can rely on is</i>
<i>yourself!</i>

00:20:12.713 --> 00:20:14.314
Now, show them
to us.

00:20:14.348 --> 00:20:16.450
Hand over your Star
Seeds!

00:20:29.129 --> 00:20:30.330
What's wrong?

00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:32.900
I felt another
star's light go
out.

00:20:32.933 --> 00:20:34.301
Who was it this time?

00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:36.570
Oh, no. Don't
tell me it was--

00:20:36.603 --> 00:20:37.538
[gasping]

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:41.074
[gasping]

00:20:43.644 --> 00:20:44.678
[gasping]

00:20:45.646 --> 00:20:49.516
[struggling]

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.186
Pluto! Saturn!

00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:54.388
Please, don't
worry, Sailor Moon.

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:58.559
You must... keep
having faith, no
matter what.

00:20:58.592 --> 00:20:59.293
[gasping]

00:20:59.326 --> 00:21:04.598
Setsuna! Hotaru!
[crying]

00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:06.700
We have been waiting
for you.

00:21:06.733 --> 00:21:07.701
[gasping]

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.680
Hold on... Why
are you standing
next to her?

00:21:19.713 --> 00:21:21.782
Uranus. Neptune!

00:21:21.815 --> 00:21:23.283
Those bracelets
are...

00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:26.086
You damn bastards!
Those were your friends!

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:28.355
Why don't you
mind your own
business?

00:21:28.388 --> 00:21:29.323
[gasping]

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.327
Your two friends
willingly became my
loyal servants.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.929
And now they'll
be taking your
Star Seeds.

00:21:35.963 --> 00:21:38.765
Sailor Uranus,
Sailor Neptune, go!

00:21:41.068 --> 00:21:43.303
[gasping]
Don't do this!

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:56.016
[laughing]

00:23:35.115 --> 00:23:37.384
<i>Uranus, Neptune,</i>
<i>please, stop!</i>

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:40.454
It's no use!
Galaxia's bracelet
are controlling them,

00:23:40.487 --> 00:23:41.855
they won't listen!

00:23:41.889 --> 00:23:44.725
<i>But I don't wanna lose</i>
<i>any more of the people</i>
<i>I care about!</i>

00:23:44.758 --> 00:23:47.427
If we just had the
Light of Hope that
the Legendary Sailor

00:23:47.461 --> 00:23:51.098
Guardian left
behind... then we
could defeat Galaxia!

00:23:51.131 --> 00:23:52.399
<i>The Light of Hope?</i>

00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:55.769
<i>Next time on Sailor</i>
<i>Stars, Dying Stars:</i>

00:23:55.802 --> 00:23:58.038
<i>Uranus and Neptune's</i>
<i>Last Stand.</i>

00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:00.741
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
