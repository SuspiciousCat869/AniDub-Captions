WEBVTT

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.744
Think she'll turn up?

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.446
I'm positive.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.649
It's why we're here
in the first place.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.385
Don't worry, I'm sure we'll
be able to find her.

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:01.388
That's right. No
matter what it takes.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.757
Alright, guys.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.425
It's show time.

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:16.637
Farewells and Encounters: The
Transitioning Stars of Destiny.

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:21.575
[chatting]

00:02:22.376 --> 00:02:32.386
[cheering]

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:42.362
[cheering]

00:02:48.068 --> 00:03:01.014
[louder cheering]

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:03.884
The Three Lights?

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.652
You don't know them?

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.454
Uh, should I?

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:10.624
They're a really popular
teen idol group.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.160
Seiya's the one for me!

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.163
<i>He has that dangerous</i>
<i>streak about him.</i>

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.232
What?! I think he's kinda
childish.

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:20.567
That's what makes him cute.

00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:21.935
Mm-hmm!

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.838
Well my favorite's
definitely Yaten.

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:27.441
It's that
mysterious beauty.

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:31.044
Yeah, you can never quite tell
what it is he's thinking about.

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:33.247
He's so dreamy,
don't ya think?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.848
Mm-hmm.

00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:36.717
You've gotta be kidding me...

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.951
Oh, come on girls...

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:39.386
You tell 'em, Ami!

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.023
You're forgetting about the
smart and handsome Taiki.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.826
So mature
and sophisticated...

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.427
Yeah, I love
how he's so...

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:48.862
...calm and cool.

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:50.497
Mm-hmm.

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:51.598
Mm?!

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:55.002
Ami, are you
actually... a
secret fan?

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:58.438
I-I mean, I don't
know that much
about them...

00:03:58.472 --> 00:03:59.673
<i>Sure you don't...</i>

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:00.841
<i>What about you, Usagi?</i>

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:01.775
Huh?

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:03.277
Who's your favorite?

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:04.745
Mamo...

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:06.113
Uhh...

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:08.515
[sighing]

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.017
Hey, what's the matter?

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.519
You seem.. down today.

00:04:13.287 --> 00:04:17.758
Well... that's because...

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:20.194
Mamoru's leaving
to study abroad?!

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:24.231
Usagi, how come you never
mentioned this to me?

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:28.902
Yeah, apparently his
thesis got him into
a university in America.

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:31.338
That's fantastic!
[grunting]

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.874
If you're trying to make her
feel better, you are not
helping!

00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:35.175
<i>My bad!</i>

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:37.110
Do you know how long?

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:45.285
I won't be back for
at least a year,
maybe longer.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.454
You sure about this?

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:51.558
Of course. It's not
like it's another planet.

00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:55.095
And you're not going away
forever, right?

00:04:56.563 --> 00:05:02.002
Besides... regardless
of what happens, I'll
always love you.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.273
So don't worry
about me, okay?

00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:09.576
<i>Usagi...</i>

00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:12.546
Are you really
okay with that?

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:14.114
Yeah, I am.

00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:18.552
<i>It's a wish come true</i>
<i>for Mamo. I have to send</i>
<i>him off with a smile.</i>

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:21.655
Usagi...

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.691
Don't worry, I'll
be fine, really!

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.797
She's taking it
pretty hard,
isn't she?

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:34.001
Well, with everything
that's happened, I can't
blame her.

00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:35.669
Yeah, you've got
a point there.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.250
<i>Chibi-Usa... What</i>
<i>am I gonna do?</i>

00:05:50.284 --> 00:05:51.718
<i>Usagi? Are you there?</i>

00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:53.120
Huh?

00:05:53.787 --> 00:05:54.688
Luna...

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:56.523
Don't be sad.

00:05:57.758 --> 00:05:59.626
I can't help it.

00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:01.695
Usagi...

00:06:02.763 --> 00:06:05.566
This isn't how I pictured my
high school life to be.

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.002
First Chibi-Usa went
back to her
future, and now...

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:12.072
...Mamo's going away too.

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.411
I wish I could've told
him how I really felt...

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:21.148
... how badly I wanted
him to stay here with me.

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:25.185
Everyone knows I'm not that
strong a person.

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:30.557
Hey, listen... Do you
remember the day
we first met?

00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:34.228
I remember thinking
you were such a crybaby
and a klutz.

00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:36.129
<i>But you know what?</i>

00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:39.266
You've changed
a lot since then.

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:43.237
You're stronger and
more mature than you
think you are.

00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:45.272
Luna...

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:47.341
I know you'll do
the right thing.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.077
Mm.

00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:56.850
<i>Passengers scheduled</i>
<i>to depart for New</i>
<i>York, please</i>

00:06:56.884 --> 00:07:00.454

<i>designated gate. We</i>
<i>will be boarding shortly.</i>

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:03.357
Guess it's time...

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.391
Mamo.

00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:09.997
Usako...

00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:23.944
I didn't think you'd
see me off because
of school--

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:26.346
I'll be waiting for you!

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:30.017
No matter how long it takes.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.886
I might not be able
to keep in touch
as much at first,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.155
you know. because of
all of my studies.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.391
Don't worry about it.

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:42.229
I'll write you a
letter every day to
keep you company, okay?

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.765
<i>Oh...</i>

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:51.205
This is terrible.. I told
myself I was going to send
you off with a smile today.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:52.439
Usako...

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.640
Oh!

00:07:56.543 --> 00:07:58.078
Go ahead and open it.

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:07.321
Wait, is this...
for me?

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:15.095
Here...

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.266
[blushing]

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.970
I love you, Usako.

00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:26.607
[laughing]

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:32.079
Thank you. It's
so beautiful.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.392
[laughing]

00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:51.365
I have to
head out now.

00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:52.499
Mm.

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:54.668
[giggling]

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:55.736
[cheering]

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:56.904
What's that about?

00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:58.505
Probably some celebrity.

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:02.910
Let's go.

00:09:02.943 --> 00:09:05.379
Mm. [giggling]

00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:07.848
Sorry, you have to give
us room, you're in our way!

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.249
I said move!

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:18.592
[gasping]

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.848
<i>Have a safe trip, Mamo.</i>

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:46.253
<i>I can feel it... The</i>
<i>energy of stars that</i>
<i>shine for all eternity.</i>

00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:49.957
<i>The Star Seeds!</i>
<i>[evil chuckling]</i>

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:55.829
Now...go to that blue planet and
find me only the true Star Seeds
that reside there.

00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:59.600
Find them all. Bring
each and every one of
them back to me,

00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:03.237
<i>so I may lay claim</i>
<i>to this entire galaxy!</i>

00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:11.411
Usako...

00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:13.180
(curious commotion at the
strange approaching light)

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:13.347
Huh?

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.456
Another star's light
just went out.

00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:23.457
Do you think it's them?

00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:28.662
This is bad. We need
her now more than ever.

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:32.533
Come on, guys. Don't
lose hope. She might
be closer than we think.

00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:33.600
Then we need to hurry!

00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:34.835
You're right...

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:37.437
We don't have a whole lot of
time to spare.

00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:06.266
<i>So.. Mamoru gave</i>
<i>you a ring, huh?</i>

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.134
Huh?

00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:09.670
You're one lucky
girl, that's for sure.

00:11:09.703 --> 00:11:11.271
Not only did he
get you that,

00:11:11.305 --> 00:11:14.274
but he went and put
it on your left ring
finger.

00:11:14.308 --> 00:11:16.777
Wait, does that mean
what I think it means?

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.978
Well, yeah it does.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.379
Well. what are you saying?

00:11:19.413 --> 00:11:21.014
I mean, what else
could it mean?

00:11:21.048 --> 00:11:22.583
What's going on?

00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:25.986
Oh, gimme a break!
Do you seriously not
know, Usagi?!

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.988
Just what kind of
a girl are you
anyway?!

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:30.457
I'm gonna say
"a really pretty one"!

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.391
[groaning]

00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:33.460
Even Luna understands
and she's a cat!

<i>I'm still a girl</i>
<i>too, ya know!</i>

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:36.630
<i>Just tell me already!</i>

00:11:36.663 --> 00:11:38.332
We're saying that ring
he gave you is actually-

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:40.534
Girls, you're not
gonna believe this!

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:43.537
Right now, they're
filming that show over
at that park nearby!

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.305
What? That show?!

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:46.507
Let's go!

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.008
What show?

00:11:49.977 --> 00:11:53.280
[chatting]

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:55.682
Oh no! We got
here too late!

00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:57.117
Why are there
so many people?

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.553
They're shooting
a drama with the
Three Lights!

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:02.489
You mean "The Z Files of Young
Holmes", right?

00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:04.658
I can't believe it's
really filming here!

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:06.226
Uh, what is it?

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.328
It's one of the most watched
shows this season,

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:10.464
with a viewership
of more than 1
in 3!

00:12:10.497 --> 00:12:11.598
Hmm...

00:12:11.632 --> 00:12:15.469
[giggling] Not that
I know too much about it.

00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:17.204
Really...

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:23.076
[film crew setting up]

Wow! She's cute!

00:12:35.956 --> 00:12:38.058
She's got an
adorable face!

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.761
[squealing] It's Taiki
and Yaten!

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:43.964
[swooning]

00:12:43.997 --> 00:12:45.699
It's really them!

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.634
Wow, they're hot!

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:49.036
<i>Darn straight!</i>

00:12:49.903 --> 00:12:51.572
So dreamy...

00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:54.274
[swooning and gasping]

00:12:54.308 --> 00:12:55.409
We can't see a thing
behind all
these people!

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:58.946
[growling]
Girls, ' we're movin' in!

00:12:58.979 --> 00:12:59.980
Got it!

00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:01.582
Excuse me.

00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:02.683
Coming through.

00:13:02.716 --> 00:13:03.450
Pardon me.

00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:04.218
S-Sorry!

00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:05.686
Ouch! Watch the tail!

00:13:05.719 --> 00:13:07.187
Hey girls, wait for me!

00:13:09.523 --> 00:13:10.557
Wait!

00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:14.394
Come on, don't leave me!

00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:15.929
[chuckling]

00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:21.235
Those celebrities must
have a lot of star power to
attract this many humans.

00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:23.504
It feels like this
crowd is endless...

00:13:23.537 --> 00:13:25.205
Yeah, talk about popular.

00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:31.144
I wanted to see things
up close. [sighing]
This sucks. Huh?

00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:34.214
Look at that. "Authorized
Personnel Only".

00:13:34.248 --> 00:13:37.618
I wonder if that could
be the rest area
for the film crew.

00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:39.353
[giggling]

00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:41.522
If I just happened to
wander back there, maybe

00:13:41.555 --> 00:13:46.393
I'd run into
someone famous. I'd be
the luckiest girl here!

00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:49.396
<i>Hey, don't you know</i>
<i>this is a restricted area?</i>

00:13:49.429 --> 00:13:56.236
I'm sorry! It was an
accident. Well, that's
not quite true, but

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.604
I was really hoping I
could meet Arisu
face to face!

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:01.608
<i>I'm really sorry!</i>

00:14:01.642 --> 00:14:03.310
You're that girl
from before.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.045
Huh?

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:06.947
Guess you don't remember.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.249
So, uh.. you're saying
we've met somewhere?

00:14:09.283 --> 00:14:11.885
[gasping] You don't
know who I am?

00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:12.819
Mm-mm.

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:14.321
Oh...

00:14:15.622 --> 00:14:17.658
Guess it just goes
to show that I'm not as
famous as I thought.

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:19.259
<i>Wait, I got it!</i>

00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:21.228
That's a new
pickup line, right?

00:14:22.863 --> 00:14:24.998
Well I'm sorry to break your
heart, mister, but I already
have a future husband.

00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:28.569
[chuckling and grunting]

00:14:28.602 --> 00:14:30.237
You really are weird.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.874
Hey, that's not
very nice!

00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:35.542
And didn't you just say
that area's for authorized
personnel only?!

00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:39.012
I happen to be one of those
personnel. See ya later,
Bun-head!

00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:40.747
[grunting] Now he's
gone too far!

00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:44.418
The only person who's
allowed to call me Bun-head
is Mamo!

00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:50.224
And cut!

00:14:50.257 --> 00:14:52.459
<i>We'll take a break here!</i>

00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:53.460
I'll be in the trailer!

00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:56.597
I can't believe we
get to see this!

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:01.468
<i>What are you doing, Usagi?</i>
<i>We'll get in trouble if</i>
<i>they catch us trespassing.</i>

00:15:01.502 --> 00:15:02.970
You listening to me?!

00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:03.971
Where should we go?

00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:05.439
You're not, are you?

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:06.740
Let's try over here.

00:15:06.773 --> 00:15:08.208
<i>Good grief...</i>

00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:18.085
[stretching] Just a
bit more to go!

00:15:18.118 --> 00:15:19.753
What a lovely smile.

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:22.189
Who are you?

00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:26.894
Your smile has a glow that
gives joy to everyone around
you. You really are a star.

00:15:26.927 --> 00:15:28.262
Aw, thank you so much!

00:15:29.563 --> 00:15:31.598
I'm here because there's
something special that
I want from you.

00:15:31.632 --> 00:15:34.401
Sorry, I can't give out
autographs while I'm
working.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:41.642
Oh no, it's not your autograph
that I'm after.. It's much more
valuable.. your Star Seed.

00:15:41.675 --> 00:15:43.644
Chuu!

00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:44.478
[gasping]

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:45.979
[screaming]

00:15:49.183 --> 00:15:52.553
[giggling]
There's no need
to be afraid!

00:15:52.586 --> 00:15:54.888
[panting]Who's that?

00:15:54.922 --> 00:15:58.659
I'll be taking your
Star Seed! [grunting]

00:15:59.726 --> 00:16:00.661
[yelping]

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:08.302
[screaming]

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:14.474
[gasping]

00:16:14.508 --> 00:16:16.577
Hurry, Usagi!
Transform!

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:17.377
Mm!

00:16:20.681 --> 00:16:26.153
Moon Eternal... Make Up!

00:17:02.055 --> 00:17:04.424
Ahh, what a
pretty Star Seed!

00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:05.125
Huh?

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:08.729
<i>Aw, it faded</i>
<i>out already...</i>

00:17:08.762 --> 00:17:13.800
I didn't come all of this way
just to get my hands on such a
lame Star Seed like this.

00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:14.768
Hold it right there!

00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:15.536
Huh?

00:17:17.304 --> 00:17:22.176
I don't know who you are, but
how dare you attack such a
beloved star like Arisu Itsuki!

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:26.580
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice!

00:17:30.784 --> 00:17:32.352
I am Sailor Moon!

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:38.192
And in the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:40.894
So you're a Sailor
Guardian too,
are you?

00:17:40.928 --> 00:17:41.762
[gasping]

00:17:43.564 --> 00:17:46.733
Unfortunately with a face
like that, you'll never
become a true star like me.

00:17:46.767 --> 00:17:48.969
Just who are
you anyway?

00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:51.839
I am no other than
Sailor Iron Mouse!

00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:52.840
Sailor...

00:17:52.873 --> 00:17:54.441
She's a Guardian too?!

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.279
It's actually time for me to
clock out for today. You can
play with this Phage instead.

00:17:59.313 --> 00:18:00.347
A Phage?

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:07.654
I'm Sailor Buri!

00:18:07.688 --> 00:18:08.655
What happened?!

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.594
People whose Star Seeds lose
their light end up turning into
creatures known as Phages.

00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:17.030
Well.. I'll leave
you two to it!

00:18:17.598 --> 00:18:18.699
<i>Buh-bye!</i>

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.535
W-Wait!

00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:23.637
Excuse me, miss...

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.472
Wanna sing a duet with me?

00:18:25.973 --> 00:18:26.974
[cringing]

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:29.610
Let's knock 'em dead!
[grunting]

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.846
[screaming]

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.781
Why aren't you
fighting back?!

00:18:34.815 --> 00:18:36.683
Because! She used to
be Arisu Itsuki!

00:18:36.717 --> 00:18:41.021
I can't bring myself
to do anything that
might hurt her!

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.391
<i>What do I do?</i>

00:18:44.424 --> 00:18:45.192
[snapping]

00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:46.260
Huh?

00:18:46.293 --> 00:18:47.294
[snapping]

00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:48.128
Who's there?

00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:51.098
<i>Breaking through the</i>
<i>darkness of night...</i>

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.166
Traveling unchained
across the
atmosphere...

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.769
<i>The three sacred</i>
<i>shooting stars!</i>

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.037
Who are you?!

00:18:57.538 --> 00:18:59.473
Sailor Star Fighter!

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.509
Sailor Star Maker!

00:19:02.543 --> 00:19:04.645
Sailor Star Healer!

00:19:05.779 --> 00:19:08.282
We are the Sailor
Star Lights!

00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:09.349
Stage on!

00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:13.353
Even more Sailor Guardians?

00:19:13.387 --> 00:19:16.123
(giggle) You guys
can sing the chorus!

00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:22.062
Star Serious Laser!

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:27.401
[shrieking]

00:19:28.769 --> 00:19:30.237
Arisu!

00:19:32.139 --> 00:19:34.441
I'll put you out
of your misery
now...

00:19:34.474 --> 00:19:36.777
Buri buri buri...

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.546
No, stop! I beg you,
don't kill Arisu!

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.447
It's too late.

00:19:41.782 --> 00:19:44.618
Humans who have turned
into Phages cannot
be reverted back.

00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:49.656
Yes... except by one
individual.. Now,
move aside!

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:50.624
No!

00:19:50.657 --> 00:19:51.325
Move it!

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:54.828
I won't!

00:19:54.862 --> 00:19:56.763
This light,
could it be...?

00:19:56.797 --> 00:20:02.336
<i>I won't let her die.</i>
<i>I'll save her, no</i>
<i>matter what!</i>

00:20:25.959 --> 00:20:36.303
Starlight Honeymoon
Therapy ...Kiss!

00:20:39.506 --> 00:20:43.677
[screaming]

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.713
Beautiful!

00:20:47.648 --> 00:20:48.482
[fainting]

00:20:54.922 --> 00:20:56.990
[sighing]
Uh?

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.298
<i>The Sailor Star Lights...</i>
<i>Who are they?</i>

00:21:05.999 --> 00:21:09.203
Who'd have thought
she had such power?

00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:11.205
Things are getting
interesting.

00:21:13.006 --> 00:21:15.843
Good job, everyone!
Let's break down the set!

00:21:15.876 --> 00:21:17.678
Seeing them in
person was great!

00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:19.313
All three of them
were so cool!

00:21:19.346 --> 00:21:21.381
This day couldn't
have been better.

00:21:22.182 --> 00:21:23.183
Huh?

00:21:23.584 --> 00:21:24.518
Usagi?

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:27.487
So... the enemy was
a Sailor Guardian,

00:21:27.521 --> 00:21:30.424
but so were the people
who saved us...

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:31.425
Usagi?

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:32.259
Mm?

00:21:33.527 --> 00:21:35.395
Where've you been?
They're all wrapped up
with the filming.

00:21:35.429 --> 00:21:37.865
Um... I was...

00:21:37.898 --> 00:21:39.233
Did something happen?

00:21:39.867 --> 00:21:41.201
Well, you see...

00:21:41.902 --> 00:21:42.936
Yeah?!

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.205
Actually have no
idea what's going on...

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:46.139
[groaning]

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.842
Seriously, Usagi? What's
that supposed to mean?

00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:50.577
Well, there was
that one thing,
and...

00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:51.778
What thing?!

00:21:51.812 --> 00:21:53.146
<i>You know, that one thing!</i>

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.182
Stop being so vague!

00:23:35.782 --> 00:23:37.117
[squealing]

00:23:38.151 --> 00:23:40.153
What's wrong, Minako?
Why did you yell like that?

00:23:40.187 --> 00:23:43.924
<i>Didn't you hear, Usagi? The</i>
<i>boys from "Three Lights" are</i>
<i>transferring to our school!</i>

00:23:43.957 --> 00:23:45.692
So what?

00:23:45.726 --> 00:23:48.362
<i>So what?! It'll be</i>
<i>so awesome to be the</i>
<i>girlfriend of a teen idol!</i>

00:23:48.395 --> 00:23:50.564
Aren't you getting a little
ahead of yourself?

00:23:50.597 --> 00:23:52.065
<i>Not at all!</i>

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:56.136
Next time on Sailor Stars, "A
