What? Who are you?

I take it that you're Kengo

ceramics artist.

I can't wait to see this place
you spoke so highly of, Rei.

00:03:56.336 --> 00:04:00.641
You have an acquaintance
who lives close to where we're
going camping, isn't that right?

Yeah! He's a relative of mine

ceramics.

He's the one who made this
pendant.

Wow, did he really make that
out of clay with his own
hands?

Yeah!

really well made.

it to be just another failure.

00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:20.581
Well, romance is nice, but y'all
be careful. Someone's been
terrorizing the campers here.

neat idea!

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.847
[laughing] This is a good spot
for the tarp, don't you think?

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.616
Hey, Rei? Can you get that for
me?

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.384
Sure!

00:12:32.786 --> 00:12:34.054
Chibi-Chibi!

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:36.990
What're you doing?! That's
dangerous! Give me that,
Chibi-Chibi!

00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:40.394
Chibi-Chibi-Chibi-Chibi-Chibi.

00:12:41.962 --> 00:12:43.297
Chibi?

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:46.233
[gasps]

00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:50.637
Trouble! Big trouble!
[panting]

00:12:50.671 --> 00:12:53.774
It...It's out there! The monster
terrorizing the camp!

00:12:53.807 --> 00:12:55.042
Huh?!

00:12:56.343 --> 00:12:57.411
[gasps]

00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:00.080
So what do we do?!

00:13:01.648 --> 00:13:02.883
Oh, no.

00:13:02.916 --> 00:13:04.318
What Rei, what's wrong?

00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:07.588
It's Kengo. Maybe he was a
victim of the monster, too!

00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:08.355
What?!

00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:10.157
No way!

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.425
[mischievous chuckle]

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:15.662
<i>[frightened shrieks] It went</i>

<i>[scared screaming]</i>

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.369
Seiya's even scaring other
people that we don't know!

00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:25.005
Guess so! He's really going
all-out.

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:27.574
I knew it. Kengo was attacked
by the monster!

00:13:27.608 --> 00:13:30.677
Wait so is there really a
monster out there?!

00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:32.779
[breathy growl] A failure!

00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:33.680
Huh?!

00:13:33.714 --> 00:13:35.749

[mischievous chuckle]

00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:45.359
A failure! A failure!

00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:48.529
Hey, our tents! You destroyed
our tents!

00:13:48.562 --> 00:13:51.265
Here, hold her. What's the big
idea, huh?!

00:13:51.298 --> 00:13:51.899
Huh?

00:13:51.932 --> 00:13:53.800

[fake frightened] Please don't!

00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:01.642
A failure! A failure!

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:04.211
<i>(Kengo) A failure!</i>

00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:06.113
[chuckles] He's really into
it!

00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:10.484
[chuckles] But what is that
thing that he's carrying with
him, anyway?

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:12.719
<i>(Taiki) Didn't he take a</i>
<i>chainsaw?</i>

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.822
[humming]

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:20.327
[chuckles] Getting them scared
beforehand is sure to make them
jumpy.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.098
Once I show up, they'll be so
frightened that they'll fall
right on their butts! [chuckles]

00:14:25.132 --> 00:14:26.466
[frightened running]

00:14:26.934 --> 00:14:27.968
Huh?

00:14:35.943 --> 00:14:37.845
Huh? Why aren't they back yet?

00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:40.080
You think he's still chasing
them around?

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:42.749
Seiya's really gotten carried
away with all this.

00:14:42.783 --> 00:14:45.152
[attacking yells]

00:14:45.185 --> 00:14:46.587
At least he's back.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.021
So he is.

00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:49.022
Huh?

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:53.160
All right Seiya, let's call it
quits already.

00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:55.062
Yeah, I'm getting hungry,
here.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.265
What do you mean, "already?" I
haven't even done anything
yet!

00:14:58.298 --> 00:15:00.601
Where are Bun-head and
the others, anyway?

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:04.304
Uhh.

00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:08.008
Uh, Seiya? By any chance, did
you just get here right now?

00:15:08.041 --> 00:15:10.677
Yeah, of course! Hey, come
on guys!

00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:14.348
I was really looking forward to
scaring them! So where'd they
all go?

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:17.818
[gasps] Hey, what happened?
The tents are all knocked down!

00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:19.820
Yaten, was that thing...?

00:15:19.853 --> 00:15:22.122
The real deal?

00:15:22.155 --> 00:15:26.493
[gasps] Hey, what do you mean,
"the real deal?!"

00:15:26.527 --> 00:15:27.661
[sighs]

00:15:28.896 --> 00:15:30.664
Guys! Wait up!

00:15:31.932 --> 00:15:34.868

[panting] You okay?

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:46.313
[gasps]

00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:56.757

to transform!

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.624
M-hm.

00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:02.629
Mars Crystal Power Make Up!

[growls]

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:08.562
People made big plans to get
away from the heat...

00:17:08.595 --> 00:17:10.931
this summer vacation and have a
lot of fun here!

00:17:10.964 --> 00:17:14.501
Like singing, eating, and
maybe even finding a summer
romance!

00:17:14.535 --> 00:17:17.237
How dare you ruin everyone's fun
at camp!

00:17:17.271 --> 00:17:19.239
We are the Pretty Guardians!

00:17:19.273 --> 00:17:21.975
Who fight for love and for
justice.

00:17:25.779 --> 00:17:27.648
I am Sailor Moon!

And I'm Sailor Mars!

00:17:32.953 --> 00:17:35.556
And now, in the name of the
Moon!

00:17:35.589 --> 00:17:37.357
We'll punish you!

00:17:37.391 --> 00:17:40.994
A failure! A failure! All you
are is a failure!

00:17:41.028 --> 00:17:45.265
Well, that is really rude! Why
are you calling me a failure,
huh?!

[grunts] Could that?!

00:18:08.889 --> 00:18:12.960

Please don't! [sobs]

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:40.487
Rei, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you. I'll make you
something better.

00:18:40.521 --> 00:18:43.724
Why don't you hold on to this
for me until next time, ok?

00:18:48.829 --> 00:18:49.963
No way! Kengo?!

00:18:49.997 --> 00:18:51.064
Huh?!

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:53.967
You're Kengo! That's who you
really are, right?!

Sailor Mars! Are you sure
that's him?!

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.679
I'm positive. Which means
someone must've turned him
into this monster somehow!

00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:10.617
You're just a failure! All of
you are nothing but failures!

00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:12.586
Please, Kengo! Stop all this!

00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:14.454
You're all failures!

Yes.

Well, it looks like all of your
masterpieces got destroyed,
Kengo. It's sad, huh?

00:21:02.529 --> 00:21:05.599
Actually this is a good chance
to start over again.

00:21:05.632 --> 00:21:09.536
I think that I've been trying
too hard to do something new.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.372
And I lost track of myself in
the process.

<i>(Usagi) How pathetic!</i>

I hear you fainted when you
saw the monster terrorizing
the camp.

00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:30.858
You might be a superhero in that
movie of yours, but you're a
super chicken in real life.

00:21:30.891 --> 00:21:34.862
Well, maybe, but what can I
say? It caught me by surprise,
that's all.

00:21:34.895 --> 00:21:38.365
Your fans would be so
disappointed in you if they
found out.

00:21:38.398 --> 00:21:39.366
Shh!
