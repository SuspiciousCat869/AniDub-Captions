Moon Power of Love:
The Nightmare Ends.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:55.282
<i>Mamo! Please! You</i>
<i>have to wake up!</i>

00:01:55.315 --> 00:02:00.320
It's useless. You can
call his name as many
times as you like,

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:04.091
but until the mirror
shard in his eye is
removed, he will

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.693
never awaken from his
slumber.

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.095
No!

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.565
Not even I have the
power to undo the
curse.

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:14.368
[crying]

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:15.502
[gasping]

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:16.803
[chuckling]

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:19.806
Come now.. You didn't
actually think the
two of you made it

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.242
this far on your own,
did you?

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:23.644
[grunting]

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:26.847
<i>You are the final</i>
<i>pawns I will use to</i>
<i>make the Princess of</i>

<i>suffer.</i>

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:30.984
[gasping]

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:32.653
[screaming]

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:38.325
Mamo! Wake up!

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:42.563
Come on, Mamo!
You've gotta
remember Usagi!

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:45.532
The two of you have
always shared the
same dreams!

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:48.535
Mamo! Please!

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:55.008
<i>Small Lady's future</i>
<i>is about to change.</i>

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:56.810
Chibi Moon.

00:02:56.844 --> 00:03:01.415
<i>[chuckling]</i>

00:03:02.983 --> 00:03:06.019
<i>We've got trouble.</i>
<i>The people, they're--</i>

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:07.487
What happened,
Father?

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:10.757
The humans.. most
likely the ones who
were mesmerized by

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:14.528
the energy from the
mirrors.. are now
trapped inside of them!

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.596
[gasping]

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.437
Nehalennia's
curse.. is probably
behind it all!

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.972
Oh no!

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:27.140
Will the Sailor
Guardians make it in
time?

00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:29.910
They can do it. We
have to believe!

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.411
Yes, of course...

00:03:34.348 --> 00:03:35.349
[yelping]

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.652
[grunting]

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.563
Please, Mamo! You
have to wake up!

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:54.601
You must despise me
for this. But even if
you were to go as far

00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:58.972
as kill me, the curse
would still remain.
Those who are

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.976
captives in my
nightmare will
never awaken!

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.281
<i>[chuckling]</i>
<i>Ah, what a</i>
<i>wonderful feeling!</i>

00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:08.549
[gasping]

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:14.521
[struggling]

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:15.355
Hmph.

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:19.493
Mamo... help me!

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:24.731
If you don't wake
up, I'll--I'll
disappear.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.437
You have to wake up!

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.742
[shivering]

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:36.877
[gasping]

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.711
[grunting]

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:41.048
Mamo?

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:43.083
Chibi Moon! Keep
calling out to him!

00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:45.118
[gasping]

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:47.621
Ah!

00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:52.125
Silence.. Wall!

00:04:58.398 --> 00:04:59.533
Mamo?

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.736
<i>Answer me, please!</i>

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:06.473
How horrible...

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.545
I will take away
everything the
Princess cherishes:

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:15.582
The man she loves,
her friends, even the
Earth itself.

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:20.087
She will know the
vengeance of one who
was thrust into darkness.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.090
You're a depraved
woman obsessed with
nightmares...

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.194
[breathing weakly]

00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:29.496
<i>You leave me no</i>
<i>choice.</i>

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.397
Mm?

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.568
I will eliminate you,
the root of this
evil, and put an end

00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:35.736
to everything.

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:41.542
In the name of Sailor
Saturn, I will unleash
the Power of Destruction.

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:47.114
[laughing] What inane
chatter. Do you
really think I can't

00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:48.749
see through your
ruse?

00:05:48.782 --> 00:05:52.352
That power is a
double-edged sword;
If you use it, your

00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:56.190
body will be
destroyed as well.
[chuckling]

00:05:56.223 --> 00:05:59.760
You expect me to
believe you'd
actually do that?

00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:02.696
Yes... for it is
my mission.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.634
[gasping]

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.272
<i>Wait... you really</i>
<i>intend to die along</i>
<i>with me?! Where's the</i>

00:06:12.306 --> 00:06:15.976
<i>meaning in that? Your</i>
<i>death would serve no</i>
<i>purpose!</i>

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:20.080
That's not true. I
have faith...

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:21.615
In what?

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.054
The Princess. She is
our beacon of hope. I
cannot allow that

00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:28.989
light to be
extinguished from
this world.

00:06:29.022 --> 00:06:31.191
Those eyes again!

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:33.360
I despise that look!

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:40.868
Stop it! Don't look
at me like that!

00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:42.102
[grunting]

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:47.808
Usagi is someone each
of us loves with all
our hearts!

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:52.246
Nelhalennia, haven't you
ever had a friend like
that before?

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.881
Silence!

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:54.982
[bracing grunt]

00:06:56.717 --> 00:07:01.588
Princess, please
protect the future. And
Chibi-Usa along with it.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.527
Silence Glaive..
Surprise!

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.528
[gasping]

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:21.141
[falling]

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:26.146
[gasping]

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.287
[trembling]

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.191
Don't do it...

00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:39.459
Chibi Moon?

00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:45.499
Don't use that power,
Saturn... or you'll
die.

00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:47.134
But...

00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:50.938
You were the one that
told me to have faith
in the Prince and

00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:53.574
Princess. Remember
that?

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:56.910
We are gonna be fine.
The two of them
aren't gonna let

00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:58.378
this defeat them.

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:00.347
So please...

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.115
Chibi Moon, no!

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.055
[chuckling]

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:10.324
[screaming]

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:14.828
It seems I
underestimated
you, girl.

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:17.965
<i>I should have sealed</i>
<i>you away inside a</i>
<i>mirror from the</i>

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.701
<i>beginning, like I did</i>
<i>the others.</i>

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:23.804
[chuckling] My
revenge on the
Princess can now

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.539
begin in full swing.

00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:28.575
Enjoy your time in
your prison of glass.

00:08:30.878 --> 00:08:33.180
[screaming]

00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:40.087
[chuckling]

00:08:40.787 --> 00:08:43.023
[laughing]

00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:48.529
[chuckling]
I've given you all a
front row seat to

00:08:48.562 --> 00:08:53.033
watch as I dispose of
your pathetic Princess.
[chuckling]

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:55.502
[giggling]

00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:57.404
<i>Nehalennia.</i>

00:08:57.437 --> 00:08:58.539
Mm.

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:12.686
[struggling]

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:17.424
Welcome, Princess of
the White Moon. I
have to commend you

00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:20.060
for actually making
it to my palace.

00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:23.497
But I'm afraid you're
too late.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.100
[struggling]
Too late?

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:31.138
[chuckling]
Every single person
who has fallen under

00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:34.875
my curse is now a
captive of my
nightmare.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.610
[gasping]

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:41.081
Very soon, the sun
will rise, after
that, they will never

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:43.116
be able to awaken.

00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:45.519
Chibi-Usa!

00:09:46.787 --> 00:09:47.721
Usagi.

00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:52.593
[panting]
Chibi-Usa... why did
you come here?

00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:54.895
Because...

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.730
Hang on!

00:09:58.832 --> 00:10:03.937
I'm sorry. I couldn't
rescue Mamo like I
wanted to.

00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:05.439
Chibi-Usa!

00:10:08.075 --> 00:10:13.080
Don't you.. worry
about me. I have
faith in you, Usagi.

00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:19.052
You're so warm.
It feels nice.

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:22.356
Chibi-Usa... Don't
leave me!

00:10:26.527 --> 00:10:29.963
[gasping and crying]

00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:40.374
Nooo! You can't
go! You can't.
[sobbing]

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:07.301
[trembling]

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:11.972
How tragic. To think
that your daughter,
the symbol of your

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:14.074
love, is no more.

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:17.978
Mourn for her. Grieve
for her.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:21.915
Your nightmare will
never end... for all
eternity.

00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:26.620
[crying]
What did Chibi-Usa
ever to do you?

00:11:27.888 --> 00:11:30.157
She didn't deserve
any of this!

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.861
Look at those eyes!
Do you despise me?

00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:35.929
Why don't you take a
look behind you?

00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:38.498
Your anger is only
sure to grow.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.268
[grunting]

00:11:43.003 --> 00:11:44.171
[gasping]

00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:52.079
No.

00:11:53.447 --> 00:11:55.115
That's right, every
one of your friends
who tried to save you

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:59.987
has fallen into my
hands. You're
completely alone now.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.356
Why did you do such a
horrible thing?

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:06.793
In order to exact my
revenge on you. So
that you could

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:10.030
experience the same
loneliness I felt.

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:16.136
Tell me... is this
excruciating?

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:20.174
After all, in every
one of your
lifetimes: past,

00:12:20.207 --> 00:12:24.111
present, and even
future, you grew up
happy, always

00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:26.246
surrounded by loved
ones.

00:12:29.316 --> 00:12:32.920
Before I acquired
that mirror, I was
all alone.

00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:41.895
<i>[chanting]</i>
<i>My lovely Queen,</i>
<i>Nehalennia!</i>

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:45.032
It didn't matter
how much people
worshipped me.

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:50.337
<i>[chanting]</i>
<i>My lovely Queen,</i>
<i>Nehalennia!</i>

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:55.042
I had no one with
whom I could share my
joy or my sadness.

00:12:55.075 --> 00:12:59.213
For so long, I had to
endure that
loneliness. But

00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:03.483
then.. finally! The
mirror saved me from
that horrible feeling!

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:10.057
The mirror promised
to give me eternal
beauty, beyond my

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.692
wildest dreams!

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:19.199
I didn't need
friends or loved
ones. I was the only

00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:23.504
friend I needed. I
was the only one I
loved. For all

00:13:23.537 --> 00:13:27.708
eternity, the one
person I knew I could
trust- in whom I

00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:30.677
could confide my
feelings - was me!

00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:34.715
For the first time, I
was freed from
loneliness. I had

00:13:34.748 --> 00:13:36.250
defeated it!

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:41.688
That is why I needed
to remain beautiful
forever. So I would

00:13:41.722 --> 00:13:46.026
never have to
experience those
feelings ever again.

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:48.862
In the same way
that you needed
your friends,

00:13:48.896 --> 00:13:51.265
I needed the
Dream Mirror.

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:56.036
But then, that
wretched Queen of the
White Moon sealed me

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:59.273
away in that cold,
abysmal darkness!

00:14:00.974 --> 00:14:03.410
Do you know how it
felt to be alone
again without my

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:07.014
precious mirror?! Do
you have any idea?!

00:14:07.047 --> 00:14:09.049
[screaming]

00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:11.318
A girl like you could
never understand!!

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.452
[grunting]

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.755
Ahh!

00:14:15.322 --> 00:14:16.456
Uhhh!

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.392
[screaming]

00:14:19.793 --> 00:14:23.230
[grunting]

00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:29.937
At long last, my
revenge will be
complete.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.471
[stirring]

00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:36.476
How I've waited for
the day my fury would
finally reach its mark.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.512
[breathing weakly]

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.282
[grunting]

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:45.619
I'll see that your
death is a painful
one.

00:14:45.652 --> 00:14:52.492
[choking]

00:14:52.526 --> 00:14:53.660
[gasping]

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:58.899
[crying softly]

00:14:58.932 --> 00:15:02.603
Don't. Don't look
at me with pity.

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:05.339
Stop it!

00:15:06.306 --> 00:15:09.243
[choking]

00:15:09.276 --> 00:15:13.580
Curse you! I told
you not to look at me
like that!

00:15:13.614 --> 00:15:17.451
[grunting]

00:15:17.484 --> 00:15:19.920
Stop it! Stop it!

00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:21.421
[screaming]

00:15:21.455 --> 00:15:23.290
<i>[gasping for air]</i>

00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:25.158
[struggling]

00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:28.195
Why do you continue
to look at me with
sympathy in your

00:15:28.228 --> 00:15:33.767
eyes? You should hate
me! Go on! I know you
want to!

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:41.208
No. If it had been
me.. I couldn't live
all alone like that.

00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:45.445
Bearing all of that
loneliness the way
you did.. I could

00:15:45.479 --> 00:15:47.047
never do that.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.083
Don't talk like you
know anything about
it!

00:15:50.117 --> 00:15:53.554
You have no idea what
such loneliness feels
like!

00:15:53.587 --> 00:15:57.257
<i>You're probably</i>
<i>right. But you must</i>
<i>know that doing all</i>

00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:59.893
of this isn't gonna
make you feel any
better!

00:15:59.927 --> 00:16:01.061
What's that?

00:16:02.396 --> 00:16:06.066
If you want revenge,
then go ahead and
take it all out on me.

00:16:06.099 --> 00:16:10.804
Just please leave
everyone else out of
it, I beg you.

00:16:10.838 --> 00:16:15.542
It's alright. They
all know now the pain
you went through.

00:16:15.576 --> 00:16:17.077
They will accept you.

00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:20.747
All of them would be
your friend.

00:16:21.849 --> 00:16:25.452
Go... do what needs
to be done.

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:27.221
You're serious.

00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:43.470
If that's really your
wish, then--
[gasping]

00:16:53.547 --> 00:16:54.615
[gasping for air]

00:16:54.648 --> 00:16:58.252
Absurd! How was he
able to break free of
my curse?!

00:17:00.587 --> 00:17:01.755
[gasping]

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.491
What's happening?

00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:38.458
Chibi-Usa, Mamo,
Everyone, I--

00:17:38.492 --> 00:17:40.894
We already know.

00:17:40.928 --> 00:17:42.930
There's still time
to make things right.

00:17:42.963 --> 00:17:44.932
It's not dawn yet.

00:17:44.965 --> 00:17:47.034
Mm.

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:50.304
If we put all our
powers together, I
know...

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:54.474
I know we can help
her.

00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:59.413
What is this?

00:18:12.893 --> 00:18:14.761
You! Curse you
all!

00:18:14.795 --> 00:18:26.507
[screaming]

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.207
[grunting]

00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:39.086
[panicked breaking]

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:50.030
Don't be afraid.

00:18:50.063 --> 00:18:52.099
You're not alone
anymore.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:55.002
Anyone's heart
would grow cold if
they were alone.

00:18:55.035 --> 00:18:57.671
Please, open
your heart.

00:18:57.704 --> 00:19:00.374
There's still time to
atone for your
mistakes.

00:19:00.407 --> 00:19:01.909
Be brave.

00:19:01.942 --> 00:19:03.810
Believe in yourself.

00:19:03.844 --> 00:19:06.146
And have faith in all
of us.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.316
Believe in my Mommy,
in Usagi...

00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:31.839
<i>Do you feel it? Do</i>
<i>you feel everyone's</i>
<i>hearts?</i>

00:19:31.872 --> 00:19:35.609
<i>All of this energy</i>
<i>that we've brought</i>
<i>together, is for</i>

00:19:35.642 --> 00:19:37.144
<i>you, Nehalennia!</i>

00:19:46.587 --> 00:19:51.592
<i>Think back! Try to</i>
<i>remember your biggest</i>
<i>dream as a child.</i>

00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:54.528
My biggest dream
as a child?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.004
[exhaling]
It feels so warm.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.544
That's right.. the
thing I dreamed of
was having friends.

00:20:10.577 --> 00:20:14.515
People whom I could
talk to, whether I
was happy or sad.

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:19.753
Is it.. really
possible to start
over?

00:20:40.507 --> 00:20:43.010
[stirring]

00:20:43.043 --> 00:20:45.812
Did I... fall
asleep?

00:20:45.846 --> 00:20:47.481
Yes, but just for a
moment.

00:20:47.514 --> 00:20:51.185
You must have been
tired. Why don't you
rest in your room?

00:20:51.218 --> 00:20:52.519
Okay.

00:20:57.891 --> 00:21:06.099
Um, would... would
someone be able to
sing me a lullaby?

00:21:06.133 --> 00:21:08.202
Well, of course, my
lady.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.205
[smiling]

00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:20.047
It's finally over. Or
rather, for her, it's

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.948
a brand new
beginning.

00:21:20.981 --> 00:21:21.982
That's right.

00:21:22.015 --> 00:21:24.251
I sure hope she finds
happiness.

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:25.986
Me too.

00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:28.322
By the way,
Jupiter.

00:21:28.355 --> 00:21:29.489
What is it?

00:21:29.923 --> 00:21:31.358
This is yours.

00:21:31.792 --> 00:21:33.093
My earring.

00:21:34.895 --> 00:21:36.363
Thanks, Mako.

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:40.033
<i>Looks like they made</i>
<i>it just in time.</i>

00:21:40.067 --> 00:21:42.536
As dreams fade away
into morning,

00:21:42.569 --> 00:21:45.439
a brand new day
can begin for
all of us.

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:46.607
<i>That's right.</i>

00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:56.450
<i>[sinister laughing]</i>

00:23:34.815 --> 00:23:38.285
<i>(squealing)</i>
<i>It's that popular</i>

00:23:38.318 --> 00:23:40.554
Lights! Usagi, let's
go take a closer
look!

00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:43.690
Minako, we don't have
time for that. A new
enemy has appeared.

00:23:43.724 --> 00:23:46.193
<i>What? Already?!</i>
<i>Wait a minute, but</i>
<i>that's a Sailor</i>

00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:48.328
<i>Guardian! And those</i>
<i>other three</i>
<i>mysterious</i>

00:23:48.362 --> 00:23:50.497
<i>shadows, are they</i>
<i>Sailor Guardians,</i>
<i>too?!</i>

00:23:50.531 --> 00:23:52.299
What is going on
here?!

00:23:52.332 --> 00:23:56.036
Next time on Sailor
Stars, Farewells
and Encounters: The

00:23:56.069 --> 00:23:58.005
Transitioning Stars
of Destiny.

00:23:58.038 --> 00:24:00.574
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
