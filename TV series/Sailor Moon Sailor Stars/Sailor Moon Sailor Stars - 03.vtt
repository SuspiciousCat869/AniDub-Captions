Yeah, yeah! Just let
us get to our seats!

00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:12.419

Huh?

All the teachers are gathered at
the faculty office for an
emergency meeting.

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:21.094
Could it be about punishing
students who are habitually
late to school?

00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:22.763
No, it's not about that.

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:28.101
(Ami) There are apparently a lot
of absences today, mostly girls.

Wow, do they all have the flu
or something?

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:32.906
I wonder if they'll close
down the school.

That's not it.

<i>morning.</i>

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:49.890
Yeah, it seems like it's made
its way here as well.

00:04:49.923 --> 00:04:55.562
Minako, instead of watching TV
in the morning, you should just
leave for school earlier.

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:58.799
Uh?

00:04:58.832 --> 00:05:01.401
Mako! Why did you just stop?!

00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:02.436

Hm?

Huh?

00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:09.476
Hmm. Let me talk to her.

Hey, um, you're really
interested in staring at that
mirror. Is there a reason?

something really special about
it, is that it?

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:28.529

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:29.062
Uh.

00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:34.568
Huh, that's odd. Just looks
like an ordinary mirror to me,
same as anyone else's.

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:37.471
Hm?

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:41.141

00:05:57.024 --> 00:06:00.427
Uh, sorry. I thought I
felt something strange coming
from it, so I just...

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.461
Huh?

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:02.529
[sighs]

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:08.502
I'm really sorry. You can have
my mirror, it's the least I can
do. Here.

00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:13.740
[awkward sigh]

00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:20.147
My mirror. How am I supposed
to go on living if I don't have
my mirror?

00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:22.115
Uh.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.752
Aren't you being, a little
overdramatic?

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:32.059
[gasps]

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.396
<i>(Usagi) Wait. Mamo's eye had a</i>

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:44.705
Huh? N-No, it's nothing.

<i>Mamoru! You there? Buddy?</i>

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:16.303
We're supposed to go to that
offline get-together today,
remember?

00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:21.975
Huh, that's weird. Maybe he
left already.

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:23.343
Who's that?

00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:29.049
Seems like a suspicious
individual. Wait a sec, is
Mamo not home?

00:07:33.387 --> 00:07:35.956
No answer, huh.

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:40.294
Well! It's gonna take a lot
more than that to make me give
up and go home!

00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:45.165
As proof of his love, Mamo gave
me a special gift. An extra
key!

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.603
Usagi, sometimes you're a bit
over the top.

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:55.142
Mamo? It's me. I'm coming in,
'kay?

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:59.179
So dark. Maybe Mamo really
did go out, after all.

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:06.086
Where could he have gone? He
had said he wasn't feeling well.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:13.760
And what's with all of these
mirrors? Were there always
this many before?

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.729
[slightly startled]

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:20.501
[soft sigh]

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:24.738
Mamo? Are you in there?

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:44.725
[startled gasp]

00:08:46.894 --> 00:08:48.195
Mamo!

00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:49.897
[gasps]

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.198
Who is it?!

00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:53.333
Why're you here?

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:57.704
Mamo, was there someone
else in here?

00:08:57.738 --> 00:09:01.608
You just barged in here without
my permission. I can't believe
how rude you are.

00:09:01.642 --> 00:09:07.281
S-Sorry. I was just worried
and wanted to make sure you were
alright.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.387
I don't need your concern. I'm
fine.

00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:14.788

[worried gasp] Are
you all right?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.528
Stop it!

00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:24.932
What's going on?

00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:31.104
I'm sorry. I don't know what
got into me. I haven't been
myself lately.

00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:35.676
I'm probably just tired, I
should really get some rest.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:41.515
Hopefully I'll feel a lot
better in the morning.

00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:46.453
If you think that's what's
wrong, then you should do that.

00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:49.656
Oh, that's right! I asked my mom
to make some food for you.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:53.594
(Usagi) I figured you could use
<i>some vitamins to help get your</i>
<i>strength up.</i>

00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:56.230
<i>So I had her put a lot of</i>
<i>vegetables inside.</i>

00:09:56.263 --> 00:10:01.235
They're in the kitchen if
you're hungry, Promise me you
won't forget to eat?

00:10:01.568 --> 00:10:02.436
Okay.

00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:05.439
Oh, and about breaking
your mirror, I'm sorry.

00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:06.173
It's fine.

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:10.210
I'll head out then. Gimme a
call when you're feeling better,
okay?

00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:12.312
[soft sigh]

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:18.785

[worried breaths]

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:51.418
<i>(Ami) What?! This was in</i>
<i>Mamoru's room?</i>

00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:55.422
Mm-hm. When I came to see
him, there were mirrors
everywhere.

00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:57.991
And all he does is stare at
them.

00:10:58.025 --> 00:10:59.560
<i>(Chibi-Usa) Could it be...</i>

00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:03.096
He caught that new disease that
takes away all of your
motivation?

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.831
No way, he's a guy.

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:08.335
It's true that it has been
spreading mostly among young
women.

00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:11.839
But that doesn't mean that men
aren't able to catch it, too.

00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:13.707
(Ami) We should get him checked
<i>out.</i>

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.409
Wait a minute!

00:11:16.877 --> 00:11:19.746
Even if Mamo really does have
that illness, how do we get
rid of it?

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.952
Yeah, that's definitely the big
question here. They're still
no closer to finding a cure.

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:26.987
[saddened sigh]

00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:37.497
Mirrors?!

00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:42.536
I wonder.

00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:44.037
What is it, Rei?

00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:48.342
Do you think that maybe the
illness has something to do with
mirrors?

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.076
Huh?

00:11:50.177 --> 00:11:51.612
There were those monsters we
fought the other day...

00:11:51.645 --> 00:11:54.081
and what happened to our
shrine's sacred mirror.

00:11:55.849 --> 00:11:58.752
<i>(Rei) Don't you think it's too</i>
<i>coincidental that all these</i>
<i>events involved mirrors?</i>

00:11:58.785 --> 00:12:00.420
You're right.

00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:01.722
[worried sigh]

00:12:01.755 --> 00:12:03.757
What was it Setsuna mentioned?

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:09.963
She said all of us are in some
kind of "great danger." What
do you think she meant by that?

00:12:09.997 --> 00:12:12.799
The White Moon is being shrouded
by a dark shadow.

00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:17.271
One with radiant, golden hair is
being pursued by pure evil.

00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:19.239
[gasps]

00:12:19.706 --> 00:12:21.175
Setsuna!

<i>(Chibi-Usa) Hotaru!</i>

00:12:23.277 --> 00:12:26.180
I don't know anything for
certain as of now, but...

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:29.850
What we do know is that some
sort of darkness is coming.

<i>(Rei) "The White Moon is being</i>
<i>shrouded by a dark shadow."</i>

[gasps] What's it all
mean?

00:12:41.028 --> 00:12:44.064
It means someone is really
jealous of Sailor Moon, and
probably wants to punish her.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:49.303
My visions were dim, but what
I can say is something is about
to begin.

00:12:49.336 --> 00:12:53.040
<i>(Hotaru) And at the same time,</i>
<i>something is about to end.</i>

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:56.043
<i>Each event has its purpose.</i>

00:12:56.076 --> 00:13:00.380
And they are all converging into
a single path towards
destruction.

00:13:03.717 --> 00:13:06.753
<i>(Setsuna Meioh) Hotaru had</i>
<i>sensed the darkness rapidly</i>
<i>approaching...</i>

00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:11.525
<i>which in turn prompted her</i>
<i>reawakening as Sailor Saturn.</i>

00:13:11.558 --> 00:13:17.664
<i>This darkness, it must also be</i>
the reason why I became Eternal
<i>Sailor Moon.</i>

00:13:17.698 --> 00:13:21.435
(Hotaru) The night of the meteor
<i>shower, I saw a vision of the</i>
<i>darkness...</i>

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:26.006
entering mirrors throughout this
<i>city that made me tremble</i>
<i>in fear.</i>

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:31.445
That's when I knew I had
to take action for the sake of
this world.

00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:38.285
So, the strange thing that
happened to our shrine's sacred
mirror...

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:41.088
And this new illness that's
been going around.

00:13:41.121 --> 00:13:46.260
Exactly. They are likely due
to the power of the darkness
inside the mirrors.

00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:49.162
Take the upmost care to avert
your gaze from them...

00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:52.199
or else the power of darkness
will consume you.

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:57.938
(Usagi) Is that what happened to
<i>Mamo? Was he consumed by the</i>
<i>darkness inside a mirror?</i>

00:13:57.971 --> 00:14:03.644
When I was over at his place
earlier, I saw some kind of dark
shadow.

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:07.314
<i>(Usagi) And then there was the</i>
<i>other night, when I was in my</i>
<i>room.</i>

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.020
<i>I felt this, weird presence.</i>

00:14:13.654 --> 00:14:15.055
<i>What does it mean?</i>

00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:17.624
We believe the shadow is
threatening the Prince.

00:14:17.658 --> 00:14:21.361
The other two have already gone
on ahead. Please make haste!

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.598
<i>Mamo!</i>

00:14:25.966 --> 00:14:29.703
Space Sword Blaster!

00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:33.040
[screams]

00:14:33.974 --> 00:14:35.642
You know, today really got me
thinking.

00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:36.710
About what?

00:14:38.345 --> 00:14:40.347
For once, I actually wish my
intuition would take a little
vacation.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.785
Oh? Well I think this is much
better than trying to find
ways to kill time at home.

00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:48.622
Are you trying to tell me that
you're getting bored of being
with me?

00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:49.223
[chuckles]

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.726
Submarine Reflection!

00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:55.729
[perishing scream]

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:57.931
[devilish laughter]

00:14:57.965 --> 00:15:00.033
There's no end to them.

00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:02.936
<i>(Sailor Pluto) Dead Scream.</i>

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.605
[perishing scream]

00:15:04.638 --> 00:15:06.173
Uranus! Neptune!

00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:08.976
Glad you decided to show up,
ladies.

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:13.247
We'll hold them off here. You
six, hurry and go save the
Prince!

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.448
<i>(Sailor Moon) Got it!</i>

00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:18.452
<i>(Sailor Moon) C'mon, c'mon,</i>
<i>hurry up!</i>

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:25.592
[sighs]

00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:28.795
[surprised scream]

00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:30.030

00:15:30.063 --> 00:15:32.099
[screams]

00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:33.967
<i>(Sailor Jupiter) Jupiter...!</i>

00:15:35.669 --> 00:15:40.174
...Oak Evolution!

00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:42.543
[obliterated scream]

00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:44.711
Now's our chance! Let's
head to the stairs!

00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:48.215
Running up all those school
stairs is finally gonna pay off!

00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:49.049
Huh?

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.585
Nothing! Nothing! C'mon, Sailor
Moon, let's go!

00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:55.122
[panting]

00:15:58.825 --> 00:15:59.560
[gasps]

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:04.198
[panting] Hey, what's the
matter? Why did you stop?

00:16:04.231 --> 00:16:06.567
We don't have time to waste!

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.338
That black shadow I mentioned,
I've actually seen it before!

00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:12.072
Huh?!

00:16:12.105 --> 00:16:13.540
That thing...

00:16:14.575 --> 00:16:15.843
It's Nehalennia!

00:16:15.876 --> 00:16:17.177
What?!

00:16:19.213 --> 00:16:21.215
But that's impossible!

00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:24.685
Yeah! Nehalennia was sealed away
in the New Moon!

00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:31.158
That's true, but what if the
seal had been broken somehow?

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:34.161
Mamo!

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:49.877
What is this?

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.078
Stop Mamo!

00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:53.113
Don't look at the mirrors!

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.749
But it makes me feel calm.

00:16:57.985 --> 00:17:01.188
I can feel myself just drifting
away.

00:17:01.722 --> 00:17:03.490
[soft breath]

00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:06.093
No! Don't look into it!

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:09.229
The power of darkness is
emanating from those mirrors!

00:17:09.263 --> 00:17:10.264
Mamo!

00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:17.204
Listen to me, you have to
stop looking at the mirror.
Please?

00:17:17.638 --> 00:17:19.006
Shut up!

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:20.407
Sailor Moon!

00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:24.978
What did you do that for?
Apologize to her!

00:17:28.148 --> 00:17:30.150
I said apologize!

00:17:30.184 --> 00:17:33.420
Don't worry. It's
okay, Chibi Moon.

00:17:33.453 --> 00:17:34.621
[gasps]

00:17:36.957 --> 00:17:38.992
[gasping]

00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:41.295
[soft sigh]

00:17:42.996 --> 00:17:44.331
That's...

00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:45.299
Nehalennia!

00:17:45.332 --> 00:17:48.068
So then, the seal really was
broken!

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:56.176
Princess of the White Moon, you
are looking very beautiful.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.445
What are you planning to do with
Mamo?!

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:00.314
[smirks]

00:18:01.849 --> 00:18:06.553
While I was sealed away inside
the cold, suffocating expanse of
darkness...

00:18:06.587 --> 00:18:11.992
you were on the outside,
laughing at my misfortune.

00:18:12.025 --> 00:18:18.866
(Nehalennia) You, with your
radiant, golden hair glistening
in the bright rays of the sun.

00:18:18.899 --> 00:18:21.535
Happily surrounded by your loved
ones.

00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:24.471
Nehalennia I have never
laughed at you!

00:18:24.505 --> 00:18:25.539
Be silent!

00:18:25.572 --> 00:18:26.540
[gasps]

00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:32.980
I will see that all of your
loved ones are sent down the
path to destruction!

00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:36.316
Starting with him!

00:18:39.686 --> 00:18:40.621
[gasps]

00:18:42.856 --> 00:18:46.226
Stop it! Let him go! Mamo!

00:18:47.661 --> 00:18:49.997

[gasps]

00:18:58.038 --> 00:19:03.010
Your petty little tricks are
nothing compared to the power
of darkness that I possess.

00:19:04.745 --> 00:19:08.682
[saddened breaths]

00:19:08.715 --> 00:19:10.184
Everyone! Help me!

00:19:10.217 --> 00:19:13.554
Got it! Everyone, focus your
power on Sailor Moon!

00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:14.321
Right!

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:27.467

Hmph.

00:20:43.744 --> 00:20:48.849
Sailor Moon I want you to
watch closely as I hold the man
you so love in my arms.

00:20:48.882 --> 00:20:54.855
(Nehalennia) Watch as this world

You fool.

00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:16.376
It's much too late for that.
My curse has already taken hold
of his heart.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:20.113
Your voice no longer has any
hope of reaching him.

[upset gasping]

00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:27.454
By the coming dawn, this man
