No denying it, he'll be held
back.

is to hold a study session!

(KO) <i>Hey, Akane.</i>

00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:42.142
Huh?

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:48.382
How can you be working as a nun
and a stage director?

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:54.821
There are many things in life I
want to partake in. I don't want
to settle on just one dream and
give up everything else. It

00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:56.290
feels far too limiting.

00:10:57.558 --> 00:11:00.827
Oh, really? Isn't that called
having a half-hearted mindset?

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:06.667
No, because I'm committed to
always give everything I have. I
believe you're the one who's
being half-hearted.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:08.135
[shocked]

00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:14.575
Listen, I'm giving this musical
everything I've got, okay?

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:17.411
Are you really, though?

00:11:18.045 --> 00:11:19.112
[gritting teeth]

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:48.342
(AKANE) <i>I went to see a Three</i>
<i>Lights concert before casting</i>
<i>you in my musical.</i>

00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:50.677
(KO) Thanks, I guess.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:57.985
While I watched you three on
stage... it was obvious to me
that you were trying to send out
a message as you sang from the

00:11:58.018 --> 00:11:59.319
bottom of your hearts.

00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:01.455
(KO) <i>That's right.</i>

00:12:03.023 --> 00:12:06.994
<i>We always sing at the very top</i>
of our lungs when we perform at
<i>our shows.</i>

00:12:07.027 --> 00:12:10.063
<i>It's all for that one special</i>
<i>person.</i>

00:12:21.842 --> 00:12:26.113
(AKANE) <i>You, Taiki, and Yaten</i>
<i>were so dazzling during the</i>
<i>entire concert.</i>

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.015
Well, now...

00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:30.584
It seems like you do have an eye
for talent.

00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:34.021
Of course I do! I'm an
accomplished director, remember?

00:12:34.054 --> 00:12:39.459
Yet, somehow... As an actor, you
appear to be totally inept.
There's no fire in you.

00:12:40.294 --> 00:12:41.061
Huh?!

00:12:42.963 --> 00:12:45.465
Do you understand how
frustrating it is? Why is there
such a difference in your
performance?

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:50.137
Are you automatically assuming
my musical can't get your
message across and isn't worth
your time or energy?!

00:12:50.604 --> 00:12:51.338
[gasp]

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:59.246
Anyway...Until you show me that
same radiance, don't expect me
to go any easier on you.

00:12:59.713 --> 00:13:00.614
Akane.

00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:04.918
Won't you get in trouble if the
<i>school finds out?</i>

00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:10.224
[chuckle] It won't be as much
trouble as you'll be in if you
fail your makeup test bye now.

00:13:10.724 --> 00:13:11.358
Wha-?

00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:12.559
[Chuckle]

00:13:14.628 --> 00:13:15.462
Hey!

00:13:16.697 --> 00:13:17.531
Yes?

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:22.469
You know. I still don't think I
really like you all that much.

00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:26.673
Believe me, I'm perfectly fine
with that.

00:13:26.707 --> 00:13:32.412
It makes it easier to push you
even harder! [Chuckle]

00:13:32.446 --> 00:13:36.049
Uh-oh...Looks like things got
way worse... [flustered]

00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:38.318
[observing]

00:13:39.453 --> 00:13:42.356
<i>No matter how hard I try, I</i>
<i>don't get it!</i>

00:13:42.823 --> 00:13:43.624
Get what?

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:50.497
The director likes to push you
around and insult you during
rehearsals... So, why would you
wanna keep practicing with her?

00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:53.367
If I back down now, that means I
lose, right?

00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:56.503
You like being...bullied?

00:13:56.537 --> 00:13:59.540
[chuckle] Unfortunately, you
wouldn't understand.

00:13:59.573 --> 00:14:00.574
What do you mean?

00:14:01.909 --> 00:14:04.278
<i>I have to give everything I've</i>
<i>got...</i>

00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:06.680
For her sake and mine.

00:14:07.548 --> 00:14:09.349
What was that?

00:14:09.383 --> 00:14:09.516
Hm?

00:14:12.553 --> 00:14:16.323
Hey, Bun-head... So, do you have
a boyfriend?

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:21.128
[confused] Yeah, I do. He's
studying overseas right now.

00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:24.631
[chuckle] Well, seems like
I still have a chance then.

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:26.066
Hm?

00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:27.167
See ya later!

00:14:27.801 --> 00:14:28.702
Uh... wait a minute, Seiya!

00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:31.939
The makeup test is tomorrow!

00:14:31.972 --> 00:14:33.006
Yeah, I know!

00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:36.543
<i>What's with him? He's so</i>
<i>weird...</i>

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:48.689
(KO) <i>I thought you said you were</i>
<i>going to start pushing me</i>
<i>harder.</i>

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:49.690
[waking up efforts]

00:14:50.824 --> 00:14:53.560
Excuse me? Don't you have a
makeup test to study for?

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:59.833
I'm not fully satisfied unless
I'm putting my all into
everything.

00:14:59.867 --> 00:15:03.670
[chuckle] Your acting
better be amazing or I'll
recast. Got it?

00:15:03.704 --> 00:15:08.242
Be my guest. If you're actually
able to find someone who can
outshine me, that is.

00:15:08.976 --> 00:15:11.912
[Laughing]

00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:12.980
(AKANE) <i>One! Two!</i>

00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:27.094
<i>Now we're talking...!</i>

00:15:31.098 --> 00:15:32.766
Nothing to worry about, I
guess...

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:35.402
(REI) <i>Wrong! You should be</i>
<i>very worried, Usagi!</i>

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:35.736
[surprised]

00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:40.107
What are you going to do if you
end up bombing the makeup test
and get held back because of
it?!

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.375
Why are you here...?

00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:46.446
Stop concerning yourself with
others! You need to go straight
home and focus on your studies,
missy!

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.948
[struggle]

00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:50.684
(REI) Don't worry, I'll be more
than happy to watch Seiya for
you!

00:15:50.717 --> 00:15:53.086
(USAGI) <i>It's always about you,</i>
<i>isn't it Rei?!</i>

00:15:57.558 --> 00:16:01.895
Oh my, look at the time... I'm
thinking we should probably call
it a night.

00:16:01.929 --> 00:16:03.997
No! Not yet!

00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:05.332
[chuckle]

00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:10.304
He sure is a stubborn one...

00:16:11.939 --> 00:16:14.808
(CHUZO) <i>Oh, wow! You're somehow</i>
way more dazzling than I thought
<i>you'd be!</i>

00:16:14.842 --> 00:16:15.442
Hm?

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:18.946
Isn't my intuition just
absolutely flawless?!

00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:21.882
I'm sorry... Are you a fan of
the Three Lights?

00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:25.719
Huh? Oh! Allow me to introduce
myself!

00:16:25.752 --> 00:16:29.556
My name's Nezu. I work as a
producer over at Ginga TV.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:35.696
I was really hoping I'd be able
to interview you to find out
just what it is that makes you
shine so brightly!

00:16:35.729 --> 00:16:40.634
[disapproving] I'm sorry, but
no. I don't want my face being
shown on TV.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:46.507
Besides, I would much rather
people experience my musical and
interpret my message through all
the performances they see on

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.274
stage.

00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:50.944
I've said everything I had to
say, so I'd appreciate if you
left now.

00:16:50.978 --> 00:16:55.415
[stunned] So, you are
straight-laced... I was hoping I
was wrong about that.

00:16:56.283 --> 00:16:57.751
Chuu!

00:16:58.819 --> 00:16:59.720
[gasp]

00:17:00.554 --> 00:17:01.555
[scream]

00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:02.556
[gasp]

00:17:04.157 --> 00:17:07.427
Now... Why don't you show me
that Star Seed of yours? I'd
really like to see it...

00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:07.995
Akane!

00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:09.096
Stay out of this!

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:10.497
Whoa!

00:17:10.898 --> 00:17:11.999
Seiya!

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:13.267
Hand it over!

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:15.736
[scream]

00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:17.004
No, Akane!

00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:18.172
Ahhh!

00:17:18.805 --> 00:17:19.273
(KO) <i>Leave her alone!</i>

[trembling]

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:30.484
Ooo! What a lovely Star Seed you
have!

00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:35.155
<i>Oh no... Was I really wrong</i>
<i>again?</i>

00:17:36.857 --> 00:17:37.758
[speechless]

00:17:39.126 --> 00:17:40.694
Sailor Director!

00:17:41.562 --> 00:17:42.596
How could you...?

00:17:44.531 --> 00:17:48.168
You really shouldn't look so
angry, y'know? It's an awful
look for your otherwise handsome
face.

00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:51.305
Alright, Sailor Director... I
leave it to you!

00:17:52.372 --> 00:17:53.040
[chuckle]

00:17:53.707 --> 00:17:56.276

00:18:45.425 --> 00:18:50.864
Ooo! Very good! Now, roll
camera!

(REI) <i>We don't know what it is</i>

[gasps]

00:19:21.895 --> 00:19:28.135
Not one of you knows anything
about us! The pain we've had to
endure... The utter sorrow... of
having to abandon home just so

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.203
we could survive!

00:19:30.237 --> 00:19:31.538
What are you talking about?

That's why... we have no choice
but to fight this way!

Don't you dare move!

If you insist on hurting that
Phage...

00:19:42.649 --> 00:19:45.085
I'm afraid you'll have to go
through me first!

00:19:45.686 --> 00:19:46.753
Why do you care...?

Now's your chance, Sailor Moon!

Mm.

Perhaps what we've needed all
this time... is this girl's
radiance.

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:05.199
(USAGI) Wait! Will we see you
again soon?

00:21:05.232 --> 00:21:08.168
I pray it doesn't turn out that
you're our enemy, Sailor Moon.

When did you even find time to
study?!
