00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:52.312
Wait, Luna's gone missing?

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.983
Yeah, I haven't seen her
around the house in almost a
week.

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:58.986
That's odd. It's not like her
to just disappear.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:00.888
You think something happened
to her?

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:02.589
<i>(Mako) Like she got hit by a</i>
<i>car?</i>

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:04.224
<i>(Ami) Or taken to the pound?</i>

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.694
Or maybe she's become part of
a shamisen band, you know what
I mean?

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:08.662
Minako!

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:10.564
Okay, yeah, that
wasn't funny, sorry.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:12.699
<i>(Mako) Anyway...</i>

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.568
(Rei) We put up a lot of flyers.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.503
All we can do now is wait.

00:02:16.537 --> 00:02:18.572
[gasp] Look, it's Yaten!

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.274
<i>(Rei) He's so cool!</i>

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:21.208
Hey.

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:22.142
Huh?

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.277
<i>(Artemis) That cat!</i>

00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:24.845
Cute cat you've got there.

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:26.513
She's like family.

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:28.916
<i>(Minako) Is that Luna?!</i>

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.117
<i>(Ami) Looks like her.</i>

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:32.319
It's definitely her.

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:33.620
Yup, that's her.

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.155
What's she doing there?

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.891
(Reporter) Can you smile for the
<i>camera, kitty?</i>

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:39.193

<i>Real Face of Yaten."</i>

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.973
You'd think he'd look more
guilty!

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.576
No need to talk about him like
he was a thief.

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.612
Shouldn't we just go over
there and ask him directly?

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:01.348
That's right, we'll demand an
explanation.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:05.552
How exactly did Luna get to be
on TV with Yaten before I did?!

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:07.020
Really?

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:07.888
I'll ask him.

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:08.655
S'cuse me?

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.557
[gasps] We're totally not
stalking! Huh?

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.594
You're Usagi Tsukino from
class one, right?

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:14.261
Me? Yeah.

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:15.362
Would you take this?

00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:17.231
<i>(Mako) A love letter?</i>

[embarrassed]

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:26.607
I see. Well, that's a really
sweet gesture. But, you see,
there already is someone...

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.042
[sighs] There is?

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:34.181
Oh, come on, don't cry. I'm
sure that the right someone
will come along one day.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.284
And that doesn't mean we can't
be friends in the meantime.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.621
Huh? Oh, you mean you're the
one who's in a relationship.

00:03:40.654 --> 00:03:42.556
You're making me blush.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:47.094
Thank goodness! Well, will you
just give this to Yaten
please? Bye!

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:49.196
[embarrassed]

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.965
She really thought that love
letter was for her, didn't
you?

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:56.236
What would have been so strange
about that? It would've been a
lovely gesture, I think.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.539
Er! It's nothing to freak out
about!

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:01.542
<i>(Usagi) Er, Yaten?</i>

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:04.745
[sighs]

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:06.980
Hurry up, Usagi, don't just
stand there!

00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:09.016
Are you enjoying your book,
Yaten?

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.020
Not really. But it's a way to
keep girls from coming up and
talking to me...

00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:15.622
for no good reason, at least it
usually is.

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:17.057
Ugh. Hmph.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.392
What are you doing?!

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.994
For your information, I do
have a good reason!

00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:23.864
Yeah, right. Let me guess.

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:28.268
Ahh. I bet someone handed you
a love letter to give to me,
right?

00:04:28.302 --> 00:04:29.303
Bingo!

00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:31.405
<i>(Yaten) Yeah, I get a lot of</i>
<i>those.</i>

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:32.206
Here.

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:36.143
(Usagi) Aah! What're you doing??

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:39.112
Oh, should I have saved the
plastic bottle for recycling?

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:42.916
Forget the bottle! How can you
throw a love letter in the trash
without even reading it?!

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.919
Don't you have any respect for
the courage it took to write it!

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:47.888
It's really none of your
business.

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:49.022
That's not the point!

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:50.891
Yes, that is the point.

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:54.161
Hey, hey, wait! Who does he
think he is?!

00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:55.896
Well, he is a teen idol.

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:57.731
That is not the issue!

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:58.498
[sheepish laugh]

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.534
<i>(Usagi) He makes me so mad!</i>

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:03.537
Is that why you forgot to ask
him the real question?

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.508
I wonder if Yaten also has a
fear of receiving love
letters?

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:08.976
What do you mean, "also?"

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.477
Nothing! Forget what I said!

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.548
Anyway, we have to confirm if
the cat we saw with Yaten
really was Luna.

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.450
It was her, all right.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:17.751
That lucky cat.

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:19.953
Oh man, I wish I was Luna!

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:22.089
Isn't anyone even a little
worried?

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:23.357
<i>(Luna) I'm fine.</i>

00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:25.893
How can you say that, when we
don't know...oh!

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:26.960
[gasps]

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.096
[yelp of surprise] Luna!

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:32.165
[chuckles] I'm back.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.668
Where have you been? We've
been worried sick about you!

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:38.672
I'm sorry, I should have told
you. I've been with Yaten all
this time.

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:39.406
I knew it!

00:05:40.107 --> 00:05:41.608
Just how did that come about?

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:42.976
Well, you see...

00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:50.651
[yawns] What a lovely
afternoon for a nice long nap.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.019
<i>(Seiya) There it goes! There!</i>

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:53.554
What in the world's going on?

00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:56.323
[stretching]

00:05:57.191 --> 00:06:04.831
[screams/stuttering]

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:09.937
[sighs] That scared the
daylights out of me. What's a
chameleon doing here, anyway?

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.639
Oh, man. I just picked it up
from the store.

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:17.110
Once it's hiding in the leaves,
forget it. It'll blend right in,
we'll never find it.

00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:19.046
Great, now you've done it.

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:20.480
Hey, don't look at me.

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:24.618
You're the one who took the gig
on "Pets of the Stars," when we
don't even have a pet.

00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.220
It's all your fault, Yaten.

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:30.190
Who's the one who took it out
of its cage and tried to get
it to stay on his hand?

00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:31.592
Let's just buy another one.

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:34.061
It took two weeks for that one
to arrive!

00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:35.796
<i>(Seiya) Yeah. It'll never get</i>
<i>here in time.</i>

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:39.766
Then we'll just make do with
something simple, like a dog
or a cat.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.767
A cat?!

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:46.540
What?! You've got to be kidding!
I'm not going to be your second
<i>choice after a chameleon!</i>

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:49.009
Here, kitty.

00:06:50.177 --> 00:06:52.346
<i>On second thought, maybe it's</i>
<i>not such a bad idea.</i>

00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:53.680
Oh, boy.

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:55.649
Anyone else having deja vu?

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:56.850
Hey, wait a minute!

00:06:56.884 --> 00:06:58.886
[grunts]

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.889
[sniffs] Why do you smell so
nice?!

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:04.458
Oh. Because we took a bath
together.

00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:06.159
Wait, you did what?!

00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:08.795
You were in a bathtub with
Yaten??

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:10.631
Can't breathe! [screams]

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:15.802
So if you're a cat, if you're
a cat, then it's okay to take
a bath with him...

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:19.740
and curl up in his bed and get
snuggly under the covers with
him!

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:22.142
Uh, Minako, your nose is
bleeding.

00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:24.478
Ok, then I wanna be a cat,
too!

00:07:24.511 --> 00:07:27.347
Your mind really does run away
with you

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:32.219
Great work, see you tomorrow!

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.922
<i>Ah, there he is.</i>

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:36.823
<i>(Noriko) Oh, Yaten?</i>

00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:39.660
Why don't you ever stick
around when we've finished
shooting?

00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:43.864
It's that cute teen idol,
Noriko Okamachi, in person!

00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:50.170
I just found out you have a
cat, too. They say people who
have cats are the lonely type.

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:53.140
Maybe you're the lonely type,
as well, huh, Yaten?

00:07:53.173 --> 00:07:56.643
Noriko can get so lonely without
her Giuliano.

00:07:56.677 --> 00:08:00.948
Noriko used to have a Siamese
until a little while ago, but
then she got tired of it.

00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:05.652
It wasn't soft and fluffy like a
Himalayan, y'know? What kind of
cat is yours?

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:07.888
Is it some kind of mixed breed?

00:08:07.921 --> 00:08:10.023
(Noriko) You should really get a
<i>Himalayan.</i>

00:08:10.057 --> 00:08:11.458
[angry growl]

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.327
So, what is it you want?

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.530
Maybe you didn't know that
Noriko is an excellent cook...

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:19.299
and she'd love to cook something
for you sometime.

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:21.902
So would you like to come home
with Noriko?

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:22.703
Listen.

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:23.403
Yes?

00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:25.405
The way you talk really annoys
me.

00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:28.675
So stop playing my girlfriend,
we're not on set anymore.

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:30.777
Wo-whoa! Told her.

00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:36.283
[insulted grunt/sob] That was
mean. Noriko was just trying
to...

00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:37.584
So annoying!

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:40.754
Just shut up! You're not even
close to being my type...

00:08:40.787 --> 00:08:43.690
so stop wasting your time and
keep away from me when we're not
working.

00:08:43.724 --> 00:08:47.628
That's fine! Go on being a
stuck-up jerk if you want.

00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:51.265
You're nothing but a passing
teen idol fad, anyway.

00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:51.965
[meow]

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:54.635
Quiet, you! Hmph!

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.871
Yeah, that goes for both of
us.

00:08:57.905 --> 00:08:58.672
<i>[meow]</i>

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:01.408
Hey. How'd you find me?

00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:04.578
<i>(Luna) That smile. Simply</i>
<i>irresistible!</i>

00:09:08.282 --> 00:09:10.684
<i>(Seiya) I told you Inky would</i>
<i>come back.</i>

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:11.485
Huh?

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:14.421
What do you mean, "Inky?"
That's a stupid name.

00:09:14.454 --> 00:09:18.292
A cat this special deserves a
much nicer name than that,
right?

00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:19.026
[meow]

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.494
So, what've you named her?

00:09:20.527 --> 00:09:22.896
Oh. I haven't decided.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:23.463
[disappointed sigh]

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:26.200
Well, okay. In that case,
let's stick with Inky?

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:26.733
No way.

00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:28.268
<i>(Seiya) Giuliano, maybe?</i>

00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:32.573
Speaking of Noriko, did you
say something to her? She
looked really pissed off.

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:34.341
Just told her the truth.

00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:38.512
And she tells me you've been
throwing out your fan mail
without even reading it.

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:40.347
What a blabbermouth.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.684
You don't want to do things
that chase away our fans.

00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:47.621
I just don't trust them. They
all profess to be in love
with us...

00:09:47.654 --> 00:09:50.891
and yet they don't know the
first thing about who we really
are.

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:55.696
It's true. The people of this
world do seem to get quite
passionate about things.

00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:59.566
Well, yeah, but call it whatever
you want, insight or
inspiration...

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.537
haven't you ever had that
feeling of love at first sight?

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.405
What's gotten into you two?

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:08.675
Have you forgotten about her
and the reason we're here at
all?

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:10.944
<i>Who's he talking about?</i>

00:10:10.978 --> 00:10:13.213
You really think we should
be wasting our time...

00:10:13.247 --> 00:10:15.682
with a bunch of people who don't
possess a true star light?

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:21.088
I don't. She's the only one
I'll accept and the only one I
care about.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:24.725
We know. That's the whole
reason we're performing.

00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:28.962
Right. To find the one and
only woman in the galaxy who
matters to us.

00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:33.100
<i>The one and only woman? The</i>
<i>true star light?</i>

00:10:38.105 --> 00:10:43.844
I'm telling you, we cannot
trust the people of this
world. Not one of them.

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:45.712
That may be true, but...

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:47.481
Hmm.

00:10:53.554 --> 00:10:56.390
She is the only person we need
right now.

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:41.635
[meows]

00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:44.271
Good kitty. What a silky coat
you have.

00:11:45.506 --> 00:11:47.274
But of course, that's what I'd
expect from your cat, Yaten.

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:49.309
Less talk, okay? Just hurry it
up.

00:11:49.343 --> 00:11:51.812
Ahh, that famous frosty
attitude! I love it!

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:56.383
<i>Ugh! I've got more suds on the</i>
<i>inside of me than on the</i>
<i>outside of me. Ahh!</i>

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:59.419
You're almost done. Just a
little longer.

00:11:59.453 --> 00:12:01.188
[nervous breathing]

00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:04.658
(Groomer) There. Adorable, isn't
<i>it?</i>

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:06.260
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

00:12:06.293 --> 00:12:08.562
Yeah, it's not bad at all.

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:11.965
<i>Well, if he likes it, I guess</i>
<i>I can live with it.</i>

00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:14.601
Here she is, and thank you so
much for waiting.

00:12:14.635 --> 00:12:17.204
Look at that funny costume
she's wearing!

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.206
<i>(Minako) And that love-struck</i>
<i>look on her face!</i>

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.808
It's almost like she thinks
he's her boyfriend.

00:12:21.842 --> 00:12:23.443
Hey. That's not funny.

00:12:24.878 --> 00:12:26.780
If it's between you and Yaten,
I think I know which one she'd
pick.

00:12:26.813 --> 00:12:27.514
[annoyed grunt]

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:29.650
There are plenty of other cats
in the sea.

00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:30.551
[frustrated grunt]

00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:31.852
Look who's coming in!

00:12:31.885 --> 00:12:32.553
[gasps]

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.355
<i>(Rei) Is that Noriko Okamachi,</i>
<i>the teen idol?</i>

00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:37.558
[grunting] That's her, all
right!

00:12:37.591 --> 00:12:39.893
<i>(Minako) Oh, I so want her</i>
<i>autograph!</i>

00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:44.665
Well, what a surprise! So, I
see you bring your cat here
too, Yaten.

00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:46.433
Oh, not you again.

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:48.502
What do you think they're
talking about?

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:55.342
[laughs] Oh, my! What a cute
little outfit your kitty has
on.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:59.479
(Noriko) In fact, it's a lot
cuter than the kitty wearing it.

00:12:59.513 --> 00:13:00.414
<i>What?</i>

00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:03.717
I'm so sorry I made the
mistake of trying to ask you
out the other day.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.187
I should have realized. You're
afraid of girls, aren't you?

00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:08.388
[grunts]

00:13:08.422 --> 00:13:09.189
[angry meow]

00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:10.490
Oww!

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:14.094
[gasps] Watch out! Cat fight!

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:17.064
You little! [grunts]

00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:23.537
(Nezu) It's Yaten and Noriko,
co-stars of the drama series
"Higashi's Handsome Girlfriend!"

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.205
And as we can see...

00:13:26.874 --> 00:13:29.309
the cute couple also seem to
have a pretty intimate
relationship off screen as well.

00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:31.311
What is this? Who are you?!

00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:34.281
I'm Nezu. I'm with Ginga TV.

00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:37.684
Ow! You rotten!

00:13:37.718 --> 00:13:40.754
Whoopsie, careful now, the
camera's rolling, remember.

00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:43.123
That cat! Such a silly!

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:46.093
So tell us, how long have you
and Yaten been dating?

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:48.729
Oh, I wouldn't say we're
"dating." Not yet.

00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:49.563
Seriously.

00:13:51.198 --> 00:13:53.333
But even so, would it be
accurate to describe your
relationship as an intimate one?

00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:54.801
Yaten's leaving.

00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:56.703
He's headed for the parking
lot.

00:13:56.737 --> 00:13:58.272
What's your secret, Noriko?

00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.440
Oh, what an embarrassing
question! I don't know.

00:14:00.474 --> 00:14:03.110
Maybe my shining star appeal as
a teen idol?

00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:08.515
Really. Well then, let's have
a look at the source of your
shining light!

00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:10.284
Show your Star Seed to me!

00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:14.454
What? Well, I wouldn't call it
a... What's a Star Seed?

00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:15.689
Chuu!

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:18.225
Wait! Am I being punked?

00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:19.960
[gasps] I'm outta here!

00:14:19.993 --> 00:14:21.295
<i>(Mako) Here he comes!</i>

00:14:24.064 --> 00:14:25.265
<i>(Noriko) [screams]</i>

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.067
Hey!

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.502
[gasps] Hm.

00:14:31.805 --> 00:14:37.444
Oh! Wow, you really surprised
Noriko! There, is that the
kind of reaction you wanted?

00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:38.712
[sinister chuckle]

00:14:40.314 --> 00:14:43.984
[gasps] Wait a minute. Oh, no!
I think I may be in trouble
here!

00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:47.454
[panting]

00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:48.856
[meow]

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:53.427

[groans]

00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:59.132
Oh no, look, we've let all the
birds escape.

00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:01.735
Whew! I thought they were all
in my head.

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:04.071
This is no time to worry about
birds!

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:05.105
Yeah, You're right!

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:06.473
Time to transform!

00:15:06.507 --> 00:15:07.174
Hm!

00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:09.076
Hmph!

00:15:09.943 --> 00:15:13.046
[screams] Pretty good
reflexes, huh?

00:15:14.948 --> 00:15:20.153
[screams]

00:15:26.326 --> 00:15:27.127
Hm?

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:30.297
[sighs]

00:15:32.032 --> 00:15:33.700
Nah, forget it.

00:15:40.507 --> 00:15:42.242
What good will it do?

00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:44.545
Nothing I do will make a
difference.

00:15:44.578 --> 00:15:49.449
If I don't find that one
person, the universe, is
doomed!

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.522
Wait, where are you going?

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:01.762
My, what a lovely Star Seed!
That has to be it. [screams]

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:02.629
[attack screech]

00:16:02.663 --> 00:16:06.567
[screams] No! Bad kitty!

Why, you!

[catching breath] Now look
what you've done! You've torn
my favorite costume!

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:38.765
Oh, never mind, at least the
Star Seed is finally in my
grasp. [groans]

00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:44.137
Oh, come on, this one's no good
either? My horoscope was right
when it said today would suck.

Ahh! I'll just pretend I
didn't hear that! [grunts]

What was that for?!

00:16:52.646 --> 00:16:55.549
That's for hurting one of my
best friends!

00:17:00.087 --> 00:17:02.222
How dare you defile a pet
shop?!

00:17:02.256 --> 00:17:05.526
What's more, you invaded a
teen idol's privacy!

00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:06.927
That's unforgivable!

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.796
Yeah, leave invading his
privacy to me!

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:10.931

Yeah, well, sorry, but my work
here is done for today.

00:17:14.768 --> 00:17:17.538
Unless you want to pay my
overtime, by any chance?

00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:19.173
I am the Pretty Guardian!

00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:20.908
I meant it about overtime.

00:17:20.941 --> 00:17:23.544

justice!

00:17:23.577 --> 00:17:25.045
Are you even listening?

00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:31.051
I am Sailor Moon!

00:17:32.152 --> 00:17:36.456
And in the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.625
Whatever. Buh-bye!

00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:42.062
Huh?

00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:43.564
Guess she got bored.

00:17:43.597 --> 00:17:45.098
Your call-out took forever!

nothing!

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.484
Yeah, so what?

00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:06.620
I'm saying you girls are out
of shape.

00:18:06.653 --> 00:18:11.558
Huh? What? No. I think there's
nothing wrong with our bodies.

00:18:11.592 --> 00:18:13.527
Oh. You can do better.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.698
Let me help you. By whipping
you into shape!

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:37.050
You must be a friend of hers?
Well, don't worry. She's only
unconscious.

little cat, I will help you
all just this once.

00:19:56.463 --> 00:19:58.365
What cat?

00:19:58.398 --> 00:19:59.700
You mean Luna?

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:02.402
This lady will not go down!

00:20:02.436 --> 00:20:04.805
Luna. Nice name.

00:20:04.838 --> 00:20:06.340
Now, Sailor Moon, do it!

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:39.039
Starlight Honeymoon Therapy
Kiss!

00:20:42.743 --> 00:20:49.416
[grunting] Beautiful!

00:20:50.284 --> 00:20:51.685
[groans]

00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:04.198
As much as I hate to admit it,
we may have to rely on your
powers after all.

00:21:04.865 --> 00:21:07.034
[gasps] Wait!

00:21:14.808 --> 00:21:18.712
Oh, man. Another trip to the
dumpster.

00:21:18.745 --> 00:21:22.482
I knew it. He's about to throw
away his love letters again.

00:21:22.516 --> 00:21:26.620
Maybe. But Yaten already has a
special someone that he's in
love with.

00:21:26.653 --> 00:21:29.623
So love letters from others
don't mean anything to him.

00:21:29.656 --> 00:21:32.125
Yeah, but still. Oh shoot!

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:34.628
What? I'm not stalking you or
anything!

00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:36.230
G'morning, Luna.

00:21:36.263 --> 00:21:37.998
[meow]

00:21:38.498 --> 00:21:39.566
She's your cat?

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.634
Sort of, yeah.

00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:43.136
Drop by again anytime.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.207
Hold on! How come he treats
you so much differently than
he treats me?

00:21:47.241 --> 00:21:52.279
Yaten. I hope you find this
special someone soon.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.052
(Usagi) Taiki, is it true you're
<i>gonna be on a cooking show?</i>

00:23:39.086 --> 00:23:39.686
<i>(Taiki) Yes.</i>

00:23:40.954 --> 00:23:42.890
(Usagi) Then let me teach how to
make my very own Usagi Special!

00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:43.991
<i>(Taiki) What's that?</i>

00:23:44.992 --> 00:23:45.659
(Usagi) First, you get two loafs
<i>of bread...</i>

00:23:47.227 --> 00:23:48.729
<i>then you put peanut butter and</i>
<i>jelly on them, and put them</i>
<i>together!</i>

00:23:50.097 --> 00:23:51.198
(Taiki) Isn't that just a peanut
<i>butter &amp; jelly sandwich?</i>

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:53.367
<i>(Usagi) Nope! It's the Usagi</i>
<i>Special!</i>

00:23:55.135 --> 00:23:58.372
<i>Next time on Sailor Stars,</i>
<i>"Friend or Foe? Star Lights</i>
<i>and the Sailor Guardians."</i>

00:23:58.405 --> 00:24:01.742
<i>The moonlight is a messenger</i>
<i>of love.</i>
