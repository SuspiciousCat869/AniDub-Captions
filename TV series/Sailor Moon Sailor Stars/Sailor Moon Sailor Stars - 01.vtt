WEBVTT

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:55.649
(Sitting up)

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.738
I am the one who embraces all
things.

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:41.161
I am the Guardian who is born
from the love that fills this
world.

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:46.500
I am Eternal...

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:53.740
(giggle)

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:58.345
Well, now... It seems that
someone is in a good mood today.

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:02.082
Did my little angel wake up from
having a nice dream,?

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.017
What was it about?

00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:05.586
(curious)

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:09.056
Or is it something you can't
tell daddy, even if you wanted
to?

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.064
Hotaru...

00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:20.000
I have come for you.

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:23.570
(Giggle)

00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:32.079
The Flower of Nightmares
Scatters: The Queen of Darkness
Returns!

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.424
What a lovely day! (chuckle)
(deep inhale)

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:45.859
(Rei)
Usagi!

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:46.693
(curious)

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.228
Hurry up already!

00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:49.930
We're gonna leave without you.

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:51.665
Coming!

00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:57.971
(Laughter)

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:00.107
Whoa there! Why're you so
happy?

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.645
What's there not to be happy
about? (laugh)

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:08.649
I've always dreamed of wearing
the Juban High School Uniform
some day!

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:13.854
Also... I'm happy that I get to
go to the same school as you
guys again.

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:15.455
Isn't it wonderful?!

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.391
I've been waiting for when we'd
get to attend the same high
school

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.626
and it's finally happening,
Usagi!

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.628
I'm so happy, I could cry!

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:23.030
Minako...

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:25.732
I don't have to take makeup
exams alone now...

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:27.935
Yay, a fellow flunker...

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:29.403
Don't remind me...

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:30.537
(curious)

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:33.140
Those entrance exams sucked...
I still have nightmares.

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:36.476
Let's look at the bright side,
'cause now that those days are
finally over,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.512
we get to have
some well-earned fun!

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:41.715
Why are you grouping yourself
with the others when you go to a
private school?

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.350
(surprised)

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:46.453
Yeah! You get to advance
without having to take any
entrance exams!

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:51.191
That's completely beside the
point! As one of your dearest
friends, your pain is my pain.

00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:52.092
(Sigh)

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.527
(awkward laugh)

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.495
Anyway, let's talk about the
perks of being in high school...

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:58.232
Like how we'll get to have a lot
more time to ourselves.

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.701
And we can start working
part-time jobs, too.

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:05.639
Club activities and idol
auditions, better be ready...
cause here I come!

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:10.477
And best of all... you can
legally get married once you
turn sixteen.

00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:11.612
Yeah, yeah...

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:12.646
(Diana)
Everyone!

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:13.881
Hm?

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:15.415
Sorry we're late.

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:16.917
Hi guys!

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.820
Hey, what's with the backpack,
Chibi-Usa? Are you going to a
sleepover?

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:21.188
(Chuckle)

00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:23.790
Well? Ready to say goodbye to
everyone?

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:25.325
Yeah!

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:29.162
I, Small Lady, a. k. a. Usagi
Tsukino, will be leaving
today...

00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:31.365
Back to the 30th century.

00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:33.400
(surprised)

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:37.604
This blissful silence...

00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:40.741
The world where even time and
light are frozen.

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:50.050
A world where my beauty lasts
for all eternity... Yes...
This is where I truly belong...

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:52.486
<i>Awaken, Noble Queen...</i>

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.388
Who's there?

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:59.393
It is such a waste to keep your
<i>noble beauty here, deep within</i>
<i>the confines of this darkness.</i>

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:03.864
Who would even dare have the
audacity to disturb my peaceful
slumber?

00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:08.569
Let's just say I am someone who
<i>has the power to grant your</i>
<i>wish.</i>

00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:10.270
My wish?

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:14.975
And now... I will free you from
<i>this despicable seal that you</i>
<i>are imprisoned in.</i>

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:16.410
You, what?!

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:17.711
(Surprised yell)

00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:23.483
(Gasp)

00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:29.389
I'm free...?

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:42.169
Time to go. I'm gonna miss you
guys a lot.

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:43.437
We'll miss you too.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.571
Come visit again.

00:06:44.605 --> 00:06:47.574
Please, Diana, make sure you
take care of Chibi-Usa.

00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:49.543
Give our best to the King and
Queen, okay?

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:53.747
I hope you have a safe journey
back. Artemis, say
something, will ya?

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.418
Diana... (Sniffle into sobbing)

00:06:58.452 --> 00:06:59.586
Father?

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.821
Good grief...

00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:01.522
Chibi-Usa.

00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:02.222
Yeah?

00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:05.859
You have everything... right?

00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:07.160
Uh huh.

00:07:07.194 --> 00:07:09.396
You're welcome back any time.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.031
mm hmm!

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.802
Bye guys... thanks for
everything!

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:23.143
O Guardian of Time! Tear apart
the heavens and open wide for me
the Door of Space and Time!

00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:27.748
I summon thee by your true name,
O Omnipotent God of Time...

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.983
Father of the Guardian! ' O
Chronos!

00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:35.622
Guide us on our journey! Protect
these travelers! Grant us the
Path of Light!

00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:40.627
That light... what is it?

00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:46.033
<i>Noble Queen... I regret to</i>
inform you that your revenge was
<i>not fulfilled.</i>

00:07:46.066 --> 00:07:48.402
No... That can't be!

00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:55.209
I swore I witnessed those two
fall to their deaths!

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.749
They can't be alive...

00:08:02.783 --> 00:08:05.018
There is no possible way that's
true!

00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:07.087
<i>Oh, but it is.</i>

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.889
What is it that you want?!

00:08:08.922 --> 00:08:12.492
Did you interrupt my sleep
simply so you could bring shame
upon me like this?

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:16.864
Are you trying to say you would
have preferred to stay unaware?

00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:20.067
<i>Those who sealed you away in</i>
<i>this place are still very much</i>
<i>alive</i>

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.870
<i>and living in peace and</i>
<i>harmony.</i>

00:08:22.903 --> 00:08:25.272
You're telling me I couldn't
beat her...?

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:28.075
She has come out victorious
every time?

00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:30.811
<i>Oh... Poor, poor Queen of the</i>
<i>New Moon...</i>

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:35.382
<i>Your lovely black hair and</i>
<i>beautiful golden eyes should</i>
<i>have been enough to make</i>

00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:40.287
<i>you the rightful queen to rule</i>
<i>that blue planet... but you</i>
<i>were denied that right.</i>

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.993
Will you ever be able to forgive
<i>those who condemned you to the</i>
<i>cold, lonely darkness?</i>

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:50.330
<i>I can only image how much you</i>
<i>despise the ones who left you</i>
<i>there.</i>

00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:56.803
<i>The same people who now enjoy</i>
love and happiness on Earth...
<i>You hate them, don't you?</i>

00:08:56.837 --> 00:09:02.476
Yes...! I hate them with every
fibre of my being! Especially
her...

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:08.949
I hate her. I hate her! I hate
her! I hate her! I hate her!

00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:12.553
I hate her!

00:09:16.123 --> 00:09:17.724
What is this?

00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:20.994
Do you not even recognize your
own heart, noble queen?

00:09:21.028 --> 00:09:25.999
All your hatred and the grudges
you hold have crystallized into
<i>that pitch-black mirror.</i>

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:28.402
This is what my heart's
become...?

00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:31.038
<i>Go ahead... shatter that</i>
<i>mirror to pieces.</i>

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:36.476
<i>Then, you will finally be able</i>
<i>to exact your revenge on those</i>
<i>who wronged you.</i>

00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:38.445
My revenge...

00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:41.582
<i>And when the tiny fragments of</i>
<i>your mirror rain down...</i>

00:09:41.615 --> 00:09:45.519
<i>fear and despair will begin to</i>
<i>spread across the Earth that</i>
<i>those of</i>

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:48.322
<i>the White Moon claim to love</i>
<i>so dearly.</i>

00:09:48.355 --> 00:09:51.158
<i>Well... What are you waiting</i>
<i>for?</i>

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:54.895
<i>Break it. Break it. Break</i>
<i>it.</i>

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.364
<i>Shatter that mirror!</i>

00:09:57.397 --> 00:10:01.602
(roar)

00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:17.384
(Sinister laugh)

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:23.557
<i>And now I've made certain that</i>
you will never awaken from this
<i>nightmare ever again!</i>

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.159
<i>(sinister laugh)</i>

00:10:29.763 --> 00:10:32.332
I should get going. Huh?

00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:34.168
Huh?

00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:35.736
(Makoto)
A meteor shower...

00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:37.404
(Minako)
It's so beautiful...

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:40.040
Wow, it's pretty rare to see
this many meteors.

00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:42.643
(curious)

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:44.845
But this is too many...

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:48.448
<i>Why is it giving me such a bad</i>
<i>feeling?</i>

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:55.122
(light pain)

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.190
Mamo, what's wrong?

00:10:56.223 --> 00:10:58.425
Some dust got in my eye.

00:10:58.458 --> 00:10:59.493
Lemme see.

00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:01.094
No, it's okay.

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:02.663
Pretty sure I got it out.

00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:04.031
(surprised reax)

00:11:04.064 --> 00:11:05.599
Something wrong?

00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:09.403
Hey, ' let's make sure that
Chibi-Usa gets a nice send off.

00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:10.070
(reluctant nod)

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:11.505
(Chibi-usa)
Ahhh!!!

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.442
What are these sparks?

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:23.784
Oh no...

00:11:23.817 --> 00:11:24.918
Chibi-Usa!

00:11:24.952 --> 00:11:26.620
What just happened?

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:27.988
I have no idea.

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:30.924
(Diana)
How are we supposed to
get home now?

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.428
I can't believe the pathway just
vanished...

00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:37.598
Do you think all those meteors
have something to do with this?

00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:41.335
Yeah, it's possible they could
have interrupted the energy
somehow.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.904
I'm sure you'll be able to head
back once they stop.

00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:46.740
Mako's right. So, don't worry.

00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:47.741
(Chibi-usa)
Okay...

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:52.179
(pain)

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:50.604
You like this place, huh?

00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:55.175
I actually find it to be quite
soothing. I could stare at
this view for hours.

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:59.847
Well, personally I think that
being behind the wheel is a lot
more soothing than this.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.382
(chuckle)

00:13:02.416 --> 00:13:05.285
Oh, you... I didn't mean the
fish.

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:06.753
(confused)

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.502
So, what'd you want to tell me?

00:13:21.535 --> 00:13:23.103
Quite the meteor shower...

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:27.674
Yeah... Now that you
mention it...

00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:31.745
Haruka... I was able to sense an
evil energy emanating from
somewhere near the moon

00:13:31.778 --> 00:13:33.547
just a moment ago.

00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:35.482
An enemy?

00:13:35.516 --> 00:13:37.117
I'm not sure.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.319
I only managed to catch a
glimpse of it.

00:13:39.353 --> 00:13:44.157
Well maybe the energy got pulled
by Earth's gravity and broke
into a million pieces.

00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:46.627
That's a bit too optimistic,
isn't it?

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.030
Look, all I'm trying to say is
that if your mirror wasn't able
to catch it,

00:13:50.063 --> 00:13:52.132
then it's probably
nothing to worry about.

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:53.934
Are you avoiding your duties?

00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:59.273
That's not what I'm doing.
When it comes to your skills...
I've got faith.

00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:00.641
hmmmm.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:03.177
They're gone.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:03.844
Hm?

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:04.912
(Pain)

00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:05.579
(concerned)

00:14:05.612 --> 00:14:06.013
(Pain)

00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:07.614
(surprise)

00:14:07.648 --> 00:14:08.048
(pain)

00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:08.916
Are you okay?

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.918
What's going on?

00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:11.518
(Pain)

00:14:11.552 --> 00:14:12.819
Haruka!

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:13.987
Something poked me.

00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:18.025
Let me see your hand!

00:14:18.058 --> 00:14:19.693
(wincing)

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.333
It looks like a shard
of glass...

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:26.967
(surprised)

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.635
Get away from that thing!

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:40.714
(cautious)

00:14:49.456 --> 00:14:52.492
(laugh)

00:14:52.526 --> 00:14:53.227
Who're you?!

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.394
(Shriek)

00:14:54.795 --> 00:14:56.763
(Trembling)

00:15:00.234 --> 00:15:03.003
(laugh)

00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:14.314
(laugh)

00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:20.187
It seems that even your mirror
manages to fog up sometimes,
huh?

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.289
This is not the time for
jokes...

00:15:22.322 --> 00:15:23.524
My bad.

00:15:23.557 --> 00:15:27.494
<i>I feel it... The energy of</i>
<i>those of the White Moon...</i>

00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:29.229
Who's there?!

00:15:29.263 --> 00:15:33.100
<i>I will take down everyone who</i>
<i>has anything to do with the</i>
<i>White Moon Kingdom.</i>

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:34.668
<i>Prepare to die.</i>

00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:38.305
I am sensing an immense negative
energy here all of a sudden.

00:15:38.338 --> 00:15:42.509
Now, attack them, my doubles! My
<i>Mirror Paredri!</i>

00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:45.779
(attack)

00:15:45.812 --> 00:15:47.648
(bracing)

00:15:48.382 --> 00:15:51.218
Dead Scream.

00:15:54.988 --> 00:15:56.123
(Pain)

00:15:58.325 --> 00:15:59.526
What...?!

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.561
(Pain)

00:16:00.594 --> 00:16:02.329
That attack is...

00:16:02.362 --> 00:16:05.465
(Pain)

00:16:10.037 --> 00:16:12.773
I don't believe it...

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:16.043
Sailor Pluto... Is that really
you?

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:18.512
What are you doing here?

00:16:18.545 --> 00:16:22.916
There is an unprecedented
disturbance in the fabric of
space and time.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.219
A disturbance?

00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:28.055
Wait, is that child... Hotaru?

00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:29.690
(Michiru)
What?!

00:16:29.723 --> 00:16:33.627
I went to see Professor Tomoe
and asked to borrow her for a
while.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.728
But why?!

00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:37.197
Because the time is drawing
near...

00:16:37.231 --> 00:16:41.101
...the time in which we will
need Hotaru's powers.

00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:45.572
I'll explain later. There are
other more pressing matters at
hand.

00:16:45.606 --> 00:16:46.707
(shocked)

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.077
No matter how hard we try, we
just can't avoid battle.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.713
Of course not. Fighting is our
destiny!

00:16:55.816 --> 00:16:59.620
Forgive me, little one. It's
too soon for you to fight.

00:16:59.653 --> 00:17:01.021
Wait for us here.

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:04.558
Alright! Both of you,
transform!

00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:09.363
Uranus Planet Power Make Up!

00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:26.713
Neptune Planet Power Make Up!

00:17:45.966 --> 00:17:48.235
(Laughter)

00:17:48.268 --> 00:17:53.373
Answering the call from a new
era, Sailor Uranus, here to
fight with brilliance!

00:17:54.775 --> 00:17:59.613
And Sailor Neptune... here to
fight with elegance!

00:18:02.649 --> 00:18:03.851
Let's go.

00:18:03.884 --> 00:18:05.285
(attack)

00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:06.987
(attack)

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.156
(attack)

00:18:10.724 --> 00:18:12.626
(attack)

00:18:13.594 --> 00:18:15.095
(attack)

00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:18.832
(grunt) There's no end to
them!

00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:20.801
They just keep multiplying!

00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:21.768
(Sinister laughter)

00:18:21.802 --> 00:18:23.237
Damn!

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.938
(Struggle)

00:18:24.972 --> 00:18:26.507
Uranus, no!

00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:33.514
(screaming)

00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:41.221
(Struggling)

00:18:41.655 --> 00:18:43.590
(Struggling)

00:18:43.624 --> 00:18:47.594
This is... why I said to cut
back on those late night
snacks...

00:18:47.628 --> 00:18:51.465
Why don't we save the pillow
talk for after we get back in
bed...

00:18:51.498 --> 00:18:53.433
(Pluto)
Hotaru!

00:18:53.467 --> 00:18:55.936
(Struggle) No, you mustn't hurt
that child!

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:56.937
(Laughter)

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.106
(gasp) Stay away from her!

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:00.974
(sinister laughter)

00:19:04.678 --> 00:19:06.046
Hotaru!

00:19:06.547 --> 00:19:07.447
No, don't!

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.385
Don't do it!

00:19:12.786 --> 00:19:14.021
(Attacking)

00:19:14.388 --> 00:19:15.989
(scream)

00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:30.704
What is this energy...? It feels
so warm...

00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:33.907
This is all Hotaru's energy
wave.

00:19:33.941 --> 00:19:37.411
I feel power... overflowing
within.

00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:40.681
They are making us stronger.

00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:43.483
Yes, they are...

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.262
The birth of new powers...!

00:19:56.597 --> 00:19:57.698
(Flinching)

00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:01.335
We're not exactly sure who you
are...

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.503
(notice)

00:20:03.704 --> 00:20:05.506
...but if you came to this
planet with bad intentions...

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:09.009
Then I am afraid we cannot allow
you to proceed.

00:20:14.114 --> 00:20:18.085
World Shaking!

00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:27.094
Deep Submerge!

00:20:28.962 --> 00:20:31.598
Dead Scream.

00:20:44.378 --> 00:20:46.847
Do you think they're a new
enemy?

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.118
Is there a crisis on the horizon
that required Saturn to be
reawakened?

00:20:51.151 --> 00:20:53.654
Whatever it is, can't be good.

00:20:55.856 --> 00:20:57.958
(surprised)

00:20:57.991 --> 00:20:59.726
Impossible...

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.495
Is that you, Hotaru?

00:21:02.596 --> 00:21:05.465
(Haruka)
But she was a baby just
a minute ago...

00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:12.372
A great change is about to
happen...

00:21:35.362 --> 00:21:38.232
(Hotaru)
If not stopped...

00:21:38.265 --> 00:21:40.667
...the Princess will be in
danger.

00:21:40.701 --> 00:21:43.270
The Princess?

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:45.005
Just what kind of threat are we
dealing with here?

00:21:45.038 --> 00:21:53.981
And with that, all the pieces
have been put into place...
(evil laughter)

00:23:37.084 --> 00:23:38.485
(Usuagi)
I just love spring
time...

00:23:38.519 --> 00:23:40.654
(Mamoru)
The cherry blossoms have
bloomed.

00:23:40.687 --> 00:23:44.057
(Usuagi)
Ooh! Ooh! You know what would be
the best? Partying under the
cherry blossoms!

00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:47.761
(Usuagi)
We'll bring all the foods,
snacks and drinks, and then
we'll do some karaoke!

00:23:47.794 --> 00:23:49.296
(Usuagi)
It'll be so much fun!

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:50.697
(Mamoru)
I think I'm gonna
pass...

00:23:50.731 --> 00:23:53.734
(Usuagi)
Come on! Where's your party
spirit, Mamo?!

00:23:53.767 --> 00:23:58.272
(Usuagi)
Next time on Sailor Stars,
"Saturn Awakens: The Ten Sailor
Guardians Unite."

00:23:58.305 --> 00:24:01.742
(Usuagi)
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
