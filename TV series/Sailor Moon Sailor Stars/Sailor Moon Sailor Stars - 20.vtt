I... I'm so hungry!

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:34.688
Mom! Where are you?! I need
snacks now!

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:37.624
Chibi...

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:39.993
Huh?

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.529
Your mom went out to get some
groceries.

00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:47.901
For real? Aw... but I'm totally
starving...

00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:50.337
Hey, where'd you get that dolly
from?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.338
Dollie!

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.541
I guess it's her new favorite.
She's been carrying it
everywhere.

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:57.878
Do you know if mom left any
snacks for me?

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.746
I don't think she did.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.048

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:03.750

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:06.253
But I want to eat some too...

Ahhh...

00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:14.795
Oh? Heh?

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:15.495
[gasp]

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.567

Why... are you talking like
that?

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.690
[chuckle] I'll stop if you gimme
a snack!

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:44.958
Oh! Oops! I forgot.

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:46.660
Hm?! [whimpering]

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:48.028
Mom! That's not fair!

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.865
How could you give so many
snacks to Chibi-Chibi and leave
none for me?!

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:56.503
Huh? What are you saying? I
definitely didn't give her any
kind of snack today.

00:03:56.537 --> 00:04:00.841
I can't let her get a mouth full
of cavities like her big sister,
after all!

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:02.976
[chuckling] Aha!

00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:06.980
But mom! She had a bunch!

00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:09.983
Huh? She was just here... Where
did she go?

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:11.518
Hm?

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:18.192
I feel like Chibi-Chibi runs off
and has her own little
adventures sometimes.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.227
Luna, your thoughts?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.031
You may be right. She does
disappear randomly...

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:25.799
Now that I think about it...

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:30.304
I haven't actually learned
anything about Chibi-Chibi since
she's been here.

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:35.475
Well, the biggest question I
have is: Is she your child or
Chibi-Usa's?

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:36.643
Hmmm...

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:40.581
Can you really not tell if she's
your own daughter or not?

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:41.315
Ehhh...

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:45.118
Excuse me, but remember when you
couldn't tell Diana was your
daughter?!

00:04:45.152 --> 00:04:47.421
Eh! You win this round.

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:51.158
Ugh, just forget it. I want
food.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:59.132
[groaning] I'm so hungry!
[groaning] Feed me...

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:00.167
[gasp]

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:01.802
You're back!

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:03.003
Chibi-Chibi.

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.171
Where were you?

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.206
Chibi-Chibi.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.974
Huh?

00:05:08.342 --> 00:05:12.012
Wait, for me?! Thanks a lot!
You're nothing like Chibi-Usa
was...

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:13.814
Chibi-Usa?

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:16.016
Oh uh, don't worry about it.

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:20.454
Don't worry... [giggling]

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.156
I wonder where she's getting all
<i>these snacks from...</i>

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.227
<i>does it have something to do</i>
<i>with where she's been</i>
<i>disappearing to?</i>

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:35.135
I bet she found a land full of
candy! [giggle]

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.605
Huh?! Am I really hearing this
from a high schooler?

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:43.143
[giggling]

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:49.583
How exciting! I can't wait to
see this candy land!

[groan]

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:52.986
C'mon! Let's go.

00:05:53.253 --> 00:05:53.620
Sure...

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.456
Huh?

00:05:57.758 --> 00:06:00.527
But... she was just here...

00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:05.265
Hmmm... There's no way she could
have gone very far with those
tiny legs...

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:10.137
She must have teleported!
Wait... or could she be an
esper?!

00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:12.139
Gimme a break...

00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:18.812
How weird. I'm pretty sure I saw
her go this way...

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:21.014
And so then I was like- Ah!

00:06:21.048 --> 00:06:21.481

you big dummy!

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:30.858
[pained groan] Have either of
you seen Chibi-Chibi? I lost
sight of her around here.

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:32.759
What's up? Did she get lost?

00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:33.393
Ah!

00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:34.061
Not quite...

00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:37.164

there?

00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:43.737
That isn't safe!

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:46.073
We've gotta get her down from
there!

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:47.474
Oh no! She slipped!

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:50.077
We're coming!

Chibi-Chibi...

00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:08.529
She went through there! I'll go
in after her.

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:10.597

Usagi?

00:07:21.742 --> 00:07:24.311
So... what's going on exactly?

00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:26.013
Are you playing hide-and-seek?

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:29.082
I think you're a bit too old for
that game.

00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:30.484
[embarrassed groan]

00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:33.120
Ah! We've got a problem!

00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:35.322
Look out!

00:07:36.023 --> 00:07:40.027

[nervous groans]

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:50.504
She must have crossed this
street a million times!

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:54.241
It's a miracle she's even still
alive!

00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:56.910

00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:57.344
Yeah!

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.147

I'm honestly surprised she's not
afraid of how huge that dog is.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.862
You know, she's sort of like
Usagi in the sense that she
doesn't judge by appearances.

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:19.533
Do you think that confirms
Chibi-Chibi is Usagi and
Mamoru's second child?

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:22.469
[gasp] Don't say things like
that, Ami!

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.004

I'm sorry! I promise I won't
take Chibi-Chibi's snacks ever
again!

00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:42.990
He was so nice to
Chibi-Chibi...

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:46.193
It doesn't really seem like he's
a big fan of us!

00:08:46.226 --> 00:08:47.361
Who cares?! Keep running!

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:29.469
Huh?

Nah, no way...

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.474
Awe!

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:36.243
Look. She picked up some money.

00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:38.579
What's she going to do with it?

00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:39.179
[giggles]

00:09:39.947 --> 00:09:41.481
Chibi-Chibi-Chibi!

00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:48.589
You see that? For being so
young, she's very responsible.

00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:51.158
She reminds me a whole lot of
Chibi-Usa.

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:53.760
Does that mean she's Chibi-Usa's
daughter?

00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:54.294
Whoa!

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:57.231
What the heck? Didn't you say
she's your kid sister?

00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:59.333
Ehhh... [nervous laugh] Yeah,
she is!

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:01.401
Are you not telling us
something?

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:03.637
I-it's just a little inside
joke...

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.875
So, uh, why are we following the
little pipsqueak around anyway?

00:10:07.908 --> 00:10:09.009
Beats me.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.181
[chuckle]

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:18.652
We're finally at Candyland!

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:19.586
What?

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.021
Oh, don't mind me!

00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:22.689
Look! She's going inside.

00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:23.790
[giggles]

00:10:23.824 --> 00:10:25.192
Then, let's follow her!

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:32.633
"Kiriyama"?

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:34.735
Where have I heard of that name?

00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:07.167
This place is huge, but we
haven't seen a single person
since we walked in.

00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:10.838
Oh, wow! I wonder if this rock
is something valuable.

00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:14.107
It's probably a precious metal
or gemstone!

00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:17.044
It's not a rock, it's a modern
sculpture.

00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:18.979
So, what's it worth then?

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.281
About 15 million yen.

00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:21.648
[gasp]

00:11:21.682 --> 00:11:22.082
Oof!

00:11:22.382 --> 00:11:24.518
Ahhh!

00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:25.452
[sighs of relief]

00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:33.126
Whoa...

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.795
(CHIBI-CHIBIi) [laughing]

00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:36.163
That's Chibi-Chibi!

00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:40.400
(JOTARO) <i>So, what would you like</i>
<i>to do today?</i>

00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:42.469
Chibi-Chibi...

00:11:44.538 --> 00:11:46.173
Dollies! [giggle]

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:48.008
Someone does live here...

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.978
It sounds like she comes by here
pretty often.

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:54.281
Oh, you've decided on the dolls,
then?

00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:55.482
Yeah, yeah!

00:11:57.618 --> 00:12:00.888
Just as I thought, it really is
a Jumeau!

00:12:00.921 --> 00:12:02.155
A 'what' now?

00:12:03.624 --> 00:12:06.460
It's an antique doll that's
supposedly worth at least ten
million yen.

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:07.961
T-ten million?!

00:12:07.995 --> 00:12:09.496
Chibi-Chibi?

00:12:11.198 --> 00:12:14.468
T-that teacup she's holding
wouldn't happen to be something
special too, would it?

00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:17.137
Well yes, it's Wedgrod
Jasperware.

00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:17.371
Hm?

00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:19.139
So then it's expensive?

00:12:20.207 --> 00:12:22.376
One tea cup os worth about a
hundred thousand yen.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:23.377
Ahhh!

00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:26.980
Whatever you do, don't break
them, Chibi-Chibi...

00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:31.485
Hey, that's...

00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:32.686
Seriously?

00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:34.621
What? His huge bushy brows?

00:12:34.655 --> 00:12:36.023
What's wrong you guys?

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.759
That man is the chairman of the
Kiriyama Group...

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:42.329
Huh?! No way! That big-time
business conglomerate?

00:12:42.362 --> 00:12:46.533
Yeah. Supposedly, he's the grey
eminence of the Japanese
economy.

00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:49.469
It's no wonder this place has
tons of treasures.

00:12:49.503 --> 00:12:53.373
And as it turns out, he's also
sponsoring our next concert.

00:12:53.407 --> 00:12:54.408
[nervous squeal]

00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:58.612
Oh no! Who's gonna pay for that
teacup?!

00:12:58.645 --> 00:12:59.513
Who's there?

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.115
[nervous laughter]

00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:16.163
(JOTARO) <i>Ah, I see... So you're</i>
<i>Chibi-Chibi's older sister?</i>

00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:17.531
Uh-yeah...

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:20.701
(JOTARO) <i>And you're all he</i>
<i>sister's friends...</i>

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:22.503
Wait, you boys are...

00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:23.737
[chuckle]

00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:25.772
Who were you three again?

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:26.640
Uhhhh....

00:13:28.175 --> 00:13:31.612
We're the idol group, the Three
Lights. We met you at a party
the other day.

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:33.614
[chuckle] Chibi-Chibi!

00:13:33.647 --> 00:13:35.749
It's quite tasty, isn't it?

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:40.020
Excuse me... but do you really
have no idea who we are?

00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:42.489
No, sorry. I haven't the
slightest.

00:13:42.523 --> 00:13:46.493
Well, we're actually pretty
famous in the music world,
y'know.

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:48.328
[spitting]

00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:51.431
Ahhh! That's another
hundred thousand...

00:13:51.465 --> 00:13:52.366
Chibi-Chibi?

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:55.269
Don't worry, it's not a problem.

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:56.803
[uncomfortable sighs and groans]

00:13:56.837 --> 00:13:57.638
[giggle]

00:13:59.573 --> 00:14:00.974
[nervous groan]

00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:05.012
Talking to youths your age is
more than enough payment.
Admittedly...

00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:07.047
it makes me feel young again.

00:14:08.649 --> 00:14:11.885
Well, in that case, we'd be
happy to come over and talk
any time. [chuckle]

00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:14.388
Could you be any more shameless?

00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:19.159
You and Chibi-Chibi are very
similar. I knew instantly.

00:14:19.193 --> 00:14:19.493
Huh?

00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:25.899
You both seem to give off the
same warm, gentle presence. It's
rather uncanny.

00:14:25.933 --> 00:14:30.470
Well, yeah, they are sisters.
So, of course they're similar.

00:14:30.504 --> 00:14:34.174
(JOTARO) <i>No... This goes beyond</i>
<i>surface value.</i>

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:36.109
Wait... What do you mean?

00:14:37.744 --> 00:14:43.984
Both your auras are exactly the
same. Fascinating... but...
enough about that...

00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:48.322
There are two women here to see
you, sir.

00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:52.025
Oh? I was sure I didn't have any
appointments....

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:56.129
Oh! Well, we should probably
start heading out now!

00:14:56.163 --> 00:15:01.969
Apologies... but you're welcome
to come again. Oh! Before I
forget...

00:15:02.503 --> 00:15:04.137
<i>Please, take one.</i>

00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:08.208
So this is where you get the
candy from...

00:15:08.242 --> 00:15:09.610
Candy!

00:15:09.643 --> 00:15:11.478
Man, what a strange day...

00:15:11.512 --> 00:15:11.712
Mmm!

00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:12.980
[giggles]

00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:14.948
[gasp] Chibi...?

00:15:14.982 --> 00:15:18.252
Why in the world did we end up
coming here, anyway?

00:15:18.285 --> 00:15:20.821
Well, Usagi's the one who
brought us here.

00:15:20.854 --> 00:15:22.122
Oh, uh...

00:15:22.155 --> 00:15:25.025
Chibi-Chibi disappears from time
to time.

00:15:25.058 --> 00:15:26.193
Right. Go on.

00:15:27.694 --> 00:15:30.731
And when she finally comes
home, she always has a bunch of
snacks with her.

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:31.732
[chuckles]

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:32.499
So what?

00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:35.702
So! I thought there might be a
candy land.

00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:36.236
Huh?!

00:15:37.638 --> 00:15:40.807
And I figured if I followed her,
I'd be able to find out where it
is!

00:15:40.841 --> 00:15:45.012
Usagi... you do know none of
that's scientifically sound,
right?

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:47.781
Frankly, that's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:50.384
Oh well, at least it was fun, I
guess.

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:52.753
It was worth it for the antique
art.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:59.059
[embarrassed chuckle] My mom's
probably worried, so I'm gonna
head home now. Chibi-Chibi...

00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:00.527
Hey, where'd she go?

00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:01.995
Did we leave her behind?

00:16:02.029 --> 00:16:05.699
I'll go see if I can find her.
See ya later!

00:16:05.732 --> 00:16:08.302
Hmmm... Chibi-Chibi!

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:12.906
Are you here? Jeez, where could
she have run off to?

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.775
(BUTLER) [screaming]

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:15.275
Huh?!

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.644
Who are you two?

00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:23.183
You may be the top name in the
world of Japanese economy,
Jotaro Kiriyama.

00:16:23.217 --> 00:16:26.053
But we wanna find out who you
really are.

00:16:26.086 --> 00:16:29.923
But don't you think we should
introduce ourselves before we
begin...

00:16:29.957 --> 00:16:32.492
We don't have time for that you
idiot!

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.661
(JOTARO) [screaming]

00:16:34.695 --> 00:16:35.329
[gasp]

00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:37.297
[screaming]

00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:38.498
[grunt]

00:16:41.468 --> 00:16:42.469
Looking good.

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:46.139
What?

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.243
Aw... Guess we were wrong again.

00:16:49.276 --> 00:16:50.277
Fantastic...

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.079
(USAGI) <i>Hold it right there!</i>

00:16:53.814 --> 00:16:57.551
How dare you do something as
evil as trample over the heart
of a kind, old gentleman!

00:16:57.584 --> 00:16:58.685
I won't forgive you!

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.990
I am the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for justice!

00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:08.996
I am Sailor Moon!

And in the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

[heavy breathing]

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:29.716
Chibi-Chibi!

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.586
Wait you seriously went back for
that doll?!

00:17:32.619 --> 00:17:34.021
Chibi! [gasp]

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.225
Oh! Whoahhh!

00:17:38.258 --> 00:17:40.894
It's dangerous here! Find some
place to hide!

00:17:40.928 --> 00:17:45.632
[grunt] How utterly pathetic of
me to be thwarted by marbles.

00:17:45.666 --> 00:17:48.368
Now taste the edge of my blade!

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:49.303
Ahhh!

[struggling]

00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:54.508
[struggling] How impudent...

fall... Now it's in a million
pieces! [sobbing]

I'm so sorry! W-what's it worth?
Do you have a payment plan?

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.336
Five million!

F-five million?!

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:29.142
This Venetian glass is pretty
pricy too...

Ahhh!

[panicking] Stop trying to break
things!

This is a Deissen coffee set

Ah! [panicking groans]

No, wait!

H-How could you let this
happen?! You'll pay for this,
Sailor Moon!

Now, wait just a minute! You're
the one who started all this!

00:19:20.928 --> 00:19:26.867
Oh, and another thing! The only
important value of something is
sentimental value! You big jerk!

know!

00:20:03.403 --> 00:20:05.405
[pained groan]

00:20:05.439 --> 00:20:06.507
Sailor Moon!

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.307
Do it!

00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:08.509
Right!

00:20:31.765 --> 00:20:41.975
Starlight Honeymoon Therapy
Kiss!

00:20:45.879 --> 00:20:52.119
[struggling] Beautiful!

00:20:58.959 --> 00:21:00.360
Mr. Kiriyama!

00:21:00.394 --> 00:21:03.330
[sigh] The Paccarat
chandelier...

00:21:03.363 --> 00:21:07.134
Let it go... everything breaks
at some point, Healer.

00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:08.969
[sigh of relief]

00:21:10.337 --> 00:21:13.807
Well, at least your doll's still
in one piece, right,
Chibi-Chibi?

00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:15.142
Still in one piece!

00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:18.178
[gasps]

00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:20.514
Ahhh!

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.987
[sigh] You're such a handful,
you know that?

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.322
(CHIBI-CHIBI) [giggling]

00:21:33.393 --> 00:21:39.333
Hmmm. He said we're similar, but
I dunno. Your thoughts?

00:21:39.867 --> 00:21:40.968
Hm?

00:21:42.803 --> 00:21:47.641
I'm beginning to feel like we're
actually related after all. Hey,
why don't we head on home now?

00:21:48.542 --> 00:21:49.643
Okay!

00:23:35.148 --> 00:23:38.685
(YATEN) <i>You wanna keep this</i>
<i>thing we've got going, right,</i>
<i>Bun-head?</i>

00:23:38.719 --> 00:23:41.755
(USAGI) <i>W-Wait a second... you</i>
<i>do know we're not dating-</i>

00:23:41.788 --> 00:23:45.626
(YATEN) <i>Great to hear! In that</i>
case, how about we train for the
<i>sports meet?</i>

00:23:45.659 --> 00:23:46.627
(USAGI) <i>Are you even listening?</i>

00:23:48.362 --> 00:23:50.297
(YATEN) <i>This match'll decide our</i>
<i>future. The power of our love</i>
<i>will guide us!</i>

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:51.765
(USAGI) <i>Are you for real...?</i>

00:23:51.798 --> 00:23:54.835
(YATEN) <i>You and me! Let's run</i>
<i>towards the setting sun!</i>

00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:58.672
(USAGI) <i>Next time on Sailor</i>
<i>Stars: "The Shining Power of a</i>
<i>Star:</i>

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.475
The moonlight is a messenger of
