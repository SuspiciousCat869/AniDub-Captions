(USAGI) <i>Dearest Mamo... Seiya</i>
<i>and the others finally found</i>
<i>their princess!</i>

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:15.916
<i>She's beautiful and has very</i>
<i>gentle powers.</i>

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.921
I want us to work together as a
team, but Haruka and Michiru say
<i>we can't...</i>

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:25.759
<i>Oh Mamo... I really wish you</i>
were here with me at times like
<i>these...</i>

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:12.633
<i>Crusade for the Galaxy:</i>
<i>Legend of the Sailor Wars!</i>

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.004
<i>Princes Kakyu!</i>

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.743
Princess. You're safe.

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:27.681
We can't even begin to tell you
how much we've longed to see you
again, Princess...

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:30.050
[gasp]

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:37.057
I am sorry for making you worry,
my Star Lights.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.695
However... I had a very
important mission to fulfill.

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.198
Mission?

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:49.937
Chibi-Chibi...

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.738
Chibi?

00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:54.541
Thank you very much.

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:57.611
And Sailor Moon... It is an
honor to meet you.

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:01.048
I've been observing you and your
friends for awhile now...

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:03.617
...from that incense burner.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.186
[gasp]

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.455
Wait, you've been watching us?

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.758
Let me explain...

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:17.898
There is a holy war that has
been waging all throughout the
galaxy for ages.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.968
It is known as the Sailor Wars.

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:24.171
Hold on... Sailor "what"?

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:28.709
Sailor Guardians are the
reincarnation of stars...

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:34.214
<i>Since the dawn of the galaxy,</i>
they fought in order to protect
<i>the innocent...</i>

00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:37.284
<i>... from those who dared to</i>
<i>threaten the peace.</i>

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:46.426
And the fight continued until
Chaos, the source of all evil...

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.767
<i>...was finally defeated and</i>
<i>sealed away by our greatest</i>
<i>champion...</i>

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.336
<i>...the legendary Sailor</i>
<i>Guardian.</i>

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:00.340
[grunt]

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:02.342
[grunt]

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:30.737
However... now that much time
has passed, Chaos has found its
way back to this galaxy.

00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:33.707
Chaos is back?

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:39.947
[maniacal laughter]

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.084
[gasp] Wait... you mean Galaxia?

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:46.520
Galaxia...

00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:49.923
Her plan is to steal all of the
Star Seeds...

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:54.328
...so that she can throw the
entire galaxy into chaos once
again.

00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:56.597
The whole galaxy...?

00:04:57.598 --> 00:04:59.733
But, all is not lost...

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:05.205
What we need is the Light of
Hope. The Legendary Guardian's
power.

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:07.608
The Light... of Hope?

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:13.714
It is the reason why I came to
this planet in secret.

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:16.416
<i>My goal was to seek its power.</i>

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:19.686
<i>We don't need help from</i>
<i>something like that!</i>

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.521
[gasp]

00:05:20.554 --> 00:05:22.089
Healer?!

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:23.557
As long as you're alive...

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.896
We can finally take back our
planet! It'd be easy!

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:31.532
She's right. Let's all return
home.

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:35.536
[conflicted sigh]

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:39.106
Princess!

00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:46.046
Finding the Light of Hope is
necessary for us. If we don't,
we will never seal Chaos away.

00:05:46.547 --> 00:05:48.182
[gasps]

00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:53.086
So, I beg of you, Sailor
Moon...

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.423
Please... aid us in our quest.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:06:01.028
Help me locate it. The Light of
Hope that will save us.

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:03.530
[sigh] [agreeing nod]

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:06.533
That request is a bit selfish,
don't you think?

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.068
[gasp]

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:10.070
Uranus! Neptune!

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:12.840
We sensed a powerful energy
here.

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.909
How shameless of you to ask for
our help.

00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:17.311
Watch yourselves...!

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.414
How dare you two insult our
princess like that!

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:21.582
Stand down, now!

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:22.649
[gasp]

00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:24.484
Princess... but why?

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.187
Sailor Moon...

00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:28.355
[gasp]

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:31.658
I have faith in all of you.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:50.277
(GALAXIA) <i>Sailor Lead Crow's</i>
<i>light has gone out...</i>

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.349
<i>And the light of that who</i>
<i>opposes me continues to grow</i>
<i>stronger by the minute!</i>

00:06:56.917 --> 00:07:01.655
<i>Why? Why are there so many</i>
lights gathering on this remote
<i>planet?!</i>

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:03.657
<i>I must hurry!</i>

00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:05.859
<i>Master Galaxia!</i>

00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:06.693
[gasp]

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:11.498
Sailor Tin Nyanko!

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:13.534
What do you want?!

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:14.501
Eh...!

00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:21.308
Oh... Uh... I came back to tell
you that I found a true Star
Seed f-finally...

00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:22.276
What?

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:23.977
Uh... Well..

00:07:25.646 --> 00:07:28.782
Crow and I were actually working
together to try to steal the
target's true Star Seed.

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:29.483
But then...

00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:33.654
...the enemy put up a good
fight, which escalated things
and really surprised us...

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:38.792
And just as I was about to grab
it, I was thwarted by a strange
light...

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:39.493
I see...

00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:43.497
But rest assured.

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:49.603
I, Sailor Tin Nyanko, will
gladly put my life on the line
to bring you the true Star Seed-

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:50.370
Go!

00:07:50.404 --> 00:07:51.471
Yes!

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:02.282
Phew... How scary... So that's
what she really looks like...

00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:06.720
And I'm in huge trouble for
witnessing it, aren't I?

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:11.658
<i>Gotta get on her good side,</i>
fast. Time to steal that girl's
<i>Star Seed!</i>

00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:16.530
Too sweet...

00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:20.501
Oh? Well, it shouldn't be. It's
barely sweetened.

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:24.204
I'm talking abut our princess.

00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:27.541
When it comes to this whole
Light of Hope thing...

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:30.310
It's she who's gonna wind up
getting hurt.

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:36.650
Yes, you're right. The enemy
wants her Star Seed.

00:08:38.485 --> 00:08:40.053
It's getting cold.

00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:42.155
Shall I warm you up, then?

00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:48.862
I'll take another cup of coffee.
But make it black this time.

00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:50.030
<i>As you wish.</i>

00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:57.638
<i>This is Mamoru.</i>

00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:01.775
<i>I'm currently studying abroad</i>
<i>and can't come to the phone.</i>

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:05.245
If you'd like to reach me, call
<i>my apartment overseas.</i>

00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:08.749
[sigh]

00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:11.485
Mamo...

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.489
I wanna hear more of your
voice...

00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:18.192
I wish I could talk to you...

00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:22.563
<i>This is Mamoru. I'm currently</i>
<i>studying abroad and can't come</i>
<i>to the phone.</i>

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:22.996
Mamo!

<i>If you'd like to reach me,</i>
<i>call my apartment...</i>

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:30.370
<i>Fighter.</i>

00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:31.271
Huh?

00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:33.874
[chuckle] Yes?

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.977
Is that... the disguise you've
been using here?

00:09:37.344 --> 00:09:38.779
Oh.. uh...

00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:42.583
In order to find you amongst all
the women on this planet...

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:46.019
this was the most convenient
appearance for us.

00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:51.558
Forgive me. Your music did reach
me, as did your message.

00:09:51.592 --> 00:09:56.730
But I am afraid I just couldn't
risk exposing myself to Galaxia.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.165
No, it's okay!

00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:04.438
You've returned to us safe and
sound and that's all we care
about.

So how is she?

she's asleep...

Quiet, Minako!

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:04.691
There are people still sleeping
you know?

00:12:05.692 --> 00:12:07.828
I need to make sure she hears
me! [big inhale]

00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:11.331
Hey, Usagi! Let's go!

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:13.166
What the heck?

00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:17.871
You didn't have to go through
all the trouble of coming to
pick me up...

00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:18.972
Yes, we did!

00:12:20.374 --> 00:12:22.376
We can't take any chances while
the enemy's after your Star
Seed.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:25.379
Yeah! You never know when
they're gonna strike next!

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:26.046
For example...

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:28.815
They might be disguised as a man
walking his dog!

00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:33.754
Or maybe pretending to be a lady
who separates her trash before
taking it out!

00:12:33.787 --> 00:12:34.755
In fact!

00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:39.793
They might even be dressed as an
electrician, so they can spy on
you from above!

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:42.462
Minako... Now you're pushing it.

00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:43.730
You're probably right?

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:48.368
Anyway, they know you have the
true Star Seed, so we can't take
any chances.

00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:50.270
There's danger lurking around
every corner.

00:12:50.304 --> 00:12:51.939
Those girls are pretty sharp.

done!

What's this stuff?

00:12:59.847 --> 00:13:04.084
A baton, 'some pepper spray',
and a small good luck charm.

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.286
We want you to have these for
protection.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.723
No one's gonna hurt you as long
as we're around Usagi!

Mmm...

00:13:12.426 --> 00:13:12.693

It's fine, so don't worry about
it!

Minako's right. You can just
leave everything to us!

stick together when it starts

Yeah! In fact, we should make it

[sniffling] I tried to be
understanding and... said it was
fine.

[sniffling] But...

00:20:55.055 --> 00:21:02.162

it! I can't!
