<i>No, this can't be</i>

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.981
<i>us. This is all some</i>
<i>sort of bad dream!</i>

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:18.285
<i>Pluto, Saturn,</i>
<i>Uranus, Neptune.</i>
<i>They're</i>

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:21.788
<i>all my friends. And</i>
<i>each one of them is</i>
<i>precious to me!</i>

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:26.126
<i>So, this can't be</i>

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:12.299
<i>Dying Stars: Uranus</i>

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:16.837
<i>Stop it! Why are you</i>

<i>we were friends.</i>

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.473
Friends, huh?
[chuckling]

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.276
<i>Let's end her</i>
<i>suffering by taking</i>
<i>her Star Seed.</i>

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.612
Sounds good. That's
what friends are
for, after all.

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:26.380
[chuckling]

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:27.581
<i>Why, you--</i>

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:31.652
<i>Uranus. Neptune. I</i>
<i>still believe in both</i>
<i>of you.</i>

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:32.719
Thanks for that.

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:33.554
<i>Now, die.</i>

00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:35.055
Stand down.

[chuckling]

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.633
Please, don't tell
me you're really
that stupid. You

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:50.170
believe in them? Even
after you bore
witness to them

00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:51.839
killing your friends?

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:54.641
This is reality.

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:59.146
Hold on. Surely you
don't still think you
can protect this planet.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.148
I can and
I will.

00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:06.119
[laughing]

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:09.156
Removing Sailor
Moon's Star Seed
can wait. Why don't

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.993
you two teach her a
little lesson about
reality first.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.762
Hmph! Honestly,
what a joke.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.966
Uranus! Neptune!

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.701
World...

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:22.302
Star Serious...

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:23.637
Shaking!

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.739
Laser!

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:29.710

[groaning]

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:50.564
Usagi.

[lightly gasping]

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.470
Ohh!

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:02.843
Everyone?
Haruka. Michiru.

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:04.044
It's all over.

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.078
What?

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:06.713
What we did was just
an act.

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:10.484
That's right. It
was all in order to
defeat Galaxia.

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:12.786
Just an act?

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.921
Just an act?

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:16.623
Sorry you were kept
out of the loop,
Usagi.

00:04:16.657 --> 00:04:19.092
We couldn't tell
you because it would
have totally ruined

00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:20.494
our whole plan!

00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:22.362
Oh...

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:24.998
Look I swear it's
not because we
thought you'd get

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:26.366
in the way or
anything.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.169
Yeah! We just felt
you weren't really
up to the task.

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:30.671
Minako, you're not
helping!

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:32.840
<i>[laughing]</i>
<i>But it's the truth,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

00:04:32.873 --> 00:04:35.075
This is Usagi we're
talking about.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.111
<i>Come on, you two.</i>
<i>Be nice.</i>

00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:40.380
Yeah, that was
kinda cruel.

00:04:40.414 --> 00:04:45.018
I mean, you know
how easy it is to get
me to believe stuff.

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:47.321
Usako.

00:04:50.224 --> 00:04:51.391
Usagi!

[gasping]

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:02.603
I got worried
so I came back to
check on you.

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.404
I'm sorry I made
you feel lonely.

00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:07.074
I'll never leave
your side again.

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:12.312
[crying]
Mamo. Chibi-usa.

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:16.984
Everything's
all right now.
It's over.

00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:17.985
[whimpering]

00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:20.187
You don't have to
fight anymore.

[whimpering]

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:24.258
Same old crybaby
Usagi!

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:28.762
I can't help it,
okay? What do you
want from me?

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:31.899
I really thought I
wasn't going to see
all of you again.

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:34.568
But I'm happy
you're back, Mamo--

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.307
They're gone.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.408
They're gone.

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:43.677
Where'd they all
go?

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.145
Where they all go?

00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:50.484

[gasping]
Uranus.

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:14.441
Uranus! Please. I
need you to tell
me the truth!

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:17.578
This is all part of
the plan, isn't it?

00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:20.848
I know that this is
just an act, so you
don't have to keep--

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.049
[yelping]

00:06:24.017 --> 00:06:26.220

Chibi?

00:06:29.423 --> 00:06:31.124
This is reality.

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.393

Hup!

Aw, is nap time over?

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:43.604
How dare you talk
down to us!

00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:47.074
You wouldn't have
that power without
Galaxia!

00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:49.776
It seems we have sore
losers on our hands.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.080
Indeed. A shame that
those who stand
against Galaxia

00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:55.349
would resort to such
petty comebacks.

00:06:55.382 --> 00:06:57.885
How do they expect
to defeat her,

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:00.521
when they can't
even defeat us?

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:03.257
Hmph. Goes to show
you're just a bunch
of amateurs

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.659
who don't even know
your own limits.

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:07.027
What did you say?!

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:11.498
And that's exactly
why you three couldn't
protect your princess!

00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:12.399
[growling]

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.601
You little--

00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:15.702
Fighter no!

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:18.005
Stop talking like you
know us!

anything!

Huh?!

Stop it. Just stop
this already!

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.906
You're right. Let's
put an end to this.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.874
[lightly gasping]

00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:55.008

Are you... all right?

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:42.556
Yeah.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.057
Good.

[grunting]

00:09:00.774 --> 00:09:04.845
Now, then. Did that
help you awaken from
your absurd dream in

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:07.114
which you can still
save this planet?

00:09:07.147 --> 00:09:10.117
It is not a dream!
You hear me?

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.987
Look around. There is
nothing left for you
to save.

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:15.322
Huh?

00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:20.127
[gasping]

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.598

This can't be
happening.

It's safe to say
that the entire
galaxy is now mine.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.997
At this point, you
have absolutely no
chance of winning.

are you going to do?
What can you even

possibly hope to
accomplish at this
point?

00:10:53.353 --> 00:10:54.388

that attack was going
to work!

Where's her Star
Seed?!

00:12:18.906 --> 00:12:22.943
Impressive. I never
thought that someone
would ever resist my

00:12:22.976 --> 00:12:24.545
bracelets' control.

00:12:24.878 --> 00:12:26.647
Uranus.

servants despite
knowing you could
die.

00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:47.167
All for an
opportunity to
strike back.

00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:49.970
Hm. And I
fell for it.

Honestly... The
people of this
planet;

they never cease
to amuse me.
[laughing]

We no longer possess
wings to fly through
the sky.

Now, all that we
have left, are blood
stained hands.

00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:25.706
Yes, you're
right.

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:30.244
Hm. All of your
efforts meant
nothing in the end.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.390
We'll be... answering
for our sins forever.

00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:46.660
I can endure, if
I'm with you.

00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:49.997
Even if we're
burned in the flames
of hell.

00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:58.405
Hell, huh? It doesn't
suit you.

00:13:59.106 --> 00:14:01.008
I have no regrets.

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:03.977
Why... Why do this?!

00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:07.414
Because this is
how we chose to
fight.

00:14:07.447 --> 00:14:11.051
It's The cross we
chose to bear as
Guardians.

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:14.721
But that's not how
it should work!

00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:16.290
You didn't have
to do this!

00:14:16.323 --> 00:14:18.625
Why didn't you
guys tell me?!

00:14:18.659 --> 00:14:22.462
I thought... you'd
really turned against
us for good.

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:25.532
And that you two
weren't friends
with us anymore.

00:14:25.566 --> 00:14:30.704
I am so sorry. I
didn't believe in
you... until the end.

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:41.682
Serves you right.

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.250
I'll never
forgive you!

00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:46.520
And after all
that big talk
of yours!

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:49.723
If you two die, who
will look after
Sailor Moon?!

00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:54.461
Fighter. The thing
your trying to
protect isn't

00:14:54.494 --> 00:14:59.566
the universe, or
peace or even the
universe, is it?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.400
Huh?

00:15:03.504 --> 00:15:08.008
I want you to
protect her from
now on.

00:15:08.041 --> 00:15:11.411
Uh! Uranus.

00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:13.814
Please, take good
care of her.

00:15:13.847 --> 00:15:16.617
Our princess is
such a crybaby.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.185
She sure is.

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:21.288
[crying]
I can't help it.

00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:23.724
Are you scared,
Michiru?

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.526
Haruka.

00:15:25.559 --> 00:15:26.093
Yes?

00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:29.730
I want... to
feel you.

00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:34.968
[lightly grunting]

Uh.

00:15:50.884 --> 00:15:52.986
I can see
the light.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:57.090
It feels warm...
doesn't it?

00:16:02.029 --> 00:16:07.734
<i>Michiru! Haruka!</i>
<i>Please don't</i>
<i>leave me.</i>

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:10.671
Hmph.

00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:13.073
[sobbing]

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:17.244
I lost two more
people that I care
about... In the

00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:20.948
end I wasn't
able to protect
anyone.

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:24.451
Your Star Seeds are
the only ones left,
so as a reward for

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:27.454
putting up a good
fight, I shall
personally remove

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:28.956
them from you!

Star Serious Laser!

00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:35.229
Get back!

00:16:35.863 --> 00:16:36.730
[grunting]

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:41.935
[gasping]

00:16:41.969 --> 00:16:43.170
[grunting]

00:16:43.637 --> 00:16:46.673
[screaming]

00:16:57.985 --> 00:17:00.120
<i>You can't win, so</i>
<i>surrender.</i>

00:17:00.153 --> 00:17:03.357
<i>Come out quietly</i>
<i>and kneel before me.</i>

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.459
<i>I will give you time</i>
<i>to prepare.</i>

00:17:05.492 --> 00:17:08.829
<i>If you are a true</i>
<i>princess, show</i>

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:12.366
<i>disgrace you by</i>
<i>taking your Star Seed</i>
<i>by force.</i>

00:17:12.399 --> 00:17:15.435
If I give in and just
do as she says,

00:17:15.469 --> 00:17:19.206
will I be able to
see Mamo and the
others again?

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:21.642
Sailor Moon.

00:17:21.675 --> 00:17:22.743
Huh?

00:17:22.776 --> 00:17:25.879
Uranus and Neptune
fought that way
for a reason.

00:17:25.913 --> 00:17:27.948
Do you know what
that reason was?

00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:29.983
No. I don't!

00:17:30.017 --> 00:17:32.286
I didn't get it at
first, either.

00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:35.722
How they went so far
to sacrifice everything.

00:17:35.756 --> 00:17:37.157
<i>And for what?</i>

00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:39.693
Could it be that
it's really just
the way that they

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.662
fought? It's
entirely possible.

00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:44.765
But I've realized
there's more to it
than that.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.469
It's because they
all have faith in you.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.839
[gasping]

00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:53.874
They all have
faith.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.709
Faith in Sailor
Moon.

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:58.645
Yes. And also in
their friends.

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:04.151
There's something
special about you. I
used to think that

00:18:04.184 --> 00:18:06.820
you and I would
never fight alongside
each other.

00:18:06.854 --> 00:18:09.122
Not in a
million years.

00:18:09.156 --> 00:18:12.860
<i>But look at us</i>
<i>now... Fighting</i>
<i>side-by-side.</i>

00:18:12.893 --> 00:18:14.394
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>why...</i>

00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:18.131
<i>... but being with</i>
<i>you makes me wanna</i>
<i>believe in others.</i>

00:18:18.165 --> 00:18:21.835
And most of all, it
makes me wanna
believe in you.

00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:24.705
So what? What are you
trying to say?

00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:28.675
That that's the reason
why all of my friends
are gone now?

00:18:28.709 --> 00:18:31.111
I didn't need to
hear that!

00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:34.314
But, your friends
aren't gone like
you think they are.

00:18:34.348 --> 00:18:35.649
[gasping]

00:18:35.682 --> 00:18:38.719
Yes, they still live
within your heart and
will only truly be

00:18:38.752 --> 00:18:42.189
gone when you decide
to give up hope for
good.

00:18:42.222 --> 00:18:45.192
But, all of them
believe you'd never
do that...

00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:47.127
... and you'll
save everyone.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.030
That's why they
placed their hopes
in you.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.169
So you wanna try
surrendering to
Galaxia?

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:57.371
It'll definitely
be easier.

00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:01.508
No.

00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:04.077
I knew you'd say
that.

00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:05.145
[lightly gasping]

00:19:06.113 --> 00:19:07.915
Well, then. If
you're gonna keep
going,

00:19:07.948 --> 00:19:10.217
I guess I believe
in you, too.

00:19:10.517 --> 00:19:11.785
So do I.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:14.021
And the same
goes for me.

00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:24.064
Fighter... Healer...
Maker.

00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:29.970
Tell me... We're
friends, aren't we?

00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:33.507
Hmm.

00:19:34.474 --> 00:19:35.242
Mm.

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:36.977
Of course.

00:19:41.682 --> 00:19:44.251
Then let's go.

00:20:08.509 --> 00:20:09.776
<i>I'm disappointed.</i>

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:14.281
<i>Are you so scared</i>
<i>that you won't even</i>
<i>show yourself?</i>

00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:17.584
You're fools if you
think you can escape
me forever.

00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:33.433
Heh. So you've
finally given up.

00:20:33.467 --> 00:20:36.770
We will never
surrender to you,
Galaxia.

00:20:36.803 --> 00:20:40.073
Let's trust this to
Sailor Moon. After
all, the Light of

00:20:40.107 --> 00:20:41.975
Hope our princess
mentioned.

00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:44.845
Yes. She might be
that light.

00:20:44.878 --> 00:20:46.980
The Light of Hope
that was left by

00:20:47.014 --> 00:20:49.983
the legendary
Sailor Guardian.

00:20:50.017 --> 00:20:52.519
<i>The Legendary Sailor</i>

brought peace to the

forgotten about it.
