<i>That was how it all</i>

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:20.721
Go, my Star Seed, my
Light of Hope, to the
ends of the galaxy...

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.225
Find a star that will
embrace you...

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:29.997
A star that will one
day arise to fight

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.199
for love and
for justice.

00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:29.983
She is about to
awaken!

00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:31.084
[gasping]

00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:34.755
...the Light of Hope
I sent out into the
galaxy.

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.758
That miserable light!

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.227
The Light of Hope?

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:53.707
[flinching]

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:05.252
<i>Usagi's Love: The</i>
<i>Moonlight Illuminates</i>

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:14.561
Sailor Moon...

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.497
Who's there?

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.300
I have been searching
all this time...

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:22.970
... for someone
who would embrace me.

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:25.572
But who are you?

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:29.309
I am the radiance of
the star that was
once within

00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:32.779
Galaxia... the Light
of Hope.

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:34.548
The Light of Hope?

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:39.019
Please accept this...
My life's spark.

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.630
[smiling]

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:56.003
So warm and gentle.

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:02.843
What--?

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:08.415
<i>I beg you... Please</i>

<i>Hope in this galaxy.</i>

00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:13.253
<i>To that end, I grant</i>
<i>you this sword.</i>

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:15.923
A sword?

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:18.659
<i>Use this Sealing</i>
<i>Sword on Galaxia.</i>

00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:19.927
But I--

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.929
<i>There's no time to</i>
<i>hesitate...</i>

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:24.998
<i>It is the only</i>

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:26.733
I won't let you!!

Sailor Moon!

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.214
<i>Use the sword on</i>

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:41.348

<i>Do not hesitate!</i>

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:46.286
I cant.

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:56.096
What?

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.864
Mm!

00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:58.498
How impudent!

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:11.812
So that's it.

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:16.617
You intend to seal me
away by force...
using that sword.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.257
Just as she once did.
But power alone can
not defeat me.

00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:27.094
[grunting]

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:29.963
For this body belongs
to Sailor Galaxia,

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.733
the most powerful
Guardian in the
galaxy.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:34.801
What do you mean?

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:38.739
Prepare yourself...
Sailor Moon!!

00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:39.806
[gasping]

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.908

[grunting]

00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:47.447
I have obtained Star
Seeds from countless
worlds...

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:50.851
In the name of Chaos,
I will rule this galaxy!

00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:53.353
[struggling]
Don't do this.

00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:55.155
What's that?!

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.692
Fighting like this,
it serves no purpose!

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:01.662
You still spout that
nonsense?!

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.831
I will bring an
end to this!

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:05.666
[gasping]

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.134
And end to the
Sailor Wars

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:10.637
that have been waged
since the dawn of
the galaxy.

00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:15.209
And I will do it by
wiping out the light
of every single star.

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:16.910
Including you...

00:06:16.944 --> 00:06:20.781
And that wretched
Light of Hope that
this body left behind!

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:22.783
Galaxia!

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:25.018
She is no longer
Galaxia.

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:26.520
[gasping]

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:30.824
Galaxia's body is
now under the complete
control of Chaos.

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:34.728
From the moment she
sealed Chaos within
herself, it has

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:37.264
slowly corrupted her
body.

00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:41.768
She left behind one
ray of hope. She cut
off her Star Seed,

00:06:41.802 --> 00:06:43.637
which was still
untainted,

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.139
and released it
into the galaxy.

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:50.077
Eventually, it found
its way here, to you.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.579
So Chibi-Chibi
is...

00:06:54.014 --> 00:07:00.354
But now, it is too
late... Please,
Sailor Moon...

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:03.657
Save the galaxy
with that sword
you hold.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:06.660
I can't...

00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:10.831
[yelling and grunting]

00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:12.165
Please stop!

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:15.169
You want me to stop?
Then tell me,

00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:17.437
why have you got
that sword in your
hand?

00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:18.238
[gasping]

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:22.910
I think you actually
want this as much as
I do...

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:24.311
This battle!

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:25.345
No!!

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:26.346
Yes, you do!!

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:26.813
[gasping]

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:28.015
[yelling]

00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:31.351
Please, Sailor
Moon... you
must fight.

00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:34.655
You must stop
her. Stop Galaxia!

00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:36.290
No! Not like this!

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:37.024
Please!

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:39.660
I won't do it!

00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:40.928
[yelling]

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:42.196
No!!

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:58.645
[whimpering]

00:07:58.679 --> 00:07:59.646
[gasping]

00:08:00.414 --> 00:08:01.648
Curse you!

00:08:01.682 --> 00:08:03.150
[yelling]

00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:04.985
[yelling]

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:06.653
[gasping]

00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:13.760
[chuckling] It's
over... The Light of
Hope you believed in

00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:15.629
has been shattered.

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:16.396
The sword!

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:19.433
[trembling]

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.605
Chibi-Chibi..!

00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:27.741
Now there is no one
left in the galaxy
who can stop me!

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:29.743
<i>No, this isn't</i>
<i>right.</i>

00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:30.644
Hm?

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:34.348
There's nothing
good that ever comes
out of fighting!

00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:37.150
You just end up
hurting one
another...

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:41.555
Oh, Chibi-Chibi,
I'm sorry.

00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:44.791
In the end, you've
proven only that you
haven't the courage

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.727
or the pride of a
true Guardian!

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.797
If being a Guardian
means hurting
others...

00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:53.600
then I don't
want it.

00:08:53.634 --> 00:08:56.336
<i>Nothing good ever</i>
<i>comes out of</i>
<i>fighting.</i>

00:08:57.538 --> 00:09:01.542
You know, violence
isn't the only way
to solve things.

00:09:03.377 --> 00:09:04.077
What--?!

00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:31.772
So you've given up
then, Sailor Moon?

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:34.474
No. In fact, I'm far
from it.

00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:38.045
You see, the thing is
I love this world.

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:39.746
You what?

00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:43.884
It may be filled with
pain and sadness, but
I still love it...

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:47.988
...because this world
is where I was able
to meet everyone.

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:51.258
You know it too,
don't you?

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.694
How wonderful
this world is?

00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:55.996
Stop talking
nonsense!

00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:59.433
[gasping and groaning]

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.134
If you won't fight
for this world,

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:03.003
then you're not
fit to defend it!

00:10:03.737 --> 00:10:05.405
All of your friends
are gone

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:08.208
because you weren't
strong enough to
protect them.

00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:12.346
They're not gone.

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:13.614
What?

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:17.451
<i>The Star Lights</i>
<i>taught me that... As</i>
<i>long as I don't</i>

00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:21.088
<i>give up, my friends</i>
<i>will always be with</i>
<i>me.</i>

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:24.825
If I were to give up,
lose hope, stop
trying...

00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:27.361
Only then would they
be truly gone.

00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:30.430
<i>That's why I</i>
<i>won't lose hope...</i>

00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:33.200
...why I will never
give up.

00:11:01.295 --> 00:11:03.363
How dare you!
[grunting]

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:11.772
[grunting]

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:15.642
You're wasting your
time, Sailor Moon!...
Your pathetic little

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:19.146
light will never be
able to illuminate
the galaxy!

00:11:19.813 --> 00:11:21.748
Yes, it can!

00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:24.518
I'll embrace...this
whole world!

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:26.386
Fool!

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:31.792
[screaming]

00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:33.160
Sailor Moon!!

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.329
Now that you've
chosen not to
fight...

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:38.665
And forfeited your
pride as a Guardian...

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:40.767
What can you
possibly do?!

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:48.609
[screaming]

00:11:48.642 --> 00:11:52.145
All that's left for
you to do is to hand
your light over to me

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:55.148
and then fade quietly
out of existence!

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:58.652
No, I won't give
up. Never...

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:02.456
Not while I still
have faith.

00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:03.257
What?!

00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:06.593
Faith in this world
that I love... This
world that

00:12:06.627 --> 00:12:09.596
<i>everyone's worked</i>
<i>so hard to protect...</i>

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.967
<i>And faith in the</i>
<i>fragment of hope that</i>
<i>still remains there...</i>

00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:17.004
...somewhere...in
your heart.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.186
What the hell is she
doing?

00:12:36.623 --> 00:12:42.129
<i>I have faith... in</i>
<i>the fragment of hope</i>
<i>that still remains</i>

00:12:42.162 --> 00:12:45.399
<i>there...somewhere in</i>
<i>your heart.</i>

00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:49.336
<i>I have faith</i>
<i>in you.</i>

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:03.650
So, please...

00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:25.706
This cant be
happening.

00:13:26.807 --> 00:13:30.244
I love it. I love
this world...

00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:33.347
This world that's
home to all living
beings...

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:37.017
I don't wanna lose
it. Or anyone in it.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.653
And that...
includes you.

00:13:39.686 --> 00:13:42.089
Stay back! Keep away
from me!

Impossible!

<i>Yes, you're right.</i>

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:53.000
I, too, love this
world...

<i>I love it with</i>

00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:08.148
I can see it, Sailor
Moon...

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:11.018
I can see your
light...

00:14:12.452 --> 00:14:16.056

so gentle...

00:14:49.623 --> 00:14:53.760
Thank you, Sailor
Moon... You have
illuminated the

entire galaxy with
your light.

It's such a loving

Chaos is gone
for good?

00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:07.474
I think it's
just gone back

00:15:07.508 --> 00:15:09.243
to where it was
always meant to be.

00:15:09.676 --> 00:15:10.611
Was meant to be?

00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:12.779
Yes.

Inside the hearts of
everyone.

will happen again?

Let's have faith in
the people of this
world we both love...

00:15:23.857 --> 00:15:25.659
It'll be all right.

00:15:25.692 --> 00:15:28.996
After all, don't
forget that the Light
of Hope resides

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:31.698
within everyone's
heart as well.

00:15:31.732 --> 00:15:35.302
You're so
strong and pure.

00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:38.071
But I-I can never
make amends for all

00:15:38.105 --> 00:15:40.274
the terrible
things I've done.

00:15:40.307 --> 00:15:43.110
Just start over. From
the beginning.

00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:47.114
It's never too late
for someone to have a
second chance.

00:15:47.147 --> 00:15:50.784
Now...guide the Star
Seeds back where
they belong.

00:15:50.817 --> 00:15:53.187
So they don't
lose their way.

00:15:53.854 --> 00:15:55.022

We all believed

Sailor Moon taught

believe.
