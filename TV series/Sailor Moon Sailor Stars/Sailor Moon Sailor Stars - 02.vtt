00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:51.078
Saturn Awakens: The Ten Sailor
Guardians Unite!

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:58.719
(Usagi)
(contented sigh) Spring is in
full bloom now...

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:00.120
(Mamo)
Yeah...

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:05.492
I love this time of the year. It
just feels so romantic.

00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:06.627
Yeah...

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.631
I was thinking now that I'm in
high school, maybe...

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:14.935
we could do more "grown up
things," you know what I mean?

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.136
Yeah...

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.273
If... you'd be up to doing
them... that is...

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:23.577
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I
actually said it!

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.014
Yeah...

00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:30.417
Moses supposes his toes'ses are
roses.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.985
Yeah...

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:36.823
Better Botter bought some
butter; "But!" she said, "this
butter's bitter!"

00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:38.425
Yeah...

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.394
(frustrated)

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:41.395
Usako?

00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:43.864
Mamo! You weren't listening to
a word I said!

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:48.635
This is the first date we've had
in a while, and it's like you
don't even care!

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:53.540
(sharp pain)

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:56.677
Hey, what's wrong? You okay?

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.545
(Shaking off pain) Yeah...

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.082
Is.. your eye hurting? Here..
lemme see.

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.017
(grunt) Stop it!

00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:05.719
(surprised)

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:13.493
(gasp) I'm.. sorry.

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:16.697
What's going on? Are you..
feeling sick?

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.532
Yeah, something like that..

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:24.271
I've been feeling really off
lately. How about.. ' we get
you another balloon?

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:28.475
It's okay. You should go home
and get some rest.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.645
You're right. I'll go do that.
Sorry..

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:32.613
Don't be.

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:33.881
I'll call you.

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:35.315
(acknowledgment)

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.285
Mamo...

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.498
Isn't it great things are back
to normal now?

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:54.301
Yes. I've had much more time to
study!

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:57.104
Yeah, same here! I've started
learning a foreign language

00:03:57.137 --> 00:03:59.673
so I can be ready once I travel
around the world.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.441
That sounds like fun.

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:05.145
It really is. I've been
learning from this great program
called "Let's Speak".

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:07.080
Oh wow! Their lessons are pretty
advanced.

00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:11.685
I watch that show too! ' The guy
who hosts it, George, is a real
cutie.

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:15.022
Right?! It's those gorgeous
eyes that do it for sure.

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:16.190
(giggly laughter)

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:18.358
...Are you really watching for
the lessons?

00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:24.331
As for me, I've been taking '
singing and dancing lessons,
day in and day out! (giggle)

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.266
(concerned)

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.834
Hey...

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:28.435
What's wrong, Usagi?

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.269
Huh?

00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:32.739
Did you get in a fight with
Mamoru?

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:35.042
Not exactly, it's hard to
explain..

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:36.143
You're safe here.

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:37.945
You can talk to us about
anything.

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:39.847
That's what best friends are
for, right?

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.318
Well the other day...
we went on a date at the park,
but...

00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:55.662
Welcome home!

00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:57.297
Hey, Hotaru.

00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:02.236
Mommy-Michiru, Daddy-Haruka,
guess what?! I was studying with
Mommy-Setsuna today!

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:04.071
That's so great, sweetie.

00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:06.840
And what was it that you were
studying together?

00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:11.078
A sonnet. It starts with,
"Shall I compare thee to a
summer's day?

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:13.180
Thou art more lovely and more
temperate..."

00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:13.847
Wow!

00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:15.616
That's so wonderful!

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:16.783
(happy giggle)

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:20.621
(awed gasp) A butterfly! Wait!

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:22.789
She's adorable.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:24.191
(warm chuckle)

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:40.507
Ever since that night... Hotaru
has been growing at a speed that
none of us could have imagined.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.381
And she really doesn't seem to
be slowing down any time soon.

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:49.283
And It's not just her body
either...

00:05:49.316 --> 00:05:51.285
Her mind is growing just as
rapidly;

00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:57.191
She now understands the theory
of general relativity and can
recite the poetry of Yeats.

00:05:57.224 --> 00:05:59.159
It's unbelieveable.

00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:04.665
I was really hoping she could
live her life as an ordinary
child this time. Perhaps...

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.134
Wait a second... where is she?

00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:10.671
Maybe she went back inside.

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.472
Let's make sure.

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:14.441
Hotaru?

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:15.876
You in here?

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.911
Where are you?

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:18.846
Did you find her?

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:19.580
No.

00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:21.148
Where could she be?

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:23.650
One more place to look...

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.365
(relieved sigh)

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.101
(surprised gasp)

00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:50.310
What is that?

00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:54.815
The birth of the Universe: The
"Big Bang."

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:58.819
She's simulating its creation,
but at an accelerated rate.

00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:02.789
When did she develop such an
ability?

00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:04.858
We need to keep a closer eye on
her.

00:07:04.892 --> 00:07:06.627
Yes.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.695
This is our Solar System.

00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:18.872
That white object is the moon,
isn't it? It's almost like a
shiny pearl.

00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:22.142
It has such a warm light.

00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:25.679
...The same light that has
always been watching over her.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:36.056
This reminds me of Fessenden's
Worlds...

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:37.257
Fessenden's...?

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:40.527
It's a science fiction book I
read as a kid.

00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:43.964
It talks about how we might be
nothing more than a momentary
blip..

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:47.201
in a universe that someone like
her has created.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.705
Can't say I like the idea.

00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:59.079
No? If we think of sadness and
pain as just illusions, aren't
they more bearable?

00:08:01.582 --> 00:08:03.183
Hotaru!

00:08:03.217 --> 00:08:07.321
Hey! Are you alright?

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:07.921
The Moon...

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:09.623
(soft surprised react)

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.226
The White Moon.. is being..

00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:17.097
shrouded.. by a dark... shadow.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:22.169
One with radiant, golden hair is
being pursued...

00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:27.374
Pursued by a force that is..
(shiver) pure evil.

00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:30.644
Hotaru... it's okay... you're
safe here with us!

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.045
Look!

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:36.650
The light of the Moon, it's...

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.952
It's fading away!

00:08:38.986 --> 00:08:41.855
Hotaru, pull yourself
together! You're fine!

00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:45.592
(shivering)(gasp of lucidness)

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:52.399
I'm scared...Daddy-Haruka... I'm
scared! (crying)

00:08:52.432 --> 00:08:55.602
It's gonna be okay, Hotaru.
We're right here with you.

00:09:00.774 --> 00:09:03.577
What is happening to our Solar
System?

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:16.356
I think you're overthinking
things, Usagi.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.224
You sure?

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:18.992
There's nothing to be concerned
about.

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:23.764
But it really seemed like Mamo
was upset; like he didn't want
be around me.

00:09:23.797 --> 00:09:28.836
I doubt that's it. I think he
just didn't wanna make you worry
about him too much.

00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:30.137
Really?

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.573
Yes, I agree with Rei.

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:34.942
I think you're lucky to even
have these issues!

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:38.846
Yeah, it's not like the rest of
us even have boyfriends to begin
with.

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:40.914
I'm jealous!
(embarrassed laughter)

00:09:40.948 --> 00:09:41.882
(amused laugh)

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:42.950
Hey! Look over there!

00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:44.251
(soft notice)

00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:47.788
So handsome...

00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:48.789
What a dreamboat!

00:09:48.822 --> 00:09:50.757
C'mon, Ami! Get in on the
action!

00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:51.592
(sheepish laugh)

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:57.197
<i>(Usagi)</i>
I guess they're right... Maybe I
<i>am worrying over nothing.</i>

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.072
What the.. (annoyed grunt)

00:10:43.043 --> 00:10:44.745
(wincing in pain)

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:51.318
Shut the hell up!

00:10:54.054 --> 00:10:55.589
(shallow breathing)

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:57.558
(panting, starting with exhale)

00:10:57.591 --> 00:10:59.660
(wincing)

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:03.197
Man, what's gotten into me?

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:10.137
You must be tired. You should
get some rest?

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.574
She's right. I really just
need to take it easy.

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:22.249
Mamo...

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.852
I've found you...

00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:25.752
Huh?

00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:29.723
<i>Was it my imagination?</i>

00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:31.124
(startled)

00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:36.330
Mamo...

00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:45.706
She's sleeping safe and sound
now.

00:11:45.739 --> 00:11:46.907
(sigh of relief)

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.443
But still, what exactly does all
of this mean?

00:12:01.488 --> 00:12:04.691
(evil laughter)

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:06.994
(evil laughter)

00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:19.072
(evil laughter)

00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:31.885
(evil laughter)

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.221
(evil laughter)

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:37.324
(startled awake) Who's
there?!

00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:47.401
(soft, evil laughter)

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:50.103
Stop it! Go away!

00:12:50.704 --> 00:12:53.106
Awaken...

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.244
The time has come for the young
soul to fulfill her destiny.

00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:01.648
Who are you?

00:13:01.682 --> 00:13:07.321
I am Sailor Saturn. And I..
am your Guardian.

00:13:07.354 --> 00:13:10.524
My Guardian?

00:13:10.557 --> 00:13:16.296
Evil is fast approaching. I
call upon... your true powers!

00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:20.601
Now.. close your eyes.

00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:59.039
I...

00:14:03.777 --> 00:14:06.146
I remember...

00:14:11.485 --> 00:14:12.452
(astonished gasp)

00:14:13.086 --> 00:14:14.221
(shocked gasp)

00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:14.688
Hotaru?!

00:14:14.721 --> 00:14:15.689
Is that you?!

00:14:15.722 --> 00:14:18.392
The Princess.. ' is in danger.

00:14:18.425 --> 00:14:18.959
(worried gasp)

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:19.993
What about the others?

00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:21.161
Them too?

00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:23.764
Yes. Darkness is
approaching.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.403
So, what's this emergency
meeting about?

00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:31.772
Yeah, what's up? Did something
happen, Rei?

00:14:31.805 --> 00:14:38.445
It's about our sacred mirror..
Last night, I felt an evil
presence...

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:47.054
(grimace)

00:14:48.188 --> 00:14:51.825
Rin, Pyo, To, Sha, Kai, Jin,
Retsu, Zai, Zen...

00:14:51.859 --> 00:14:54.628
Evil Spirit, be exorcised!

00:14:57.331 --> 00:14:58.799
A mirror...

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:02.102
Wait.. This morning I saw a
bunch of people just staring
into mirrors.

00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:08.308
Yesterday, I swore that I saw
something outside of my window.
A weird shadow...

00:15:08.342 --> 00:15:10.310
All of this might be connected.

00:15:10.344 --> 00:15:14.348
You think there's someone behind
the scenes that's orchestrating
this?

00:15:15.983 --> 00:15:21.889
(evil laughter)

00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:24.024
(surprised)

00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:26.260
Everyone! Let's transform!

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:35.202

00:16:20.714 --> 00:16:23.550
Sailor Venus!

00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:32.459
Last but not least...

00:16:33.527 --> 00:16:36.296
I.. am Sailor Moon!

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.700
And I.. am Sailor Chibi Moon!

00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:41.935
In the name of the Moon...

00:16:41.969 --> 00:16:44.338
...we'll punish you!

00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:48.275
(freaking out) There are so
manyyyy!

00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:54.648
Mars... Flame Sniper!

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:59.453
Mercury... Aqua Rhapsody!

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:00.687
(evil laughter)

00:17:00.721 --> 00:17:04.391
Jupiter...Oak Evolution!

00:17:04.424 --> 00:17:07.928
(panicked cries)

00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:11.732
Venus... Love and Beauty '
Shock!

00:17:11.765 --> 00:17:13.000
(frightened scream)

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.168
Mirrors?!

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:16.203
Look!

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.608
There's no end to them!

00:17:21.642 --> 00:17:23.043
(concerned react)

00:17:23.076 --> 00:17:25.379
(pained scream)

00:17:25.412 --> 00:17:26.747
(gleeful cry)

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.049
Tuxedo Mask!

00:17:30.851 --> 00:17:34.955
Anyone who would dare bring
about chaos to this world must
answer to me, Tuxedo Ma- (wince)

00:17:34.988 --> 00:17:37.457
Tuxedo Mask! Are you alright?

00:17:38.759 --> 00:17:40.694
Oh no!

00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:43.230
(gasp)

00:17:43.263 --> 00:17:45.832
Looks like you kittens could use
a little help.

00:17:45.866 --> 00:17:47.801
(notice react)

00:17:47.835 --> 00:17:53.140

of the Heavens, I am Sailor

Protected by Pluto, the Planet
of Space-Time, I am Sailor

00:18:05.786 --> 00:18:10.157
Answering the call to a new
threat, the Three Guardians of
the Outer Planets...

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.392
...are here to fight for this
world!

00:18:12.426 --> 00:18:12.693
(evil laughter)

00:18:12.726 --> 00:18:13.760
Uranus!

00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:14.761

00:18:15.629 --> 00:18:16.964
Mind if we join the party?

00:18:16.997 --> 00:18:18.532
It will be fun.

00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:19.533
(chuckle)

00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:21.768
We even brought a guest...

00:18:21.802 --> 00:18:22.402
(disbelief gasp)

00:18:22.436 --> 00:18:23.437
You're...!

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.006

(happy)

00:18:33.981 --> 00:18:35.716
Hello, Chibi-Usa.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.485
(evil laughter)

00:18:40.587 --> 00:18:44.625
World... Shaking!

00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:47.528
(scream)

00:18:49.263 --> 00:18:52.266
Thank you! But why are.. you
here?

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:55.636
Sailor Saturn had warned us that
you were all in great danger.

00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:56.904
All of us are in...

00:18:56.937 --> 00:18:58.605
...danger?

00:18:58.639 --> 00:19:02.543
Sailor Moon, now is the time for
you to awaken as the True Moon
Princess.

00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:03.477
(puzzled)

00:19:07.781 --> 00:19:12.352
Sailor Guardians... we must
unite our hearts as one.

00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:18.025
(affirming)

00:19:26.233 --> 00:19:29.403
I can feel everyone's power
flowing through me.

00:19:29.436 --> 00:19:35.576
The words I have to say are
echoing in my heart...

00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:50.057
Moon Eternal... Make Up!

00:20:02.536 --> 00:20:04.171
Sailor Moon...?

00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:06.073
(awed)

00:20:38.672 --> 00:20:40.874
(scream)

00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:43.110
(scream)

00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:46.413
(weakened)

00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:49.249
Sailor Moon!

00:20:50.584 --> 00:20:51.718
You okay?

00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:53.520
What just happened?

00:20:53.554 --> 00:20:56.790
What you all just witnessed was
Sailor Moon's true form.

00:20:56.823 --> 00:21:00.460
I was reborn in order to help
awaken this power inside her.

00:21:00.494 --> 00:21:01.595
Her true form...

00:21:01.628 --> 00:21:03.363
That power was incredible.

00:21:03.397 --> 00:21:05.365
It purged all of those
creatures.

00:21:05.399 --> 00:21:08.602
Was.. that really my true
form?

00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:12.940
Hey, Mamo...

00:21:12.973 --> 00:21:14.808
You sure you'll be fine by
yourself?

00:21:14.842 --> 00:21:17.511
Yeah.. I just need some rest is
all.

00:21:18.846 --> 00:21:19.746
Okay...

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:20.247
Goodnight.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.982
(sigh)

00:21:22.015 --> 00:21:23.684
Night, Mamo...

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:34.661
<i>I feel strange... like my body</i>
<i>isn't even my own.</i>

00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:38.799
Precisely. You're mine now.

00:21:38.832 --> 00:21:44.738
Know this, Princess of the White
Moon. I will take everything you
love away from you.

00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:51.245
(nefarious laugh)

00:23:36.783 --> 00:23:41.388
(Usagi)
Mamo's been acting so
distant towards me lately! Could
something have happened?

00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:43.190
(Usagi)
I'm so worried, I can't
even sleep at night.

00:23:43.223 --> 00:23:45.092
(Minako)
Well, you were sound
asleep in class.

00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:47.327
(Usagi)
I've been having trouble
eating.

00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:49.162
(Minako)
You had a whole cake earlier!

00:23:49.196 --> 00:23:51.431
(Usagi)
I've been too distracted
to study!

00:23:51.465 --> 00:23:53.700
(Minako)
And that's different,
becauuuuse...?

00:23:53.734 --> 00:23:58.038
(Usagi)
Next time on Sailor
Stars, "The Cursed Mirror:
Mamoru Caught in a Nightmare."

00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:01.408
(Usagi)
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
