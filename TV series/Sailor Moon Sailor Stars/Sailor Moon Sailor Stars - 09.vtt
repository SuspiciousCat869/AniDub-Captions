[happy sigh]

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.120
I promise, it won't take a
minute, really. Okay, are you
ready? You better be.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:04.424
Are you sure about this? It
might not be a good idea.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:07.628
You can't back out now! I'm
counting on you.

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:12.399
Hey, we've gone far enough,
don't you think? So what did you
want to say to me?

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:15.068
Uh, oh! My eye!

00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:17.938
Can you look? I got something in
it.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:22.142
Wow, Minako sure is good!

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:25.679
<i>(Usagi) Oooh! They look like</i>
<i>they're about to kiss!</i>

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:33.353
This is amazing! Yes! Woo! Work
it! [gasps] Eee!

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:33.854
Huh?

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:34.655
Uh-oh!

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.826

you're doing, Bun-head?

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.995

(Rei) Are these the best photos
<i>you got?</i>

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.610
Man, these are really bad.

00:02:56.643 --> 00:03:01.081
Well, at least your excitement
really comes through, Usagi, if
nothing else.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:06.620
Gotta hand it to Minako for
coming up with these ideas.

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:10.257
(Makoto) I mean, trying to sell
photos of herself with Seiya to
<i>the media?</i>

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.992
<i>It's kinda brilliant!</i>

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.929
Become a teen idol by posing as
a teen idol's girlfriend!

00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:20.968
Yes, exactly. And just a couple
of days ago, she made me take a
photo of her and Yaten...

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:25.439
eating lunch together, so she
could promote herself as his
girlfriend!

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:29.376
Wait a minute! She was eating
lunch with my Yaten?!

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.679
And before that, she pretended
to have a problem with math...

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:36.049
so that she could get a photo of
Taiki helping her with homework.

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:41.221
[gasps] She went after Taiki?!
[embarrassed]

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:43.657
Seems she's going after all of
them.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.025
The real question is...

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.627
Which one is Minako...

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.095
Really after?

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.730
<i>(Minako) Hey guys!</i>

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:50.197
Huh?

00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:52.299
Good morning!

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:53.300
Which one?!

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:55.169
Which one what?

00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:58.438
We all know about you and your
romantic photo shoots.

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:01.708
So which one of the Three Lights
are you really after?

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:02.643
Ohh.
[grunts]

00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:06.513
That. I've totally given
up on that plan, it was too
roundabout.

00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:09.483
I've come up with a more
realistic strategy.

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:10.717
[gasps] That's mine...

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:11.718
Huh?

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:13.453
Ahh.

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.924
I, Minako Aino!

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:18.292
As of now...

00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:23.564
am officially the personal
assistant to the popular idol
group, the Three Lights!

00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:28.368
[groans]

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:33.040
These are super-busy guys,
famous celebrities.

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:36.510
I thought being at the same
school, we'd naturally become
intimate...

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:38.679
but there just aren't
enough opportunities.

00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:43.217
But if I'm around them
twenty-four-seven, love can't
help but blossom and grow!

00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:48.889
Okay then, so what's your
ultimate objective in getting
close to the Three Lights...

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:53.260
Minako? To become an idol
yourself or to make one of the
members your boyfriend?

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.495
Obviously both, of course!

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:56.663
[groans]

00:04:56.697 --> 00:04:59.266
Oh wow, look at what time it is,
I've gotta run!

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.169
The Three Lights are waiting for
me in the studio!

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.706
Minako's left the building!

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:10.611
Wait, she's already their
assistant? When the heck did she
pull that off?

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.380
Hey, what happened to Usagi?
When did she leave?

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:27.661
I hope all this isn't just a
waste of time. Do you really
think we'll be able to find her?

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:32.332
Absolutely. That's the whole
reason we've gone to the trouble
of becoming teen idols.

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:37.905
Yes, we just have to become
famous enough that she can't
help but know we're here.

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:40.574
We have to work harder at it,
that's all.

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.442
Hmm.

00:06:00.227 --> 00:06:01.461
Hmm.

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:05.699
[chewing]

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:06.466
Hmm?

<i>[chuckles]</i>

(Secretary) Producer Nezu, the
President would like to see you.

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:58.852
You summoned me, Master Galaxia?

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:02.656
I did. Have you decided on your
next target?

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:07.394
Oh, yes. The target is chosen
and in my sights, Master
Galaxia.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:15.235
I see. So then go and get me
the true Star Seed, quickly, so
I can make the galaxy mine.

00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:16.603
I will.

<i>(Usagi) He's got problems with</i>
<i>his plumbing?</i>

00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:40.794
Not those kind of pipes, I mean
his voice! Huh? Wait, what're
you even doing in here, Usagi?

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:45.032
[giggles] Well, I wanted to see
if what you were doing was as
fun as it sounded.

00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:47.701
So I kinda decided to follow
you. [giggling]

00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:53.073
Excuse me, no fans are allowed
back here, I'm sorry. And no
pictures. Can you...?

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:55.976
Back off. Stay out of my way.

coming. How do you do?

00:09:11.752 --> 00:09:14.221
Yeah, okay, okay, I get why
you're here. But did you have to
take a picture of me yawning?

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:15.522

How can they act like it's so
delicious?

Because they're professional
teen idols, silly.

00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:39.773
They have to keep smiling for
the camera no matter what
they're feeling.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.309
Being a professional is a tough
job.

Hmph. I'll say!

yourself, right?

00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:56.056
That's right, I do.

00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:59.026
Well, then maybe one day you'll
understand.

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:02.329
[grunts] Man! What's with
that attitude?

00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:39.099
A little more of an angle,
Seiya. Taiki, eyes forward.

00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:41.235
That's it, hold it just like
that.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.176
Yeah, that's right. Hold that
pose.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.678
What a moment! The click of the
shutter...

00:11:51.712 --> 00:11:55.682
the flash of the strobe lights,
that's when you know you're a
star!

00:11:55.716 --> 00:12:00.787
[moans] I'm starving. When are
we going to take a break for
dinner?

00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:06.693
A true professional doesn't even
think about eating until their
work is done, Usagi.

00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:12.466
Man, I could never do this
job. That's it, I'm gonna
go buy something to eat.

00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:23.210
Well, okay! That's all the
studio time we booked for today,
so that is officially a wrap!

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.045
Really good work, everyone.

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:27.381
Kill the lights!
Get those out of the way!

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:28.015
Oh, thanks.

00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:29.082
You're a great help.

00:12:29.116 --> 00:12:30.717
I'm feeling hungry.

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:34.955
Hey! Why don't we all go
somewhere special and get a bite
to eat together? We deserve it!

00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:35.956
Sounds good.

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:39.326
Yay! Follow me! [giggles]

00:12:41.128 --> 00:12:43.497
Can't we all stay for just a
little bit longer?

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.198
Hmm?

00:12:45.032 --> 00:12:46.033
You were just starting to loosen
up.

00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:49.303
Please, let me keep shooting
till I get the look I want.

00:12:49.336 --> 00:12:51.338
But we're already over our time.

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:53.540
I've got news for you, we're not
in school.

00:12:53.574 --> 00:12:56.176
It's not like everything's over
as soon as the bell rings, okay?

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.280
They have all been working
really hard today and they're
hungry! They've had it!

00:13:00.314 --> 00:13:04.451
But I'm so close to getting the
perfect shot.

00:13:04.484 --> 00:13:09.756
I'm sorry, but if you don't have
the perfect photo already, maybe
the problem's with you, Saki.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.625
Stop arguing with her, she's
right.

00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:12.659
But I...

00:13:13.527 --> 00:13:14.995
Okay, then.

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:17.764
You can keep shooting till your
satisfied. But...

00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:21.401
These had better be the best
publicity shots ever.

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:23.136
Count on it.

00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:27.875
But we're past our time. And
you're hungry and tired.

00:13:27.908 --> 00:13:30.244
We're pros. It's what we do.

00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:34.615
<i>Wow. Is being a pro always</i>
<i>this demanding?</i>

00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:38.919
Look, for us, every day is for
keeps, and that means putting
everything we've got...

00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:42.422
on the line to achieve the very
best results we possibly can.

00:13:42.456 --> 00:13:49.596
No compromises. No saying that
we're too tired. Or too hungry.
You see?

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.597
Okay! Let's do this.

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:56.837
You can't rely on flashiness or
popularity. Not if you really
want to make it.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.406
Nothing is easy in this line of
work.

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:04.745
It's like you said yourself,
remember? Being a professional
is a tough job.

00:14:04.778 --> 00:14:06.013
<i>(Director) Ready when you are!</i>

00:14:07.147 --> 00:14:10.417
Hang in there. Right, coming...
Okay, here we go again!

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:13.020
[happy gasp]

00:14:14.588 --> 00:14:16.890
Chin down a little bit, Seiya.
And Taiki, stand straight, with
your chest out.

00:14:16.924 --> 00:14:21.028
There, that's it. Hold it like
that.

00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:28.001
(Minako) Saki's a pro, the Three
<i>Lights are pros. I'm just an</i>
<i>amateur compared to them.</i>

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:33.040
Minako, if you wanna be a real
idol you had better get with the
program!

00:14:33.073 --> 00:14:34.975
Good work, everyone.

00:14:44.084 --> 00:14:45.652
<i>(Nezu) Saki Itabashi.</i>

00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:46.320
Huh?

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:50.958
<i>(Nezu) You are truly the</i>
<i>photography world's brightest</i>
<i>new star, a true genius.</i>

00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:51.692
Who're you?

00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:55.896
I admire the passion you put
into every photograph you take.

00:14:55.929 --> 00:14:58.165
Maybe you'd like to take one of
me.

00:14:58.198 --> 00:15:01.001
Sorry, I don't take photographs
outside of my work.

00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:06.573
It's fine. I wasn't that
interested in having my picture
taken anyway.

00:15:06.607 --> 00:15:08.976
What I want is your Star Seed.

00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:11.044
Chuu!

00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:12.145
[screams]

00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:19.686
Where did Usagi disappear to?
Did she get bored and go home
already? [gasps]

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:21.688
Saki!

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.359
Haa! Umph!

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:33.300
[screams]

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.138
She needs help!

00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:43.477
Venus Crystal Power Make Up!

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:11.538
Huh? Aww. Come on, don't tell
me I was wrong again!

00:16:11.572 --> 00:16:12.206
Hey!

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:12.973
[gasps]

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:14.975
Get away from her!

00:16:15.843 --> 00:16:16.977
Hm!

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.012
[laughing]

00:16:19.046 --> 00:16:22.549
[chomps] Hmm? Hmm!

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.259
Moon Eternal Make Up!

00:17:08.762 --> 00:17:10.430
Venus!

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:17.171
Love and Beauty Shock!

00:17:17.671 --> 00:17:18.705
[chuckles]

00:17:18.739 --> 00:17:20.174
Wha? She dodged it!

00:17:21.408 --> 00:17:24.144
What was it that you were aiming
at anyway, you stupid girl?

00:17:24.178 --> 00:17:26.146
(Sailor Moon) You're the stupid
<i>one!</i>

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.014
Huh?

00:17:31.585 --> 00:17:33.787
I was looking for you, where
were you?

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.355
[sheepish chuckle] Sorry.

00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:37.524
Anyway, how dare you attack
Saki...

00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:41.161
after she had just finished
teaching me the challenges of
life as a pro!

00:17:41.195 --> 00:17:46.099
I'm the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for beauty!
I am Sailor Venus!

00:17:46.133 --> 00:17:51.371
And I'm the Pretty Guardian who
just ate a rice ball so I'm at
full strength!

00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:57.177
I am Sailor Moon!

00:17:58.378 --> 00:18:02.950
And in the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

00:18:02.983 --> 00:18:07.621
I know, why don't we have your
friend Saki teach you even more
of life's challenges?

00:18:07.654 --> 00:18:11.725
Sailor Gekisha! Do me a favor
and get rid of these two, will
you?

00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:15.863
[giggles]

00:18:15.896 --> 00:18:20.267
My work here is done for
today. Bye-bye!

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.040
[gasps]

00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:29.977
Sailor Gekisha!

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.411
Saki?

00:18:32.679 --> 00:18:35.449
Ooh, yes, very nice, very nice,
hold that pose, just like that!

00:18:35.482 --> 00:18:37.451
Aah! Huh?

00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:40.254
A photo opportunity!

00:18:42.322 --> 00:18:43.357
[screams]

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.359
No! Saki!

00:18:46.293 --> 00:18:47.227
Ah!

00:18:48.629 --> 00:18:52.766
Love it! Don't move!
[chuckles] The perfect angle!
What a photo op!

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.303
[screaming]

00:18:56.336 --> 00:18:58.205
[gasping] Venus!

00:18:58.238 --> 00:19:01.408
Hang in there! [grunts]

00:19:02.276 --> 00:19:03.177
Huh?

00:19:04.011 --> 00:19:08.081
Who? What? Hm? [growls]

00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:12.152
Breaking through the darkness of
night.

00:19:12.186 --> 00:19:15.122
Traveling unchained across
the atmosphere.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:17.658
The three sacred shooting
stars!

00:19:19.193 --> 00:19:21.128
What the? Who're you guys?

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.497
Sailor Star Fighter!

00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:26.600
Sailor Star Maker!

00:19:27.201 --> 00:19:30.070
Sailor Star Healer!

00:19:31.038 --> 00:19:34.641
We're the Sailor Star Lights!
Stage on!

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:39.613
Wow, what a pose! You look
great! What a photo op!

00:19:40.214 --> 00:19:41.215
[grunts]

00:19:45.252 --> 00:19:50.757
Star Sensitive Inferno!

00:19:51.491 --> 00:19:54.561
[screams]

00:19:55.662 --> 00:19:57.598
Now, Sailor Moon!

00:19:57.631 --> 00:19:58.732
[grunts]

00:20:24.157 --> 00:20:34.168
Starlight Honeymoon Therapy
Kiss!

00:20:37.938 --> 00:20:43.977
[grunting] Beautiful!

00:20:51.385 --> 00:20:52.586
Thank goodness.

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:53.453
Uh?

00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:55.756
Wait! Don't go!

00:20:59.459 --> 00:21:04.665
Are they on our side? Or are
they?

00:21:09.503 --> 00:21:13.640
I wonder if Minako is succeeding
in her efforts to become a
superstar idol.

00:21:13.674 --> 00:21:17.511
I doubt it'll last. You don't
even get any time for meals.

00:21:17.978 --> 00:21:19.179
Meals?

00:21:20.214 --> 00:21:21.048
You wouldn't believe what
happened yesterday!

00:21:21.582 --> 00:21:21.615
<i>(Minako) Morning!</i>

00:21:21.882 --> 00:21:22.216
Huh?

00:21:22.916 --> 00:21:24.518
Oh, good, you're all here! Look!

00:21:25.085 --> 00:21:26.720
[shrieks] Oh!

00:21:26.753 --> 00:21:28.288
[gasps] Hey, that's mine!

00:21:28.322 --> 00:21:31.058
"Come be a star." An audition?

00:21:31.091 --> 00:21:32.759
Minako, what are these?

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:36.663
I realized that if I made my
debut as an assistant to the
Three Lights...

00:21:36.697 --> 00:21:39.266
then people would
think I was just riding their
coattails.

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:44.137
<i>(Minako) So I decided to earn</i>
<i>my stardom fair and square by</i>
<i>auditioning!</i>

00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:46.940
So you're not giving up your
dream of becoming an idol?

00:21:46.974 --> 00:21:49.743
Not in a million years! Well!

00:21:49.776 --> 00:21:53.247
Minako has got to go, go, go!

00:23:35.682 --> 00:23:39.052
<i>(Usagi) Hey, I heard you're</i>
<i>going to be doing a musical?</i>

00:23:39.086 --> 00:23:43.991
<i>(Seiya) Hm? Yeah. Dammit, she</i>
<i>hates me. That's why she's</i>
<i>giving me a hard time.</i>

00:23:44.024 --> 00:23:48.061
<i>(Usagi) What are you talking</i>
about? And taking your anger out
<i>on me isn't going to help!</i>

00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:50.163
(Seiya) Shut up! You don't know
<i>what I'm going through!</i>

00:23:50.197 --> 00:23:52.866
<i>(Usagi) Yeah? Well, I just</i>
<i>failed a big test!</i>

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.368
<i>(Seiya) Huh, me too.</i>

00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:56.270
