<i>Haruka and Taiki</i>

I'm sure Seiya
would agree with me.

All right... Why did
you all call us here?

Oh? You seem unfazed.

We've had our
suspicions for a
while.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:46.166
Our mission is to
defend the solar system
from outside threats.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.035
And keep our princess
safe.

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:50.237
So, stay away from
Usagi Tsukino.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.539
That goes for
Sailor Moon, too.

00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:56.343
We planned to do that
anyway. She's been
causing too many

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.344
problems for us.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.379
But we might use her
if we think it'll

00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:01.315
help accomplish
our own mission.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.917
Did you not get it
the first time?
We're telling you

to stay out of her
life!

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.255
We understood. But
that doesn't mean
we'll listen.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.331
That's enough!

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:21.235
