<i>Dearest Mamo, I bet</i>
<i>you're starting to</i>
<i>worry that all the boys</i>

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.481
<i>at school are trying to</i>
<i>ask me out 'cause</i>

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:57.651
<i>I'm too cute! But</i>
<i>don't you worry</i>
<i>about a thing.</i>

00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:01.455
<i>You'll always be</i>
<i>the one and only</i>
<i>person I love in this</i>

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.990
whole universe.

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.759
Miss you lots.
There. Done.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.195
[sighing]

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:11.398
<i>I still haven't</i>
<i>gotten a reply from</i>
<i>him. He did say</i>

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.534
<i>he'd be busy for a</i>
<i>while, but...</i>

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:13.901
Hey!

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:14.601
Uh?

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.904
Oh, Haruka!
Michiru!

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:19.673
We didn't expect to
run into you at the
library.

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:20.908
What are you
doing?

00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:22.309
Don't look!

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:25.245
Leave her alone. I
think it's pretty
obvious she's

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.314
been writing a love
letter to her
beloved.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:28.615
[giggling]

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:32.452
So, has Mamoru told
you how much he's
been liking America?

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.922
Huh? Um...

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:36.089
Something wrong?

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:40.127
Mm-mm!
Everything's been
great, actually!

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.000
<i>They'll worry if I tell</i>
<i>them I haven't gotten</i>
<i>a reply from him yet.</i>

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:48.468
Oh.

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.745
I can tell she's
hiding something,
can't you?

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:02.015
Yeah but it's
not really like
Bun-head to do that.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.684
It's concerning.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:11.191
<i>Friend or Foe? Star</i>
<i>Lights and the Sailor</i>
<i>Guardians.</i>

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:20.567
[playing guitar]

00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:22.269
Sailor Moon, huh.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.570
Huh?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.509
Is she friend or foe?

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:33.747
I can't really
explain it, but
sometimes...

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:38.652
I feel like... there
are moments when she
kind of resembles our

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:41.622
princess. Weird,
right?

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:44.324
They're two
completely different
people, Seiya. How

00:03:44.358 --> 00:03:47.127
dare you even mention
them in the same
breath.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.698
Okay. But, she
possesses power that
none of us have.

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.735
That doesn't change
things. It's still
not safe to consider

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:56.103
her an ally.

00:03:56.136 --> 00:03:58.472
Furthermore,
there's no way she
could ever resemble

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:00.040
our princess.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:04.778
But she could
possibly prove useful
to us at some point.

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.713
I'm afraid I beg to
differ.

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:21.361
<i>Mako, this is</i>
<i>incredible! [giggling]</i>

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:24.898
I can't believe our
school has it's own
strawberry garden!

00:04:24.932 --> 00:04:26.366
[chewing] Mm!

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.702
Don't go overboard,
Usagi. And if you see
any green ones,

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:33.307
don't pick them
yet. They still need
some time to ripen.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.376
I know. How about
we keep this our
little secret and eat

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.580
them all ourselves?
I'm willing to split
them fifty-fifty!

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:42.449
We can't do that.
We promised to bake
strawberry shortcake

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.818
with the girls after
school, remember?

00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:45.719
Huh?

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.221
What's wrong?

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:49.022
I think there might
be someone else in
the greenhouse with

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:50.691
us... that's weird?

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.694
<i>I was told the</i>
<i>Horticulture Club</i>
<i>would be out today.</i>

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:08.275
<i>Sailor Moon. Just</i>
<i>who are you?</i>

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:12.646
<i>I won't let her</i>
<i>die. I'll save her,</i>
<i>no matter what!</i>

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:17.985
<i>She wants to "save"</i>
<i>them? Only an</i>
<i>optimistic fool could</i>

00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:19.419
<i>say such nonsense.</i>

00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:23.257
<i>Someone who has never</i>
<i>seen real war.</i>

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.326
How oblivious. She
has no idea of the
horrible things

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.629
we've been through
to get to this point.

00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:36.103
Where is our
princess? Will we
ever find her?

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:38.338
What does it matter
if someone else is in
here?

00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:41.275
I heard a rumor that
someone's been stealing
flowers recently.

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:43.677
So, if that's true,
we've gotta catch
the thief.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.746
What?! But I'm
scared!

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:46.747
Shh!

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:48.348
[tripping]

00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:48.882
Mako!

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:50.751
[flailing]

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:52.386
[grunting]

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.157
Oh, hey! It's
you.

00:05:57.191 --> 00:05:59.426
And just when I
thought that I'd
finally found a place

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.728
where I could get a
little peace and
quiet.

00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:03.931
Oh... I'm sorry.

00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:06.567
No need to apologize.
It's not a big
deal.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.637
You okay, Mako?
Taiki? What're you
doing here?

00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:14.074
Fantastic. Another
noisy girl has
decided to show up.

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:16.743
I suppose that's
more than enough
reason for me to go

00:06:16.777 --> 00:06:18.011
and forfeit this
place to you.

00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:22.049
Huh? What happened?
You're bleeding.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.117
Oh, you mean this?

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:26.887
Are you alright? you
must have hurt
yourself on the rose

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.755
thorns. Let me help.

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.391
No, I'm fine,
really.

00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:32.159
I'll fix it!

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:35.162
There! You're all
better now!

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:40.400
I thank you. In
return, allow me to
recite a poem for you.

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:41.201
Huh?

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:50.777
O Rose, thou art
sick. The invisible
worm, That flies in

00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:55.549
the night In the
howling storm: Has
found out thy bed Of

00:06:55.582 --> 00:07:02.589
crimson joy: And
his dark secret love
Does thy life destroy.

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:04.992
Uhhhhh...

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:07.694
It's by William
Blake.

00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:09.796
Who's that? Ha!

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.865
His name kind of
rhymes with coffee
break!

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:12.633
Uhhh--

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:13.734
Huh?

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.836
We don't have any
coffee here, but
you're welcome to

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:17.504
join us for a
snack break if
you want!

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:21.742
Mako bakes a perfect
strawberry shortcake!
It's really yummy!

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.343
Uhh--

00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:25.179
<i>What is with this</i>
<i>girl?</i>

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:28.448
Oh no, did I say
something weird just
now?

00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:30.984
Usagi, the
"Blake" Taiki
mentioned is the name

00:07:31.018 --> 00:07:33.253
of a really famous
poet from London.

00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:37.224
London? Where's
that? Do they have
food there? If they

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:39.359
don't, then who
cares?

00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:40.561
Usagi.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:45.032
[laughing]
Thanks, but I think
I'll pass on the

00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:47.067
strawberry shortcake.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.170
[laughing]
Sorry.

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:53.207
Oh, by the way... If
I recall correctly,
you're in the

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.975
Cooking Club,
aren't you, Makoto?

00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:56.710
Huh? Yeah.

00:07:56.743 --> 00:08:00.247
If you don't mind,
I have a small favor
I'd like to ask of you.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.951
What do you need?
You're free to ask me
for favors too, Taiki!

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:05.319
Thanks, but no
thanks.

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:06.587
[groaning]

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.755
I'm scheduled to
make an appearance on
a cooking show later

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:11.058
and they requested
that I bring a
friend. I was

00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:13.660
wondering if you
would like to be the
one to join me.

00:08:13.694 --> 00:08:17.030
Seriously? Did
I actually just hear
you ask Mako if she

00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:18.866
wants to appear on TV
with you?!

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:21.335
Wow! That's cool!
How lucky!

00:08:21.368 --> 00:08:23.437
I've heard that
you're quite
skilled when it comes

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.106
to cooking, so I was
hoping you'd be willing
to help me out.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:29.376
Sure, it'd be my
pleasure to help.
So, is there any

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:31.812
particular dish you
had in mind to make
on the show?

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:34.748
It really doesn't
matter to me. That
strawberry-thing you

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:37.818
mentioned earlier
should work. After
all, you have plenty

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.219
of strawberries,
right?

00:08:39.253 --> 00:08:42.256
Well, yeah, but the
thing is, I promised
I would share them

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:43.790
with Rei and the
others, so--

00:08:43.824 --> 00:08:46.560
So, she's willing
to do it, but you
have to agree to one

00:08:46.593 --> 00:08:49.596
condition: Let me go
to the studio with
you guys so I can

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.731
watch the show being
filmed.

00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:52.466
That's not a
problem, is it?

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:53.934
Wait, really?

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:55.969
Oh, uh...
I don't know.

00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:57.971
I'll be Mako's
assistant! You
won't even know

00:08:58.005 --> 00:09:00.007
I'm there! Pretty
please?

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.242
Seems I don't
really have a choice.

00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:05.279
Fine, you can come.

00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:08.982
<i>Ah... What a</i>
<i>beautiful day it</i>
<i>is. It really makes</i>

00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:11.652

<i>here working.</i>

00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:13.587
<i>As much as I hate</i>
<i>having thoughts</i>
<i>like this,</i>

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.524

<i>in a huge</i>
<i>organizational wheel.</i>

00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:23.197
Well, I know that's
the case, but still.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.898
If this is all I'm
thinking about,

00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:27.267
then I must be losing
my motivation.

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:33.974
Hang on... what's
Master Chef?!

00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:37.978
<i>A cooking show?</i>
<i>Ooo! I like what I'm</i>

<i>check this Tetsuro</i>
<i>guy out.</i>

00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:41.448
Huh?

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:46.053
[phone ringing]

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.988
Nezu speaking.

00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:50.424
<i>Master Galaxia wishes</i>

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:51.358
[nervous groaning]

00:09:55.996 --> 00:09:59.266
You summoned me,
Master Galaxia?

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.169
<i>[chuckling]</i>

00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:03.504

[giggling]

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:12.279
So... Still no true
Star Seed?

00:10:12.312 --> 00:10:15.782
Uh, no. Though, I do
have a potential
target in mind.

00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:19.820
Again? How sure are
you that this one
possesses the true

00:10:19.853 --> 00:10:21.688
Star Seed, Sailor
Iron Mouse?

00:10:21.722 --> 00:10:24.558
I mean... well,
pretty sure?

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:27.594
[growling]

00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:29.496

[groaning]

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.037
Now then. Please,
don't keep me
waiting any longer.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.040
Yes. I understand.

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:43.010

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:08.135
<i>I think it's about</i>

<i>Tetsuro Yoshinogawa's</i>
<i>Let's Have Fun Eating</i>

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:14.508
It's on! This
is so exciting!

00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:17.911
<i>Today's special</i>
<i>guest is Ko Taiki,</i>
<i>from the popular teen</i>

00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:19.613
<i>idol group, The</i>
<i>Three Lights.</i>

00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:20.480
Hi there.

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:23.417
I don't know if you
girls heard, but I
guess Mako taught him

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.719
how to make the dish
he'll be showing off
on today's show.

00:11:25.752 --> 00:11:28.722
Oh wow, it really
seems like idols have
to be able to do

00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:30.257
everything, don't
they?

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.560
Mako's so lucky
though. I'm super
jealous that she gets

00:11:33.594 --> 00:11:35.662
to be on live TV with
Taiki like this...

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:38.999
<i>Also joining us is</i>
<i>his friend, Miss</i>
<i>Makoto Kino.</i>

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:42.736
It's so nice...
t-to be here.

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:44.705
Come on, Mako! You
can do it!

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:47.641
All right! Then
without further ado,
let's have Taiki

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:51.378
and Miss Kino get
started on their
delicious specialty!

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:54.815
The recipe they'll
be making is homemade
strawberry shortcake!

00:11:54.848 --> 00:11:57.784
Hang on, did he
just say homemade
strawberry shortcake?

00:11:57.818 --> 00:12:00.521
I thought Mako was
supposed to make that
strawberry shortcake

00:12:00.554 --> 00:12:02.923
with us so we could
have fun eating it
together!

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:05.292
What's the meaning
of this?!

00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:07.995
This isn't good.

00:12:08.028 --> 00:12:09.596
What else did you
expect?

00:12:12.666 --> 00:12:15.502
Let's start with the
sponge cake, shall
we?

00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:18.405
We'll need butter
at room temperature,
sugar, and a few

00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:21.141
large eggs. Three of
them to be exact.

00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:23.210
Would you mind
grabbing them for me?

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.745
Uh-sure.

00:12:24.778 --> 00:12:25.746
<i>First, we'll need--</i>

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.181
That's strange, they
were just here.

00:12:27.214 --> 00:12:30.717
Mako! Mako!! The eggs
are right behind all
that stuff!

00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:32.819
Ah! This is so
stressful!

00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:34.988
What am I gonna do?
We need those eggs.

00:12:35.022 --> 00:12:35.989
[gasping]

00:12:36.023 --> 00:12:38.192
[gagging]

00:12:38.225 --> 00:12:39.693
What's keeping
those eggs?

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:41.795
Three eggs,
coming up!

00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:44.064
Who let you on set?

00:12:44.898 --> 00:12:45.766
Oops.

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.367
[gasping]

00:12:48.535 --> 00:12:50.604
It's no problem at
all as long as you
mix it well!

00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:52.806
Oh boy.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.075
[sighing]

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:58.579
Hold on... Why is
Usagi suddenly
there, too?

00:12:58.612 --> 00:13:01.748
I think we're gonna
have to have a talk
with her after this.

00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:04.985
The next step is to
sift in the flour and
start mixing.

00:13:05.018 --> 00:13:06.520
Ooo! Let me!

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:09.089
[coughing]

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.424
[coughing] What is
she doing?!

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:13.293
Slow down, Usagi!
You're doing it too
fast!

00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:16.496
<i>Really? So, I should</i>
<i>be doing it more like</i>
<i>this then?</i>

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.999
Hey, Taiki, do you
think you could hold
the bowl for me?

00:13:19.032 --> 00:13:20.734
<i>Oh, sure.</i>

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:23.570
Next, you place the
mixed batter into a
preheated oven

00:13:23.604 --> 00:13:24.838
and start baking!

00:13:24.872 --> 00:13:27.207
Okay, time to go into
the oven now!

00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:29.209
Would you mind
telling me who you
are?

00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:31.245
Ready or not,
here it comes!

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:33.213
Ha!

00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:35.415
Now that I think
about it...

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:38.986
I knew it. Unopened
flour. So then that
means...

00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:43.657
[yelling]

00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:48.228
She used baking
powder instead of
flour.

00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:51.131
What the hell is
going on here?! The
entire show is ruined!

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:52.332
Cut to
commercial!

00:13:52.366 --> 00:13:54.001
We have to take care
of this quickly.

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:56.203
Prepare another
sponge cake!

00:13:56.236 --> 00:13:58.739
<i>Hm. Making such precise</i>
<i>decisions on the</i>

00:13:58.772 --> 00:14:00.707
spot. He really
is a master.

00:14:00.741 --> 00:14:03.844
No doubt about it.
I'm certain he's
the one who possesses

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:05.612
the true Star Seed.

00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:07.915
[grunting]

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:10.884
I don't get it,
Mako. I followed
instructions,

00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:12.152
so what
went wrong?

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.155
That wasn't flour
you sifted in, it
was baking powder.

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:17.124
What?! No wonder!

00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:21.995
[laughing]

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:24.731

filthy. Look.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.570
Look who's talking!
Yours is dirty too,
Taiki!

00:14:29.603 --> 00:14:30.337

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.506
<i>It's been</i>

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:35.042
<i>... that this girl has</i>
<i>made me laugh.</i>

00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:39.313
<i>How many years has it</i>
<i>been since I've laughed</i>
<i>at something this hard?</i>

00:14:40.147 --> 00:14:42.182
Would you look
at that?

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:44.985
Now there's a sight
you don't see every
day.

00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:46.720
No kidding.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.959
Man, I screwed up
big time, huh?

00:14:51.992 --> 00:14:53.427
Don't worry
about it.

00:14:54.595 --> 00:14:56.897
Mr. Yoshinogawa
covered up our
mistakes so it's fine.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.499
But you know, I think
the stunt you pulled
really caught the

00:14:59.533 --> 00:15:01.935
cast and crew off
guard. It was pretty
funny.

00:15:01.969 --> 00:15:05.339
She's right. I've
never seen anyone crash
a live broadcast.

00:15:05.372 --> 00:15:08.375
Oh, hey! When did
you-- I'm so sorry.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:11.812
Look, today's show
was fun. If you have
some time, you're

welcome to come
visit the set again.

see you soon.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:21.121
Did you hear that? Do
you think he was saying
I could be on TV again?

00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:23.490
Yeah. I don't
think that's really
what he meant.

00:20:21.555 --> 00:20:24.558
Hey. It looked like
you were having a lot
of fun today, Taiki.

00:20:24.591 --> 00:20:27.494
I have to admit,
it's kinda nice to
see you laughing so

00:20:27.528 --> 00:20:29.596
cheerfully again.

00:20:34.668 --> 00:20:38.205
Why did I save her
back there?
Especially when

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:41.575
it's still not
clear whether she's
a friend or foe.

00:20:41.608 --> 00:20:44.044
I don't think
I've never felt
this way before

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:47.681
today. So why now?

00:20:47.714 --> 00:20:51.518
Perhaps, it has
something to do
with that girl.

00:20:54.755 --> 00:20:57.224
Yum! This is so good!

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.927
Right?! And it's
amazing how things
taste even better

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.795
when someone else
is paying for it!

00:21:01.828 --> 00:21:02.930
[groaning]

00:21:02.963 --> 00:21:05.999
Man. There goes my
monthly allowance.

00:21:06.033 --> 00:21:08.135
I can help you out a
little if you need
it--

00:21:08.168 --> 00:21:11.038
Do not feel sorry
for her. This was
Usagi's fault and

00:21:11.071 --> 00:21:13.140
she needs to pay the
consequences.

00:21:13.173 --> 00:21:15.876
She's right! This
traitor gave Taiki
all the strawberries

00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:18.779
Mako was going to use
to make us her famous
shortcake, just so

00:21:18.812 --> 00:21:20.047
she could be on TV!

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.115
Uh, I think she's
already learned her
lesson,

00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:23.884
so you guys can
let it go now.

00:21:23.917 --> 00:21:26.653
[pouting]

00:21:33.827 --> 00:21:38.565
Do you feel that? A
new wave is approaching
Earth once again.

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:41.502
<i>Yeah. It could</i>
<i>possibly be the</i>
<i>biggest threat</i>

00:21:41.535 --> 00:21:43.003
<i>we've ever faced.</i>

00:21:43.036 --> 00:21:45.205
Do you think this
world will ever
know peace?

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:46.740
Or is there no
end to our battle?

00:21:46.773 --> 00:21:50.310
I don't care what
happens, as long as
I'm with you.

00:21:50.344 --> 00:21:51.478
Aw, Haruka.

00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:39.553
<i>Usagi, did you hear?!</i>
<i>The Three Lights and</i>
<i>Michiru are doing a</i>

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:40.621
<i>joint concert soon!</i>

00:23:40.654 --> 00:23:43.724
Yeah, but Haruka
seems to have an
issue with Seiya.

00:23:43.757 --> 00:23:45.859
<i>Really? Wait, you</i>
<i>don't think it's</i>
<i>because they're</i>

00:23:45.893 --> 00:23:47.294
<i>fighting over</i>
<i>Michiru, do you?!</i>

00:23:47.327 --> 00:23:49.196
I wish I could be as
popular!

00:23:49.229 --> 00:23:51.665
<i>Uh, hello? You're</i>
<i>already dating</i>
<i>Mamoru!</i>

00:23:51.698 --> 00:23:53.534
A girl can dream,
can't she?!

00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:56.970
Next time on Sailor
Stars, "Calling of
the Shining Stars:

00:23:57.004 --> 00:23:58.038
Enter Haruka and
Michiru."

00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:01.475
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
