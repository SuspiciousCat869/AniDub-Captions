00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:50.244
[gasps]

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.447
Stop it!

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:56.383
You fool.

00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:01.488
It's much too late for that. My
curse has already taken hold of
his heart.

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:05.392
Your voice no longer has any
hope of reaching him.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.194
[gasps]

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:11.598
By the coming dawn, this man
will be under my complete
control.

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:17.604
I'll be curious whether you can
find me before that happens,
Sailor Moon.

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:23.010
[evil laughter]

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.012
[gasps]

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:27.347
[gasps] What?
What's going on?!

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:28.015
[gasps]

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.451
[fearful screaming]

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:33.754
[wincing]

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:40.794
[gasps]

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.396
[fainting]

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.796
Chibi-Usa!

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.531
[gasps]

00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:46.133
Chibi-Usa, wake up!

00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:54.007
(Usagi) "Night of Destiny:
The Sailor Guardians' Ordeals."

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.757
A time paradox?

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:17.030
The future, Small Lady's future
in particular, is about to
experience a dramatic change.

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:19.132
What does that mean?

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:25.339
Basically, if we cannot figure
out a way to save the Prince
from being held by Nehalennia...

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.407
<i>(Setsuna) A future will be</i>
<i>created...</i>

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:31.478
<i>where the Prince and Princess</i>
<i>would have never joined in</i>
<i>matrimony.</i>

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:34.848
And in that future, Small Lady
will not have been born.

00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:35.983
[gasps]

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:42.456
An altered timeline?

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.857
That's not good at all.

00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:45.592
If what you say's true...

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:49.196
then it would explain
why Chibi-Usa's body was
starting to fade earlier.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.266
<i>(Setsuna) Yes. It was likely a</i>
<i>preliminary sign.</i>

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.735
I should have realized it much
sooner than this.

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:58.405
It never occurred to me that the
disturbance I've been sensing in
space and time...

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:00.440
could end up holding such great
meaning.

00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:01.175
[sighs]

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:04.745
Nehalennia's curse is powerful
enough to change the course of
history?

00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:09.583
[holding back tears]

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.419
[grunting]

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:13.220
Wait!

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:13.787
Hmph.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.222
It's a trap, you know.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.858
The one she's really
after, is you Usagi.

00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:22.129
I promise that we will find a
way to save the Prince from
Nehalennia's curse.

00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:25.666
But until then, you and Small
Lady must remain here.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.434
No! I'm going!

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:28.569
Usagi.

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:29.436
[sighs]

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:35.108
I have to. I don't want a
future without Mamo, or for
Chibi-Usa to vanish.

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:39.012
[sniffle] I can't just wait
around and do nothing!

00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:41.148
Hmm.

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:53.160
So I'm going! I have to save
Mamo from her!

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.075
She's transforming without
anyone's help!

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:10.377
Her emotions are causing
her energy to overflow!

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.445
[gasps]

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:20.587
[gasps] Hmph!

00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:22.222
Wait for me.

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.461
No! Usagi! [grunts]

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:35.135
She just flew away.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:40.107
So, then, is she really going
after Mamoru?

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:42.676
She can't do that alone!

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:46.079
Dammit. That girl's playing
right into Nehalennia's hands!

00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:49.216
Usagi, you idiot!

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:52.219
What are we waiting for? Let's
go after her.

00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:53.220
What?

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:56.156
All of us were born with a
mission.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.426
It's something that only we
Sailor Guardians are able to do.

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.595
That's right, how could I
forget?

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:06.033
An important mission that only
Sailor Guardians can fulfill.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.036
It's to protect our Princess!

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:10.504
I'm going too!

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.572
Small Lady!

00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:17.477
I am a Sailor Guardian after
all. I heard some of what Usagi
said and I agree.

00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:21.782
I miss Mamo. Let's bring him
back as soon as possible!

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:23.717
[chuckles]

00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:30.123
<i>(Setsuna) The sun is setting.</i>

00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:33.227
All right, this is it. Everyone
ready?

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.265
Whether we win or lose, tonight
seals our fate.

00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:42.536
We've got a whole night to get
it done! With that much time
you could even ace a test!

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:46.707
We don't know what trap
awaits us, and we may not even
come out alive.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.141
That won't stop us.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.645
We must protect the Prince and
Princess we serve under as
Sailor Guardians.

00:06:56.517 --> 00:07:00.521
And also free all of the
innocent people from
Nehalennia's curse.

00:07:04.892 --> 00:07:09.530
(Hotaru) We have to do this, to
<i>preserve everyone's future.</i>

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:14.601
All right. Let's go!

00:07:16.837 --> 00:07:20.207
Sailor Teleport!

00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:30.117
Good luck, Sailor Guardians.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.420
Please, find Usagi and
Mamoru.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.255
[running]

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:38.258
We're counting on you all to
save the Princess and Prince!

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:56.076
Where am I?

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:59.813
<i>(Nehalennia) Welcome to my</i>
<i>domain, Princess of the White</i>
<i>Moon.</i>

00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:01.048
Hmm. [gasps]

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:07.688
You really are quite foolish,
aren't you?

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:10.791
You knew that this was a trap,
and yet you still came.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:14.628
Is your love for him truly worth
putting yourself in danger?

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.496
Nehalennia!

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:22.870
I remember it well. That day
you were so quick to throw your
whole life away and for what?

00:08:22.903 --> 00:08:24.605
Just to save someone you love?

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:41.588
However, miracles only occur
but once.

00:08:41.622 --> 00:08:44.091
Give Mamo back! Right now!

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:46.827
[chuckles] Those eyes.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:52.132
<i>(Nehalennia) It pleases me to</i>
see them filled with such hatred
<i>and sadness.</i>

00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:56.270
Wait!

00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:58.572
[defeated sigh]

00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:01.642
[grunting]

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:02.509
What the?

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:09.650
<i>(Nehalennia) Suffer. There's</i>
nothing I want more than to see
<i>your pain.</i>

00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:26.800
<i>(Nehalennia) Time is wasting,</i>
<i>Princess of the White Moon.</i>

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:31.305
If you're unable to reach me by
sunrise to undo the curse I've
placed upon him...

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:37.044
Then you'll have doomed him to
be tortured by horrible
nightmares for all of eternity.

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:47.454
Now, I anxiously await you. If
you want the man you love back,
you should act quickly.

00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:57.331
<i>(Nehalennia) It can't be.</i>

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.401
[grunts]

00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:08.075
[gasps]

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.410
<i>I'm starting to fade again.</i>

00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:12.446
[laughing]

00:10:14.014 --> 00:10:19.987
<i>(Chibi Moon) No! That won't</i>
happen. You won't let it, right?
<i>Usagi? Mamo?</i>

00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:22.489
[sighs]

00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:26.026
Huh?

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:27.394
Everything will be fine.

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:30.764
Just have faith in the Prince
and Princess, Chibi-Usa.

00:10:31.498 --> 00:10:34.134
Yeah. Thanks, Hotaru.

00:10:34.668 --> 00:10:36.003
Curse them!

00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:40.040
The Sailor Guardians followed
the Princess of the White Moon
all the way to my domain!

00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:44.578
Fine, then! I'll just take them
from her. All of her loved ones
will be mine!

00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:45.579
[grunts]

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:54.321
<i>(Sailor Mars) What's that?</i>

00:10:56.623 --> 00:10:57.724
<i>(Sailor Neptune) Look out!</i>

00:10:57.758 --> 00:10:58.659
We have to move!

00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:00.227
No! Don't let go!

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:04.998
<i>(Sailor Uranus) We can't split</i>
<i>up. That's what Nehalennia</i>
<i>wants!</i>

00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:20.714
[screams]

00:11:29.923 --> 00:11:32.359
[grunts] What the?

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:49.109
Where am I?

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:56.083
Who's there?!

00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:04.191
[sighs]

00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:33.954
Sailor Moon!

00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:36.123
Mamoru!

00:12:36.857 --> 00:12:38.025
Any luck?

00:12:39.126 --> 00:12:40.227
I've been trying to locate them
using my computer...

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:42.362
but I'm not picking up signs of
either of them.

00:12:44.498 --> 00:12:45.732
That's not good.

00:12:52.372 --> 00:12:55.576
I'm worried about how all the
others are doing, too.

00:12:55.609 --> 00:12:58.512
Let's go over to that hill and
get to higher ground.

00:12:58.545 --> 00:12:59.646
Right!

00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:05.786
<i>Look at her.</i>

00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:08.055
(Sailor Mercury) She's so fast.

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:10.190
<i>I can't keep up.</i>

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:21.335
Hey, Ami! Going home already?

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:24.204
Stay a little bit longer and
practice basketball with us!

00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:26.673
We've gotta get good for the
tournament, right?

00:13:26.707 --> 00:13:27.708
[giggles]

00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:29.176
<i>(Friend) She can't stay.</i>

00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:32.112
You see, Ami goes to a lot of
cram schools every day...

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:35.249
and she's way too busy to waste
time playing basketball.

00:13:35.282 --> 00:13:36.717
Whoa!

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.785
Sorry, we didn't know.

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:40.521
Maybe next year!

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:49.029
Come on now, pick up the pace!

00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:51.431
Sorry! [panting]

00:13:52.766 --> 00:13:54.768
<i>Something feels different.</i>

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:57.171
Is it because I'm mirroring her
<i>pace?</i>

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:09.216
<i>Oh, I see now. So, that must</i>
mean she was always matching her
<i>pace with mine.</i>

00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:17.925
[panting] What is all this?

00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.126
[exhales]

00:14:24.464 --> 00:14:25.499
[sighs]

00:14:27.568 --> 00:14:30.404
<i>(Sailor Mercury) No way.</i>

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:33.574
How can that be? This whole
space is distorted!

00:14:33.607 --> 00:14:37.444
Seriously? We need to find
a way out of here and fast.

00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:38.212
Please, wait!

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:39.179
What?

00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:42.716
Something about this makes
me feel like the more we
struggle...

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:45.586
the more entangled we'll become
in Nehalennia's trap.

00:14:45.619 --> 00:14:48.488
Until we figure out what's going
on, we need to be careful.

00:14:48.522 --> 00:14:50.891
This might be her way of slowing
us down.

00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:55.362
So are you suggesting that we
stand around here doing nothing
but twiddle our thumbs?

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.498
We don't have that kind of time
right now.

00:14:58.532 --> 00:14:59.299
Yeah, but..

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:00.868
<i>(Nehalennia) I almost had you.</i>

00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:02.069
[gasps]

00:15:03.837 --> 00:15:08.442
(Nehalennia) I was going to seal
<i>you within this maze and leave</i>
<i>you to die miserably.</i>

00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:11.545
<i>But it seems you saw</i>
<i>through my plan.</i>

00:15:15.682 --> 00:15:17.518
<i>(Sailor Mercury) Nehalennia!</i>

00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:20.521
Looks like her highness has
graced us with her presence.

00:15:20.554 --> 00:15:24.658
Sorry, but we're not here to
become playthings for your
little toy-box.

00:15:25.692 --> 00:15:27.194
[charging attack]

00:15:28.562 --> 00:15:29.730

[evil laugh]

00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:32.766
[gasp]

00:15:34.168 --> 00:15:38.438
Mercury Aqua Rhapsody!

00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:44.311

[screams]

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:47.080
Sailor Mercury! [grunts]

00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:50.751
[gasps] Are you okay?

00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:52.553
Hah!

00:15:58.592 --> 00:15:59.660
Hmph!

00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:05.165
Give it up. You'll never be able
to defeat me when your powers
can't even...

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:08.402
so much a scratch a single
strand of my hair.

00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:09.236
Oh yeah?

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:11.805
Hold on! Don't attack her yet!

00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:14.141
But if we don't, we'll be
killed!

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:20.180
World Shaking!

00:16:25.185 --> 00:16:25.752
Hmm!

00:16:28.388 --> 00:16:30.724
[gasps] Ahh!

00:16:30.757 --> 00:16:31.592
[grunts]

00:16:32.226 --> 00:16:34.461
Oh no, Sailor Uranus!

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:37.731
[laughing]

00:16:38.532 --> 00:16:40.434
Foolish people of the
White Moon.

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:44.638
Prepare to suffer as I kill you
one after the other.

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:50.043
<i>Her power is too great. We</i>
<i>can't win like this!</i>

00:16:55.349 --> 00:16:58.552
<i>(Friend) So, how does it work,</i>
<i>Ami?</i>

00:16:58.585 --> 00:17:02.289
Oh, wow! Neat! Cool!

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:08.161
<i>That's right. I may not be</i>
<i>strong like Uranus, but I have</i>
<i>my own way of fighting.</i>

00:17:11.498 --> 00:17:15.536
<i>But first, there's something I</i>
<i>need to confirm.</i>

00:17:24.011 --> 00:17:25.412
It's that look.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.850
<i>(Nehalennia) That disgusting</i>
<i>look of determination.</i>

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:33.086
Don't you dare look at me with
those eyes!

00:17:37.858 --> 00:17:44.031
[grunting]

00:17:45.532 --> 00:17:46.733
<i>What is she doing?</i>

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:50.437
<i>(Sailor Uranus) Why isn't she</i>
<i>fighting back?</i>

00:17:53.273 --> 00:17:55.309
You need to fight, Sailor
Mercury!

00:17:55.342 --> 00:17:58.145
How can you call yourself a
Sailor Guardian if you don't?

00:17:58.178 --> 00:18:01.882
I know but I don't have all
the data just yet.

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.283
What?

00:18:05.586 --> 00:18:08.121
[grunts]

00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:13.260
(Ami) Put on Defensive pressure!

00:18:14.361 --> 00:18:15.362
<i>Nice cut!</i>

00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:17.865
<i>Now, pass the ball!</i>

00:18:17.898 --> 00:18:19.766
<i>And Shoot!</i>

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.370
[basketball game noise]

00:18:24.905 --> 00:18:28.442
We won! We did it! Yeah!
[giggling]

00:18:28.475 --> 00:18:31.478
And it's all thanks to the game
plan Ami came up with!

00:18:31.512 --> 00:18:34.081
<i>Ami! [giggles]</i>

00:18:38.852 --> 00:18:40.621
[grunts]

00:18:42.155 --> 00:18:45.592
This is all I'm good at. It may
not be much, but it's my way of
<i>fighting!</i>

00:18:48.262 --> 00:18:49.229
Uh?!

00:18:50.831 --> 00:18:52.132
<i>(Sailor Mercury) Uranus!</i>

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:54.568
I can't hold out that long, so
make it quick.

00:18:54.868 --> 00:18:55.736
Hmph!

00:19:06.446 --> 00:19:07.347
Up there!

00:19:07.781 --> 00:19:08.982
Huh?

00:19:13.654 --> 00:19:17.257
World Shaking!

00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:27.668
[laughing]

00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:28.669
Hmph!

[death scream]

00:19:34.374 --> 00:19:35.976
An illusion?

00:19:36.877 --> 00:19:39.146
But, how did you figure it out?

00:19:40.948 --> 00:19:44.451
Her hair wasn't flowing in the
wind. I managed to notice it
after you pulled me to safety.

00:19:47.321 --> 00:19:50.357
It took a bit longer than I
thought to find the real
presence.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.961
You've got a unique way of
fighting, Mercury, that's for
sure.

00:19:53.994 --> 00:19:56.163
It's so different from
mine.

00:19:56.196 --> 00:20:01.468
No, it's not. It's quite
similar. We're both fighting in
order to bring Usagi back.

00:20:02.469 --> 00:20:03.570
Good point.

00:20:03.604 --> 00:20:04.204

Uh!

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:03.130
Well, which is it?

00:21:03.163 --> 00:21:07.267
Uh! We'll go your way.

00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:09.570
Good choice, because we have no
time to waste.

00:21:09.603 --> 00:21:14.708
Aw, man. You know, if it were
Usagi, she probably would have
just listened to me.

00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:18.312
You two are close, huh? Quite
similar to Uranus and me.

00:21:20.013 --> 00:21:24.318
Hmm. I doubt anyone could be
that close. [sighs]

00:21:24.651 --> 00:21:25.485
Hm!

save him, before it's too late!
