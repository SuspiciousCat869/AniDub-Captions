Everything turned out fine!

Why would you do something so
reckless?

00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:20.534
I don't have it in me to run
away and leave a friend behind.

This is an order from your
leader!

The two of us are gonna

Hmm.

Oh I won't let you off easily.
I'm going to torture you until

Usagi, wake up!

00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:49.857
Snap out of it! We've gotta get
out of here!

[sighing blankly]

00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:57.564
(Nehalennia) You're wasting your

00:14:57.598 --> 00:15:01.401
[grunts] Return her to normal!
Right now!

00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:03.871
You have had nightmares
before, haven't you?

00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:04.404
What?

00:15:05.873 --> 00:15:08.175
Usually one would wake up on
their own if they were having a
bad dream.

00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:11.578
Yet, she remained asleep, even
after you called to her.

00:15:11.612 --> 00:15:15.449
So, I'd say she doesn't plan on
leaving her sweet dream any time
soon.

00:15:15.482 --> 00:15:18.051

This is my Palace of Nightmares.
The Kingdom of Darkness I
previously ruled as Queen!

00:16:53.213 --> 00:16:55.449
Haven't you heard of me?

00:16:55.482 --> 00:17:01.455
Using the control I had over the
Darkness, I ruled this kingdom
long ago.

00:17:02.256 --> 00:17:05.893
So this place is your home,
then?

00:17:05.926 --> 00:17:07.861
I tried to take the world of
light...

00:17:07.895 --> 00:17:11.465
but the Queen of the White Moon
subdued me and sealed me away.

00:17:11.498 --> 00:17:14.668
However, within the Darkness, I
am invincible!

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.570

[groaning]

00:17:20.674 --> 00:17:25.145
The light of the White Moon is
incapable of reaching this
Darkness.

00:17:25.179 --> 00:17:28.815
Even if all the Sailor Guardians
were to face me at once...

00:17:28.849 --> 00:17:31.718
you would never be able to
defeat me here.

<i>(Nehalennia) Now, to finally</i>

[groans]

00:17:46.366 --> 00:17:49.469
How foolish. Are you really
going to die for her?

00:17:49.503 --> 00:17:50.170
Hm?

00:17:51.305 --> 00:17:53.941
Is she even someone worth
protecting at this point?

00:17:53.974 --> 00:17:58.078
She's lost in a dream and has
forgotten everything, including
who you are.

00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:59.613
You don't get it, huh?

00:17:59.646 --> 00:18:03.050
Usagi may be a bit clumsy and a
crybaby at times...

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:07.087
But she always manages to
brighten up lives of everyone
she meets.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.122
Just like the gentle
light of the Moon.

00:18:09.156 --> 00:18:11.859
<i>(Sailor Jupiter) On top of all</i>
<i>of that...</i>

00:18:11.892 --> 00:18:18.065
She never hesitates to help
others, even if it means
sacrificing herself to do so!

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:20.601
That's the kind of person she
is.

00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:44.758
Usagi is someone each of us
loves with all our hearts!

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:48.629
Nehalennia, haven't you ever
had a friend like that before?

00:18:48.662 --> 00:18:51.498
Uh! [seething]

00:18:51.532 --> 00:18:52.633

[groaning]

00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:33.140
A friend? What nonsense. I have
no need for something so
useless!

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:37.811
But since you feel so strongly,
let me seal you away with your
precious friends.

00:19:37.845 --> 00:19:40.180
Wake up, Usagi.

00:19:40.781 --> 00:19:42.249
You have to.

00:19:57.297 --> 00:19:58.332
A rose.

00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:02.569

Nehalennia!

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.264
I never thought that you'd
awaken from my nightmare.

00:20:30.297 --> 00:20:32.733
But can you make it to my
palace?

00:20:32.766 --> 00:20:36.336
Will you be able to save your
beloved Prince before it's too
late?

Mamo, please, wait for me!

Just how stupid can that girl
be?

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:21.215
I hope you die a gruesome death,
being completely ripped apart by
those thorns.

00:21:21.248 --> 00:21:26.186
I'm looking forward to feasting
my eyes on all the blood that's
sure to flow out of you.

<i>(Chibi Moon) That's enough!</i>

[gasps] It's you two!

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:36.129
Your actions are unforgivable!
How dare you torture two people

going to vanish from this world!
