00:01:58.585 --> 00:01:59.520
What is it?

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:04.024
Is it true? I hear the Three
Lights have the whole day off
tomorrow.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.693
[taken aback] Who told you
that?!

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:11.698
Let's just say, you probably
shouldn't underestimate my
network of sources.

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:15.469
We went to great lengths to get
that day off, you know.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.804
Well, how 'bout you spend it
watching...

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:18.539
...a movie?

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:18.972
No.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.341
I'd much rather focus on
composing lyrics tomorrow.

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.511
Lyrics? Wow, how cool! Do you
mind if I help you?

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:28.448
Not a chance. I'd like to do it
in peace... By myself.

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:29.483
Right. Of course...

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:32.719
Tsk!

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:34.188
It was a good try...

00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:36.590
I'll see the movie with you. If
you want.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:37.591
What?! No way!

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.726
I'd hate for the tickets to go
to waste.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.496
So, what's the movie called
anyway?

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.365
It's called "The Forbidden Love
of Grown-Ups".

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.233
[taken aback]

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:46.800
Uh...

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:47.401
What?

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:50.437
If Taiki can't go, then I'll
just ask Yaten!

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:51.638
Oh, Yaten!

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.141
Uhhh...

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.511
If he turns you down, I'm still
avaliable to go!

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.982
Mako. If that happens...

00:03:02.783 --> 00:03:04.017
[gasp]

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:09.556
Will you buy these for retail
price?

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:11.391
Seriously?

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:13.160
Come on... Not cool.

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:23.303
[humming]

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:25.973
Hey!

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:26.974
Huh?

00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:29.977
I'm free tomorrow. We should
hang out.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.145
Wha-?! Are you for real?!

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:34.014
Pretty sure you're not busy.

00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:38.652
Ah! Excuse you! For your
information, after I get out of
bed, I have to eat
breakfast...

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:44.358
catch up on my TV shows, eat
second breakfast, read a few
chapters of manga- what else is
there- I gotta eat sweets...

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:47.027
play video games, and do lots of
other importnat stuff like...

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.595
Cool, so you're
free then.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.496
[growl]

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.833
I'll see you at Ichinohashi Park
at eleven.

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:56.537
Wait a second! I didn't agree to
that!

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.673
Seiya! [grumble]

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:01.542
Oh wow...

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:02.976
[gasp] A-Ami...!

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:08.015
Hi, Usagi... You don't need to
worry. I didn't actually hear
anything just now, I swear.

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:09.316
See ya... [chuckle]

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:13.153
Uh, Thanks... I guess?

You can run, but you can't hide.

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:46.887
This is bad. Really, really bad.
If I don't deliver the true Star
Seed first thing Monday morning,
then-

Ah! Wha-?! Ahhh!

Woah!

00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:05.472
Ahhh!

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.644

Ah! What have I done? I hung up
on her!

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:39.640
Huh? It's that popular teen idol
group, the Three Lights...

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:43.310
Wait... I've got it!

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.246
It's perfect! Why didn't I
realize it sooner?!

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.480

You're... cho...king...me...

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:56.523
What's taking him so long?! He's
the one who set the time and
place for us to meet!

00:05:56.557 --> 00:06:03.897
Maybe he's pulling a prank on
you. I mean, why else would
Seiya ask someone like you to go
on a date? [smirk]

00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:04.565
A date...?

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.467
Wait, what date?! Who? Where?!
Huh?! Wha-?! Huh?!

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.103
Uh...

00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:15.509
I didn't expect to see you here,

(USAGI) <i>Haruka!</i>

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.815
Don't you know? The only things
you'll find in a park on a
Sunday are couples on a date and
pigeons.

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:22.649
Pigeons?

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:24.551
You on a date?

00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:25.185
Well?

00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:30.657
Uh... Actually! Seiya asked if
I'd hang out with him today,
that's all.

00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:32.326
Seiya?

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:33.594
[grunt]

00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:37.030
Seems that guy goes after any
woman he can get his hands on.

00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:37.531
(USAGI) <i>Huh...?</i>

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:42.503
Try not to let your guard down
around him. It's too late once
the wolf devours you, kitten.

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:46.039
[laughing] We don't have that
kind of relationship!

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:49.376
Haruka tends to get a bit
jealous of popular boys.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.977
No...

00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:52.145
You sure? Bye Usagi.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.214
That hurts!

00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:54.681
Does it?

00:06:55.516 --> 00:06:57.017
Yeah, you're being a little too
rough.

00:06:58.085 --> 00:06:59.620
Oh, am I? I'll be more gentle
once we're alone...

00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:02.589
Ehhh... They're always just a
little too open.

00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:06.093
So, is Seiya really as bad as
Haruka thinks he is?

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:07.294
How should I know?

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:09.229
Well, now it's got me worried.

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:12.332
I feel like I should go home at
this rate. He's still not here!

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:12.499
[giggles]

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.034
That's probabably a good idea.

Ha... Ow!

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:15.302

Hey, now... C'mon. There's no
need to cry like that.

Heh... go get 'em!

00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:47.835
Look, he's here.

00:07:47.868 --> 00:07:49.503
Huh? [grunt]

00:07:50.037 --> 00:07:51.405
Were you waiting long?

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.843
Are you for real right now?! Why
did you even make me come here
if you-

00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:56.476
Whoa!

00:07:57.244 --> 00:07:58.979

Aren't you gonna do that thing,
too?

00:08:22.703 --> 00:08:23.470

not even here now, so stop
bothering me!

Who was it?

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:44.491
They never gave their name.

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:49.162
While that call does have me
pretty worried, I'm more
concerned about your phone
etiquette.

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:54.635
Who the heck taught him how to
answer the phone? Kids these
days have no manners.

00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:59.873

wasn't a complete waste.

Yeah right. Get your own,

Figures...

00:11:26.153 --> 00:11:30.591
Wouldn't there be a huge scandal
if someone took a photo of us
together?

"Teen idol Seiya has a new
girlfriend!" Stuff like that!

00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:36.396
Wouldn't bother me, to be
honest.

Huh?

00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:42.236
Oh yeah. That's right. I forgot
you'd go for just about any
girl.

one bit.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:49.476
Didn't you say your boyfriend is
living overseas, Bun-head?

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:56.250
Yeah... I write Mamo a letter
every day so he knows what I'm
up to while we're living so far
apart.

00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:59.720
But I still haven't gotten a
single reply back from him...

00:11:59.753 --> 00:12:03.190
<i>I'm guessing he's really busy</i>
<i>with his university research.</i>

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:05.626
(SEIYA) <i>He sounds like a jerk.</i>

00:12:05.659 --> 00:12:08.395
You sure he's not toying with
<i>your feelings?</i>

00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:10.264
He wouldn't do that.

00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:11.498
Huh?

00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:17.304
I know he wouldn't. 'Cause he's
always thinking of me.

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:23.010
Sorry... [gasp]

00:12:31.652 --> 00:12:32.653
<i>Princess...</i>

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.600
Hmph. Come on, cheer up. How
'bout I take you somewhere fun?

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:48.302
Huh? Really?

00:12:49.403 --> 00:12:50.304
Just don't tell.

00:12:56.243 --> 00:13:00.113
Never underestimate a TV
producer's network of sources...

00:13:00.147 --> 00:13:04.985
Finding out which club the Three
Lights come to on their day off
was a total walk in the park.

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:08.989
That's him!

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.558
We'll be using
that room, Bob.

00:13:11.592 --> 00:13:12.326
No problem.

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:13.794
Follow me.

00:13:13.827 --> 00:13:15.529
Oh. Sure.

00:13:15.562 --> 00:13:17.397
Hey, isn't that Usagi?

00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:18.665
His taste sucks.

00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:21.969
Well, it doesn't look like it's
anything too serious as of yet.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.642
Now then... Hm?

00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:34.748
<i>What do I do?! It's probably</i>
not a good idea to be all alone
<i>with him in this room...</i>

00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:38.151
It's too late
once the wolf
devours you, kitten.

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:41.655
[panicking]

00:13:42.589 --> 00:13:43.323
What's wrong?

00:13:43.624 --> 00:13:44.658
Mmmm...

00:13:45.592 --> 00:13:47.327
You don't... want a drink?

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.797
Huh?! [gasp]

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:52.866
What're you so nervous about,
Bun-head?

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.301
[nervous laugh]

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.303
Oh, this must be your first
time.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.638
[gasp]

00:13:58.739 --> 00:14:01.408
It'll be fine. I'll make sure to
lead you through it.

00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:02.543
[speechless]

00:14:02.576 --> 00:14:04.845
<i>Uh oh, I lost my voice...</i>

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:07.381
I'll show you the time of your
life.

00:14:07.414 --> 00:14:07.981
[speechless]

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.153
Come on, Usagi! Speak! You have
<i>to remind him that your heart</i>
<i>already belongs to Mamo!</i>

00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:16.190
<i>I love him... And only him!</i>

00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:16.657
[gasp]

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:18.992
[scared squeal]

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:22.663
See? Isn't this great?!

00:14:24.031 --> 00:14:26.200
So you were talking about
dancing...

00:14:26.233 --> 00:14:27.534
Did you say something?

00:14:27.568 --> 00:14:29.970
Nope! Just dancing!

00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:32.139
[screaming]

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:33.140
Huh?!

00:14:33.807 --> 00:14:34.641
What the...?

00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:37.144
I'm hoping this is just a power
outage.

00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:40.514
[chuckle]

00:14:43.217 --> 00:14:43.984
[gasp]

00:14:50.858 --> 00:14:53.160
Don't worry. Everything's
okay.

00:14:53.527 --> 00:14:54.494
[gasp]

00:14:56.163 --> 00:14:59.666
I feel so safe right now... but
<i>why?</i>

00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:08.509
<i>Don't worry, Usako...</i>
<i>Everything's okay now.</i>

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.311
Oh, Mamo...

00:15:14.648 --> 00:15:16.683
<i>I'm always here for you.</i>

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:28.662
<i>It almost feels the same as</i>
<i>Mamo's warmth... the scent is</i>
<i>just different. I'm so</i>
<i>confused...</i>

00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:36.270
I still feel a gentleness... But
<i>it's not Mamo's...</i>

00:15:36.303 --> 00:15:42.476
(CHUKO) <i>Chu! Don't even try to</i>
escape! I've come for your Star
Seed, Seiya, and I'm not leaving
<i>until I get it!</i>

00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:44.144
[chuckle]

00:15:45.479 --> 00:15:45.712
[gasp]

00:15:45.746 --> 00:15:46.547
Run.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.314
But...

00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:47.848
Just go!

00:15:47.881 --> 00:15:48.582
Right...

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:49.783
[chuckle]

00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:50.984
I need to transform!

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.154
[grunt]

00:15:55.255 --> 00:15:58.492
Now, give me your Star Seed!
[grunt]

00:16:06.066 --> 00:16:10.137
Please let this be the true Star
Seed, so I can deliver it in the
morning...

00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:12.472
Where'd he go?!

00:16:13.607 --> 00:16:14.641
(SEIYA) <i>You can't get me. Not in</i>
<i>a million years!</i>

00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:20.314
Fighter Star Power Make Up!

00:16:33.727 --> 00:16:34.494
Ah!

00:16:39.132 --> 00:16:49.476
The wandering shooting star that
cuts through darkness... I am
Sailor Star Fighter! Stage on!

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.814
No one told me you were a Sailor
Guardian! This ruins everything!

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:55.482
Too bad for you, I guess.

00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:57.985
It's over. Perhaps you should
give up.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.556
Listen, I don't have time to
watch you three act so cool.
I've got important things I need
to do!

00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:03.624
(USAGI) <i>Hold it right there!</i>

00:17:03.657 --> 00:17:03.991
Huh?

00:17:05.659 --> 00:17:09.596
How dare you ruin everyone's
favorite teen idol's day off!
Such an act is unforgivable!

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.330
So uh...

00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:11.665
(USAGI) <i>I am the Pretty</i>
<i>Guardian...</i>

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:12.666
Like I was saying...

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:14.968
(USAGI) ...who fights for love
and for justice!

00:17:15.936 --> 00:17:17.771
I really don't have time for
this, y'know...

00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:18.972
(USAGI) <i>I am Sailor Moon!</i>

00:17:20.007 --> 00:17:21.508
<i>And in the name of the Moon,</i>
<i>I'll punish you!</i>

00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:23.477
...Would someone please listen
to me?!

00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:28.749
Enough! Not a single one of you
has any idea what I'm going
through right now, okay?!

00:17:28.782 --> 00:17:29.716
So, c'mon! Let's ...

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.717
(USAGI) <i>Time out!</i>

00:17:30.751 --> 00:17:31.318
Huh?

00:17:32.452 --> 00:17:35.489
[gasp] This brooch belongs to
Seiya...

00:17:35.822 --> 00:17:36.657
Huh?!

00:17:37.624 --> 00:17:38.659
[gasp]

00:17:40.961 --> 00:17:43.964
Where's Seiya? What've you done
with him?

00:17:43.997 --> 00:17:46.400
<i>How does she know about that</i>
<i>brooch?</i>

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:48.969
<i>You didn't... turn him into a</i>
<i>Phage, did you?</i>

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.304
[gasp]

00:17:51.004 --> 00:17:53.106
Please! Tell me! Where is he?!

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.310
[touched sigh] Don't worry.
He's safe.

00:17:57.477 --> 00:17:58.312
Really?

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:00.981
(SEIYA) Yes, You have my word.

00:18:02.583 --> 00:18:08.422
[laughing] This is too perfect!
You actually have no idea, do
you? But I do!

00:18:08.455 --> 00:18:14.161
Hmmm. So then, wanna know
the truth? About Seiya's big
secret?

00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:19.600
Star Serious Laser!

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:20.334
Ahhh!

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:23.637
[grunt]

00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:30.143
[chuckle] Well, if you don't
want me to tell her, then you'd
better hand over your Star
Seeds.

00:18:30.711 --> 00:18:31.645
Ahhh!

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.320
[panicking]

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:50.130
[panicking]

00:19:01.008 --> 00:19:06.813
Hi! Thank you so much for your
call today! This is Sailor Iron
Mouse, how may I be of service?

00:19:06.847 --> 00:19:10.217
(GALAXIA) <i>You've failed me for</i>
<i>the last time, Sailor Iron</i>
<i>Mouse!</i>

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.319
Ahhh!

00:19:12.786 --> 00:19:13.654
[gasps]

00:19:13.687 --> 00:19:14.488
What?!

00:19:15.756 --> 00:19:19.459
M-Master Galaxia! Is this about
me hanging up on you earlier?!

00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:21.361
(GALAXIA) <i>I have no further use</i>
<i>for you.</i>

00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:25.165
No, I'm begging you! Please
forgive me! [quivering]

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.301
[gasps]

00:19:29.403 --> 00:19:34.975
Ahhh! Don't do it! Please, don't
take away my bracelets!

00:19:39.313 --> 00:19:40.047
Ahhh!

00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:44.184
Hey, I just had a great idea!
I'm gonna tell you a riddle and
if you can't solve it...

00:19:44.218 --> 00:19:46.386
<i>then how about you forget all</i>
<i>this and forgive me?</i>

00:19:48.222 --> 00:19:51.425
Okay, it walks on four legs in
the morning, two legs at noon
and three legs in the evening.

00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:54.161
Well, did you figure it out? Or
<i>did I stump you?!</i>

00:19:54.828 --> 00:19:59.099
Ahhh!

00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:03.303
She vanished!

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:11.478
This whole Galaxy belongs to me,
Sailor Galaxia. And if you don't
want to end up like her, then
stay out of my way.

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:17.317
Galaxia...

00:20:18.619 --> 00:20:20.554
Our enemy and the one
responsible for destroying our
world.

00:20:20.587 --> 00:20:21.154
[gasp]

00:20:22.122 --> 00:20:23.991
You should be careful of her,
Sailor Moon.

00:20:26.126 --> 00:20:28.862
You three will fight alongside
us, won't you? If we work
together, I know that we can
defeat any enemy...

00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:29.997
We're not teaming up.

00:20:31.265 --> 00:20:33.534
(TAIKI) We didn't come here in
order to protect this planet.

00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:36.470
(YATEN) Yeah, that's your job,
so handle it yourself.

00:20:37.371 --> 00:20:38.305
No, wait!

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:43.143
[sigh]

00:20:55.822 --> 00:20:56.690
Seiya...

00:20:58.158 --> 00:20:59.326
(SEIYA) <i>Hey, Bun-head...</i>

00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:00.494
[gasp]

00:21:04.865 --> 00:21:05.999
[gasp]

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:11.305
Where were you, Seiya?! I was
worried sick about you!

00:21:12.506 --> 00:21:13.473
Yeah, sorry.

00:21:14.608 --> 00:21:17.377
I need more than that. You
didn't get hurt, did you?

00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:18.178
Nah.

00:21:18.612 --> 00:21:19.346
Thank goodness.

00:21:19.379 --> 00:21:21.114
You can keep that if you want.

00:21:21.148 --> 00:21:21.315
Huh?

00:21:22.516 --> 00:21:24.484
It's my way of saying thanks
for keeping me company today.

00:21:24.918 --> 00:21:27.321
Ohhh. Thank you.

00:21:30.991 --> 00:21:32.025
What's wrong?

00:21:32.693 --> 00:21:34.494
Oh... It's nothing.

00:21:35.662 --> 00:21:37.664
<i>Nah... She couldn't be.</i>

00:21:39.666 --> 00:21:40.968
