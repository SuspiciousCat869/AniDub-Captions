00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:11.912
(Usagi) My dearest Mamo. You'll
<i>never guess what's been</i>
<i>happening over here.</i>

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.615
We suddenly have a new addition
<i>to our family!</i>

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:18.986
The girls think she might be our
<i>second child, but Setsuna says</i>
<i>that's not possible.</i>

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.491
<i>If that wasn't crazy enough,</i>
<i>two new enemies appeared! I'm</i>
<i>in some serious trouble!</i>

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:15.035
<i>Dearest Mamo, this is the</i>
thirtieth letter I've written to
<i>you.</i>

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.371
<i>I really hope you're doing</i>
<i>okay.</i>

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:22.976
There's been so much going on
in my life lately.

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:31.585
[sighs]

00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:33.587
[embarrassed]

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.358
Why the heck am I even thinking
about that guy, anyway? Uh?

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.996
Mamo. I really miss you.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.165
<i>(Usagi) "Invaders from Outer</i>
<i>Space: The Coming of Siren."</i>

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.239
My Anima Mates.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.078
Yes, Master Galaxia. We have
arrived.

00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:38.752
<i>(Karasuma) We are pleased to</i>
inform you that we've conquered
<i>roughly 80% of the galaxy.</i>

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:43.390
(Aya) And our collection of true
<i>Star Seeds is coming along</i>
<i>nicely.</i>

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:47.561
<i>Only this solar system and its</i>
<i>few neighboring stars remain.</i>

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:49.429
Good work.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:52.566
Once I can get my hands on every
true Star Seed...

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.436
I can finally become the
rightful ruler of the entire
galaxy!

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.406
Listen up, Sailor Aluminum
Siren!

00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:01.341
Yes!

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:05.546
(Galaxia) You are to gather the
<i>true Star Seeds that remain in</i>
<i>the solar system.</i>

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.516
I will not tolerate failures
like those of your predecessor.

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:11.118
Right.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.422
You can count on me, Master
Galaxia.

00:04:20.027 --> 00:04:21.461
<i>(Rei) Galaxia?</i>

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:23.297
M-hm.

00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:25.532
So that's the name of the
enemy's boss?

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:32.072
And these invaders came
from outside our solar system,
right?

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:36.610
Hey, wait a minute. Didn't
Haruka and Michiru say that the
Sailor Star Lights...

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:39.546
are intruders who came from
outside the solar system, as
well?

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:41.315
[gasps]

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.152
<i>(Luna) Do you think that means</i>
<i>the Star Lights could also be</i>
<i>our enemy?</i>

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:46.019
Huh?

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:55.362
No way! Those three can't be
bad people!

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:58.565
They always show up to help
when we're in trouble!

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:03.537
(Minako) Listen Usagi there's no
<i>telling what their real agenda</i>
<i>for coming to this planet is.</i>

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.006
I mean, let's not forget that
they're aliens, after all.

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.143
It's possible they're only
acting friendly as a cover up.
[licking]

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:12.613
Then, one of these days,
they're gonna abduct us into
space...

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:16.350
and insert some strange
device into our brains so
that they can control our minds!

00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:20.287
You watch way too many weird
TV shows, Minako, you know
that?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.924
But guys, I'm serious about
not thinking the Star Lights
are bad.

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:25.926
You mustn't let your guard
down.

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:27.661
[gasps] Setsuna?

00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:33.500
There seems to be some kind of
dark energy spreading across
the entire galaxy.

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:37.337
(Setsuna) An evil that's robbing
<i>the stars of their radiance.</i>

00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:42.576
Robbing the stars' radiance
across the galaxy?

00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:44.077
Is that even possible?

00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:47.848
Yes, and our solar system is
no exception to that.

00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:54.154
So, be on high alert. I have
a feeling this enemy is unlike
any we've faced before.

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:05.766
Aw, man. Why is everyone
telling me to be careful?

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:09.837
Are the Star Lights that
sketchy? I didn't think so.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.541
They just want you to be more
cautious because they're
worried about your well-being.

00:06:14.575 --> 00:06:15.242
Hmph.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.179
(Luna) Your biggest weakness is
that you're too trusting, Usagi.

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:21.448
<i>Do you remember that time when</i>
<i>you...</i>

00:06:25.252 --> 00:06:29.556
(Luna) Hello? Are you listening
<i>to me? Usagi?!</i>

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.190
Hm?

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.527
Huh?

00:06:57.985 --> 00:06:58.752
Here!

00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:01.522
[giggles]

00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:03.724
[giggles]

00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:07.761
You're cute. Bye now.

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:09.696
Huh?

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:14.268
Alright, time to go home,
Luna.

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:15.269
Meow.

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:22.709
Hm? Hey, Usagi!

00:07:22.743 --> 00:07:23.410
Hm?

00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:25.779
I think that girl from the
park is following us.

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:26.513
[gasps]

00:07:29.016 --> 00:07:31.251
<i>(Usagi) Oh, no! What do we do?</i>

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:33.954
<i>(Luna) We should make sure she</i>
<i>gets back to her parents.</i>

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:35.088
<i>(Usagi) Good idea.</i>

00:07:35.756 --> 00:07:37.524
Let's see here.

00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:40.427
[sighs] Hey, young lady.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.228
Chibi?

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:42.963
Do you have a name? What is
it?

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:46.066
Chibi? Chibi!

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.402
[giggling]

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:50.704
[gasps] You alone?

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:51.805
Chibi.

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:53.473
Know where your mom is?

00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:54.608
Chibi-Chibi!

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.476
Okay, where do you live?

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.344
Chibi!

00:07:58.145 --> 00:07:59.780
This is going nowhere.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:03.984
Usagi, I feel like we should
just take her to the police
station.

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:07.020
Yeah, I was actually thinking
the same thing.

00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:09.590
[gasps] She disappeared!

00:08:09.623 --> 00:08:11.258
<i>(Usagi) What?! No way!</i>

00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:16.296
How'd she even do that?

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:18.699
<i>(Aya) My goodness.</i>

00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:24.004
<i>I guess it's true that</i>
<i>incompetent people are</i>
<i>destined to fade away.</i>

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:29.176
Oh, poor little Nezu. I feel
terrible about what happened
to you.

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:31.678
Thinking about it
makes me hungry.

00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:34.314
<i>(Karasuma) What in the hell do</i>
<i>you think you're doing over</i>
<i>there?</i>

00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:34.748
Hm?

00:08:35.616 --> 00:08:38.485
Oh! Hello, Sailor Lead Crow.

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:44.825
My name is Karasuma. So, get it
right! Don't you ever call me by
that other name in public, okay?

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:47.694
Oh, then, Karasuma?

00:08:47.728 --> 00:08:48.262
What?

00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:49.863
Care for some dried pickled
octopus?

00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:50.597
[gasps]

00:08:51.598 --> 00:08:53.367
<i>(Karasuma) Why are you eating</i>
<i>right now?</i>

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.134
Well...

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.772
I was told to use Nezu's old
desk, but when I got here it was
so messy and disgusting...

00:08:58.805 --> 00:09:01.542
that I didn't want to use
it until I did some cleaning
first.

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:03.610
But then that made me really
hungry so...

00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:04.311
[sighs]

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:08.215
How the mighty have fallen. You
and I have been competing for
the proud title...

00:09:08.248 --> 00:09:10.684
of number one Anima Mate for
several years.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.820
But now, you've been cast off
to this godforsaken planet.

00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:17.958
(Karasuma) I suppose that's one
<i>less rival for me to worry</i>
<i>about.</i>

00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:20.227
Congratulations, Karasuma!

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.028
Huh?!

00:09:21.828 --> 00:09:23.230
You're not mocking me, are
you?!

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.733
No. But as far as I recall, I'm
the only one who got sent to
Earth.

00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:30.270
I don't think you were required
to follow me, which means you
can leave any time.

00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:32.372
So why are you here anyway?

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:33.473
If you must know!

00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:37.377
I was worried about my rival and
came to see how she was doing
out here on her own!

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:42.449
Ugh. It's so upsetting to know
that my eternal rival is just
a complete ditz.

00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:43.550
My apologies.

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.788
Anyway! You need to work on
being a lot more motivated
while you're here.

00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:51.725
Otherwise, you'll end up getting
eliminated like Sailor Iron
Mouse!

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:52.693
[sighs]

00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:56.096
Now hurry up and go look for a
target that might have a true
Star Seed!

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:58.398
She can be such a handful.

00:09:58.432 --> 00:09:59.433
Oh.

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:04.571
[sighs] Fine then. I'll get
started after I finish eating my
lunch.

00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:05.639
[gasps]

00:10:06.707 --> 00:10:08.375
You're free to join me if
you'd like, Karasuma.

00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:12.646
<i>(Usagi) It's so hot today.</i>
<i>[groans]</i>

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:15.949
(Luna) Where do you suppose that
<i>little girl could have run off</i>
<i>to?</i>

00:10:15.983 --> 00:10:20.387
I'm guessing her mother
probably found her and took
her back home by now.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.523
I hope you're right about
that.

00:10:22.556 --> 00:10:25.158
How about we just go inside for
a little bit...

00:10:25.192 --> 00:10:30.497
and grab something cold to drink
from the fridge, ok? I'm
exhausted. [sighs]

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:34.735
[gasps]

00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:37.604
What's the matter?

00:10:37.638 --> 00:10:38.672
There she is! That girl!

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.842
What's she doing at our
place?!

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:43.744
Oh, Usagi, you're home.

00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:46.547
Mom! That girl over there!
Why's she?

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.983
How could you run off and leave
your precious little sister
alone like that?

00:10:50.017 --> 00:10:52.386
Usagi's mean, isn't she?

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:54.087
Little sister?!

00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:55.856
Why are you so surprised?

00:10:55.889 --> 00:10:59.893
Or are you just pretending to
forget that Chibi-Chibi's your
sister?

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:01.061
Chibi!

00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:02.729
What's going on here?

00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:04.364
That's what I'm wondering.

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:07.167
Chibi-Chibi!

00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:37.598
<i>(All) Another strange</i>
<i>visitor?!</i>

00:11:38.065 --> 00:11:39.366
<i>(Usagi) Yeah.</i>

00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:43.737
I mean, how could my mom give
birth to a kid that size in a
day or two.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.740
She's super cute! I want
one, too!

00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:50.043
You can't just say you "want
one." She's not a kitten, you
know.

00:11:50.077 --> 00:11:52.579
Could she be Chibi-Usa's
little sister?

00:11:52.613 --> 00:11:55.382
Maybe she was jealous of
Chibi-Usa's stories...

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:58.552
and decided to come to the 20th
century to see for herself.

00:11:58.585 --> 00:12:03.490
<i>(Ami) If I'm being honest, the</i>
more I look at her, the more she
<i>resembles Usagi.</i>

00:12:03.524 --> 00:12:05.526
If she's Chibi-Usa's little
sister...

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:08.595
wouldn't that also make her
Usagi and Mamoru's second child?

00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:09.530
[gasps]

00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:13.600
You're right. I guess it
would mean that, wouldn't it?

00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:14.535
That's not possible.

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:15.302
[gasps]

00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:16.370
Setsuna?!

00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:19.206
I was concerned, so I followed
you to this place.

00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:24.044
You see, as far as I'm aware,
Small Lady is Neo Queen
Serenity's only child.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.413
Hm. Then who is she?

00:12:27.781 --> 00:12:30.350
I feel it's best to be wary of
her.

00:12:30.384 --> 00:12:34.321
Seriously? I mean, she's
just a little girl though.

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:39.526
She may be young, but it would
be foolish to blindly trust her
without knowing who she is.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.928
[concerned]

00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:43.163
<i>(Ikuko) Oh dear. Chibi-Chibi?!</i>

00:12:44.565 --> 00:12:45.832
Where could she have gone?

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:47.134
[groans]

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:49.336
Let's all split up to help
find her!

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:50.437
Okay.

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:58.879
[sighs] She's tiny, so she
couldn't have gotten far.

00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:01.081
<i>(Usagi) Oh! I'm in luck!</i>

00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:04.284
Excuse me, officer! Huh?

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:06.553
Where'd you come from, little
lady?

00:13:06.587 --> 00:13:07.621
Little lady?

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:08.822
Do you have a name?

00:13:08.856 --> 00:13:09.523
Have a name?

00:13:09.556 --> 00:13:11.124
There she is.

00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:13.694
Hey, you! Time to go home!

00:13:13.727 --> 00:13:14.328
Hm?

00:13:14.361 --> 00:13:15.395
[gasps]

00:13:15.429 --> 00:13:16.430
Bun-head?!

00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:18.699
What are you doing out in
public dressed like that?!

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:23.070
(Usagi) You're acting as Police
<i>Chief for the day?!</i>

00:13:24.104 --> 00:13:26.940
Yup! All part of the job of
being an idol.

00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:28.208
Part of the job!

00:13:29.877 --> 00:13:33.313
Not to brag, but I make a pretty
good patrol officer. See, I even
found a lost child!

00:13:33.347 --> 00:13:34.181
See? See?

00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:37.551
(Seiya) Come to think of it, she
<i>kinda looks like you.</i>

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:37.985
Huh?

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:39.152
Is she your sister?

00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:41.355
[gasps] Well. Something like
that.

00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:42.055
Like that!

00:13:43.824 --> 00:13:45.959
You know the more I think
about it, she looks more like
your daughter than your sister.

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:46.760
[gasps]

00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:50.497
Why're you blushing all of a
sudden? You weirdo.

00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:53.367
You wouldn't understand, if
I told you!

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.237
What the heck's your problem?
You hiding something?

00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:58.005
[gasps]

00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:03.410
What, no! It's not like that.
I mean, I do have a few
secrets.

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:06.813
How about we promise to never
keep secrets from each other?

00:14:06.847 --> 00:14:08.015
[scoffs]

00:14:08.048 --> 00:14:09.049
What's wrong?

00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:11.385
For some reason I have a
feeling...

00:14:11.418 --> 00:14:15.689
you're keeping a lot more
secrets from me than I am from
you.

00:14:15.722 --> 00:14:20.327
I guess, but it's probably no
more than most people have.
Just forget it.

00:14:23.497 --> 00:14:26.033
<i>(Ikuko) There you are</i>
<i>Chibi-Chibi!</i>

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.267
Chibi!

00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:28.769
How can I ever repay you?

00:14:28.802 --> 00:14:30.103
Oh, it was nothing.

00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:33.607
He's right, you know. He was
just taking a walk down the
street and happened to find her.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.809
Wow, way to throw me under the
bus, Bun-head.

00:14:35.843 --> 00:14:37.711
You're only mad 'cause you
know it's true.

00:14:37.744 --> 00:14:39.279
Way to go, Seiya!

00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:43.217
It looks like you didn't give up
being "Police Chief for a day"
even on your break, did you?

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.820
That dedication shows you've
got real police spirit!
[laughing]

00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:47.588
Who's he?

00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:49.590
He's the actual Police Chief.

00:14:49.623 --> 00:14:50.891
See over there?

00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:53.994
That man possesses a Star
Seed.

00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:56.196
You mean the old one? Are
you sure about that?

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:01.201
Seriously?! Are you doubting the
help that I went out of my way
to give to my former rival?

00:15:01.235 --> 00:15:03.437
Oh. I appreciate it, I guess.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.406
Just go corner him and take
his Star Seed already!

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.710
Alright, I'll see you all
later. [laughing]

00:15:12.513 --> 00:15:14.581
What're you waiting for? Now's
your chance!

00:15:14.615 --> 00:15:15.582
Uh.

00:15:17.284 --> 00:15:19.987
You think I should try starting
the conversation by exchanging
business cards with him?

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.321
You idiot!

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:22.756
[gasps]

00:15:24.691 --> 00:15:26.660
I just remembered that the
others are probably still out
searching for Chibi-Chibi!

00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:28.128
[groans]

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:34.067
<i>(Aya) Excuse me.</i>

00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:36.937
Hm? Can I help you?

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.140
I would like to do a story on
you, officer.

00:15:42.009 --> 00:15:44.178
<i>(Usagi) [gasps] Setsuna?</i>

00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:45.646
What are you doing here?

00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:48.115
I came to see if a lost child
was reported.

00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:49.583
Where are all the others?

00:15:50.984 --> 00:15:53.020
Apparently, there's going to be
a parade featuring the Three
Lights.

00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.256
And they said Chibi-Chibi might
be there, so they went over
to...

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.057
[gasps]

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.525

00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:00.294
[grunting]

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:03.797
Wait, where are you going sir?
Why are you suddenly trying to
avoid me?!

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.033
<i>(Police Chief) Because you're</i>
<i>suddenly trying to follow me!</i>

00:16:06.066 --> 00:16:09.236
<i>(Aya) I'm only following you</i>
<i>because I want to look at your</i>
<i>Star Seed!</i>

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:10.704
How hard is that to understand?

00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:14.775
Ah, yes, that aggressiveness.
Now that's the former rival I
know.

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:17.411
Whatever it is, this ain't
normal!

00:16:17.444 --> 00:16:19.046
Is that so?

00:16:20.581 --> 00:16:22.983
Well, if that's how you feel,
then I suppose you leave me
with no choice.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.018
Hi!

00:16:25.986 --> 00:16:27.154
What's going on?!

00:16:28.455 --> 00:16:30.958
I'm only going to ask you once
more. Show me your Star
Seed!

00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:32.626
[scared stammering]

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:34.962

[sighs]

00:16:40.734 --> 00:16:43.504
He doesn't have a true Star
Seed. How could you lie to
my face like that?

00:16:43.537 --> 00:16:44.505
Sorry!

00:16:46.273 --> 00:16:48.942
Knowing that I've been lied to
makes me so sad, that I'm afraid
I've gotten hungry again.

00:16:48.976 --> 00:16:50.911
I need to hurry home and have
dinner.

And in the name of the Moon,

Pleasure to meet you!

Oh no! That's the Police
Chief!

Look what they turned him
into.

You wouldn't point your gun at
law-abiding citizens if you
were a true man of the law.

00:19:00.407 --> 00:19:03.243
You're unfit to be a police
officer.

00:19:03.277 --> 00:19:05.913
You should turn in your badge.

Good night, Chibi-Chibi.

00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:52.713
<i>When I dream tonight. I hope</i>
<i>the dream is about you, Mamo.</i>

00:23:36.383 --> 00:23:40.287
<i>(Usagi) Summer vacation's</i>
<i>finally here! And we're going</i>
<i>camping at a beautiful lake!</i>

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.123
<i>(Rei) By the way, I've heard</i>
<i>that this place is haunted.</i>

00:23:43.156 --> 00:23:44.057
<i>(Usagi) Yeah?</i>

00:23:44.958 --> 00:23:45.459
<i>(Rei) Wait, that doesn't scare</i>
<i>you?</i>

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.529
<i>(Usagi) Nope! I'm way more</i>
<i>afraid of you than I am of</i>
<i>ghosts, Rei!</i>

00:23:50.297 --> 00:23:52.633
<i>When you get angry, your</i>
mouth opens from ear-to-ear like
<i>some kind of crazy snake lady!</i>

00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:53.667
<i>(Rei) [hiss]</i>

00:23:55.502 --> 00:23:58.438
<i>(Usagi) Next time on Sailor</i>
<i>Stars, "The Screaming Dead:</i>
<i>Terror of the Camp Monster."</i>

00:23:58.472 --> 00:24:01.742
<i>The moonlight is a messenger</i>
<i>of love.</i>
