<i>(Usagi) I'm doing fine, so you</i>

00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:27.281
Minako was all like, "Oh my god,
those three are so totally hot!
<i>I want to date all of them!"</i>

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:28.215
[chuckles]

<i>(Makoto) A Long-distance</i>

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.527
Huh? [flustered screams]

00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:43.230
I've heard being absent from
class makes the heart grow
fonder.

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:44.698
Stop talking, please.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.999
Based on the grammar...

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:48.535
I think you forgot everything
you memorized for the entrance
exams.

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:06.653
[sighs] Oh, wow!

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:10.090
That was amazing! I guess the
rumors about you being the
infamous...

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:13.060
strong girl from Juban
Middle School are actually true!

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:14.928
I already told you, I really
don't want...

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:16.530
With someone like you on the
track team...

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:19.199
we're sure to make it to the
high school championships!

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.102
It would be a true honor to have
you join our team this year!

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:25.439
Uh, actually, I was planning
to join the Cooking Club.

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:27.274
Listen to me, Makoto!

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.042
Uh, okay...

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:32.980
How can you waste that strength
of yours and not use it? It's a
complete insult to sports!

00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:34.314
I get what you mean, but...

00:03:34.348 --> 00:03:36.617
You only get to enjoy your high
school years once!

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.821
So, don't make the mistake of
wasting your talents! Do I make
myself clear?

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:43.824
Uh, yeah. [gasps]

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:47.194
I knew I could count on you.
Welcome to the track team!

I downloaded all the information
you were looking for about
aerospace engineering...

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.343
from Columbia University's
library.

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:06.346
Thank you, Ami! Now I can
finish my paper.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.615
I can help find more references
if you'd like.

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:11.585
Oh yeah, I guess I should have
more than one source, huh?

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:13.320
[chuckling]

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.028
Hmm! Now that I've officially
joined the school's volleyball
team...

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.264
we're sure to win a national
championship this year!

Walking home alone?

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.216
M-hm. The others are doing club
things.

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:44.384
Why don't you join
one too, Usagi?

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:46.687
Uhh, I could.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.559
Yeah! Maybe there's a club where
I can sing karaoke, or even
learn new dance moves!

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:55.429
And they'll have lots of
delicious snacks and handsome
boys!

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:57.631
Oh and they take trips
to America, too!

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.499
You're not joking, are you.

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:00.300
<i>(Usagi) Nope!</i>

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:02.503
Well, scratch the club idea.

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:06.740
Hey, Luna?

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:13.013
(Usagi) About yesterday, how are
we supposed to explain it all to
<i>the girls?</i>

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.638
<i>(Luna) Well, we still don't</i>
<i>know anything about them.</i>

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:40.440
Why don't we wait it out until
we learn a little more?

00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:42.709
I have a really bad feeling
about...

00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:44.278
[shrieks]

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:46.547
<i>(Ko Seiya) You alright?</i>

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.915
Yup! Totally fine.

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:49.049
[screams]

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.752
Oh. Didn't think I'd run into
you again, Bun-head!

00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:55.389
That's seriously all you're
going to say after just bumping
into me like that?!

00:05:56.957 --> 00:05:58.425
If you had been watching where
you were going, that wouldn't
have happened.

00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:00.861
But you're the one who suddenly
jumped out of nowhere!

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:02.563
You're definitely an odd one.

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:03.230
Huh?

00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:06.667
Most girls would be over the
moon if they bumped into me on
the street.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.367
Ew, why?

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:10.003
Well, cause I'm such a
good-looking guy, of course.

00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:11.004
[disgusted]

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:12.239
Seiya, what's the hold up?

00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:14.041
We should really get going.

00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:15.709
I'll be there in a sec.

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:19.213
You're a lucky girl, you know
that, Bun-head? Maybe I'll see
you again sometime.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.082
Huh! Can you believe how much
of an arrogant jerk that guy is?

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.584
So what if he's kinda
good-looking?

00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:24.618
That's an understatement.

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:04.124
Hmm?

00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:07.661
<i>(Chuko Nezu) Oh, this looks</i>

They say he'll be a big star in
the future. But right now, he's
still so pure. Perfect.

00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:24.811
<i>(Nezu) These muscular</i>

[phone ringing]

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.896
Yes? Third Production
Department, Nezu speaking.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.300
(Secretary) The President would
like to see you, Producer Nezu.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:47.034
Right.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:28.709
You summoned me, Master Galaxia?

00:08:28.742 --> 00:08:34.381
Yes, Sailor Iron Mouse. Have
you been able to locate a true
Star Seed?

00:08:34.414 --> 00:08:37.351
Not yet, but I've managed to
narrow down my target.

00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:40.287
It's someone who holds the
brightest Star Seed.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.623
You must obtain the true one
quickly.

00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:47.194
In order to seize the entire
galaxy, I need it in my
possession.

00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:49.563
I await to hear good news from
you.

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:51.999
Of course.

00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:58.605

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:07.147
She's here pretty early.

00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:10.050
M-hm. She's not usually
here untill the first bell.

00:09:11.418 --> 00:09:13.453
Do you know what
going on, Minako?

00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:13.720
[excited]

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:15.322
Why are there so
many people here?

00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:16.456
You haven't heard?!

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:19.593
The Three Lights are
transferring to Juban High
School!

00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:20.694
No way!

00:09:21.828 --> 00:09:22.563
Huh?

00:09:25.332 --> 00:09:26.900
Told ya so!

00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:28.635

You're here?

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:32.873

them out, too.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.431
No way!

00:09:57.464 --> 00:09:58.332
Seriously?

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.468
I guess it's pretty accurate
when they say it's always the
quiet ones.

00:10:01.502 --> 00:10:02.936
I'm so sorry.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.838
Wow, girls. Impressive.

00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:07.307
Can we go inside already? It's
so noisy.

00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:08.442
Yeah, I agree.

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:10.611
Huh? Hey!

00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:12.346
Bun head! It's you.

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:12.980
Huh?

00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:14.715
I guess you go to this school,
too, huh?

00:10:15.983 --> 00:10:17.985
Wait a sec, you're a member of
the Three Lights?

00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:21.955
Bet you wanna be in the same
class with me now, right? See
ya!

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:25.826
Are you kidding? Who would want
to be in the same class with a
jerk like you?!

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:26.560
Hold up, Usagi.

00:10:27.528 --> 00:10:28.695
You talked to Seiya like you
knew each other.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.566
It's a long story that I don't
wanna get into, but he's kind
of a weirdo.

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:33.767
Come on, you gotta tell us!

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.871
So, as many of you may already
know...

00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:41.375
(Teacher) Starting today, these
<i>three will be your new</i>
<i>classmates...</i>

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:43.043
<i>for the remainder of</i>
<i>the year.</i>

00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:46.313

up, I trust you'll all give them

[gasps]

00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:49.116
Hmph!

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.351
Now then, take any open seat.

00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:54.488
Ooo! Yaten, over here! You can
take this empty seat next to me!

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.824
Is this seat open?

00:10:57.858 --> 00:10:59.893
[gasps] Uh, yeah!

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:02.262
Hmm. I'll sit behind
you, Bun-head.

00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:04.765
It's Usagi Tsukino! Not
Bun-head!

00:11:04.798 --> 00:11:06.700
Oh, so, you're a moon bun!

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:07.701
[annoyed]

00:11:08.702 --> 00:11:10.137
All right, let's begin class.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.272
Nice, Usagi! Way to go!

00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:14.575
Hey, Bun-head.

00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:15.442
[slight annoyed]

00:11:16.877 --> 00:11:18.846
The three of us are thinking of
joining a club. Know any good
ones?

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:22.716
You mean one that's super fun,
where you can sing songs and
learn dances?

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:25.485
And they have snacks, and
handsome guys, and take trips to
America?

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:28.655
Because a cool club like that
doesn't exist, trust me.

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:29.990
Ok...

00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:33.160
So, uh, you know, I'd be happy
to show you around.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.629
<i>(Teacher) Quiet down! Class is</i>
<i>in session!</i>

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:36.530
<i>(Minako) Sorry, sir...</i>

00:11:36.563 --> 00:11:38.999
You'll help show me around too,
right?

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.167
Not on your life!

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.702
Why're you being so cold?

00:11:43.337 --> 00:11:46.473
Don't be silly, of course she's
joining us! Isn't that right,
Usagi?!

00:11:46.507 --> 00:11:47.441
[groans]

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:49.610
<i>(Teacher) That's enough, you</i>
<i>three!</i>

00:11:49.643 --> 00:11:50.711
Sorry.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.451
Bingo!

00:11:57.784 --> 00:11:59.419
[chuckles]

00:12:37.024 --> 00:12:39.826
Come on, Seiya! You can beat
these guys!

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.528
Try and get past me!

00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:42.996
Heh. Fool.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.597
Bring it!

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:45.065
He's just toying with him.

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.835
Ya think? [sighs] Why's Seiya so
childish?

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:48.735
[chuckles]

00:12:50.337 --> 00:12:50.704
Hmm.

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:51.638
Wow...

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.441
[shrieks]

00:12:58.846 --> 00:12:59.613
[grunts]

00:13:00.948 --> 00:13:03.450
[cheers]

00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:05.552
Wha? Huh?

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.591
He's amazing!

00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:11.758
So cool!

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.560
He really is, isn't he?!

00:13:13.594 --> 00:13:14.161
What the?!

00:13:14.728 --> 00:13:15.262
When did you get here?

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.432
I rushed straight over here
after school so I could see
Seiya play.

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:22.236
Oh boy. Well, I've had enough of
this place. It reeks of sweat.

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:26.874
Yes, I'd much rather be
participating in more academic
activities than be here.

00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:30.611
I think I've had enough
"activity" for today. I'm going
home.

00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:32.045
You're so right!

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:35.182
The Academic Club is perfect for
someone like you, Taiki!

00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:38.352
You don't belong in this gym!
Sports teams are so gross!

00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:42.589
I'm super familiar with the
Academic Club, so I'll show you
around.

00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:44.258
I think I'll go alone.

00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:44.725
[grunts]

00:13:45.592 --> 00:13:47.027
I said I'll show you around.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.061
<i>(Taiki) Fine.</i>

00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:49.763
Alright! Then let's get started!

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:51.932
<i>Score! I managed to snag one!</i>

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:53.634
Wow, Minako's incredible.

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.636
She knows how to get exactly
what she wants...

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:58.672
and doesn't bother holding back
like all the other fans at
school do.

00:13:58.705 --> 00:13:59.673
Go girl.

00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:01.008
<i>(Seiya) Hey! Bun-head!</i>

00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:04.311
Excuse me! I told you to stop
calling me Bun-head!

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.914
Sorry! Just wanted to know where
we're headed to next!

00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:09.216
What the heck makes you think I
know?!

00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:09.917
Usagi!

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:10.484
[shrieks]

00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:12.452
Don't speak to him that way!

00:14:12.486 --> 00:14:13.353
Seiya's our idol!

00:14:13.387 --> 00:14:16.056
You should treat him with more
respect.

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:19.059
Uh, not that I know a lot
about him, or anything!

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.297
(Usagi) Seriously? You're trying
<i>the football club now?</i>

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.866
Pretty perfect for a cool guy
like me, right?

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:27.234
Yeah, I don't think so.

00:14:30.337 --> 00:14:31.738
Hmm. Go time.

00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:33.373
Wait, what do you think you're
doing?

00:14:33.407 --> 00:14:36.176
You want to see me score a
touchdown, don't you?

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.446
Juban High's football team is
known to be really tough, so...

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:40.380
Just watch me!

00:14:40.414 --> 00:14:41.181
[grunts]

00:14:41.682 --> 00:14:42.449
[grunts]

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.956
Hah. What do we have
here?

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:50.424
[grunts]

00:14:52.893 --> 00:14:54.361
I've got this

00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:56.363
Hmph!

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:57.297
[grunts]

00:14:57.831 --> 00:14:58.765
<i>No way!</i>

00:14:58.799 --> 00:14:59.299
[gasps]

00:15:00.234 --> 00:15:01.668
[grunts]

00:15:01.702 --> 00:15:03.203
Seiya! [panting]

00:15:04.471 --> 00:15:06.106
[groaning]

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:08.942
You bully! What were you even
thinking?

00:15:08.976 --> 00:15:13.547
He wasn't wearing any sort
of protective padding, and you
tackled him at full force!

00:15:14.681 --> 00:15:18.118
[flinches] What? You're gonna
hit a girl now too?!

00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:25.158
<i>(Kayama) I'm Kayama, the team</i>
<i>captain.</i>

00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:27.561
That was a nice tackle.
You're a strong guy.

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:29.963
Can't believe you managed to
outrun most of my teammates.

00:15:29.997 --> 00:15:33.500
When you compare it to running
from my fans, it was pretty
easy.

00:15:33.534 --> 00:15:35.569
Well then, you wanna join our
team?

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:36.436
Of course!

00:15:37.571 --> 00:15:39.840
Uhh. Why would you shake hands
with a guy who hurt you?

00:15:39.873 --> 00:15:42.176
A girl would never understand,
Bun-head.

00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:43.810
Nice to meet you, Bun-head!

00:15:43.844 --> 00:15:44.311
Hmph.

00:15:47.314 --> 00:15:48.148
Huh?

00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:51.285
You've got some sharp instincts
there, Mr. Yuji Kayama.

00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:55.656
Wow, they definitely weren't
kidding when they said a new
football star is born.

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:56.623
Uhh.

00:15:58.158 --> 00:16:00.894
Nice to meet you. My name's
Chuko Nezu and I'm a producer
with Ginga TV.

00:16:00.928 --> 00:16:03.163
I'd love to do a story on you.

00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:06.633
Sorry, I've got a team meeting
now, so I kind of have to go.

00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:08.268
You've got such lovely
muscles!

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.238
And you're much more attractive
in person than I thought you'd
be!

00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:13.340
Uh, do you mind if we do
this interview later?

00:16:13.373 --> 00:16:19.479
Huh? No way. I've been waiting
forever for you to be alone. I'm
done with waiting today.

00:16:19.513 --> 00:16:22.149
Okay, I think this should be a
pretty good distance!

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:24.117
Why're you being so insistent?

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:26.286
Oh. Well, you see...

00:16:27.254 --> 00:16:28.455
Chuu!

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:31.358
Hmph! You monster!

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:39.333
[screaming]

00:16:45.372 --> 00:16:46.306
[gasps]

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.241
Hmph!

00:16:51.512 --> 00:16:56.583
Moon Eternal Make Up!

00:17:32.586 --> 00:17:34.087
[chuckles]

00:17:35.956 --> 00:17:37.758
<i>(Nezu) Aw, it faded out.</i>

00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:41.461
What a shame. He didn't have the
Star Seed I was looking for
after all.

00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:42.696
<i>(Sailor Moon) Hold it right</i>
<i>there!</i>

00:17:44.198 --> 00:17:46.133
How dare you meddle with the
beginning of someone's beautiful
friendship!

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:48.202
I am the Pretty Guardian!

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:50.671
Who fights for love and for
justice!

00:17:54.441 --> 00:17:57.244
I am Sailor Moon!

00:17:57.277 --> 00:18:01.915
And in the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

00:18:01.949 --> 00:18:03.450
Really? You again?

00:18:04.852 --> 00:18:07.054
Oh well. My work is done for
today, I don't have the time for
this.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.524
No! Not again!

00:18:10.557 --> 00:18:13.193
Have lots of fun with the Phage,
okay?

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.929
Time to go!

00:18:15.963 --> 00:18:18.866
[giggles] Well, buh-bye
now!

00:18:18.899 --> 00:18:22.669
Hold on a sec! You could at
least clean up your mess before
you leave!

00:18:24.204 --> 00:18:26.607
This looks bad. Can I go home?

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.908
Listen, Sailor Moon!

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:28.375
Luna!

00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:29.643
Keep it together.

00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:32.379
But, I'm getting a bad vibe
here.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.449
I am, Sailor Guts!

00:18:35.482 --> 00:18:36.183
Oh, boy.

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:38.352
Okay, this just got awkward.

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:39.386
See what I mean?

00:18:40.521 --> 00:18:44.658
Blood, sweat, and guts! Those
are a man's true appeal!

00:18:45.425 --> 00:18:46.393
[groans]

00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:51.398

So who's the pink guy?

00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:13.086
A new enemy?

00:19:14.054 --> 00:19:15.389
That's Yuji Kayama, from the
football team!

00:19:15.422 --> 00:19:16.089
Uh!

00:19:16.924 --> 00:19:17.491
The enemy turned him into a
Phage.

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:20.527
Take this! Sweats of Youth!

Now, faster!

00:19:30.537 --> 00:19:31.672

There's five of you, and this is
the best you could do?

And you call yourselves Sailor
Guardians.

00:20:17.951 --> 00:20:19.653

00:21:35.796 --> 00:21:36.997
Wow! It's really cute.

[chuckles]

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.935
<i>(Rei) A piggy with a crescent</i>
<i>bald spot, huh? That's unique.</i>

00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:43.337
(Makoto) It's totally a raccoon.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.105
<i>(Ami) Is this supposed to be a</i>
<i>rough draft?</i>

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:48.742
<i>(Minako) You know, it looks a</i>
lot more like a Tasmanian devil
<i>to me.</i>

00:21:48.775 --> 00:21:50.677
Come on, guys! It's clearly
Luna!

00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:51.545
<i>(All) It is?!</i>

00:21:51.578 --> 00:21:52.646
You guys are mean.

00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:39.786
(Usagi) Hey, Minako! Is it true
<i>you're the Three Lights'</i>
<i>girlfriend?</i>

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.823
(Minako) The rumors have spread
<i>that far? What's a girl to do?</i>

00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:44.157
<i>We were even photographed</i>
<i>together!</i>

00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:45.659
(Usagi) You were?! I wanna see!

00:23:45.692 --> 00:23:48.395
<i>(Minako) Oh dear, this might</i>
<i>lead to my debut as an idol!</i>

00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:51.365
(Usagi) Wait, are you sure these
<i>photos aren't staged, Minako?</i>

00:23:51.398 --> 00:23:53.400
<i>(Minako) Uh! You can</i>
<i>tell?</i>

00:23:55.068 --> 00:23:57.437
<i>(Usagi) Next time on Sailor</i>
<i>Stars, "Becoming an Idol:</i>
<i>Minako's Ambition."</i>

00:23:57.471 --> 00:24:01.742
The moonlight is a messenger of
<i>love.</i>
