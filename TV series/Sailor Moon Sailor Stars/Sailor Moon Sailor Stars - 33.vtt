<i>give up our lives to protect</i>
<i>her.</i>

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:38.438
Healer! Maker!

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:42.109
I have always loved your
light... Sailor Moon.

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:43.310
Fighter--

00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:48.448
We can leave, knowing... our
hopes are in your hands.

00:15:54.087 --> 00:15:59.359
(SEIYA) Flying across the
heavens, the three shooting
stars are about to burn out...

00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:03.163
Galaxia, we'll show you our last
<i>spark of light!!</i>

00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:06.767
Go ahead, I'll turn that spark
into pitch black darkness!

00:16:09.336 --> 00:16:10.103
Wait--!

00:16:16.844 --> 00:16:18.278
[grunts]

00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:21.582
<i>No...!</i>

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:37.764
(SEIYA) <i>Sailor Moon, please</i>
<i>spread the light of hope</i>
<i>throughout the galaxy!</i>

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.767
No...

00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:43.270
<i>You can't--</i>

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:51.445
No!

00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:55.582
Ahhh!

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.126
[weeping]

00:17:10.998 --> 00:17:12.299
Now it's over!

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.408
Sailor Moon..?

00:17:22.009 --> 00:17:23.177
Wh--What is that?

00:17:26.013 --> 00:17:27.281
Her Star Seed...

00:17:27.314 --> 00:17:29.983
Could she be planning to release
its energy?

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:42.162
A fitting Star Seed for the
princess of the moon.

00:17:42.196 --> 00:17:47.000
Its radiance is unlike any other
in the galaxy... Ha!

00:17:47.434 --> 00:17:48.168
Ah!

00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:49.036
Ah!

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:49.903
Sailor Moon!

00:17:49.937 --> 00:17:52.206
[pained gunt and scream]

00:17:54.007 --> 00:17:58.278
Did you think your Star Seed was
so special... that it would be
strong enough to defeat me?

00:17:59.379 --> 00:18:00.280
You fool!

00:18:06.653 --> 00:18:08.222
[pained scream]

00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:11.158
[chuckling]

00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:13.393
[pained scream and groan]

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:17.931
[chuckles and laughing]

00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:20.200
[crying and screaming]

00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:21.735
What is this?

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:26.306
We can't beat her even with all
our powers combined? How can
that be?!

00:18:31.578 --> 00:18:35.382
[emotional breaths]

00:18:36.817 --> 00:18:37.451
[gasp]

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.454
(PRINCESS KAKYU) <i>Have faith...</i>

00:18:50.931 --> 00:18:55.602
<i>Believe in the reason why you</i>
<i>were given life in this</i>
<i>universe...</i>

00:18:55.636 --> 00:18:58.572
<i>the reason why you</i>
<i>met these people...!</i>

00:19:00.641 --> 00:19:01.575
[stunned gasp]

00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:06.113
Is that voice--! Is that the
princess?

00:19:10.417 --> 00:19:14.087
It's too late for that! The
galaxy belongs to me now!

00:19:14.588 --> 00:19:15.455
It's mine!

00:19:20.527 --> 00:19:24.798
[grunt] Was this the reason I
defeated Chaos?

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:28.535
So I could then destroy the
world I've sworn to protect?

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:28.969
[struggling]

00:19:32.573 --> 00:19:39.046
I feel it... Chaos's energy,
growing ever stronger inside of
me.

00:19:39.079 --> 00:19:42.149
Soon I'll be consumed by evil!

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:47.588
I must do something... [grunt] I
can't let it end this way...

00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:52.292
If I don't protect this galaxy,
then who will?

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:15.315
Go, my Star Seed, my Light of
Hope, to the ends to the
galaxy...

00:20:15.349 --> 00:20:20.120
...where Chaos cannot reach you.
Find a star that will embrace
you...

00:20:20.153 --> 00:20:25.459
<i>a star that will one day arise</i>
<i>to fight for love and for</i>
<i>justice...</i>

00:20:25.492 --> 00:20:29.763
and help her protect this world
<i>from the forces of evil!</i>

00:20:33.267 --> 00:20:36.570
But that is not to be. It ends
here.

00:20:39.373 --> 00:20:43.744
Now prepare yourselves. I'm
going to take your lights!

00:20:46.313 --> 00:20:50.817
My princess. Give us the
strength to fight one last time!

00:20:50.851 --> 00:20:52.686
[winces and pained grunts]

00:20:52.719 --> 00:20:54.321
[pained breaths]

00:20:54.922 --> 00:20:56.757
Begone, all of you!

00:20:58.592 --> 00:21:00.160
[weeping]

00:21:06.867 --> 00:21:08.101
What--?

00:21:08.902 --> 00:21:10.103
[gasp]

00:21:10.971 --> 00:21:11.738
[gasp]

00:21:14.174 --> 00:21:15.609
This radiance...!

00:21:26.086 --> 00:21:30.023
Is she the one light capable of
opposing me?

00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:33.293
The Light of Hope I sent out
into the galaxy?

00:21:34.595 --> 00:21:36.363
What is this light?

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.106
The Light of Hope is about to
awaken.
