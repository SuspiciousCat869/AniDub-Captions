<i>(Usagi) Dearest Mamo, please</i>
<i>forgive me!</i>

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:13.747
I allowed a man other than you,
<i>my beloved, into my home.</i>

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.552
<i>Even worse, Mom and Dad are</i>
<i>out, so now I'm all alone with</i>
<i>him in my room.</i>

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.421
Yes, I know, I know, it's very,
<i>very bad!</i>

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:25.492
<i>But don't worry. Your Usako</i>
<i>isn't that easy!</i>

00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:06.927
<i>(Usagi) What?! A burglar?</i>

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.031
Yeah, somebody's been breaking
into houses all over the
neighborhood lately.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:11.999
So be careful.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.401
Our house doesn't really have
anything worth taking.

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.336
That's where you're wrong,
Usagi.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.737
Huh?

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:18.605
There's your life, for one
thing.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.806
Come on! Ha!

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.042
Oh, I wouldn't take it so
lightly.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:26.580
Just the other day, the old
lady at the corner store was
threatened with a knife.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:27.414
[gasps]

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:31.818
Late one night, she heard a
noise coming from the backdoor
when... [screams]

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:32.786
[nervous]

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.688
Oh, stop exaggerating.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:37.558
Look, just stick with your
family and you'll be fine!

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:40.494
Except that I'm watching the
house all by myself tonight!

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:42.996
Aww. Well, I guess you're
toast, then.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.831
<i>(Ami) Minako.</i>

00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:45.432
[laughs]

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:46.900
(Seiya) I'll be your bodyguard.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.235
Seiya.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.839
If any burglar tries breaking
into your house, I'll kick his
butt.

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:52.940
You will?

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:54.608
It's pretty nice of me, huh?

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:55.442
Yeah!

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:56.510
No fair!

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:00.814
That means Seiya's gonna be
staying over at Usagi's place,
maybe all night!

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:02.583
You're right, that is not
fair.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:03.450
Oh, please.

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:11.425
(Usagi) "A Night Alone Together:
<i>Usagi in Danger."</i>

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.994
<i>(Usagi) [sighs] There!</i>

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:16.763
Everything nice and tidy.

00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:17.764
<i>(Luna) Sure is!</i>

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:21.969
Hmm. Bathroom, living room,
kitchen, anything else?

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:24.037
Oh yeah! I forgot the front
hall.

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:28.308
<i>(Usagi) [crashes]</i>

00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:31.945
Usagi, are you sure you're
going to be all right?

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.014
[groans] Yeah! I'll just mop
it up.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.617
No, not that. I meant about
Seiya.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.551
Huh?

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:40.354
What will you do if your
faithful, dependable watchdog...

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.890
suddenly turns into the big, bad
wolf, huh?

00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:44.591
[laughs] Don't be silly.

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:45.526
Usagi!

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:46.326
Yes?

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:50.097
At the end of the day, men are
nothing but animals acting on
instinct.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.632
So don't ever let your
guard down!

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:54.668
Wow. You really don't think
much of them.

00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:57.871
[gasps] Coming! [grunts]

00:03:57.905 --> 00:03:59.806
Hello? [gasps]

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.708
[grunts] Hi! Uh, welcome!

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:05.646
Were you in the middle of
doing yoga or something?

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:09.283
Please make yourself right at
home. I'll go get us something
to eat.

00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:27.901
You can't keep a girl waiting
forever, you know.

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.437
<i>(Usagi) I'm back! [chuckles]</i>

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:38.078
Which would you like, the
strawberry shortcake or the mont
blanc?

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.479
Oh, either is fine.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:43.016
Then I'll take the shortcake!
Or were you just saying that?

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.886
You're not usually this
unassertive, Seiya.

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.387
Then I'll have both!

00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:50.724
No! Take it from me, girls won't
like you if you're greedy.

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:54.795
That's fine. I'm not really
interested in getting girls to
like me.

00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:55.696
What?

00:04:57.264 --> 00:05:00.501
You see, when I sing, there is
only one woman whose attention
matters to me.

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:03.303
You mean you're only singing for
her?

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:06.206
That's right.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:11.545
Just her. We sing our hearts
out for that one special
person.

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:14.014
Hoping that she'll hear us.

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:19.486
Who is this special woman?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.222
<i>Watch it! You're leaning in</i>
<i>too close!</i>

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:25.092
I've been waiting till we were
alone together.

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:29.796
There's something that I've been
wanting to tell you. Promise me
you won't laugh.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.098
Okay.

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:34.635
Oh, no! This is bad, this is
bad!

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:38.739
Bun-Head, I... I have a...
confession to make.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:40.641
I...

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:43.410
Uh! This might not be such a
good idea.

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:47.381
Why not? I thought we said we
wouldn't keep secrets from
each other.

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:51.618
Well, yeah, but, I didn't
think you meant this kind of
secret.

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:52.619
[nervous]

00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:54.054
Come on, just hear me out!

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:56.590
No, really, I can't! [gasps]

00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:57.424

<i>(Chibi) Cake, cake! [giggles]</i>

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:10.537
Chibi-Chibi wanna!

00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:17.544
I missed the perfect chance to
tell her.

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:22.015
Wait, Chibi-Chibi. I'll get
it! Uh?

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:24.017
Hi, can we come in?

00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:25.519
What the heck?

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:26.753
Where is he?

00:06:26.787 --> 00:06:27.487
Huh?

00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:28.722
Where is Seiya?

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:30.424
Oh, so that's why you're here.

00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:34.261
Hope you don't mind, but after
we told Rei about Seiya being
here...

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:35.762
we thought we'd join the
sleepover.

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:38.799
Just because we thought you
might want more company.

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:39.399
That's right!

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:43.170
Not because we thought you and
he might be getting up to
hanky-panky or anything.

00:06:43.203 --> 00:06:44.238
[groan]

00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:44.938
Minako!

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:46.406
You had to go and say it.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.710
Thank you guys. I do appreciate
your concern.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.278

Hey Mako, what's wrong?

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.575
It's about Seiya.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.310
Oh, I know! What a body!

00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:24.511
Please, Minako.

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:27.214
What if we hadn't shown up when
we did?

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:28.582
Yeah!

00:07:29.683 --> 00:07:31.151
I can't believe you'd try to

I'm sure Usagi had her reasons
for, whatever.

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:42.229
Is something wrong?

We just won't tell Mamoru about
it.

No, it isn't like that!

Hi there, do you know if Seiya

Aw, thanks.

Pass. You should really play
the five of hearts next, Rei.

No way, Usagi, I'm not gonna
make it that easy for ya.

Okay, now it's my turn.

my play, aren't you?

I can't put anything past you,
Ami.

you?

it.

[giggles] No, no way!

Looks like we didn't need to
worry.

I'll say.

Eight teenage girls and boys
sitting around together
playing a game of cards.

Hey there, kitten.

00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:42.543
Good evening.

00:10:42.576 --> 00:10:44.144
So what brings you here?

00:10:44.178 --> 00:10:46.213
Well, we had a little car
trouble.

00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:49.082
Huh?

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:50.484
You again.

00:10:51.685 --> 00:10:53.554
What are you doing here?

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.760
Nope, I'm never bored with
Haruka.

00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:25.385
Isn't this one so cute?

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:26.320

You seem to have a lot of free
time. For such a busy celebrity.

00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:35.395
Not that it's any of your
business, but we had a
cancellation today.

00:11:35.429 --> 00:11:37.998
And anyway, I'm here as her
bodyguard.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.734
That right? So what're the other
guys doing here?

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:43.370
They supposed to be bodyguards
for the bodyguard?

00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:44.238
Say what?!

00:11:45.172 --> 00:11:48.709
Yeah, she needs protection. From
you guys.

00:11:48.742 --> 00:11:52.579
Hey, don't drag the rest of us
into this, we have nothing to
do with it!

00:11:52.613 --> 00:11:54.781
Yaten. Just ignore her.

00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:55.649
Hmph!

00:11:56.783 --> 00:11:59.520
Usagi, those two don't get
along very well, do they?

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:03.624
I think I know the reason
why. Haruka doesn't like boys.

00:12:03.657 --> 00:12:05.325
(Chibi-Chibi) Doesn't like boys.

00:12:05.893 --> 00:12:07.761
So that's it.

00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:10.197
Don't listen to her.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.934
Haruka doesn't like popular
boys.

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:15.636
Oh. Right.

00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:18.405
You're not helping, Michiru.

00:12:21.308 --> 00:12:22.209
Yes?

film your dinner?

00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:30.284

What's on the menu?

00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:35.389
Take-out pizza.

00:12:36.557 --> 00:12:39.059
Pizza! Always a favorite! So
you mind if we come on in?

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.762
Uh, wait, let me just clean up
for a minute!

Well? What do we do?

A TV crew?

That's a problem.

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:50.204
If they show us hanging out at a
girl's house at night...

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:52.372
it's not going to be very good
for our image.

But you don't have me alone,

target, and you were the
one who brought me here.

And come to think of it, this
whole thing was your idea,
pretty much.

00:19:00.841 --> 00:19:04.511
It's getting a little cramped
in here. You should've found a
bigger house for this party.

00:19:04.545 --> 00:19:05.579
Quiet, you!

00:19:06.914 --> 00:19:08.282
<i>(Sailor Star Healer) Breaking</i>
<i>through the darkness of night.</i>

00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.018
(Sailor Star Maker) Traveling
unchained across the atmosphere.

00:19:12.186 --> 00:19:13.487
(Sailor Star Fighter) The three
<i>sacred shooting stars!</i>

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.756
Sailor Star Fighter!

00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:18.158
Sailor Star Maker!

00:19:18.192 --> 00:19:21.361
Sailor Star Healer!

00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:26.500
We are the Sailor Star
Lights! Stage on!

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:30.871
This place is a little tight,
Sailor Moon.

00:19:30.904 --> 00:19:36.777
[grunts] It always seemed plenty
big to me, I never even thought
about it. But looking at it now.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:37.978
It seems small.

00:19:39.646 --> 00:19:41.448
Star Gentle...!

00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:43.584
No, wait, don't do that!

00:19:43.617 --> 00:19:45.319
[grunts] What gives? Let go!

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:46.920
You can't use that attack in
here!

00:19:46.954 --> 00:19:48.622
Stop it!

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:49.890
Yeah, get off her!

00:19:49.923 --> 00:19:50.958
Uh, hello?

00:19:50.991 --> 00:19:52.226
Stay out of this!

00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:54.361
Now, Sailor Moon! Hurry!

00:19:54.795 --> 00:19:55.729
Mhm.

00:20:18.886 --> 00:20:28.662
Starlight Honeymoon Therapy
Kiss!

00:20:32.366 --> 00:20:36.670
[screams]

00:20:36.703 --> 00:20:38.705
Thank you for a lovely dinner!

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.715
Until next time.

00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:49.249
[gasps]

00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:53.320
Why'd they even show up again?

00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:54.955
So long, kitten.

00:20:54.988 --> 00:20:57.191
We'll be on our way, too.
[chuckles]

00:20:57.224 --> 00:21:00.327
Wait! You're not going to help
me clean up?! [groans]

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.963
Uh, guys?

00:21:02.996 --> 00:21:06.366
A little help here? My arms
are getting tired.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.936
<i>(Seiya) Well that didn't take</i>
<i>too long to clean up.</i>

00:21:08.969 --> 00:21:11.305
[sighs] Only all night.

00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:12.439
I'm pooped.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.474
[gasps]

00:21:14.508 --> 00:21:15.976
Huh? What was that??

00:21:16.009 --> 00:21:17.444
It came from the hallway.

00:21:19.346 --> 00:21:20.514
A burglar?

00:21:20.547 --> 00:21:22.249
Don't worry, I'm on it.

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:24.551
[gasps] Look, look, right
there!

00:21:24.585 --> 00:21:26.153
<i>(Mako) Could that be?</i>

00:21:26.186 --> 00:21:29.656
[growls] You dare??

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.191
Mako, cut that out!

00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:34.595
All right, we'll all jump him
on the count of three. Got it?

00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:36.496
Okay, one, two, three!

00:21:37.564 --> 00:21:41.068
[scared screams]

00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:43.837
[sloppy eating] Chibi-Chibi.

00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:45.105
Chibi-Chibi!

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:46.240
You really scared us!

00:21:46.273 --> 00:21:48.075
Another mess to clean up!

00:21:48.108 --> 00:21:52.179
Yum! Chibi-Chibi! [giggles]

00:23:35.315 --> 00:23:38.085
(Usagi) Taiki, what do you mean
<i>you're canceling the concert?!</i>

00:23:38.118 --> 00:23:41.522
<i>(Taiki) I can't go on singing</i>
<i>when no one understands our</i>
<i>message.</i>

00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:45.058
<i>(Usagi) Well wait. Before you</i>
go, can you at least take a look
<i>at this drawing?</i>

00:23:45.092 --> 00:23:47.127
<i>(Taiki) [gasp] Who drew this?</i>

00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:51.899
<i>(Usagi) A little girl who's a</i>
<i>big fan of yours. But she's</i>
<i>very, very sick.</i>

00:23:51.932 --> 00:23:53.267
<i>(Taiki) Sick?</i>

00:23:54.968 --> 00:23:57.104
<i>(Usagi) Next time on Sailor</i>
Stars, "Taiki's Song Filled with
<i>Passion and Faith."</i>

00:23:57.137 --> 00:24:00.207
<i>The moonlight is a messenger</i>
<i>of love.</i>
