00:01:56.083 --> 00:02:00.521
Taiki is really something to be
able to go toe-to-toe with Ami,
don't you think?

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:02.155
Yeah, tell me about it!

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.991
Wait, that's it!

00:02:04.024 --> 00:02:04.658
What's it?

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.895
I'm gonna go ask Taiki to help
me out with my homework!

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:09.830
Oh! I want that too!

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.164

Hey, Taiki!

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.774
I was doing the math homework we
got, but I got really confused!
Could you help me out?

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.543
I need some help too.

Go ahead. You can copy my notes.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.189
Thank you! [annoyed grunt]

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:38.525
What are you doing, Minako!?

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:39.860
I should have it first!

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.228
<i>(Usagi) Why's that?!</i>

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.530
<i>(Minako) Because! I got here</i>
<i>before you did!</i>

00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:47.935
Yeah, sure, but by one second,
maybe. [grunts] Why should that
matter?

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:52.840
[grunts] Even if it was by a
hundred thousandth of a second,
first, it's still first!

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:55.976
<i>(Usagi) You're always using</i>
<i>silly arguments like that,</i>
<i>Minako!</i>

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.680
<i>(Minako) Haven't you heard the</i>
<i>saying, "The early bird is</i>
<i>mightier than the sword?!"</i>

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:00.981
<i>(Usagi) Never heard of it!</i>

00:03:02.216 --> 00:03:03.750
I believe you mean, "The early
bird gets the worm," right?

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:08.055

[cry of despair]

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:22.336
That's odd. Those two haven't
asked for help lately. I wonder
why.

(Usagi) "A Star of Dreams and

<i>(Ami) Mr. Amanogawa!</i>

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.353
Mm? Miss Mizuno!

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:44.491
In a few more days, we'll
finally be able to see the comet
that you discovered!

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:49.630
Ahh. I haven't seen Francoise in
fifteen years now.

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:51.665
Francoise?

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:55.035
Oh! Yes, the comet.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:58.472
I'm happy she's finally
returning from her long journey
through space.

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:03.744
[giggles] The way you talk about
the comet makes it sound like
your lover!

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:05.879
[embarrassed] Well...

00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:10.751
I calculated the exact time when
it'll be visible. It's tomorrow
at...

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:12.286
<i>(Taiki) 9:15pm.</i>

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.886
Huh?

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.488
It'll be to the south.

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:18.926
Visible for just ten minutes as
it passes through the
constellation Centaurus.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.195
Aren't you one of the new
transfer students?

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:21.995
Yes.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.099
I'm so honored to have two
students at this school who are
aware of my research.

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:31.071
On the contrary sir, the honor
is mine. You were invited by
Cambridge University...

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.775
to join their research team at
the Institute of Theoretical
Astronomy.

00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:39.279
I must admit I was a bit
surprised to learn this about
our very own physics teacher.

00:04:39.313 --> 00:04:41.448
You seem to know a lot about me.

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.483
It was in the handout I was
given.

00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:44.418
Handout?

00:04:45.853 --> 00:04:48.255
You're involved in a taping for
a children's show, isn't that
right?

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.223
Yes.

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:54.027
Well, I happen to be hosting
that program with you. That's
why I was briefed on your work.

00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:55.362
Ah, I see!

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.899
Sir, why haven't you taken up
the offer to go to Cambridge?

00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:04.505
I suppose, I'd rather observe
the stars than study them, ya
know?

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.410
Looking up at the night sky, it
excites my imagination.

00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:14.448
Questions about where we came
from, and where we go.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.783
I never realized that you were
such a dreamer.

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:21.788
[laughing] Well, the universe
is filled with dreams and
wonder.

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:25.692
With all due respect, such
things have no place in a
learning environment.

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:26.527
Huh?

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:32.499
That's not true, Taiki. It's
because of his wonder of the
universe...

00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:35.869
that he ended up discovering
Wataru's Comet in the first
place.

00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:37.504
Your name is Ami, correct?

00:05:37.538 --> 00:05:38.505
Yes.

00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:44.311
I can't believe I share the top
grades with someone who'd say
that.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.212
Huh?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.649
[awkward sighs]

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:53.320
I have an idea! How would you
two like to come visit my place
tomorrow night?

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.988
We can watch
the comet together!

00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:56.456
Sure!

00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:04.464
[sad sigh]

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:08.368
<i>(Makoto) Wataru's Comet?</i>

00:06:08.402 --> 00:06:11.638
Mr. Amanogawa invited me to come
watch it tomorrow night.

00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:16.577
Can you imagine having a comet
with your name roaming the deep
reaches of the universe?

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.278
It sounds so romantic.

00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:23.784
It sure does! Maybe Mamo and I
could discover a comet and call
it "Usagi &amp; Mamo's Comet."

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:25.052
Wouldn't that be great?

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:26.653
[sighs] Sure, Usagi.

00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:30.357
But, why do you think he calls
the comet Francoise though?

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.026
I'll bet it's the name of the
person who broke his heart.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.095
[awkward laughter]

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.297
I think it's the name of his
sweetheart.

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:43.237
I was actually thinking the same
thing myself. She must be a
really wonderful person.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.140
Someone wonderful with Mr.
Amanogawa?

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:52.479
[goofy laugh]

00:06:52.513 --> 00:06:54.982
Oh! [giggling]

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.118
On to more important matters,
Ami.

00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:03.490
A little birdie told me he's
gonna be appearing on TV today
with Taiki.

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:05.659
How did you know that?

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:08.996
I think we should go and tell
them that we're his students.

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:11.498
Then they'd have to let us into
the taping!

00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:13.400
[impressed sighs]

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:28.415
"Wataru's Comet makes its first
near-Earth approach in 15
years."

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:33.854
Oh! This is who discovered it? I
have to say, I quite like what
I'm seeing.

00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:38.192
(Nezu) Plus discovering a comet
<i>is a pretty impressive feat.</i>

00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:42.729
It's decided then! He will be my
next target.

00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:47.634
(Amanogawa) In conclusion, there
are still many, many stars that
<i>we don't know about yet.</i>

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:53.173
Who knows! Perhaps they're out
there, waiting for one of you to
discover them someday.

00:07:53.207 --> 00:07:54.675
Thank you very much.

00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:59.446
Now, does anyone here have a
question for Mr. Amanogawa?

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:03.817
I do! I do! Me! I have a
question! Pick me! Call on me!

00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:05.886
Huh. Who should I pick?

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:09.022
<i>(Kids) Me! Me! I do! I have a</i>
<i>question!</i>

00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:13.727
How about you in the upper row,
in the blue sweatshirt.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.132
Hello, sir. My grandfather told
me that when we die, we go on to
become the stars in the sky.

00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:20.601
Is that really true?

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:22.035
[giggling]

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:24.371
Yes, that very well could be.

00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:25.205
Huh?

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:29.176
A number of myths and legends
speak upon this manner of
reincarnation...

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:34.414
that your Grandfather described.
It's possible that in order to
help guide us on our way...

00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:37.518
our ancestors returned to us as
stars.

00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:38.719
I see!

00:08:40.254 --> 00:08:43.657
Mr. Amanogawa sure knows a lot
of stuff, doesn't he.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.558
Yes.

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:46.493
Sir.

00:08:46.894 --> 00:08:48.095
Huh?

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:51.865
That's not how it works. The
dead can't become stars.

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:52.566
[gasps]

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:57.037
It's the power from living
people that creates the stars.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:02.576
[excited/curious murmuring]

00:09:04.344 --> 00:09:05.379
[intrigued]

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.147
Huh?

00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:11.185
"The power from living people
creates the stars." Hmm.

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:13.620
I didn't know Taiki was such a
romantic!

00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:16.023
Huh?

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:24.464
<i>(Taiki) Thanks for waiting.</i>

00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:25.566
Hey, Taiki!

00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:30.237
So what did you wish to speak to
me about, Ami?

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.406
Um, tomorrow night.

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:37.611
I wondered if you'd reconsider
going with us to our teacher's
place, to watch the comet.

00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:41.048
Seriously? Are you still
obsessed with all of that?

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:44.017
You don't even see the reality
you're facing, do you.

00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:45.886
What do you mean?

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:50.257
Your "wonder of the universe,"
is no match against the weather.

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:52.025
[gasps]

00:09:55.162 --> 00:10:01.235
The weather reports say there's
a 100% chance of rain tomorrow,
too. Good luck.

00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:05.739
<i>(Ami) I won't give up hope!</i>

00:10:07.674 --> 00:10:12.579
Like I said, dreams and wonder
are what helped make Wataru's
Comet become reality!

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.147
[chuckles]

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:18.785
You can spout idealism all you
like, but it isn't gonna stop
this rain.

00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:20.153
[speechless]

00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:26.126
I'll join you if the weather
gets better.

00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:31.098
You okay?

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:21.148
<i>(Usagi) Ami, let's go home.</i>

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.449
Uh?

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:24.084
Cheer up, don't worry.

00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:25.219
But...

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.355
I'm sure the sky will clear up.
Everything will be fine.

00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:30.757
Thanks, Usagi.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.982
I won't give up hope!

00:11:56.683 --> 00:11:59.086
Like I said, dreams and wonder
are what helped make Wataru's
Comet become reality.

00:11:59.853 --> 00:12:00.754
[gasps]

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.502
This must be the place.

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:19.940
It's not letting up.

00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:22.643
Sometimes, things are out of our
control.

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:23.477
But...!

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:25.512
Hm?

00:12:27.347 --> 00:12:28.315
Yes?

00:12:29.783 --> 00:12:32.553
<i>(Nezu) Hello, I'm a producer</i>
with Ginga TV. Do you have a few
<i>minutes?</i>

00:12:33.587 --> 00:12:35.856
I'm very sorry, but...

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:38.926
I'd like to keep this interview
short if that's possible.

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:44.565
I think there's been some
mistake. The person I'm looking
to interview is Mr. Amanogawa.

Huh? Yeah, that's me.

Not his Dad! I mean the
astronomer.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.372
Yes. I'm Wataru Amanogawa.

00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:53.607

Nooooo!

This man in the picture is you?!

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:00.447
Let me see.

00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:04.518
Ahh. This is from 15 years
ago.

00:13:04.551 --> 00:13:09.089
Man, really? In other words,
he's not so cute anymore.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.024
Oh well, it can't be helped.

Pretty please?

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:28.569
I'll leave the curriculum to

Why did you do that?!

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.486
Because this teacher is a
person who I respect. Please,
don't hurt him!

The teacher you admired no

him.

No, there has to be a way!

00:16:42.736 --> 00:16:46.373
A way to turn him back into the
person who talked about dreams
and wonder.

00:16:48.141 --> 00:16:50.744
Are those things that important
to you?

Chasing after our dreams and
seeing wonder in the world!

That's what gives us the spark
that drives us as human beings!

[gasps]

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.290
That's not true, Taiki. It's
because of his wonder of the
universe...

00:17:03.323 --> 00:17:07.294
that he ended up discovering
Wataru's Comet in the first
place.

00:17:07.327 --> 00:17:10.364
[chuckles] So that's what
you meant by that.
