A free batch of tickets at

You pulled some strings,
didn't you?

exactly?

Uh.

Why were you so impressed if
you didn't know what it meant?

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:04.978
A joint concert is when two or
more groups collaborate...

together during the same live
performance.

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:09.650

Michiru Kaioh. I wonder what
kind of person she is?

00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:46.947
I gotta say, I'm not crazy about
doing a concert with someone we
don't know.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.482
(Taiki) That's not our concern.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:49.082
Hm?

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:54.188
We're putting on this show for
the sake of our Princess, her
and no one else.

Seriously, what's holding up

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:13.240
Maybe she took the wrong bus...

off somewhere in the middle of
the mountains.

She would.

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.317
No! Even Usagi wouldn't do
that, let's give her a little
credit.

I am not!

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.188
So what were you gonna do to
Michiru if we hadn't shown up?

00:11:28.222 --> 00:11:30.457
I- I wasn't gonna do anything!

00:12:08.128 --> 00:12:11.064
Hey, Bun-head! You alright?
[grunts]

00:12:12.933 --> 00:12:16.904
[moans] I'm so sorry!

00:12:16.937 --> 00:12:19.506
[groans]

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.075
I hope I didn't injure you, my
dear.

00:12:22.109 --> 00:12:23.610
<i>(Seiya) Mr. Garajan?!</i>

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.813
[grunting] Are you all right,
sir?

00:12:26.847 --> 00:12:27.614
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:29.750
Huh? He your teacher or
something?

00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:33.453
You don't know Mr. Garajan?!
He's a world famous conductor!

00:12:33.487 --> 00:12:35.289
Mr. Carry-on?!

00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:37.324
He's not luggage, show some
respect!

00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:43.096
[laughing] What an amusing
young lady. Is she your
girlfriend?

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.698
Well, I guess you could say
that.

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:47.134
[groans] Uh, no. You really
couldn't say that.

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:49.536
You don't have to sound so mad
about it.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.037
Hmph!

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:51.138
<i>(Garajan) By the way, Seiya.</i>

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:52.239
Uh, yes?

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.975
Today's concert was simply
marvelous.

00:12:55.008 --> 00:12:56.710
Thank you very much.

00:12:56.743 --> 00:13:01.215
I felt a mysterious wave of
energy coming from your music.

00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:02.015
Huh?

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:06.019
There was such passion behind
it, but also something gentle.

00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:08.555
I even felt a sense of
melancholy there.

00:13:08.589 --> 00:13:12.860
It was like you were sending a
message to someone you loved.
[chuckles]

00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:16.997
I'm sure this sounds like the
ramblings of an old fool.
[groans]

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.031
Are you okay?

00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:19.766
Lemme take you back to your
room.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.168
No need, young man.

00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:26.006
I'm sure taking in the night air
will clear my head. I'll
just take a little stroll.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.141
Oh, and Seiya.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.346
<i>(Garajan) If your music was</i>
intended as a message to a loved
<i>one...</i>

00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:35.983
I hope it reaches them as
soon as possible.

00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:37.618
Thank you.

00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:40.988
[chuckles] Ow!

00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:44.658
So, is that Carry-on guy
really that big of deal?

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:46.026
It's Garajan!

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:48.028
Right, Garajan.

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:52.032
Sheesh. I already told you
he's a conductor.

00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:56.904
<i>(Seiya) You saw the New Tokyo</i>
<i>Orchestra performing during</i>
<i>today's final act, right?</i>

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:59.072
That was him, front and center.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.475
Right.

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:04.344
Wait! You didn't see the
show, did you?

00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:07.714
Uh. Well you see, it's kinda a
long story.

00:14:07.748 --> 00:14:08.615
I bet it is.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.752
Anyway, I really hope that he's
all right.

00:14:11.785 --> 00:14:14.188
I should check on him, just in
case.

00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:15.088
'Kay.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.861
He picked up on our music. Our
message seems to be getting
out.

00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:22.696
That's such a relief to
hear.

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:33.207
[sighs] Ow! That was quite the
collision. My head is still
throbbing!

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.643
<i>(Nezu) I'm afraid it might get</i>
<i>much, much worse.</i>

00:14:36.677 --> 00:14:38.178
And you are?

00:14:38.212 --> 00:14:42.216
A producer with Ginga TV by
the name of...Huh?

00:14:42.249 --> 00:14:47.087
Hang on, darn-it. Where'd my
card go? It's not here!

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.722
Do you need help, miss?

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:52.359
Aw man! Fine! Just forget it!

00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:54.294
Chuu!

00:14:54.862 --> 00:14:55.596
[gasps]

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.699
That Star Seed of yours, gimme
it!

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:00.767
[gasps]

00:15:03.604 --> 00:15:06.740
Oh mein Gott!

00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:08.408
[gasps]

00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:12.679
Nein!

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:18.752
[grunts]

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:19.987
Mr. Garajan!

00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:30.063
Moon Eternal Make Up!

00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:09.870
<i>(Nezu) My, what a wonderful</i>
<i>glow!</i>

00:16:09.903 --> 00:16:12.639
Could it be?! Hm.

00:16:12.673 --> 00:16:15.108
<i>(Nezu) Oh, gimme a break!</i>

00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:19.079
[growls] This one's a dud too!
Whatever, moving on!

00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:20.514
<i>(Sailor Moon) Hold it right</i>
<i>there!</i>

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:21.114
Huh?!

00:16:22.783 --> 00:16:25.752
The elderly are our teachers
in life! You should treat them
with the upmost respect!

00:16:25.786 --> 00:16:30.457
I am the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for
justice!

00:16:33.927 --> 00:16:36.430
I am Sailor Moon!

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:41.401
And in the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:43.270
Yeah, yeah.

00:16:43.303 --> 00:16:45.372
Don't you walk away from
me!

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.377
I don't have time to play with
you right now. I have to work
overtime today.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.979
Bye-bye!

00:16:52.613 --> 00:16:53.747
Get back here!

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.517
[gasping] This isn't good.

00:17:00.487 --> 00:17:04.191
I am Sailor Conductor!

00:17:04.224 --> 00:17:06.994
I was afraid this was gonna
happen.

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:09.730
Welcome to this evening's
concert.

00:17:09.763 --> 00:17:10.330
Hm?

00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:15.002
Let us begin with the first
movement: Piano!

00:17:15.636 --> 00:17:16.670
[gasps]

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:20.107
Second movement: Cello!

00:17:20.574 --> 00:17:21.975
[screams]

00:17:22.009 --> 00:17:25.412
On to the third movement:
Violin!

00:17:26.013 --> 00:17:28.282
[screeching]

00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:29.016
[gasps]

00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:31.485
[whimpers]

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:36.423
[chuckles] And to close out
our performance, the final
movement!

00:17:37.257 --> 00:17:38.158
Hm?

00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:40.294
Who's there?!

00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:44.565
<i>(Sailor Star Healer) Breaking</i>
<i>through the darkness of night.</i>

00:17:44.598 --> 00:17:47.167
(Sailor Star Maker) Traveling
unchained across the atmosphere.

00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:50.170
(Sailor Star Fighter) The three
<i>sacred shooting stars!</i>

00:17:50.204 --> 00:17:52.272
Sailor Star Fighter!

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:55.075
Sailor Star Maker!

00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:57.511
Sailor Star Healer!

00:17:58.712 --> 00:18:01.381
We are the Sailor Star Lights!

00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:03.684
Stage on!

00:18:05.719 --> 00:18:06.854
<i>(Sailor Moon) You're here!</i>

00:18:06.887 --> 00:18:08.422
[grunts]

00:18:09.156 --> 00:18:13.160
Star Serious Laser!

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:16.597
What?! Nein!

00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:22.603
You just can't stay out of
trouble, can you?

00:18:22.636 --> 00:18:24.104
Sorry about that.

00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:25.906
[grunts]

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:26.840
Sailor Moon!

00:18:26.874 --> 00:18:28.075
Right!

00:18:51.398 --> 00:19:01.408
Starlight Honeymoon Therapy
Kiss!

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:11.285
[grunting] Beautiful!

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:24.198
<i>(Sailor Moon) Wait!</i>

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:29.703
I wanted to thank you for all
you've done for me. You've
saved me so many times.

00:19:29.736 --> 00:19:32.606
I was wondering if you'd like
to team up together.

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:35.475
What do you think?

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:38.245
Well we do seem to share a
common enemy.

00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:41.248
I guess it's fine as long as
she doesn't hold us back.

00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:43.250
Well, there's your answer.

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:45.652
[giggles]

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:48.655
Thank you.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.095
[scared scream]

00:19:55.128 --> 00:19:56.430
Who's there?!

00:19:56.463 --> 00:19:59.499
Get lost. I won't miss next
time!

00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:05.772
Wait a minute! Uranus, what
are you doing?!

00:20:05.806 --> 00:20:09.343
Those three are trespassers
from outside the solar system.

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:10.244
[gasps]

00:20:10.277 --> 00:20:12.346
Such beings can't be trusted!

00:20:14.114 --> 00:20:18.018
No! You've got them all wrong!
I don't know what you've heard,
but they are good people!

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.253
Out of our way!

00:20:20.254 --> 00:20:20.787
<i>(Sailor Star Fighter) Know</i>
<i>what? Forget it.</i>

00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:22.055
Huh?!

00:20:23.156 --> 00:20:24.558
If you don't want us in your
group, then so be it.

00:20:24.591 --> 00:20:28.562
We've been managing things
just fine on our own.

00:20:28.595 --> 00:20:32.766
I'm sorry. But it looks like
we will never see eye-to-eye.

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:36.336
No, don't say that. Wait!

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:41.542
I'm sure that's not true. I
know we could make it work.

00:20:41.575 --> 00:20:46.647
I don't get it. Why can't we
join forces and work together
with them?

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.618
Our mission is to make sure
you're safe from outside forces.
We can't take any risks.

00:20:51.652 --> 00:20:54.154
Please try to understand.

00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:58.992
[sighs]

00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:06.033
<i>(Seiya) Bun-head?</i>

00:21:06.533 --> 00:21:07.367
Hm?

00:21:09.069 --> 00:21:10.871
You're still here?

00:21:10.904 --> 00:21:12.940
Lemme walk you home, it's
late.

00:21:12.973 --> 00:21:14.942
Hey, Seiya?

00:21:14.975 --> 00:21:15.676
Yeah?

00:21:17.077 --> 00:21:19.246
If you met people who came from
somewhere that was very
different...

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:24.184
from what you were used to,
would that stop you from being
friends with them?

00:21:24.218 --> 00:21:26.053
What brought that up?

00:21:26.954 --> 00:21:28.722
Just, what do you think?

00:21:28.755 --> 00:21:32.926
What a strange thing to ask
someone. What can I really say
about it?

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:38.098
I mean, I'm a transfer student
from a far away town you've
probably never even heard of.

00:21:38.398 --> 00:21:39.166
[gasps]

00:21:40.434 --> 00:21:43.036
But that didn't stop the two of
us from becoming friends, right?

00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:46.073
That's true.

00:21:47.174 --> 00:21:50.244
[stretching] I feel a lot
better now!

00:21:50.277 --> 00:21:52.179
(Seiya) What was that all about,
<i>anyway?</i>

00:21:52.212 --> 00:21:53.981
<i>(Usagi) It's nothing. Let's go</i>
<i>home!</i>

00:21:54.014 --> 00:21:56.183
(Seiya) [chuckling] You're such
<i>a weirdo.</i>

00:23:36.183 --> 00:23:38.752
(Seiya) Hey Bun-head, why're you
<i>so nervous?</i>

00:23:38.785 --> 00:23:40.454
<i>(Usagi) What?! I'm not!</i>

00:23:40.487 --> 00:23:43.190
<i>I dunno if I should be alone</i>
<i>in this room with him.</i>

00:23:43.223 --> 00:23:45.025
<i>(Seiya) It's your first time,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

00:23:45.058 --> 00:23:45.692
<i>(Usagi) [yelps]</i>

00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:49.396
<i>(Seiya) Just relax. I'll take</i>
<i>real good care of you. You're</i>
<i>gonna love it.</i>

00:23:50.864 --> 00:23:52.833
(Usagi) No, I can't! Mamo's the
<i>only person I could do this</i>
<i>with!</i>

00:23:52.866 --> 00:23:54.034
<i>(Seiya) Come on.</i>

00:23:55.736 --> 00:23:58.071
<i>(Usagi) Next time on Sailor</i>
<i>Stars, "Seiya and Usagi's</i>
<i>Heart-Pounding Date."</i>

00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:01.375
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
