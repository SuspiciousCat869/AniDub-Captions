1
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:23,100
Koneko?

2
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:25,333
Don't move a
muscle, Gaspie.

3
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:29,700
[KONEKO] Humans?

4
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:31,233
[MAGICIAN 11A]
Yes, that's right.

5
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:33,366
We are indeed human,
but we're somewhat different

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,366
in that we utilize magic

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,600
by rebuilding the
structure of devil magic.

8
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:39,466
We're known as magicians.

9
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:42,733
[MAGICIAN 11D] If it helps
you understand a bit better,

10
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:43,666
we're on the same level

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,433
as what you devils
call mid-ranking devils.

12
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:49,200
It would be best if you
did what you were told.

13
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,466
[MAGICIAN 11C] Hand the
half-vampire over to us.

14
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:58,433
[MAGICIAN 11C] We've already
confirmed that he's here.

15
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,100
[GASPER]
What's going on out there?

16
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:11,233
[MAGICIAN 11A] There's
nowhere for you to run.

17
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:12,600
Nowhere at all.

18
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,500
[MAGICIAN 11B]
There's magic on the door.

19
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:26,100
[MAGICIAN 11A] I did think
there was something strange

20
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:28,433
about this room when
we first infiltrated.

21
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:29,700
I was right.

22
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,766
[MAGICIAN 11C] I'm assuming they
must be hiding in there, now.

23
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:35,800
[KONEKO] We should
be able to stall here

24
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,633
for at least a little while.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,133
Don't worry.

26
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:44,100
I'm sure Rias and the
others will come to save you.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,700
Yeah. I'm sure
they will.

28
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,600
Koneko!

29
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:55,300
[MAGICIAN 11F]
I've been waiting for you.

30
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:00,266
[MAGICIAN 11C]
That magic square will render

31
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,600
all physical powers
one possesses useless.

32
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:05,433
There's no use struggling.

33
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:06,766
[GASPER]
Please, you have to stop!

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,266
What are you even trying to do!

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,000
[KONEKO] Gaspie. I'm sorry.

36
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,000
Gaspie.

37
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,233
Our perpetual
three-way stalemate

38
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:30,066
is getting rather old and hardly
doing this world any favors.

39
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,666
I assume we're
all in agreement on that?

40
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:09,018
God and the
Devil King are gone.

41
00:04:09,051 --> 00:04:11,884
Both of our war generals
have been annihilated.

42
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:17,818
[XENOVIA thinking] Irina.

43
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:20,751
I suppose she must have
heard the truth by now.

44
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:23,618
We have a complication.

45
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:25,984
Once again it's not
even our three powers.

46
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:28,984
But these forces are equally,
if not more, destructive.

47
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,018
They are the Red,
and White Dragon Emperors.

48
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:34,818
So, I'd like to
hear their thoughts.

49
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:38,551
What I want is to fight
someone who's as strong as me.

50
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:40,618
Heh. Yes, but
you can still find

51
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:43,618
a lot of powerful opponents
without having a war.

52
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:45,584
I suppose.

53
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,784
[AZAZEL] And you,
Red Dragon Emperor?

54
00:04:48,818 --> 00:04:49,451
Thoughts?

55
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:51,751
I uh-- um, wow.

56
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:54,718
Yeah, I'm not good at coming up
with stuff on the spot, so, uh--

57
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:55,984
I see.

58
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:59,384
Well, then why don't I make it
a little easier for you, Issei.

59
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:01,384
Try to focus here.

60
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:03,418
If we start fighting again,

61
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:06,584
you'll never be able to have
your way with Rias Gremory.

62
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:07,351
[ISSEI] Uh?

63
00:05:07,384 --> 00:05:08,718
[gasp]

64
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:11,684
But, if we make peace, instead,

65
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:15,718
then prosperity and propagation
become far more important.

66
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:19,684
You mean, like,
baby making?

67
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:21,518
That's right.

68
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,984
Imagine those training sessions.

69
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:26,418
And you could practice
every single day.

70
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,584
Hey, I'm right here!

71
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,651
[sighs]

72
00:05:29,684 --> 00:05:32,584
Peace means a daily
dose of Rias lovin'.

73
00:05:32,618 --> 00:05:34,951
War means no sexy time.

74
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:36,018
You understand?

75
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:38,784
Is that simple enough for you?

76
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:40,984
[ISSEI thinking]
If there's peace between us,

77
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:42,984
then I could actually get
my dirty-dirty freak-freak

78
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:43,984
on with Rias?

79
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:46,351
Can my dreams really come true?

80
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:49,084
Wait. Am I in the position
to make that happen?

81
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:50,118
Even if I'm not,

82
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:53,951
at least with no fighting,
there'd be a chance.

83
00:05:55,818 --> 00:05:57,451
Peace is number one!

84
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:00,051
Yeah. Peace for me, please!

85
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:02,651
I'm gonna do it
with Rias so hard!

86
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:04,884
Hey, Issei, you might want

87
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,018
to notice her brother
is still present.

88
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:09,918
[snickers]

89
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:10,984
[sighs]

90
00:06:11,018 --> 00:06:13,784
Both of you
are nightmares.

91
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:15,951
She likes it.

92
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:16,684
[ISSEI thinking]
Maybe I should

93
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,918
stop talking out
loud altogether.

94
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:22,851
So, anyway,
bottom line is, dude.

95
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:24,451
I'm not gonna use
my power unless

96
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,384
I'm helping Rias and my friends.

97
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,618
That's just the way it is.

98
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,884
Red Dragon Emperor.

99
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:35,518
Did you still have a
question you wanted to ask me?

100
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:36,484
I do.

101
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:38,751
Although I didn't figure
you'd remember that.

102
00:06:38,784 --> 00:06:41,118
[MICHAEL] I made a promise.

103
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:45,018
All right.
You weren't fair to Asia.

104
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:46,984
I want to
know why you guys

105
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:48,818
kicked her out of the church.

106
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:50,484
She loves God more than anyone.

107
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:52,718
Issei, stop.

108
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:54,718
[MICHAEL]
After God was destroyed.

109
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:56,651
Only the system remained.

110
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,951
The only thing we
had to keep the faith

111
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:01,651
was our power to administer
divine protection,

112
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:03,751
mercy, and miracles.

113
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:04,984
Even with me as the center,

114
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:08,018
the church is barely
functioning right now.

115
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:09,884
Consequently,
there was a need

116
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,351
to avoid anything that could
negatively affect our system.

117
00:07:13,384 --> 00:07:15,051
So, you had to.

118
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:16,484
I mean, Asia could heal devils

119
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:19,118
and fallen angels
on top of humans.

120
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:20,618
[MICHAEL] Indeed.

121
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:22,084
The faith of
believers is the reason

122
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:24,751
those of us in Heaven exist.

123
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:27,651
A threat to the system is
a threat to our survival.

124
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:29,951
Therefore, anything that
could negatively affect it

125
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:31,584
had to be removed.

126
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,451
Of course, that's why
I suffered Asia's fate, too.

127
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:38,451
Along with others
who found out the truth.

128
00:07:38,484 --> 00:07:41,018
Exactly. It <i>was</i> unfair.

129
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:42,818
You were hardly heretics.

130
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:45,418
We should have
discovered another way.

131
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:47,618
I ask your forgiveness.

132
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:51,118
[IRINA thinking]
Then she didn't betray us?

133
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:53,751
Apology accepted,
Chief Michael.

134
00:07:53,784 --> 00:07:55,418
It's interesting.

135
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:56,751
I grew up in the church,

136
00:07:56,784 --> 00:08:00,584
so I must admit,
I do have a few regrets.

137
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:02,484
But to be perfectly honest,

138
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:05,851
I am more than satisfied
with my life as a devil.

139
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:12,751
I am sad, though.
For the other believers.

140
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:16,818
[ASIA] As am I.

141
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:20,051
And I'm so much
happier as a devil, too.

142
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:23,418
I've met people I cherish
who also care about me.

143
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:26,351
Both of you have
forgiving spirits.

144
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:28,651
And I am grateful for that.

145
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:33,118
Oh, right.
I've heard of her.

146
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:36,651
Wasn't one of my underlings
responsible for killing you?

147
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,651
[ISSEI] Yeah, and you
should be apologizing!

148
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:42,118
You wanna know why that
fallen angel bitch killed her?

149
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:45,784
Because she wanted to be like
you, you stupid asshole!

150
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:52,784
[AZAZEL] Naturally,
I take full responsibility.

151
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:57,518
So to atone, I will satisfy
you in a way that only I can.

152
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:58,418
How?

153
00:08:58,451 --> 00:08:59,818
Calm down, Issei.

154
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:06,451
What in the hell?

155
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,118
They're frozen.

156
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,518
[ISSEI] Is it just me,
or did time stop?

157
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:14,851
[AZAZEL] It appears so.

158
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:15,751
Fortunately, those of us

159
00:09:15,784 --> 00:09:18,584
with superior powers
weren't affected.

160
00:09:18,618 --> 00:09:20,018
Thank our dragons.

161
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:22,084
They protected us.

162
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:22,884
The heavenly bunch over there

163
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:25,618
were shielded by
their Holy Swords.

164
00:09:26,118 --> 00:09:28,751
What?
I don't understand.

165
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:35,084
I'm okay thanks to you, Issei.

166
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:36,751
You did it again.

167
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:40,584
[loud crashing sound]

168
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:43,818
[ISSEI] Who are those freaks?

169
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,884
[LEVIATHAN] They're magicians.

170
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,818
[ISSEI] Magicians?

171
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:49,084
[LEVIATHAN] They're so rude!

172
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:51,851
I'm a real life MagiGirl, and
they're flat out ignoring me!

173
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,651
But what is this power?

174
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:56,751
[AZAZEL]
It's the half-vampire boy.

175
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:58,518
He must have been coerced

176
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:01,451
into creating Balance Breaker
conditions for them.

177
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:02,751
You mean Gasper?

178
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:04,984
He has the power to stop time.

179
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:08,451
I think it's safe
to say yes, it is him.

180
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:10,718
Gasper has fallen
into enemy hands.

181
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:11,818
Oh no.

182
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:13,051
Terrorist magicians dared

183
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:15,351
to kidnap a member
of my household?

184
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:17,684
They will pay
for this disrespect.

185
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,684
Our guards are disappearing.

186
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:22,684
[MICHAEL] Teleportation magic.

187
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:23,718
That can only mean someone

188
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:26,684
is connected to the
Gate within this barrier.

189
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:29,484
[GRAYFIA] And, unfortunately,
our magical transport troops

190
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:31,818
are completely
sealed off from us.

191
00:10:31,851 --> 00:10:33,051
[AZAZEL] So we've been cornered.

192
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:33,851
[MICHAEL] Yes.

193
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,084
Their timing along
with their use

194
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:38,651
of Lady Gremory's Bishop could
not have been more perfect.

195
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,784
We've been betrayed.

196
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:48,418
[SIR ZECHS] I recommend
we take action soon.

197
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:50,084
If they've somehow
found a way

198
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:54,484
to make Gasper even stronger,
none of us will survive.

199
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:57,684
No one is strong
enough to beat him?

200
00:10:57,718 --> 00:10:59,884
How could Gasper
have that much power?

201
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:02,851
Because he is
a Mutation Piece.

202
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:04,784
What's a
Mutation Piece?

203
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:08,118
It's something that causes
many strange phenomena.

204
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:10,618
The Bishop I used
to turn Gasper into a devil

205
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:13,851
should have required
several of my chess pieces,

206
00:11:13,884 --> 00:11:16,818
however, only one
ended up being used.

207
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:19,418
It was a Mutation Piece.

208
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:21,451
[ISSEI] I guess that
means he's pretty awesome?

209
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:24,784
Awesome in that his potential
is utterly incalculable.

210
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,318
That's the reason
he was sealed away.

211
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:33,051
If we don't do something
about this half-vampire kid now,

212
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:35,784
it'll be far too
dangerous to fight back.

213
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:38,884
Sir Zechs. I have an
unused Rook in storage

214
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:41,018
where my household
usually holds meetings.

215
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:43,918
[SIR ZECHS] A Rook?
Castling could work.

216
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:45,418
What's castling?

217
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:46,718
It's a special rule in chess

218
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:48,451
where you can switch
the places of the King

219
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:50,018
and the Rook in one move.

220
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:52,551
[SIR ZECHS] But I'd rather
not send you in alone.

221
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:54,618
Gasper is a member
of my household.

222
00:11:54,651 --> 00:11:57,884
I take responsibility for him.
I'll steal him back.

223
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,418
I'd recommend using
some of Sir Zech's power,

224
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:04,818
then another person will
be able to escape with you.

225
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:07,451
[ISSEI] Then I wanna
be that person!

226
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:09,884
I promise to protect her!

227
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:13,518
[SIR ZECHS] You can go with her.

228
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:14,451
Thanks!

229
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,551
[VALI] Wouldn't it
be easier to go ahead

230
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:19,051
and take out the half-vampire
with the terrorists?

231
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:20,018
If you'd like.

232
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:21,751
I can just do it for you.

233
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:22,751
You're such a dick!

234
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,051
Vali, try to be a little
more considerate, okay?

235
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:27,618
After all, we're trying
to make peace here.

236
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:30,551
Sorry; it's hard for me
to do nothing like this.

237
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,718
Hmph. Fair enough.

238
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,518
Then why don't you go
welcome those magicians.

239
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:37,051
Upset their ranks some.

240
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:39,384
Seeing the White Dragon
Emperor should help.

241
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:40,784
Of course.

242
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:49,518
Here we go!
Balance Break!

243
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:50,784
[ALBION] Vanishing Dragon.

244
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:57,384
[ALBION] Balance Breaker!

245
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,451
He pulled that off fast!

246
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:09,751
If I tried it,
it would cost me my left arm,

247
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:12,684
and even then, I could
only hold it ten seconds.

248
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:28,884
[ISSEI] He's strong.

249
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:31,018
I mean, like stupid strong!

250
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:32,751
[XENOVIA] True.

251
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:35,518
But his power also
feels dangerous to me.

252
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:37,684
Don't worry.

253
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:40,651
We're gonna get Gasper
back safe-- I swear it!

254
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:43,051
[AZAZEL] Uh, first things first.

255
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:51,984
[SIR ZECHS] I'm leaving
Rias in your hands.

256
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:53,484
Understood?

257
00:13:53,518 --> 00:13:54,718
[ISSEI] Yes, sir!

258
00:14:18,477 --> 00:14:20,377
Gasper? Koneko?

259
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,243
Let's try looking
in a different room.

260
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:23,510
Right.

261
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:26,443
[AZAZEL] Take these with you.

262
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:28,277
You should be able
to use that bracelet

263
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,443
as compensation
instead of your arm.

264
00:14:30,477 --> 00:14:33,210
Are you serious? Thanks.

265
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:35,477
That means I can become
a Balance Breaker!

266
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,043
Only as a last resort.

267
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,510
It can't regulate how
fast your strength is used.

268
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,010
Which would suck.

269
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:46,010
I don't wanna go
through that again.

270
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,077
[AZAZEL] Put the other
one on the half-vampire.

271
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,243
It can bring him
back under control.

272
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:54,377
Now, pay attention
to what I'm about to say.

273
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,210
Luck is the only
reason you've survived.

274
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:58,143
You're barely a devil,

275
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:00,443
and that's a compliment
to your strength.

276
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:02,577
Keep refusing
to accept others' help,

277
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,443
and you will be dead.

278
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:07,143
[AZAZEL] You, yourself,
are the weakest point

279
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:09,243
of the Sacred Gear.

280
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:11,310
[ISSEI thinking] Like I don't
already know that.

281
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,777
[SIR ZECHS]
It won't be long, now.

282
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,177
As soon as Gasper is
rescued by Rias and Issei,

283
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,177
we can begin our counterattack.

284
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,077
[GRAYFIA] We have a visitor.

285
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,043
I know this
magic. But how?

286
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:22,910
[CATTLEYA]
Well, if it isn't

287
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:25,110
the unworthy Devil
Kings Mister Zechs

288
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:26,643
and Little Miss Serafall.

289
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,277
Explain yourself;
what are you doing here?

290
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,043
[SIR ZECHS]
Cattleya Leviathan,

291
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:33,443
descendant of the
first Leviathan.

292
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:36,410
I'm here to bring
destruction and chaos.

293
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:39,677
[explosion]

294
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,043
That's where
everyone's trapped!

295
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:43,643
[RIAS] My brother.

296
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,277
[CATTLEYA] Adorable;
the Three Great Powers

297
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,377
put up a defensive
barrier together.

298
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,377
Adorable and pathetic!

299
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,310
[SIR ZECHS] What are
you thinking, Cattleya?

300
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:57,110
[CATTLEYA] What I'm thinking
is the complete opposite

301
00:15:57,143 --> 00:15:59,343
of everyone at this
disgusting meeting.

302
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:01,710
If God and the Devil King
aren't around anymore,

303
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:04,343
then there should be a
revolution in this world!

304
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:06,077
[LEVIATHAN] Cattleya,
stop this right now!

305
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,643
Why are you trying to do?

306
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:11,010
Serafall, you stole
my Leviathan title

307
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:12,277
and now question me.

308
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,677
How dare you?

309
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,577
Cattleya.

310
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,243
[CATTLEYA]
Oh, don't worry, darling.

311
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:20,043
Once I kill you today,
I'll simply take back the name

312
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:22,277
of the Devil King
Leviathan for myself.

313
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,577
[AZAZEL] Of course.

314
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,277
I suppose it's too much to hope

315
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,777
we're just caught up
in a devil's coup d'état.

316
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,210
I think it's more than that.

317
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:32,777
Her plan is most likely
to take over the whole world.

318
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,410
Oh, Michael nailed it.

319
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:35,377
No one wants a world where God

320
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,710
and the Devil King's
death are covered up.

321
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:39,510
So, since you
have clearly failed,

322
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:41,277
we will take this decaying realm

323
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,343
and reform it for
ourselves instead.

324
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,410
[AZAZEL laughs]

325
00:16:44,443 --> 00:16:48,543
Azazel, what do
you find so amusing?

326
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:50,610
[AZAZEL] Decaying? Reform?

327
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,577
How cliché.

328
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,543
Come on, you have to
know the first villains

329
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:56,177
to die always
say crap like that.

330
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,410
I'll teach you to mock me.

331
00:16:58,443 --> 00:17:00,377
Oh, you will, will you?

332
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,077
Sounds like fun.

333
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,643
[SIR ZECHS] Cattleya, you have
no intention of backing down?

334
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:06,177
Not at all, Sir Zechs.

335
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,243
Don't get me wrong,
you were a good Devil King,

336
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,543
but you won't have that

337
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:12,310
or any other title much
longer, unfortunately.

338
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:15,043
Doubtful. Shall we, then?

339
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,677
[AZAZEL] A descendant of the
former Devil King Leviathan.

340
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,243
A desperate monster
nearing her end.

341
00:17:22,277 --> 00:17:23,610
Not a bad opponent.

342
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,743
I think I'll treat myself
to some Armageddon.

343
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:29,443
Surprise.
You don't scare me.

344
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,210
[RIAS] Who's that?
Look, with Azazel!

345
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,443
What's she doing here?

346
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:38,710
Who is she?

347
00:17:38,743 --> 00:17:40,677
Cattleya Leviathan.

348
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,643
You know when the four devil
kings were killed in the war,

349
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:46,677
they were replaced
by devils that earned

350
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,377
instead of inherited
those titles, right?

351
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,043
[ISSEI] Yeah, that's
how your older brother

352
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:54,043
and Sona's older sister
became Devil Kings.

353
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:55,510
[RIAS] Through the
long years of fighting,

354
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:58,643
the devils were almost
completely decimated.

355
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,777
If the new Devil Kings
hadn't ended the war

356
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,310
when they did, we probably
wouldn't be here right now.

357
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:05,310
But the direct
descendants

358
00:18:05,343 --> 00:18:08,043
of the former Devil Kings
still retaliated.

359
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:10,577
They declared themselves to
be the rightful successors,

360
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,043
so they were chased to
the farthest ends of Hell.

361
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:14,510
For real?

362
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:17,010
[RIAS] Cattleya was
a part of the resistance.

363
00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:20,110
She is a descendant
of the Leviathan family.

364
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:22,143
[RIAS] Come with me.

365
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:23,543
Hold on. What
about everyone else?

366
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:25,310
We can't worry
about them right now.

367
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:28,043
There are other things
to take care of first.

368
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:30,143
I want you to promote
yourself to Queen.

369
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,610
You got it.

370
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:35,277
What's going on?

371
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,177
[MAGICIAN 11B] A devil?

372
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,743
We disabled
their ability to teleport.

373
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:39,710
How did they get here?

374
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:43,710
[RIAS] Don't worry, we're here.

375
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:46,010
Rias, I'm so sorry.

376
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,177
This whole thing
is all my fault!

377
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,643
[MICHAEL] We are outnumbered.

378
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:52,610
But a war of attrition
must still be avoided.

379
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,443
[SIR ZECHS] Grayfia is
currently analyzing the gate.

380
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,543
Which means we need to
buy her some extra time.

381
00:19:01,577 --> 00:19:04,443
[KIBA] You can let us
ward off any attacks.

382
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,377
[SIR ZECHS]
Can you work together?

383
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,310
[IRINA] Yes, Xenovia
and I became friends

384
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:09,110
when we were
Chief Michael's guards,

385
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:11,177
and all three of us
have teamed up before.

386
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,177
In the meantime,

387
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,343
let's hope Azazel has
the power to defeat her.

388
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:17,277
There's no need
to worry, Chief Michael.

389
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,410
Remember, he's not
alone out there.

390
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:22,210
Right. He's got
Rias and Issei.

391
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:36,310
[IRINA] Xenovia!

392
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,977
[XENOVIA] Irina!

393
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:43,177
Thank you.

394
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:45,377
[IRINA] Why?

395
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:49,543
Why didn't you tell
me the truth, Xenovia?

396
00:19:49,577 --> 00:19:52,377
That you weren't a traitor,
but had just been exiled.

397
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,543
In order to
tell you that,

398
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:56,510
I would've also had to tell
you that God didn't exist.

399
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,410
I couldn't
do that to you.

400
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:01,077
And I didn't have the
strength to tell you.

401
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,077
Irina?

402
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,377
Well, come on.

403
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,743
We can't let these
talks be thwarted, right?

404
00:20:07,777 --> 00:20:09,243
Because if peace
gets established,

405
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:11,310
then devils won't
be my enemy anymore.

406
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,577
And neither will
believers in God.

407
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,077
Then, let's do this!

408
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,010
We can fight for
our friendship's sake.

409
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:18,143
All right!

410
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,922
[KONEKO]
Please forgive me, Rias.

411
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:26,789
[RIAS] It's all right.

412
00:20:26,822 --> 00:20:29,822
I'm just glad we
found you. You're okay?

413
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:32,856
[MAGICIAN 11E] I don't know what
tricks you used to get here,

414
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:34,889
but don't take one more step.

415
00:20:34,922 --> 00:20:36,089
Please Rias.

416
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:38,456
Just kill me now
and get it over with.

417
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:39,889
Don't say stuff like that!

418
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:42,789
[GASPER] It would be better
for everyone if I was dead!

419
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:46,956
I'm a useless coward, and not
only that-- look what happened.

420
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:50,456
My stupid power caused it, so I
don't deserve to live anymore!

421
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:52,456
[RIAS] Don't be so dramatic.

422
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:55,489
Remember what I told you
when I made you one of us?

423
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:02,389
[RIAS] Live for me, little one.

424
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:06,989
At the same time, find a way of
being that will make you happy.

425
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:11,389
[RIAS] You are my servant
and a part of my household.

426
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:12,856
I made a solemn vow.

427
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:15,056
I will not abandon you.

428
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:16,489
Thank you.

429
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,422
Thank you so much.

430
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:19,156
Are you as excited

431
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:21,989
about your final
moments as I am?

432
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,022
[AZAZEL] A snake?

433
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:35,022
[AZAZEL] We should
clear something up

434
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:36,889
before moving forward.

435
00:21:39,022 --> 00:21:42,056
You've got a lot of aura.
Seems to be more than

436
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:44,922
a Devil King's descendant
should possess.

437
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:46,822
Where'd you get this power?

438
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:48,889
I would love to
answer that question,

439
00:21:48,922 --> 00:21:52,689
but why waste so much breath
when you are just going to die?

440
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:56,556
[MAGICIAN 11D] How stupid.

441
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:58,522
You should have taken
the time to brainwash

442
00:21:58,556 --> 00:21:59,922
such a dangerous creature
so that you could

443
00:21:59,956 --> 00:22:02,422
then use him as your own,
personal weapon.

444
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:03,589
[RIAS] I know
this is most likely

445
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,989
beyond your understanding,

446
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:07,089
but my servants are
actually cared for.

447
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:09,022
Disrespectful bitch.

448
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:12,089
I'll turn that pretty face into
one deserving the name Devil!

449
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:17,156
Listen to me.

450
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:21,422
Now would be the right time
to cause major problems.

451
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:22,656
I promise if you do,

452
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:26,622
I'll scold you over and over
for being so naughty, Gasper.

453
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:29,456
Then I will hold
you and never let go.

454
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:34,389
You will? Okay. I can try!

455
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:37,389
[ISSEI thinking]
Look at her. Rias Gremory.

456
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,956
She's so awesome!

457
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:41,056
[ISSEI] Hey, Gasper!

458
00:22:42,122 --> 00:22:43,389
You can do this!

459
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:44,489
Don't be afraid!

460
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:45,722
And stop crying!

461
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:48,456
You've got us,
and that's not all!

462
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:54,622
Akeno, Asia, Kiba,
Koneko, Xenovia.

463
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:55,722
We're all your friends!

464
00:22:55,756 --> 00:22:57,556
And we believe in you!

465
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:01,856
[DDRAIG] Boost!

466
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:04,022
Go! Ascalon!

467
00:23:04,056 --> 00:23:06,722
[DDRAIG] Blade!

468
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:09,122
[MAGICIAN 11D] Are you
going to fight back?

469
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:10,489
What are you doing?

470
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,022
Issei, stop.

471
00:23:13,056 --> 00:23:14,456
[ISSEI] You know what, Gasper?

472
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:16,956
Nothing will happen
if you don't move.

473
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:25,756
Damn it, dude,

474
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,656
you are a member of
the House of Gremory!

475
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:29,689
Show them what kind
of man you are!

476
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:31,922
Do it, Gasper!

477
00:23:38,856 --> 00:23:40,389
[MAGICIAN 11E] He's gone!

478
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:42,589
[MAGICIAN 11D]
No, he stopped time.

479
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:43,556
[MAGICIAN 11F]
I don't understand;

480
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,156
the Sacred Gear was suppressed.

481
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:47,722
[MAGICIAN 11E] And he
managed to transform, too!

482
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:48,922
[MAGICIAN 11D] Take this!

483
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:54,456
Attack him! Attack!

484
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:56,522
He's drinking my blood!

485
00:23:56,556 --> 00:23:57,522
But not only our blood;

486
00:23:57,556 --> 00:23:59,989
he's absorbing all of
our power along with it!

487
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:05,456
[ISSEI] Awesome.

488
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:08,689
This is just a small dose
of Gasper's power.

489
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:10,456
No way, are you shitting me?

490
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:11,789
No, I'm not shitting you;

491
00:24:11,822 --> 00:24:14,522
his power was released
when he tasted your blood.

492
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:15,389
But Issei.

493
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:17,789
How'd you ever
come up with that idea?

494
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:20,056
Oh, uh--
because I might've...

495
00:24:21,622 --> 00:24:23,089
...had some help.

496
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:27,422
[KONEKO] You guys, look out!

497
00:24:29,622 --> 00:24:30,522
[MAGICIAN 11E]
Wait, what happened!

498
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:31,789
The magic's been stopped!

499
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:33,056
[GASPER] It's no use.

500
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:36,422
I can see every move
all of you are making.

501
00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:42,456
Issei, now! You're up!

502
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:43,989
You got it!

503
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,889
Hell fuckin' yeah!
Dress Break.

504
00:24:58,022 --> 00:25:02,122
Oh, hot damn, this is like
a festival of naked ladies!

505
00:25:03,056 --> 00:25:04,256
Gasper!

506
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:06,456
Look at what we can accomplish
when we're working together!

507
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:08,456
[GASPER] Yeah!
We can do anything!

508
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:09,389
Look at them all.

509
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:11,889
Naked. Gropin' time!

510
00:25:12,722 --> 00:25:13,589
Down boy.

511
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:14,622
[ISSEI] Right. I'm down.

512
00:25:14,656 --> 00:25:16,389
[KONEKO] You're the worst.

513
00:25:17,689 --> 00:25:19,122
This should keep
you more in control.

514
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:20,622
Wow, thank you!

515
00:25:20,656 --> 00:25:23,089
All right.
Let's get out of here.

516
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:24,622
[ISSEI] You got it, Rias!

517
00:26:58,022 --> 00:26:58,822
[ISSEI] Yo, Issei here!

518
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:00,589
As the fighting
grows more intense,

519
00:27:00,622 --> 00:27:02,689
I finally battle Vali,
the White Dragon Emperor.

520
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:05,589
I definitely can't lose for the
sake of the world,

521
00:27:05,622 --> 00:27:07,622
for the sake of the breasts!

522
00:27:07,656 --> 00:27:10,522
Last episode!
"Clash of the Twin Sky Dragons!"

523
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:12,495
Defend the dairy pillows!
