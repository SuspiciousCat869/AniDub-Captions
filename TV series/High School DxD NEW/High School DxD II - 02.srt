[FREED chuckling]

2
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,266
Time to die!

3
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:28,800
Hasn't anyone told you

4
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,233
to heed the
faces you make?

5
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:31,166
We wouldn't want our

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,033
pretty little prince
getting stuck that way.

7
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,633
Luckily Excalibur
isn't picky.

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,733
It's simply hungry
for your blood.

9
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:38,333
[KIBA] That's
enough, Freak!

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,466
[FREED] Now there's
a tone of voice

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,433
I never thought I'd
hear come out of you.

12
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:43,733
Good job!

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,433
Holy Eraser!

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,033
That was cute.

15
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:51,633
You win some,
you lose some.

16
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,000
Nice try, kid.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,400
[KIBA] Whatever.
It was just a test.

18
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:58,233
I wanted to see if
that sword was real.

19
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,466
Thanks for
giving me the license

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,633
to destroy you,
and your sword!

21
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:05,366
[FREED]
That's the spirit!

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,600
Get 'em Tiger!

23
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,133
[FREED] Aw, someone
forgot to warn you.

24
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:14,733
This Holy Sword
absolutely despises devils.

25
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:16,233
Phooey.

26
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:19,033
Shut up!
I'm not done yet!

27
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,133
That's cheating!

28
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:24,466
[KIBA] That's
what devils do!

29
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,200
[FREED]
Nice move, Kiddo.

30
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:31,433
Oh shit.

31
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:33,366
[FREED] I hate
to cut this short,

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,200
but someone more
important is calling!

33
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:38,333
It's been fun.
That's all, folks!

34
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:22,522
It's time to get wet!

35
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:24,822
So go out there and
make a big splash!

36
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:25,956
Good morning! It's going
to be a beautiful day!

37
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:27,556
I feel like hell!

38
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:41,322
[ISSEI secreams]

39
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:45,889
[RIAS]
Good morning, Issei.

40
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:47,756
Did you sleep okay?

41
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:49,889
[ISSEI]
Why are you here?

42
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:51,056
You didn't tell
us what to do

43
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:53,822
before you fell asleep last
night so we just stayed here.

44
00:03:53,856 --> 00:03:54,856
[ISSEI] What?

45
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:55,822
We made the best of
our sleeping arrangements

46
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:57,922
and each used one of
your arms as a pillow.

47
00:03:57,956 --> 00:03:58,889
It was quite comfortable.

48
00:03:58,922 --> 00:03:59,956
Very.

49
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,989
[ISSEI thinking] Something's
totally wrong here.

50
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:03,789
ASIA] We should go
get breakfast started!

51
00:04:03,822 --> 00:04:04,789
It's already late!

52
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:06,256
[RIAS] Oh right!

53
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:11,456
Thanks again.
We'll talk to you later.

54
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:16,489
I hope we didn't keep you
from something important.

55
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:25,522
Now that she's
hanging out with Rias,

56
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,389
Asia's sex appeal has
gone through the roof.

57
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:29,556
Not that there's
anything wrong with that!

58
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:30,622
No, what am I saying?

59
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:32,622
Asia's pure and I shouldn't
be checking her out,

60
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:35,556
but I am, which has to mean
that I'm not just into boobs.

61
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:37,689
Hey! I'm not just into boobs!

62
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:39,456
No, no, no!
This isn't good!

63
00:04:44,722 --> 00:04:46,822
Best thing to do is
just focus on Rias.

64
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:50,022
But of course, I can't
because Asia will freak out.

65
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,289
[sniffs deeply]

66
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:54,656
Why does my
life suck right now?

67
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:57,389
[ISSEI] In my perfect
fantasy world...

68
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:04,456
[ISSEI] So who's gonna
be the lucky girl today?

69
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:06,522
Oh, Issei,
please choose me.

70
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,489
Please have mercy and choose me!

71
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:09,789
You sure?

72
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:11,822
Yes! Please choose me!

73
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:14,689
I'm begging you;
please, have mercy!

74
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:17,522
All right,
if you say so.

75
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:19,789
What are you even
talking about, Issei?

76
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:21,356
Pardon me, ma'am?

77
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,889
Issei, now, listen
to me carefully.

78
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:25,522
I cannot and
simply will not live

79
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:26,956
without you in my life,

80
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:30,422
which means I need you
to satisfy me immediately.

81
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,622
Yeah, okay!

82
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:32,922
[ASIA] No, please,
you have to do me first!

83
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:35,356
No, do me first!

84
00:05:36,356 --> 00:05:37,322
[ISSEI] Come on, ladies.

85
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:40,289
You gotta realize I've
only got one body here!

86
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:41,556
I know.

87
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:44,689
Let's decide this with a little
game called rock-paper-scissors.

88
00:05:44,722 --> 00:05:45,256
I won't lose!

89
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:46,756
Well, neither will I!

90
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:48,289
Let's do this thing!

91
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:49,922
I'm not gonna lose!

92
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:55,522
[RIAS and ASIA]
1, 2, 3! 1, 2, 3! 1, 2, 3!

93
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,656
[ISSEI] I love being
the Harem King!

94
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:02,822
At least that was what
was supposed to happen.

95
00:06:02,856 --> 00:06:05,256
Reality sucks balls!

96
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:07,056
It's not fair!

97
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:07,922
I saw her boobs already!

98
00:06:07,956 --> 00:06:08,922
I touched them!

99
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:10,422
I can't just act like
everything's normal--

100
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:13,022
like it didn't happen.
That's torture!

101
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:15,422
This sucks ass.

102
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:16,756
[DDRAIG] Yo! Issei!

103
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:19,422
Sorry to interrupt
your pouting.

104
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:21,556
Don't act like you've
forgotten my voice.

105
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,689
Oh, Ddraig, hey!

106
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:25,956
[DDRAIG] Your mind is as
perverse and twisted as ever.

107
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:26,889
That's refreshing.

108
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:28,122
I'm in the middle
of a mental breakdown

109
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:31,022
so I'd appreciate it if you'd
be a little more sensitive!

110
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,822
[DDRAIG] Well,
that's unfortunate.

111
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:34,789
I came here to
give you a warning.

112
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:35,889
About what?

113
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:38,589
[RIAS] Here, try this.

114
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:40,356
Tell me what you think.

115
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:41,856
[ASIA] Wow, it's delicious!

116
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,989
Rias, this is the best
miso soup I've ever had.

117
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:45,489
Mine always ends up too salty.

118
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:46,522
What did you do?

119
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:48,589
[DDRAIG] I've felt a
strong spiritual presence

120
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:50,056
surrounding you lately.

121
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:52,289
It's made me nervous
and I can't sleep.

122
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:52,856
Oh yeah.

123
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:53,856
That's probably Rias.

124
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,556
She's been hanging out
around here a lot more.

125
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:58,356
If you know what
I mean by "hanging out."

126
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,422
[DDRAIG] Assuming you're
talking about your buddies,

127
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:02,489
I don't even
notice them anymore.

128
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,756
Are you saying
there's an enemy close by?

129
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,656
[DDRAIG] I'm saying be careful.

130
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:08,389
You never know
when the White One

131
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:11,022
will decide to make an
unexpected appearance.

132
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,356
The White One?

133
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:15,522
That sounds intense.
What does it mean?

134
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:18,722
[DDRAIG] The Vanishing
Dragon is The White Dragon.

135
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:20,956
What's a
Vanishing Dragon?

136
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:23,389
[DDRAIG] We are called
the Twin Sky Dragons,

137
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:25,856
and we've been fighting
for several years now.

138
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,456
Those with sky dragons living

139
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,856
within them are destined
to fight each other.

140
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,989
What do you mean
"those" with sky dragons?

141
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:35,422
There's someone else who
has the Sacred Gear like me?

142
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,422
[DDRAIG] There is.

143
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,889
And I'm gonna have
to fight this guy someday

144
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:39,856
because he's got
your twin inside him?

145
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:40,989
[DDRAIG] You're my only hope.

146
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:42,022
This isn't fair.

147
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:43,856
You're the one who
decided to come live in me.

148
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,589
[DDRAIG] And in
exchange I've given you

149
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:46,989
the power of the dragon.

150
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:48,756
It's way fair.

151
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:49,522
I know.

152
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,656
I haven't forgotten.

153
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,889
You're the only reason
that I was able to save Rias.

154
00:07:52,922 --> 00:07:54,556
And speaking of that,

155
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,589
I've got to say this
one more time, Ddraig.

156
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:58,456
[DDRAIG] Say it.

157
00:07:58,489 --> 00:07:59,622
Listen close.

158
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:01,756
I have a dream that
one day I'll rank

159
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:04,622
so high that
I become the Harem King!

160
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:05,822
I'll have one
group of hot girls

161
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:09,056
with huge jugs as servants
and another for my babe army!

162
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,856
Oh yeah. One day all
of this will be mine!

163
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:15,689
[DDRAIG] It's not
every day I get

164
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:17,789
to live inside a pervert-tron!

165
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:20,289
As if I didn't feel
awkward enough. Jeez.

166
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:22,422
[DDRAIG] Maybe it's
not out of the question.

167
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:24,289
It's true;
the dragon powers can be

168
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:26,656
overwhelming to several
of those around you.

169
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:27,856
Some will want to fight,

170
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:29,822
but then, many will
find it charming--

171
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:31,822
especially the female sort.

172
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:32,956
No way! Really?

173
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:34,356
[DDRAIG] Definitely.

174
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,922
Every male I've lived in
has been surrounded

175
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:37,322
by lustful women.

176
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:38,689
I was there, remember?

177
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:39,622
Wow!

178
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:40,922
I had no idea you
were the most amazing

179
00:08:40,956 --> 00:08:43,289
sacred treasure
in the whole world!

180
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,289
[DDRAIG] That's more like it!

181
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:45,322
Nice switch.

182
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:47,856
Yes! It's time to
take your powers for a spin!

183
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:48,889
I am now on a mission

184
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:51,489
to fully experience
Rias's hot fleshy globes!

185
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:54,722
[DDRAIG] You want
to squeeze them?

186
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:58,689
[ISSEI] Suck them. Now.

187
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:03,689
[DDRAIG sighs]
So this is all about you

188
00:09:03,722 --> 00:09:05,656
having a woman's
breasts in your mouth?

189
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:07,589
How far we've come.

190
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:10,856
I suppose the variety of goals
in a partner is good for me.

191
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:13,922
Just promise you'll
remember what I told you.

192
00:09:13,956 --> 00:09:15,822
I will.
The White Dragon.

193
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:16,956
Got it.

194
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,285
[FEMALE STUDENT 2-1]
Good morning!

195
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:29,552
Sona. Look.

196
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:38,218
The Holy Sword.

197
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:40,618
Karaoke?

198
00:09:40,652 --> 00:09:42,152
Gotta get my sing on, yo!

199
00:09:42,185 --> 00:09:43,985
We should go to the one
in front of the station.

200
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:45,285
They get new inserts every week.

201
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,818
They also have contests.

202
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,652
I always love
a good insert.

203
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:49,818
[BOYS] Kiryuu!

204
00:09:49,852 --> 00:09:51,018
You're having
a contest to see

205
00:09:51,052 --> 00:09:52,352
who gives the best insert?

206
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,052
We were talking
about hittin' up

207
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:54,918
the K-roke after school!

208
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:56,352
[KIRYUU] Omigosh
that sounds so fun!

209
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:57,652
What time are
you guys leaving?

210
00:09:57,685 --> 00:09:58,585
I wanna go!

211
00:09:58,618 --> 00:09:59,752
What do you think, Asia?

212
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:01,118
You can't
invite yourself!

213
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:04,718
[ASIA] Karaoke? I'd love to go!

214
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:06,618
What?

215
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:12,652
[ASIA] Wow! Look
how shiny the floor is!

216
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:13,652
[ISSEI] Huh? Oh.

217
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:16,018
Yeah, that shine is amazing!

218
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:17,118
[ASIA] What's that?

219
00:10:17,152 --> 00:10:19,218
[ISSEI] Huh? What's what?

220
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,785
[ASIA] That room way
back over there.

221
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:21,852
See it?

222
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:22,785
[ISSEI] Oh that.

223
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:24,318
Yeah that's called
"The Forbidden Room."

224
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:25,952
It's never been opened.

225
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:30,885
[RIAS] They did a good job
cleaning the place, didn't they?

226
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,985
Feels like we're
getting a fresh start.

227
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:34,685
[ISSEI] So, where's Kiba?

228
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:35,985
[KONEKO] Looks like
somebody decided

229
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,618
to take the entire day off.

230
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:38,585
Must be nice.

231
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:39,585
[ASIA] I hope he's okay.

232
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:41,852
[ISSEI] So do you think
this has anything to do

233
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:43,852
with what we talked
about yesterday?

234
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:46,652
Whoa, no frikkin' way.

235
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:48,618
So what the hell
does Kiba have to do

236
00:10:48,652 --> 00:10:50,185
with the Holy Swords?

237
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:51,885
Do you remember
me telling you

238
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,752
before about how
he was a survivor

239
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:55,652
of the Holy Sword Project?

240
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:57,285
For sure.

241
00:10:57,318 --> 00:10:58,885
What I didn't
tell you was that

242
00:10:58,918 --> 00:11:01,085
there were several
other children involved.

243
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,785
They were all being
raised to use an Excalibur.

244
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,985
[RIAS] As of right now,
there are seven Holy Swords

245
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:10,852
that are known by
the name Excalibur.

246
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:13,152
Long ago, pieces of
the original Excalibur

247
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:14,952
were scattered during a war.

248
00:11:14,985 --> 00:11:16,152
[ISSEI] What? Seven?

249
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:17,252
[RIAS] That's right.

250
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,952
It was the church
that tracked down

251
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:20,952
and collected all
of those pieces.

252
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:22,052
They then used alchemy

253
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:24,918
to create seven
entirely new swords.

254
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:27,585
[ISSEI] So does that mean Kiba
is able to use all of them?

255
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:29,685
Actually, no it does not.

256
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:32,085
He never adapted to
Excalibur's strength.

257
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:34,985
In fact, none of those
who were trained ever could.

258
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:38,552
[RIAS] The entire
project failed.

259
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:40,618
Completely?

260
00:11:40,652 --> 00:11:41,485
[RIAS] Yes.

261
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:43,218
So those in charge
of the project decided

262
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:46,285
to dispose of Kiba and
the other test subjects.

263
00:11:46,318 --> 00:11:49,752
Dispose? Like, kill?

264
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:52,185
They were already on
the verge of death.

265
00:11:56,985 --> 00:12:00,652
[RIAS] However,
one child was able to escape.

266
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:03,085
His motivation in staying
alive was a promise

267
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:06,218
to himself that he
would someday get revenge.

268
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:09,718
[RIAS] I felt that such
a passion could be used

269
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:12,952
in a meaningful way
and wanted to help.

270
00:12:12,985 --> 00:12:15,818
There was but a single solution.

271
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:21,752
[ISSEI] So that's the
reason you made Kiba a devil.

272
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:25,885
And why he was weird
when he looked at that picture.

273
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:31,852
We'll just have to wait and
see what happens next.

274
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,285
[AKENO] Fantastic!
It looks like everyone's here.

275
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:37,818
[RIAS] Akeno.
Why are you so late?

276
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:39,218
[AKENO]
Well, I brought some guests

277
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:41,018
and was helping them get here.

278
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,485
[SONA] Thank you for having us.

279
00:12:42,518 --> 00:12:45,218
[ISSEI] The student body
president and vice-president?

280
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:46,418
Why?

281
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:48,818
They said they had something
urgent to discuss with you.

282
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,018
Right, Rias.

283
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:51,952
Would you mind coming with me

284
00:12:51,985 --> 00:12:53,952
to my house right away, please?

285
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:55,018
This isn't something
you're going

286
00:12:55,052 --> 00:12:57,118
to want to discuss in
front of a lot of people.

287
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,352
Trust me.

288
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:01,952
You make it sound like
a complicated situation.

289
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:05,652
It is.
Very complicated.

290
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:10,685
[ISSEI] What in the
world happened?

291
00:13:10,718 --> 00:13:11,685
Was it just me,

292
00:13:11,718 --> 00:13:13,785
or did you think Sona
was acting weird, too?

293
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:14,918
[ASIA] Yeah, maybe.

294
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:16,952
What do you think
about it, Koneko?

295
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:17,818
Don't know.

296
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:19,185
It's not like there's
anything wrong

297
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:21,052
with Rias talking to someone.

298
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:22,685
However.

299
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,052
I guess I'm more
worried right now

300
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:26,252
about what's going on with Kiba.

301
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:27,985
Yeah, actually,
I am, too.

302
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:29,985
I know what Rias
told us, but still.

303
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:30,918
I feel like maybe I should try

304
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:33,285
and help out somehow,
you know what I mean?

305
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:36,785
Not because I feel obligated,
but because we're friends.

306
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:40,318
[KONEKO] Yeah.
Well, see you tomorrow.

307
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,085
[ISSEI] See ya, Koneko.

308
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:44,052
Bye!
See you tomorrow!

309
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:46,818
Koneko and Akeno
chose this, as well.

310
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:47,718
What?

311
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:48,518
Oh.

312
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:49,752
I was just wondering
why they decided

313
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,285
to become devils, too.

314
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:54,685
Surely they had reasons
like the rest of us.

315
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,356
Haven't been
here in a long time.

316
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:16,856
[AKENO] Really; did
you used to come a lot?

317
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,923
[SONA] In the past,
Rias and I came here together

318
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:22,723
all the time so we could
tell each other secrets.

319
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:31,990
[SONA] This sauna was
installed for my personal use.

320
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:35,756
[TSUBAKI] The space is directly
connected to Sona's stronghold,

321
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,356
which means if it's closed,
no one else will be able enter.

322
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,223
[AKENO] Well, that explains

323
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,190
how you could tell
your secrets here.

324
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,356
[RIAS] All I did was complain
about getting in trouble

325
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,456
with my mom.

326
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,323
Silly stuff like that.

327
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,890
And I think Sona
only ever complained

328
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:53,223
about her sister.

329
00:14:53,256 --> 00:14:54,490
[AKENO] Oh my.

330
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:57,723
I didn't realize the two
of you were so close.

331
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,823
[SONA] That's all
in the past, now.

332
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:00,856
True.

333
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,090
So then, what are we
here to discuss this time?

334
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:05,956
Something tells me
this secret's a good one.

335
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:11,356
[TSUBAKI] It was this morning.

336
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,723
Two people from the
church contacted me.

337
00:15:13,756 --> 00:15:14,823
Contacted how?

338
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:17,823
[RIAS] It's been a while
since they came to this town.

339
00:15:17,856 --> 00:15:19,423
Did they tell you
want they wanted?

340
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:20,356
They did.

341
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,956
Rias, they said they
wanted to speak with you

342
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,456
and that it was urgent.

343
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,056
[RIAS] Members of the church
want to speak with a devil?

344
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,190
What are they up to?

345
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:28,890
There's no
other reason for them

346
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:31,823
to be here except
to stir up trouble.

347
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:32,756
All right, then.

348
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,823
What did you say?

349
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:35,156
I accepted
their request.

350
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,856
I told them where
they could find you

351
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,790
so after school tomorrow
they'll be paying you a visit.

352
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:40,990
[RIAS] What?

353
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,156
[SONA] There is one other
thing you need to be aware of.

354
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,123
Not only were these
two members of the church,

355
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:47,090
but they were also
carrying Holy Swords.

356
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:48,190
Wow, really?

357
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,390
Well that is certainly
something to consider then.

358
00:15:50,423 --> 00:15:52,456
Why would they
come to this town?

359
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,690
Maybe members of the
church are from this area?

360
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,856
No way!

361
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,056
[ASIA] I just got the
chills for some reason.

362
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,290
[ISSEI] Yeah,
I know what you mean.

363
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:07,223
Actually, now that
I think about it,

364
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:09,290
I recognize this
feeling from before.

365
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:10,490
[ASIA] How?

366
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:11,456
It was when I met you,

367
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,056
and you were showing
me around the church.

368
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,190
And also...

369
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:19,690
My mom!

370
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,023
I'm very sorry, Sona.

371
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:23,490
I have to get back home soon.

372
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:25,823
Issei and Asia are in danger!

373
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,856
[ISSEI] Mom!

374
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,723
[MOTHER] That's my boy!

375
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:32,656
And then there was the time

376
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,923
when he ripped his swimming
trunks at the pool for grins.

377
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:35,856
What's happening?

378
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,723
Hey! There he is!

379
00:16:36,756 --> 00:16:37,856
Welcome home, Issei!

380
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,923
Now what's that sour face for?

381
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:42,223
[ISSEI thinking] So these guys
are the reason we got chills?

382
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:44,856
[IRINA] It's been a
while, hasn't it, Issei?

383
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,190
How could you
forget this face?

384
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:47,723
It's me!

385
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,923
[ISSEI] Uh, right.

386
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:50,423
[MOTHER] Irina Shido!

387
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:51,990
Don't you remember this photo?

388
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:53,856
[ISSEI] Whoa!
That's her? How the hell?

389
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,456
[MOTHER] I know!

390
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,856
She looks so different!

391
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,723
I mean you'd mistake her

392
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:58,190
for a boy if you
didn't know any better!

393
00:16:58,223 --> 00:16:59,023
And look at her now!

394
00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:00,456
She's positively
gorgeous, isn't she?

395
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,790
[ISSEI] What?
This is so freaking weird!

396
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:04,990
I always thought she was a boy!

397
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,790
[MOTHER] That's not
very nice! Apologize!

398
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:07,923
[ISSEI] Huh? For what?

399
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:09,056
[IRINA] No, he can't help it.

400
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,990
I really did act
like a boy back then!

401
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:13,256
Yeah. That made
it pretty confusing.

402
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:15,823
It's okay.
But we should catch up.

403
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:18,690
A lot has happened to both of us
in the time we've been apart.

404
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,323
Also? I love reunions!

405
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:24,390
You never know
what's going to happen!

406
00:17:26,523 --> 00:17:28,090
I'm so glad
you're home safe!

407
00:17:28,123 --> 00:17:29,490
I'm so sorry.

408
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:31,723
I should have paid more
attention to both of you.

409
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:33,790
I was terrified of
what I might find

410
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:35,456
when I came back here today.

411
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,890
I'm thankful
I worried for nothing.

412
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,090
I promise to keep a better eye

413
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:41,990
on each of your
whereabouts from now on.

414
00:17:42,023 --> 00:17:43,823
[ISSEI] Uh, Rias?

415
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:44,923
What is it?

416
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:46,923
[ISSEI] Your breasts.

417
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:48,790
[RIAS] Of course, I understand.

418
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,823
Oh, Issei, do you have any
idea how much I spoil you?

419
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:53,056
You can't do that!

420
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,690
[ISSEI] Yeah,
I can't do that.

421
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,056
[RIAS] Why were they in
there talking to your mother?

422
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,190
No clue.

423
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:01,290
Maybe Irina actually
wanted to catch up

424
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:02,490
and show me she's a chick now.

425
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:04,223
They never said
why they were there.

426
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:06,256
But it didn't matter.

427
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,223
All they cared about when they
left was that we were devils.

428
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,756
[RIAS] That's fine.

429
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,823
I honestly don't know
what they're planning,

430
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:15,490
but perhaps we can
ask them tomorrow.

431
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:16,756
[ISSEI] Tomorrow?

432
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,490
That's what
I've been told.

433
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:21,690
They'll be visiting the
clubroom tomorrow after school.

434
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:29,290
[ISSEI] Can't believe
someone I've known

435
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:31,723
since I was a kid is now a
follower of the church.

436
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:33,223
I'm not looking
forward to tomorrow.

437
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:34,423
[ISSEI'S CLIENT]
What's the matter, Devil Boy?

438
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:35,956
Hey. I'm sorry.

439
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,956
I've just got a lot
on my mind right now.

440
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,856
It's a bit unusual
to see a devil looking

441
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,290
so worried, isn't it?

442
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:43,890
Things in this
world usually turn out

443
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,256
the way you want them to.

444
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,356
Stress about the
future is a waste of time.

445
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,823
Just wait it out a bit.
Things'll change.

446
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,490
Oh. Looks like you've
got a bite on that hook!

447
00:18:52,523 --> 00:18:54,456
Pull him in!

448
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,756
[XENOVIA] Thank you for
agreeing to speak with us today.

449
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,356
My name is Xenovia.

450
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,256
And I'm Irina Shido.

451
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,990
[RIAS] It's fascinating
to me why followers of God

452
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:06,790
would want to meet with a devil.

453
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:08,223
[IRINA] It does seem random.

454
00:19:08,256 --> 00:19:09,490
Here's the thing.

455
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,023
There are six swords
we can account for.

456
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:14,256
Three of them are
still with the church.

457
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,023
But we happen to know
that the other three

458
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,690
were stolen by fallen angels.

459
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:20,356
You sure about that?

460
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,723
These are from the
ones we have left.

461
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:24,790
They're made from Excalibur.

462
00:19:24,823 --> 00:19:26,090
This weapon is mine.

463
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,223
It's called the
Sword of Destruction.

464
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:30,056
[IRINA] And then there's
the one I have here.

465
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,923
It's known as the
Holy Sword of Mimicry.

466
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:33,456
It's an Excalibur Mimic!

467
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,456
Well.

468
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,456
What is it you would
like us to do for you today?

469
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,190
Stay completely out of it.

470
00:19:38,223 --> 00:19:40,423
This is between us
and the fallen angels.

471
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:42,790
Let's keep it simple, shall we?

472
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:45,456
We don't need the devils
in this town to intervene.

473
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,256
[RIAS] That sounds
like an accusation.

474
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,023
Are you
afraid that we'll side

475
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:50,356
with the fallen angels
and keep you

476
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,856
from obtaining
the Holy Swords?

477
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,923
[XENOVIA] We know
that for devils,

478
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:55,990
a Holy Sword is
a detestable thing.

479
00:19:56,023 --> 00:19:57,156
Wouldn't it make more sense

480
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,456
for you to support
the fallen angels?

481
00:20:00,456 --> 00:20:02,956
[ISSEI thinking] Oh, man.
Rias is getting pissed!

482
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,090
And if that's true,

483
00:20:04,123 --> 00:20:06,956
we will have no choice but
to completely annihilate you.

484
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,923
Even though you are
the Great Devil's sister.

485
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:11,490
[RIAS] If you already
have me figured out

486
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:13,456
then let me share
something with you:

487
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,123
There is no way
I'd ever even think

488
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:16,823
of joining the fallen angels.

489
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:19,356
I would never do anything
to besmirch the name

490
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,190
of the House of Gremory
or my dear brother.

491
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,356
It's enough for me just
to be able to hear that.

492
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,456
I was only relaying the
thoughts of headquarters.

493
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,923
I honestly didn't think
the little sister of Lucifer

494
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:32,790
would really be that stupid.

495
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:34,023
[RIAS] Good to know.

496
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:35,090
Then I hope you also understand

497
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:38,856
that I will not provide
aid to your side, either.

498
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,756
Of course.

499
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,823
I trust that we will
prevail if you promise

500
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:45,223
not to intervene in anything
we may do in this town.

501
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:47,156
[RIAS] You have my word on that.

502
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,023
[XENOVIA] We won't take up
any more of your time.

503
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:51,956
[RIAS] Would you like
some tea before you go?

504
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,890
[XENOVIA] No, thanks.

505
00:20:52,923 --> 00:20:54,823
I'm not here to make
friends with devils.

506
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:56,923
We'll let ourselves out.

507
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:02,856
I was wondering
if visiting the home

508
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,356
of Issei Hyodo
would lead us to you.

509
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:08,223
[XENOVIA]
Aren't you Asia Argento?

510
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:10,223
Um, yes.

511
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:11,490
It makes sense
that I would run

512
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:14,156
into a witch in
a place like this.

513
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,723
Oh my goodness!
It is you!

514
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:18,023
You're the former saint
who became a witch!

515
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:19,256
I had heard that
you were banished

516
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,056
because you had the power to
heal fallen angels and devils,

517
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,856
and that one time
you actually used it!

518
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,390
You must be pretty strong!

519
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:28,056
I didn't know you'd actually
become a devil yourself.

520
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,956
[ASIA] Well, I um-- I guess so.

521
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,823
[ISSEI ] You okay?

522
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:32,856
[XENOVIA]
Of course she's not okay.

523
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,456
She went from being
a saint to being a devil.

524
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,923
That's about as
far as one can fall.

525
00:21:37,956 --> 00:21:38,990
[ISSEI] That's enough!

526
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:39,823
Why don't you take that
crap and get out of here!

527
00:21:39,856 --> 00:21:41,423
[KONEKO] Dude,
you're not helping.

528
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:44,090
[ISSEI thinking] She's right.

529
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:45,456
Even I know it
would be a dick move

530
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,890
to pick a fight with
these jerks right now.

531
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:48,956
Ball sack!

532
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,256
[XENOVIA] Do you still
believe in our God, Asia?

533
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,056
Don't be silly.

534
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,156
She's like, a
devil, and stuff.

535
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,323
She's over us.

536
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:55,323
No.

537
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,290
That doesn't always mean
what you think it does.

538
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:59,856
There are those whose hearts
continue to remain pious

539
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,390
in the midst of their
own selfish betrayal.

540
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:04,890
She seems like she
might be one of them.

541
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,023
[IRINA] Really?
Is it true, Asia?

542
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:08,790
Do you still believe in God?

543
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:11,856
I mean, I know you're
like a devil, but do you?

544
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,190
Yes. I've never
been able to let go.

545
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:17,190
I've believed in God
this whole time.

546
00:22:17,223 --> 00:22:20,323
Then you should allow us
to execute you this instant.

547
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:23,223
Though you have sinned
in the worst way possible;

548
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:27,223
if you sacrifice your soul
to Him, He will forgive you.

549
00:22:27,256 --> 00:22:29,890
Let yourself be
convicted by my hand.

550
00:22:29,923 --> 00:22:31,356
God will work through
me to save you.

551
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,856
[RIAS] Do you mind
stopping there, please?

552
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,123
There is no need
for you to be

553
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:37,223
shaming my servant
here in that way.

554
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,190
I wasn't shaming
her senselessly.

555
00:22:39,223 --> 00:22:40,056
As one of God's servants,

556
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,690
I feel it is my duty
to rescue her soul.

557
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:45,323
Issei, no!

558
00:22:45,356 --> 00:22:46,990
Stop! Don't do it!

559
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:47,923
Everything's okay.

560
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:49,990
You have no right
to call Asia a witch!

561
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:50,890
Believe me;

562
00:22:50,923 --> 00:22:51,890
that's one of the
nicest descriptions

563
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:53,890
I have for someone who
has done what she has.

564
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:54,990
[ISSEI] I don't want to hear it!

565
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:55,856
You pricks are the ones

566
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,356
who decided she
was a saint, not Asia!

567
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,923
That wasn't her choice!

568
00:23:03,923 --> 00:23:06,390
She was happier
without any of this!

569
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,856
I'm okay.

570
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,490
[XENOVIA] A genuine
saint can survive

571
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:10,723
on the love of God alone.

572
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,323
If Asia makes sacrifices for
the love of anyone besides God,

573
00:23:14,356 --> 00:23:15,923
then she was never a true saint.

574
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:17,190
[ISSEI] What does
that even mean?

575
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:20,156
Saint or not, Asia is one of the
kindest souls you'll ever know!

576
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,823
If you can't see that,
then you're an idiot!

577
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:26,890
And who exactly
are you to Asia Argento?

578
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:28,023
[ISSEI] I'm her family!

579
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:30,056
We all are! And her friends!

580
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,190
If you so much as raise
a hand against her,

581
00:23:32,223 --> 00:23:33,856
I will spend every last breath

582
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,923
I have making
sure you regret it!

583
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,290
[XENOVIA] Is that so?

584
00:23:37,323 --> 00:23:40,290
Then are you prepared to
take on the entire church?

585
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:41,723
That's pretty big talk

586
00:23:41,756 --> 00:23:43,290
for a little devil,
like yourself.

587
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:44,490
[RIAS] Issei, that's enough!

588
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:45,990
[KIBA] This is perfect.

589
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:47,290
I'll take all of you on.

590
00:23:47,323 --> 00:23:48,823
[XENOVIA] Who are you?

591
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:51,923
Your superior.
Nice to meet you.

592
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:54,156
Kiba?

593
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,323
[XENOVIA] Alright then,
let's begin.

594
00:24:08,056 --> 00:24:09,190
[AKENO] Are you
sure this is okay?

595
00:24:09,223 --> 00:24:10,023
Should we be fighting people

596
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:11,990
from the church
without permission?

597
00:24:12,023 --> 00:24:13,356
[RIAS] It's just
an informal bout--

598
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,823
not an actual official battle.

599
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:16,956
'Cause if the
higher-ups found out,

600
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,090
then we'd all be in trouble!

601
00:24:20,123 --> 00:24:21,790
[XENOVIA] Consider it a drill.

602
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:23,790
No killing.

603
00:24:27,056 --> 00:24:28,290
Why are you laughing?

604
00:24:28,323 --> 00:24:30,356
[KIBA] Because the one
thing I always wanted

605
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,323
to destroy more than
anything has appeared

606
00:24:32,356 --> 00:24:34,456
willingly before my very eyes.

607
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:37,356
Sword Birth, is it?

608
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,856
I remember now.

609
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,023
During the Holy Sword
Project there was

610
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:44,890
one subject facing disposal
but managed to escape.

611
00:24:44,923 --> 00:24:46,456
Issei, it's totally you!

612
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,656
Yeah? So what?

613
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,923
[IRINA] I feel like fate is
making fun of me right now.

614
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,156
A friend I grew up
with has become a devil?

615
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,856
Why is this happening?

616
00:24:54,123 --> 00:24:56,123
[IRINA] My one goal in
this world was to learn

617
00:24:56,156 --> 00:24:58,123
how to use a Holy Sword,
move far away,

618
00:24:58,156 --> 00:25:00,156
and help everyone around me!

619
00:25:01,323 --> 00:25:02,956
God must be
testing my will

620
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,756
to overcome this
traumatic heartbreak.

621
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,956
If I can prove
I'm strong enough,

622
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,323
I will be that
much closer to Him!

623
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:10,456
Yeah, I'm pretty sure none
of this has to do with you.

624
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,790
But whatever.

625
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:13,190
I'm so sorry, Issei.

626
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:15,323
This hurts me much
more than it hurts you,

627
00:25:15,356 --> 00:25:18,990
but your sins will now face
the wrath of my Excalibur!

628
00:25:20,423 --> 00:25:22,290
Fine. You wanna
go there?

629
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:23,456
Boosted Gear!

630
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,156
[DDRAIG] Boost!

631
00:26:58,123 --> 00:26:59,290
[ISSEI] Yo, Issei here!

632
00:26:59,323 --> 00:27:00,790
It's finally time
for the showdown

633
00:27:00,823 --> 00:27:02,190
with the pair of
hottie church girls

634
00:27:02,223 --> 00:27:03,323
with holy swords!

635
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:04,523
If it comes down to it,

636
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,390
I'll have no choice but to
let that special move explode!

637
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:09,790
Next time:
"I'll Destroy the Holy Sword!"

638
00:27:09,823 --> 00:27:12,561
Come to me, boobies!
