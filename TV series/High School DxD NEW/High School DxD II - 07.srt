1
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,066
[AZAZEL] My name is Azazel.

2
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,100
And I'm the head
of the Fallen Angels.

3
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,733
[ISSEI] Oh, that's right!

4
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,533
This has to be the same guy!

5
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:27,766
What do you want?

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,333
[AZAZEL] After what
happened with Kokabiel,

7
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,033
I just thought I'd drop by.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,433
[AZAZEL] That and
one other thing.

9
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,266
I also happen to have
a special interest

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,300
in that Boosted Gear of yours.

11
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,233
It looks like Albion did
some good work, didn't he?

12
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:42,733
[ISSEI] What do you mean?
The White Dragon?

13
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:45,233
Unfortunately, I wasn't
able to be as present

14
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:46,700
as I'd liked so
I had someone else

15
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,300
take care of it in my stead.

16
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,066
I must say, I was
impressed with how well

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,033
he followed
directions this time.

18
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:53,633
[ISSEI] Oh, I see.

19
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,500
So it's your fault.

20
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:58,300
You're the reason I wasn't
able to suck Rias's boobs.

21
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,533
You destroyed my dreams!

22
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,800
[AZAZEL ] Did I really?
I'm so sorry.

23
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,566
[ISSEI] You have no idea how
close I was to a boobsickle.

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,733
I hope someone
drops a house on you.

25
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:09,400
[AZAZEL] Okay, I get it.

26
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:10,466
You'll never be able

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,066
to defeat someone like Kokabiel

28
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,666
with the amount
of power you have.

29
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,566
It really doesn't
matter how hard you try.

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,500
And another thing.

31
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:19,533
Because of the recent events,

32
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:22,133
the leaders of the Fallen
Angels, Angels, and Devils

33
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,733
have decided to hold a summit.

34
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:25,133
[ISSEI] No way! When?

35
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,166
I'm absolutely livid.

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,100
The Governor-General
of the Fallen Angels

37
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:30,533
has infiltrated my territory

38
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:32,566
and interfered with my business.

39
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,766
And on top of that,

40
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,633
he's attempting to make advances
towards my prized servant.

41
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,100
He deserves to
die a thousand deaths!

42
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,733
That bad, huh?

43
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:43,033
So, uh, are there really going

44
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:45,166
to be a bunch of
leaders meeting here?

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,133
There are.
It's absolutely true.

46
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,066
I received confirmation earlier.

47
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,500
We're going to
need to make a plan

48
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:52,500
and discuss what will
happen in the future.

49
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:54,600
Any thoughts on the matter?

50
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:56,600
I still can't
believe this happened.

51
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,766
All relationships
have been changed.

52
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,600
Nothing's the same
between anyone.

53
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:03,133
Devils, angels,
or fallen angels.

54
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,733
[RIAS] That's why a meeting
of this sort happening

55
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:06,500
so suddenly could quite frankly

56
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,200
make things more complicated.

57
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:11,233
I honestly can't help but
wonder what's really going on.

58
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:14,133
I do have a theory, however.

59
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,400
Has to do with Azazel.

60
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:17,600
Let me guess.

61
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,500
You think he could be after
my Boosted Gear, don't you?

62
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,733
[RIAS] No matter what,
it's going to be okay.

63
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,333
[RIAS] I will do everything
in my power to protect you.

64
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,574
[XENOVIA] Good morning.

65
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,874
[ASIA] Hi! How are
you doing today?

66
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:06,807
[RIAS] Good morning, Xenovia.

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,040
[ISSEI] Hey what's up?

68
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:09,040
From the look of things,

69
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:11,007
I'd say you're getting
used to living out here.

70
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,107
[XENOVIA] Yeah.

71
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,674
The place Rias prepared
for me is quite comfortable.

72
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:15,474
I'm adjusting well.

73
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:18,340
[RIAS] This whole area is
supported by the devils,

74
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:20,640
so it's going to be a
very safe environment.

75
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:22,707
[ISSEI] Gross!
What is that crap?

76
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,974
[AKENO] It hasn't been
used since last year.

77
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:27,674
[ISSEI] We have
to clean all of this?

78
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:29,874
[XENOVIA] How does
it make sense for our club

79
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:31,740
to have to clean
the swimming pool?

80
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:33,674
[RIAS] It's actually the
student council's job,

81
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,040
but we've taken it over.

82
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,507
We thought taking
on this responsibility

83
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,740
would be a great way

84
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:39,807
to thank them for all the help
they gave us with Kokabiel.

85
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,807
On the plus side,
after we finish cleaning it,

86
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,374
the pool will be ours to use

87
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:45,674
as often as we like for
a least a little while.

88
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:47,607
No way! We have a pool?

89
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,974
[thinking] Pools mean swimsuits.

90
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:50,540
If Rias and the
others want to swim,

91
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:52,507
they will be wearing
teeny tiny swimsuits!

92
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,540
Yes! I love cleaning pools!

93
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:55,340
I live for it!

94
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:56,774
Raise your hand
if you can't wait!

95
00:04:56,807 --> 00:04:57,674
Raise two hands

96
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:59,474
if you're just trying
to be a pervert.

97
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:01,707
What do you say
we blow their minds

98
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,574
with how clean the
Occult Research Club

99
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:04,940
can make the school pool!

100
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:06,807
[GROUP] Yeah!

101
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,474
[ISSEI] G-strings
and Tittie Slings!

102
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:11,607
[KIBA] Hey Issei.

103
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:13,607
[KIBA] So, listen.

104
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,907
I want you to know that if
anyone tries to hurt you,

105
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,474
I will destroy them.

106
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:20,074
Okay, that's random.

107
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:21,340
[KIBA] I know it seems that way,

108
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:23,940
but I was waiting to find a time
when we were alone to tell you.

109
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:26,440
You definitely did
a good job just now.

110
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:27,407
[thinking] Isn't that
something you should be saying

111
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,540
to some helpless hot
chick who can't fight?

112
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:31,674
Not to like, another dude?

113
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,640
You saved
my life, remember?

114
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:36,507
If I can't return the service,
then I can't call myself

115
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,740
a Knight of the
House of Gremory.

116
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:39,707
[ISSEI thinking] We're in a
locker room and I'm shirtless.

117
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,674
Just sayin'.

118
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,507
[ISSEI] Cool. Well, good talk.
I gotta go!

119
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,840
[KIBA] Wait! Issei!

120
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,940
[ISSEI] What the hell?

121
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:49,007
I thought Akeno sucked
all that crap out?

122
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,440
[DDRAIG] Remember
that time I told you

123
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,540
to be careful of strong power?

124
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:53,474
[ISSEI] What?

125
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:54,874
[DDRAIG] If you keep
coming into contact

126
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:56,574
with someone of a higher class,

127
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,074
like the Governor-General of the
Fallen Angels for instance,

128
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:01,074
it'll happen even if
you don't consent to it.

129
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:02,774
Power cancels out power.

130
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:04,807
I didn't realize you
meant that kind of power.

131
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,440
I promise to be more
careful from now on.

132
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:21,540
Hey Asia,
were you able

133
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:23,507
to finish the
homework for forth hour?

134
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,274
Sure did.

135
00:06:24,307 --> 00:06:25,640
So how do you
think you did on it?

136
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:26,640
I don't know.

137
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:28,540
There were a lot of phrases
I couldn't identify.

138
00:06:28,574 --> 00:06:30,840
Well, it was a tough
one so don't feel bad.

139
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:31,840
I'm better with numbers.

140
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:33,840
Word problems are
too complicated.

141
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:35,007
No big deal.

142
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,074
I'll just stay up late tonight
and go over all of it again.

143
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:39,040
I know God will be
right there beside you

144
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:40,840
to offer strength
and knowledge.

145
00:06:40,874 --> 00:06:43,307
Thanks.
You're right. Amen.

146
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,507
Amen.

147
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:47,507
You two better hurry
up and get changed.

148
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,940
[ASIA] Yes, miss. I'm sorry!

149
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:50,740
[KIBA] Rias! Come quick!

150
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:52,740
We need help! It's Issei!

151
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:54,474
[RIAS] Why? What's
the matter with him?

152
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:57,407
[RIAS] Not much we can
do about it, I'm afraid.

153
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,507
Akeno will have to suck the
energy from your arm again.

154
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,307
[ISSEI] You really don't mind?

155
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,140
[AKENO] I'm making an exception

156
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:04,840
for such an adorable
underclassman.

157
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:08,407
[ISSEI] Thank you very much!

158
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:18,905
[RIAS thinking]
Why is this upsetting me?

159
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:26,172
[moaning and sucking noises]

160
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:30,196
You look so hot when
you're being pleasured.

161
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,096
I'm just dying to know

162
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,063
what you'd look
like writhing in pain.

163
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:35,196
And what's that
supposed to mean?

164
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,063
[AKENO] Nothing.

165
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:37,930
Don't you want to
get naked with me?

166
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:39,063
Say what?

167
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:40,396
What do you say
we just keep this

168
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,530
between you and me?

169
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:44,330
Asia and Rias don't need
to know our secrets, right?

170
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,463
Doesn't it turn
you on to know

171
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:48,063
that no matter what we do
in here, no one will see?

172
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,030
I wonder what it
would feel like

173
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:51,963
to have my body devoured
by a hot younger guy.

174
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:54,363
I bet we could learn
a lot from each other.

175
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:55,430
Yeah. Maybe we could.

176
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:56,263
I dunno.

177
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:56,996
I know.

178
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,796
You want me to
be in control.

179
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,863
[ISSEI thinking]
What am I doing?

180
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:03,096
Is this even allowed? Shit.

181
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,696
I'd probably lose my man
card if I ran away.

182
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,163
Maybe it's fine.

183
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,163
I'm a goddamn man, aren't I?

184
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:11,396
Which one of you
would like to explain?

185
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,396
[ISSEI] Wasn't me!

186
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,263
[chuckles] I wanted
to make sure

187
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:17,396
the dragon energy
was evenly distributed.

188
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,196
Yet, somehow
I don't believe you.

189
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,763
Issei, tell me the truth.

190
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:23,296
Uh. What do you
mean by that?

191
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,363
I mean, did you
get the chance to know

192
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:27,130
your big sister in the
way you always wanted to?

193
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:29,763
All I know is my face
hurts right now.

194
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:34,230
Well, it's none
of my business.

195
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,930
[ISSEI] No no no! Rias, wait!

196
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:38,830
Was that not the
sweetest thing?

197
00:08:38,863 --> 00:08:41,330
She got jealous!
You okay, Issei?

198
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:42,663
Huh?

199
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,063
I'm so glad
our relationship

200
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:46,363
is starting to go in
a better direction.

201
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:55,663
[ISSEI] Whoa! That's so awesome!

202
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:58,330
All right,
feel free to swim

203
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:00,996
until your heart's
content! Ready, Issei?

204
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,996
Yeah?

205
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,896
[RIAS] What do you
think of my new swimsuit?

206
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,130
[ISSEI] It's the most
epic suit I've ever seen!

207
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:09,196
[AKENO] Oh my, this is really
getting to you, isn't it Rias?

208
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,396
It's adorable how bad

209
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,763
you want to impress
Issei with that outfit.

210
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:15,763
And I suppose
you're only wearing yours

211
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,963
to show off for yourself?

212
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:19,063
Sure.

213
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:20,130
Jiminy!

214
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:21,930
Those are two of the
hottest bods I've ever seen!

215
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:23,330
[ASIA] Hi, Issei!

216
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,330
I decided to change
into my swimsuit, too!

217
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:27,363
[ISSEI] Sweet!

218
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:28,930
Aw, Asia, you look great!

219
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:31,030
I'm so proud! Damn.

220
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:33,896
[ASIA] You have no idea
how happy that makes me!

221
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:35,596
[ISSEI] Koneko, you look

222
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,363
even more like the
mascot than usual!

223
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:40,030
Gotta say, it's definitely
working for you!

224
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:42,796
I honestly have no
response to that.

225
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,196
Better to have the perv's
approval than not, I guess.

226
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:48,863
By the way,
where's Xenovia?

227
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:50,963
She was having a little
trouble putting on

228
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:53,263
her swimsuit and told
me to go on without her.

229
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:54,796
Oh?

230
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,796
Issei.

231
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,963
Would you mind doing me a favor?

232
00:09:57,996 --> 00:09:59,696
Kay.

233
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:05,130
Okay, ready?

234
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:07,230
Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick.

235
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:08,930
[ASIA] You can do it, Koneko!

236
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:09,930
[ISSEI thinking]
Weird.

237
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:12,730
I never expected Koneko
to not be able to swim.

238
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:14,796
Man, if this were Rias or Akeno.

239
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,663
[RIAS] Kick, kick, kick, kick!

240
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:20,830
[AKENO] Kick, kick, kick, kick!

241
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:23,763
[ISSEI thinking] I could
so get behind that shit!

242
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:24,730
[KONEKO] Hey, um, Issei?

243
00:10:24,763 --> 00:10:26,363
[ISSEI]
Uh, yeah?

244
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:28,696
I'm, uh, sorry that you had

245
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,430
to help me learn how to swim.

246
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,596
Don't worry about it.

247
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,363
Helping a little girl learn
to swim is super fun, too.

248
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:40,963
[ISSEI thinking] Crap,
she's gonna punch me!

249
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:44,863
[KONEKO] You are
unexpectedly kind, Issei.

250
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:47,130
Especially for a pervert.

251
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:48,363
Yeah.

252
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:50,863
I can't tell if you're giving me
a compliment or just hating.

253
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:53,396
I mean, I want to help out
some of the underclassmen, too.

254
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,163
I'm a nice guy.

255
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,230
[ISSEI] All the
problems I end up

256
00:10:56,263 --> 00:10:58,230
causing are honestly accidental.

257
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,096
[ISSEI] Whoa!

258
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:08,896
[RIAS] To put it simply, a
strong rival has appeared.

259
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,896
[AKENO] There's no
stopping a heart in love.

260
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,030
[RIAS] Even if
we're best friends,

261
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:16,863
I refuse to ever
lose to you, Akeno.

262
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:19,296
[AKENO] Let's do this
fair and square, Rias.

263
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,230
[ISSEI] Whoa, the
big sisters are at it!

264
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:24,296
All right, time
for a closer look!

265
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,730
Boosted Gear!

266
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:29,930
[DDRAIG] Transfer!

267
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,896
[ISSEI thinknig] If I transfer
power to both my eyes,

268
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,263
my vision will be powered up!

269
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,096
Now this is exactly what

270
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,330
my Boosted Gear
should be used for.

271
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:40,196
I gotta save this

272
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,796
to the Gentleman
Folder inside my brain.

273
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:45,330
Hey, out the way, Kiba!

274
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:47,130
Correct me if I'm wrong,

275
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:48,663
but weren't you
supposed to help Asia

276
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:50,863
with her swimming next?

277
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,396
[ISSEI] Here we go; kick,
kick, kick, kick, kick, kick...

278
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,330
[KONEKO] You can do it, Asia.

279
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,030
Hey wai--

280
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:25,763
I hope I didn't piss
those guys off too much.

281
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:27,230
[RIAS] Issei?

282
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,130
Would you help me
rub lotion on my back?

283
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:30,896
Omigod yes
please thank you!

284
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:40,196
[ISSEI thinking]
This is the best day ever.

285
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,363
[RIAS] That feels great.

286
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,963
[RIAS] Would you like to
rub some on my chest, too?

287
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:46,930
[echoing] Would you like to
rub some on my chest, too?

288
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:48,130
On my chest.

289
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:49,396
[ISSEI thinking] "Rub lotion
on my chest" are officially

290
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,996
the most beautiful words I've
ever heard in my entire life!

291
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,063
[RIAS] Is that a no?

292
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:55,130
[ISSEI] No! I want to!

293
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:55,696
It's cool?

294
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,396
[RIAS] Of course it is!

295
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,996
I know how passionate you are

296
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,663
about touching women's breasts.

297
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,863
[ISSEI] They're only my most
favorite things in the world!

298
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,663
[RIAS] Then make sure you
do a thorough job on mine.

299
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:09,230
[ISSEI] It's weird but
kinda cool how bossy

300
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:12,063
she's been about me
touching her lately.

301
00:13:12,263 --> 00:13:13,963
[AKENO] Whatcha doin?

302
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:15,996
Is she the only
one who gets a back rub?

303
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,296
[ISSEI] You scared
the crap out of me.

304
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,196
Akeno, that was
highly inappropriate!

305
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,663
He hasn't finished with me yet!

306
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:21,430
[ISSEI] Rias! You're out!

307
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:21,963
They're out!

308
00:13:21,996 --> 00:13:22,963
I have a good idea.

309
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:25,830
Why don't you hand Issei
over to me for a while?

310
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:27,863
[RIAS] Ridiculous!

311
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:28,863
I will never
give him away

312
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:31,063
and I'm asking you one
more time to back off!

313
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:32,396
[AKENO] Tell me
something, Issei.

314
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,263
[ISSEI] Okay?

315
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:35,830
Were you able to suck
on Rias's breasts?

316
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:36,763
No, I couldn't.

317
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:37,796
I never got the chance.

318
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,963
Oh dear,
that's just too bad.

319
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:40,930
Tell you what,

320
00:13:40,963 --> 00:13:43,696
you can suck mine instead
as long as you want.

321
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,863
[ISSEI thinking] I'm in trouble.

322
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:53,696
Akeno, I don't know
what's gotten into you,

323
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,263
but you are out of control.

324
00:13:56,463 --> 00:13:57,896
[AKENO] I am not.

325
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,163
But if you're refusing
to back down

326
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:01,296
then I'm fighting to win.

327
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:08,663
I'm not giving
Issei to you!

328
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:10,963
You won't even let me
play with him a little?

329
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:12,230
I don't know why
you would want to,

330
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:14,663
considering the fact
that you hate men.

331
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:15,363
You're one to talk.

332
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,696
You said all men looked the same

333
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,163
and you couldn't
possibly be interested.

334
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,830
What the hell's
going on today?

335
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:29,363
The way a devil family
shows affection

336
00:14:29,396 --> 00:14:32,096
is just a little too much
for me to handle.

337
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,363
[XENOVIA]
What are you doing here?

338
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:35,363
[ISSEI] Xenovia?

339
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:36,263
Where have you been?

340
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:37,130
We thought we lost you.

341
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:39,030
It's the first
swimsuit I've ever had,

342
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:41,030
so it took some
time to figure it out.

343
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:42,696
Do you think it looks okay?

344
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,396
You've never been
swimming before?

345
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,163
Is it because you
were born in a church?

346
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:47,330
[XENOVIA] No, I've just
never been interested

347
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:50,063
in recreational activities.

348
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:52,196
[ISSEI] Still. It's
just two pieces of fabric.

349
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,730
You're right-- I did
figure it out a while ago.

350
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,363
Truth is I was
doing some thinking.

351
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,663
[ISSEI] This can't be good.

352
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,030
Just hear me out, okay?

353
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:01,196
I have an important matter
I'd like to discuss.

354
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,663
Okay? But first.

355
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:04,363
What's with the dramatic tone?

356
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:08,096
[XENOVIA]
That's just my voice. Listen.

357
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,896
I would like you to
make a baby with me.

358
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,481
You never
gave me an answer.

359
00:15:27,514 --> 00:15:29,514
I want to make a baby with you.

360
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:30,448
[ISSEI] Why?

361
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:32,148
[XENOVIA] It used
to be that serving God

362
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,981
was my only dream--
my every reason for living.

363
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:37,181
But now things have changed
and that dream is dead.

364
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:40,181
I've already approached Rias
for her thoughts on the matter.

365
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:43,214
Devils have desires,
grant desires,

366
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:46,114
give desires, and hope for
desires without obligation.

367
00:15:46,148 --> 00:15:48,248
We get to live
the life that we want.

368
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,114
[XENOVIA] So...

369
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,114
[ISSEI thinking] Shit.

370
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:52,114
[XENOVIA] I decided the
life I want right now

371
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:54,948
is the womanly life
I never thought I would have.

372
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:56,948
To create life inside of me.

373
00:15:56,981 --> 00:15:58,014
[ISSEI] Yeah. Life. Great.

374
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,281
[XENOVIA] As I was watching
you fight Kokabiel,

375
00:16:00,314 --> 00:16:02,281
I noticed your latent powers.

376
00:16:02,314 --> 00:16:04,181
I decided they
are worth looking at.

377
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,181
Also, you have taken
on the aura of a dragon.

378
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:09,348
I want my child to have that.

379
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:12,248
They should have unique,
strong, and powerful genes.

380
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:14,881
But I'm not the only one
who can give that to you!

381
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:15,881
So it must be fate

382
00:16:15,914 --> 00:16:17,514
that we are here alone together.

383
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:19,214
It has to be God's will.

384
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:21,381
Okay, let's hurry.

385
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,448
These things take
a few months to grow.

386
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:25,381
I apologize that I don't

387
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:27,781
have any experience with men.

388
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:30,348
I will need to follow your
lead while we intercourse.

389
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:31,848
[ISSEI] Wait!

390
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:33,814
[XENOVIA] Touch me, please.

391
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:34,548
[ISSEI] Huh?

392
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:35,548
You can do
anything you want

393
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:39,214
as long as I end up with
your seed inside of me.

394
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,881
Issei! What is
going on in here?

395
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:42,848
[ISSEI screams]

396
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:44,181
[AKENO] Uh oh. Sorry, Xenovia.

397
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:45,381
That's not going to work.

398
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:48,514
I already claimed Issei's
virginity so I get to go first.

399
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:50,014
Issei, you're so mean!

400
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:51,448
Why didn't you tell me
that's what you wanted?

401
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:53,081
I would've done it!

402
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:55,114
Looks like you're
in for a bumpy night.

403
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,548
It's time to make a baby.

404
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:58,148
Let's go. We don't have all day.

405
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,481
Do you even understand
what you're saying?

406
00:16:59,514 --> 00:17:00,314
You want to make a baby?

407
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:01,281
That's insane!

408
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:03,148
You can't just force
your eggs on someone!

409
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:07,248
[ISSEI screams]

410
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:12,514
[RIAS] Seriously.

411
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:15,514
I swear I will never understand
your perversion, Issei.

412
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:16,948
It's not perverted.

413
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:19,048
He was just trying
to make a baby with me.

414
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:19,514
It's a beautiful thing.

415
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:20,081
I was not!

416
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:21,481
You were forcing eggs!

417
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:23,981
[SIR ZECHS]
This looks like a good time.

418
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:28,881
Is there some sort
of event going on?

419
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,081
[RIAS] What are you doing here?

420
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:33,314
Whoa! It's The Devil King.

421
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:36,014
[ASIA thinknig]
This is the Devil King?

422
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:39,548
Mister Sir Zechs?
Lucifer? Rias's brother?

423
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:41,514
[SIR ZECHS]
You must be Asia Argento.

424
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:42,514
[ASIA] Yes, sir.

425
00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:44,481
I've been told that you
are an excellent Bishop,

426
00:17:44,514 --> 00:17:46,914
and that you're taking
very good care of our Rias.

427
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:47,914
[ASIA] Really? Wow!

428
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:49,914
Don't look so nervous, my dear.

429
00:17:49,948 --> 00:17:52,414
I'm merely here to conduct
some private business matters.

430
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:53,314
[ASIA] Right.

431
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:55,114
What private business?

432
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:57,248
It's very good to meet you.

433
00:17:57,281 --> 00:18:00,014
I've heard so much.
I'm Xenovia.

434
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:01,981
Pleasure to meet you,
Miss Xenovia.

435
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,114
I didn't believe
my ears at first

436
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,914
when I heard the Durandal
user had joined my sister.

437
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:08,948
What a beautiful and intelligent
decision you've made.

438
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:10,481
[XENOVIA] I do wonder
if I didn't think over

439
00:18:10,514 --> 00:18:13,014
my decision to become
a devil long enough.

440
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:15,481
I still sometimes
regret what I did.

441
00:18:15,514 --> 00:18:18,181
I mean, what was
it that made me

442
00:18:18,214 --> 00:18:20,048
want to change
in the first place?

443
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:21,448
Was I just desperate?

444
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:23,248
Did I even have a choice, or--?

445
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:25,381
It's nice that there are those

446
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:27,848
in my sister's family
that make her laugh.

447
00:18:27,881 --> 00:18:28,814
Xenovia.

448
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:29,781
I'd like to ask you to support

449
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:33,181
the House of Gremory
as part of Rias' family.

450
00:18:33,214 --> 00:18:34,414
I guess I have no choice

451
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,348
if the Devil King
commands it so.

452
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,048
I promise to do
my very best, sir.

453
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:41,248
It will be an honor
and a pleasure.

454
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:42,481
[SIR ZECHS] Thank you.

455
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:45,314
And you have yet to tell me
what you're doing here exactly.

456
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:46,981
[SIR ZECHS]
You honestly don't know?

457
00:18:47,014 --> 00:18:48,914
Isn't it almost
time for Open House?

458
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:49,614
What? No way! You can't!

459
00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:50,581
If you mean that I can't wait

460
00:18:50,614 --> 00:18:51,281
to see my little sister
in action at school,

461
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:55,214
then you're absolutely right.

462
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:56,914
Was it you, Grayfia?

463
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:58,414
Did you tell him? Be honest.

464
00:18:58,448 --> 00:18:59,914
Oh, I almost forgot.

465
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:01,348
Father will be here, too.

466
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,514
You can't just leave like that.

467
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:03,914
You have work to do.

468
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:04,881
You're the Devil King.

469
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:06,248
You have responsibilities.

470
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:08,781
[SIR ZECHS] No, actually
this counts as work, too.

471
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,048
[gasps]

472
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:12,448
[SIR ZECHS] Your school seems
like it would be a lovely place.

473
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:13,281
We were thinking we might want

474
00:19:13,314 --> 00:19:16,114
to hold the leaders'
summit there.

475
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:17,048
Of all the places.

476
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:19,348
Are you serious?

477
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:20,914
[SIR ZECHS] I'm glad to
hear that my little sister

478
00:19:20,948 --> 00:19:22,848
hasn't inconvenienced you.

479
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:25,281
[MOTHER] Oh no,
Rias is such a lovely girl.

480
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:27,014
Clean. Eats her veggies. Lovely.

481
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:28,814
[FATHER] Oh yes, she's
a wonderful young lady

482
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:30,948
but I have no idea what's
she's doing with Issei.

483
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:32,848
All right, come on
and have another drink!

484
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,781
[SIR ZECHS] If you insist.

485
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:37,014
[FATHER] Hahaha!
You're a good drinker!

486
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:37,914
It's whatever, Dad.

487
00:19:37,948 --> 00:19:39,448
Hang out with the Devil King.

488
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:40,381
It's okay.

489
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:42,348
He doesn't even know
he's talking to Lucifer.

490
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,248
Issei.

491
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:44,248
What were you thinking?

492
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:46,148
Why did you say he
could stay at your house?

493
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:47,314
[ISSEI] I was being polite.

494
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:50,248
Besides, he said he'd
find a hotel tomorrow.

495
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:53,914
Ugh... So humiliating.

496
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:57,348
[ISSEI thinking]
Rias gets humiliated?

497
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:59,348
[RIAS] What?
You can't be serious!

498
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:02,014
Are you trying to tell me
I can't sleep with Issei?

499
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:03,148
[SIR ZECHS]
Sorry, but I'd like to talk

500
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,181
with him as we
fall asleep tonight.

501
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:09,114
Surely I can borrow
him for just one evening.

502
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:09,981
[ISSEI thinking]
So her very own brother

503
00:20:10,014 --> 00:20:12,981
doesn't care that
we sleep together?

504
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:13,848
Rias!

505
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,248
Tell me you'll be okay.

506
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,448
Do you think you can even
fall sleep all by yourself?

507
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:19,381
Can you ever survive
without me by your side

508
00:20:19,414 --> 00:20:20,981
because I don't think
I'll get a wink of sleep

509
00:20:21,014 --> 00:20:22,914
without you there.

510
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:24,381
[GRAYFIA] Come now, my lady.

511
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:25,281
It's time for us to go.

512
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:26,881
Yes, I'm coming.

513
00:20:26,914 --> 00:20:28,314
Thank you, Grayfia.

514
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:29,914
Rest well, gentlemen.

515
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:31,414
Yeah, uh,
good night, ladies.

516
00:20:31,448 --> 00:20:32,814
Good night, Issei.

517
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:34,014
And sweet dreams.

518
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:36,381
Yeah, sweet dreams
to you, too, Rias.

519
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:37,748
[ASIA] Issei.

520
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:41,414
Unfortunately,
I will also be sleeping

521
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,181
in my own room tonight.

522
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:44,381
[ISSEI] Oh, right.

523
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:45,448
Good night, Asia.

524
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:48,214
And good night
to you, Issei!

525
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,348
[ISSEI thinking] Weird.
What do I feel so guilty for?

526
00:21:00,414 --> 00:21:02,414
[ISSEI] Man.
I'm so sorry.

527
00:21:02,448 --> 00:21:03,614
[SIR ZECHS]
For what?

528
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:07,448
[ISSEI] For making the Devil
King sleep in a place like this.

529
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:10,248
[SIR ZECHS chuckles]
Actually, I'd like to thank you.

530
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:11,414
In our world,

531
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:13,881
it's unthinkable to be treated
as a normal guest in a home.

532
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:15,814
I'm enjoying the change.
Thank you.

533
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:18,281
You've been a wonderful host.

534
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:20,114
I actually feel
more comfortable here

535
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,514
than I would at a hotel.

536
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,481
[ISSEI thinking]
How is this real life?

537
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:25,314
[SIR ZECHS] Also,
I don't think I've ever seen

538
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:28,914
Rias have so much fun,
even in Hades.

539
00:21:28,948 --> 00:21:29,814
It's all thanks to you.

540
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:32,048
Nah. It's not like
I've done anything.

541
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:33,181
[SIR ZECHS] Issei?

542
00:21:33,214 --> 00:21:34,181
Yeah?

543
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:36,781
I'm counting on you to
take care of Rias for me.

544
00:21:36,814 --> 00:21:37,781
[ISSEI]
Of course, sir!

545
00:21:37,814 --> 00:21:38,981
I mean, I have to.

546
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:40,414
I'm her pawn. It's my job.

547
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:42,881
Unless she doesn't need me
then I stay out of her way.

548
00:21:42,914 --> 00:21:44,048
I appreciate it.

549
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:47,314
Also, I never asked, but is
it okay that I call you Issei?

550
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,248
Yeah!

551
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:49,514
It would be weird to
be called anything else.

552
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:50,681
All right then, Issei,

553
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:54,414
it's only fair that I ask you
to call me by my name, too.

554
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:56,448
You're also welcome
to call me "Big Brother."

555
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,414
[ISSEI] Wow. Yeah.

556
00:21:57,448 --> 00:21:59,014
I don't know about all that.

557
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:00,448
Honestly, I've gotten so used

558
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:02,881
to calling you Sir Zechs
that I might forget.

559
00:22:02,914 --> 00:22:05,081
[SIR ZECHS]
Let's go with that, then.

560
00:22:05,114 --> 00:22:06,214
Oh, and by the way,

561
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:09,148
my sources tell me that you've
met our mysterious Azazel.

562
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:09,981
[ISSEI] Yeah.

563
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:10,814
I'm guessing he's
probably trying

564
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:13,181
to get in on some
Boosted Gear action.

565
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:14,881
[SIR ZECHS]
You might be right.

566
00:22:14,914 --> 00:22:16,314
He does seem to
be very interested

567
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:18,314
in the Sacred Gears as of late.

568
00:22:18,348 --> 00:22:20,314
But he's not a
war-lover like Kokabiel.

569
00:22:20,348 --> 00:22:22,081
Besides, in the previous war,

570
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:25,314
the fallen angels were
the first side to withdraw.

571
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:28,314
[SIR ZECHS] It has
been said that Azazel

572
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:31,481
punished Kokabiel
by freezing him solid.

573
00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:33,548
So what does he
want with me?

574
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:36,248
You don't think he wants me
to be his servant, do you?

575
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:38,214
What's gonna happen
if he brainwashes me?

576
00:22:38,248 --> 00:22:39,848
What am I supposed to do?

577
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:41,348
He won't do that.

578
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,514
I promise you have
nothing to worry about.

579
00:22:43,548 --> 00:22:45,848
Wow. Thanks for looking
out for me, man.

580
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:46,748
Sure.

581
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:48,181
It's not every day
that a legendary dragon

582
00:22:48,214 --> 00:22:49,981
joins the ranks of the devils,

583
00:22:50,014 --> 00:22:52,048
and there's something
else I wanted to ask you.

584
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:53,781
It seems that
you have a strong

585
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:56,248
appreciation for large
breasts on a woman?

586
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:58,081
Huh?

587
00:22:58,114 --> 00:22:59,448
Oh yes, sir, I love
them more than air!

588
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:01,048
Well, even though
I'm her brother,

589
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:04,048
I can acknowledge that Rias
has a very attractive set.

590
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:04,614
Agreed!

591
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:05,548
I think Rias, I mean,

592
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:07,348
my Master's boobs
are the best there is!

593
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:09,114
Nothing else can compare!

594
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:11,181
[SIR ZECHS] Might I speak
hypothetically for a moment?

595
00:23:11,214 --> 00:23:12,048
[ISSEI] Yes, sir!

596
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:13,781
Have you ever wondered
what might happen

597
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:15,548
if you were to
transfer your power.

598
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:16,981
What if somehow
the Boosted Gear

599
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:19,348
found its way to
Rias' breasts?

600
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:22,048
Just something
to think about.

601
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:23,048
I'm mostly joking.

602
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:24,914
Don't read too much into it.

603
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:26,248
Sleep well.

604
00:23:29,014 --> 00:23:31,814
[ISSEI thinking] Using my
Boosted Gear on Rias's knockers.

605
00:23:31,848 --> 00:23:34,048
Why didn't I didn't
think of that before?

606
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,248
So much valuable
time has been wasted!

607
00:23:38,414 --> 00:23:40,148
[thinking] Would they
get even bigger?

608
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:42,314
Could those beautiful
mounds become rounder?

609
00:23:42,348 --> 00:23:44,848
Will the firmness or shine
become even brighter?

610
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:45,948
I can't think about this!

611
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:48,314
It's too much!

612
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:49,148
It's not gonna happen!

613
00:23:49,181 --> 00:23:49,848
I can't even deal!

614
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:50,781
Thinking of those things makes

615
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:53,081
at least one of my
heads want to explode!

616
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:58,214
[ISSEI] No more. I'll go insane.

617
00:24:04,048 --> 00:24:05,848
[ISSEI thinking] So much
for not thinking about it.

618
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:07,181
I hardly slept at all.

619
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:08,848
Dude, though,
transferring the Gift

620
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,814
to her breasts is a killer idea.

621
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:12,348
That Devil King knows what's up.

622
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:14,148
Why didn't I think of
it in the first place?

623
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:15,514
I'm showing my
brother around today,

624
00:24:15,548 --> 00:24:17,381
so I will likely
be late for school.

625
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,048
I'll see you two again
at the Open House.

626
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:23,414
Take care, and
good luck in class.

627
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:25,181
Thank you. Goodbye!

628
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,314
[SIR ZECHS]
Grayfia, what do you say

629
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:27,914
we be proper tourists today?

630
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:29,514
[GRAYFIA]
After we complete our tasks.

631
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:31,014
[RIAS] This is the worst.

632
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:33,414
[ISSEI] Xenovia's late, I guess?

633
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:36,048
[ASIA] She said she was
going to stay up studying.

634
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:38,414
Poor thing.
I bet it was a long night.

635
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:40,181
I'll see if she's feeling okay.

636
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:41,214
You go ahead, Issei.

637
00:24:41,248 --> 00:24:42,748
[ISSEI] Okay.

638
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,248
[thinking]
I'm glad Asia and Xenovia

639
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:45,948
are getting along so well.

640
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:47,381
Makes my life easier.

641
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:47,914
[FEMALE STUDENT 7-1]
Good morning!

642
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:48,481
[STUDENTS] Morning!

643
00:24:48,514 --> 00:24:49,614
[ISSEI thinking] Damn.

644
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:51,881
It's been so long since
I've come to school by myself.

645
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:54,948
[thinking] When I first got
here I was an unpopular nobody.

646
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:57,381
But now I come to school
every day surrounded by hotties.

647
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:01,048
Talk about climbing
the social ladder.

648
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:02,848
Shit! What's going on?

649
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:07,748
[ISSEI] Who's that?

650
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:10,781
[VALI] You don't remember?

651
00:25:10,814 --> 00:25:12,548
This is the second
time we've met here.

652
00:25:12,581 --> 00:25:14,148
[ISSEI] It is?

653
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,781
[VALI] You're Issei Hyodo,
the Welsh Dragon.

654
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:19,148
Red Dragon Emperor.

655
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:22,048
[VALI] I am Vali.

656
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:23,848
White Dragon Emperor,

657
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:26,214
but you can call me
the Vanishing Dragon.

658
00:26:57,414 --> 00:26:58,281
[ISSEI] Yo, Issei here!

659
00:26:58,314 --> 00:27:00,214
It's time for our school's
Open House!

660
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:01,848
Rias's older brother,
and even

661
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:04,314
the student council president's
older sister are coming.

662
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:06,348
And there's a huge
commotion while we're there!

663
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:07,781
Hope it's all right!

664
00:27:07,814 --> 00:27:09,848
Next time, "Open House Begins!"

665
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:12,439
I'll cherish those
pretty pillows!
