Dude, what the hell;
that was dangerous.

5
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,466
I thought this was
a friendly fight!

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,400
[IRINA] Oh!

7
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,400
To return to my
hometown only to be forced

8
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:30,566
to kill one of
my oldest friends.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,733
Alas, fate can be so cruel!

10
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,100
Issei, try to avoid
her direct attacks!

00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,100
Yeah. That is
the plan. Thanks!

You devils certainly
have a fair amount

of the pagan sacred treasures.

18
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:49,500
I have another power.

One that comes from grudges

With this power,

I will destroy

I'm a little worried.

29
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,533
Actually, that
sword doesn't seem

30
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:18,400
to be bothering him much.

is the Dragon itself.

You're way too simple
to be that impertinent.

34
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,700
Whatever that means,
you're gonna regret it.

Uh, that's freaky.

[KONEKO] You
should be careful.

Seriously, watch
out for that pervo-jerk

46
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:25,729

my secrets away
to the enemy?

51

Because you are the

Sometimes the things
you say really hurt.

I can hardly believe how
you've ended up, Issei.

54
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:42,562
It's not enough that you've
turned into an evil devil,

55
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:43,362

Preach it, sister.

I think you've received
divine punishment.

So, perhaps you should seal away
this kind of obscene attack.

I may have
underestimated you a little;

114
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,196
your movements were
almost good enough.

115

Almost.

00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:32,862
I have to agree with you.

00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:34,696
Yes, Irina Shido.

130
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:37,029
I officially

Aw, damn it all to hell!

132
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:47,929
Why don't
we see which of these

133
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:49,962
destructive swords
is the most destructive.

134
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:52,429
Will it be your
Holy or my Demon?

135
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:56,596
[XENOVIA] Too bad.

136
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:13,896
[XENOVIA] Your only
weapons are a few swords

137
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:14,996
and a little speed.

138
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,096
Not only do you lack the
power to use a large sword,

139
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:19,629
but in the process,
you're sealing away

140
00:08:19,662 --> 00:08:21,629
that speed you're so proud of.

141
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:25,462
Please, don't tell me
you didn't realize that fact?

142
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:28,496
[KIBA] No. Wait.

143
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:30,896
[XENOVIA] You should know only

144
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:32,829
to fight when you're rational.

145
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:36,129
After all. You are my superior.

146
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:40,896
[XENOVIA] Looks like the end.

147
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,162
So then, are you satisfied,

148
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:45,162
Yes.

149
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:48,096
I'm grateful neither
were dealt final blows.

150

Thank you both
for your integrity.

151
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:51,362
[XENOVIA] Of course.

152
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:54,162
And remember what
we talked about earlier.

153
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:57,829
[RIAS] Just out of curiosity.

154
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:00,196
Did you find out which
fallen angel was guilty?

155
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:02,196
Of stealing the swords, I mean.

156
00:09:02,229 --> 00:09:04,062
We know who was behind it. Yes.

157
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:05,696
The leader of the Grigoris.

158
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:07,996
Named Kokabiel.

159
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,962
Huh? Yeah, uh.

160
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:11,629
So, who are the Grigoris?

161
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:12,796
Fallen angels.

162
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,529
It's a group of them
who are also known

163
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:17,062
as the "Ones Who Watch Over
the Children of God".

00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:19,462
The two of you
are after a leader class?

165
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:20,929
Are you planning to die?

166
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:21,862
We do what we must

167
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,929
to keep the fallen
from the Holy Swords.

168
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:27,029
I am willing to trade
my life to annihilate them.

169
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:27,896
We understand the danger.

170
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:31,729
There has already
been one casualty.

171
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:33,829
[IRINA] A priest
who came to this town

172
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:36,596
to check things out
ahead of time was killed.

173
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:40,429
[KIBA] I know who killed him.
Freed Sellzen.

174
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:42,629
Whaddaya mean Freed?

175
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:47,562
Really?
The stray priest did?

176
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:50,896
[KIBA] I happened to be there
when the priest was murdered.

177
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,796
And Freed definitely
had a Holy Sword.

178
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,896
Interesting it
was a stray priest.

179
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:00,029
At least we know
what we're up against.

180
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:03,962
[XENOVIA] I appreciate the
information you've shared,

181
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:07,729
but don't involve yourselves
further in our affairs.

182
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:10,462
[XENOVIA] We'll take our leave.

183
00:10:10,496 --> 00:10:12,529
Hold on;
wait for me, Xenovia!

184
00:10:12,562 --> 00:10:15,029
Well. Thank you.
This has been such fun.

185
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:17,729
Issei, I'll be here
to judge you anytime!

186
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:20,429
[smooches] Amen!

187
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:27,096
[RIAS] Where are
you going, Kiba?

188
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:30,596
You do realize I will never
permit you to leave me.

189
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,729
Remember, you are a
Knight of the House of Gremory.

190
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:37,196
[KIBA] I know, President.
And I'm sorry.

191
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:38,796
[RIAS] Kiba.

192
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:45,429
[ASIA] Oh no. He left.

193
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:51,629
Oh, Kiba. Why now?

194
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:06,662
[IRINA] I don't
get why I can't even

195
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:08,629
take a bath comfortably.

196
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:13,929
I bet this must be
another trial from God.

197
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:15,996
[XENOVIA]
Do you really believe that?

198
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:18,796
[XENOVIA] After all,
you were the one

199
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:20,429
who spent all of our money.

200
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:24,496
For what? A weird,
suspicious looking picture?

201
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:26,562
What are
you trying to say?

202
00:11:26,596 --> 00:11:28,562
There's an honest to goodness
holy person in that image,

203
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:29,696
and you know it!

204
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:32,529
The exhibition guy said so.

205
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,896
And why would he lie?

206
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:40,196
[XENOVIA] Why did I have to
be stuck with you as a partner?

207
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:41,929
[IRINA] Wow, when
you get depressed,

208
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:44,129
you get like really
depressed, don't you?

209
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,696
[XENOVIA] Oh, be quiet.

210
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:46,996
[stomach growling]

211
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:49,629
[XENOVIA] First things first,

212
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:51,562
we have to find a way
to get something to eat.

213
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:54,196
We're hardly in the condition
to retrieve Excalibur right now.

214
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:55,062
[IRINA] Yeah, you're right.

215
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:56,029
In that case,
you wanna threaten people

216
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:58,896
from other religions
so they'll give us money?

217
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:00,562
Since they won't
be with the church,

218
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,596
God will totally
forgive us. Probably.

219
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:04,729
[XENOVIA]
If we're going that far,

220
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:06,762
we might as well just steal
a temple's offering box

221
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:08,462
or something like that instead.

222
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:10,029
[IRINA]
Oh, that would be easier!

223
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:10,829
Good plan!

224
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:13,729
[XENOVIA] No.
We can't do that.

225
00:12:13,762 --> 00:12:14,996
[IRINA] Right.

226
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:18,129
I guess that wouldn't be
very nice, now would it?

227
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:34,852
[KIRYUU] Congratulations!

228
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,652
We're gonna
karaoke with you all!

229
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:38,018
Asia, too, right?

230
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:39,252
Yeah, I'm planning on it.

231
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:40,252
Aw, hell yeah!

232
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:42,318
Screw Kiryuu,
I'll take two of that fly Asia.

233
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:44,218
What's wrong, Issei?

234
00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:47,985
Be careful not to let all
their loser rub off on you.

235
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:52,752
Oh, hello, Saji.
How are you doing?

236
00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:54,752
Better now that
I've laid my eyes on you.

237
00:12:54,785 --> 00:12:55,585
Watch it!

238
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:56,918
Student council
secretary or not,

239
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:59,785
you need to
back off, mo-fo!

240
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:01,252
Such aggression.

241
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:03,752
This is what I'm
talking about, Asia.

242
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:06,985
[ISSEI] Oh yeah.
I forgot about him.

243
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:13,052
[SAJI] Hyodo.

244
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:16,252
Hey, yeah, uh-- Sorry
for calling you out here.

245
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:19,252
No worries, man. So?

246
00:13:19,818 --> 00:13:21,685
Hell no; are
you even serious?

247
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,352
[ISSEI] As a
five-hour boner, dude!

248
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,252
You're insane!

249
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:27,685
You realize both of
our presidents will punish us

250
00:13:27,718 --> 00:13:30,218
just for being involved with
those Holy Swords, right?

251
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:32,585
And yet you still wanna
go out and destroy them?

252
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:34,618
We're gonna get
murdered for sure!

253
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,085
I mean, you've got Rias.

254
00:13:36,118 --> 00:13:37,752
She's strict, but reasonable.

255
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:40,818
Sona is draconian
and loves punishing us!

256
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:42,785
No way, man. Sorry.

257
00:13:46,885 --> 00:13:47,918
Big surprise;

258
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,985
I kinda had a feeling you
would try to run away.

259
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:53,918
I wanna go home!

260
00:13:54,218 --> 00:13:56,252
So you wanna
cooperate with the Church?

261
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:57,418
Makes sense.

262
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:59,118
I mean, those chicks said
they'd rather destroy the swords

263
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:01,352
than have the fallen angels
use them, didn't they?

264
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:02,218
Yes.

265
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:03,085
It seems like
they'll stop at nothing

266
00:14:03,118 --> 00:14:05,285
to get them back
in the Church's hands.

267
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:07,918
Kiba wants to get his revenge
by defeating Excalibur.

268
00:14:07,952 --> 00:14:09,618
And the church
wants the swords back

269
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,218
no matter what it costs.

270
00:14:11,252 --> 00:14:13,985
The goals might be different,
but they have the same result.

271
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:15,318
That's why it works.

272
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:17,318
We just gotta get
both to cooperate.

273
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:18,785
I'm not sure
they'll be as eager

274
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:20,318
to do this as you are, though.

275
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:21,685
We should at least try!

276
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:23,152
Especially if it
means Kiba will be able

277
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:25,752
to keep being a devil
with the rest of us.

278
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:28,818
I think we gotta do
everything we can think of!

279
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:32,585
First, we have to find
those girls. Somehow.

280
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:35,252
I don't like keeping this
secret from Rias and Akeno,

281
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:37,852
but we have to do
something to help him.

282
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:42,852
Cool, so I don't have to
be here anymore, do I?

283
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:43,952
You've got your rook on board,

284
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:45,885
so what do you need me for?

285
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,018
We need you because the
stronger we are, the better.

286
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:51,252
Probably won't be too easy
to find them, you know?

287
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:52,385
It's not like we're
gonna run into

288
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:55,318
a couple of weirdoes in
white robes on Main Street.

289
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:58,285
Oh, blessings on the
wandering sheep before us.

290
00:14:58,318 --> 00:15:00,652
We are pitiful when
compared to you, O Lord!

291
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:01,352
Please have mercy
upon us, dear Father!

292
00:15:01,385 --> 00:15:02,352
[ISSEI] Or maybe we will.

293
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:03,785
[KONEKO] Right.

294
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:08,085
So, delicious!

295
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:10,752
Don't you agree?
This is heaven!

296
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,985
Oh yeah!

297
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:14,785
Everything I'm putting into my
mouth is like food for the soul!

298
00:15:14,818 --> 00:15:16,852
[SAJI] Watching this is a
little too intense for me.

299
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:18,985
[ISSEI] Yeah, looks like
they were really hungry.

300
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,718
[WAITRESS 3A] Here's
your hamburger steak.

301
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:23,785
[XENOVIA] What just happened?

302
00:15:23,818 --> 00:15:26,185
Even if this
will build our faith,

303
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,985
the devil saving us
must mean the end of days.

304
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:31,018
We've practically sold
our souls to the devil!

305
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:32,685
How will we ever be forgiven?

306
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:34,685
That's my thanks
for buying you food?

307
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:36,885
Get it together, bro.

308
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:40,285
Sorry, I couldn't help it,
but I'm smiling now, see?

309
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:41,218
Lord, please, have mercy

310
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:43,752
on these kind souls
even if they are devils.

311
00:15:43,785 --> 00:15:44,918
[cries in anger]

312
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:45,918
For the love
of thick thighs!

313
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:48,352
Damn it; we don't need
God's blessing. Stop it!

314
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:49,685
Oh, right; I'm sorry.

315
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:52,085
It's kind of a habit.

316
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,018
[XENOVIA] Well? What's the deal?

317
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:56,118
What did you want
to talk to us about?

318
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:58,785
We want to help
you destroy Excalibur.

319
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:00,318
What?

320
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:03,752
[XENOVIA]
I understand the situation.

321
00:16:03,785 --> 00:16:06,052
I don't mind letting you
take care of one sword.

322
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:07,152
Wait a minute, Xenovia!

323
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:08,618
You mean it?

324
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:09,918
Why couldn't she
just have refused us

325
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:12,318
like I was
hoping she would?

326
00:16:12,352 --> 00:16:14,652
You know who
the other side has.

327
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:16,718
Kokabiel is dangerous.

328
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:19,052
Honestly, it'll be
impossible for us

329
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:21,318
to recover all
three swords on our own.

330
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:23,852
Yeah, I get that,
but they're like devils!

331
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,185
We have a thirty
percent chance

332
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,285
of returning home.

333
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,318
We knew what
kind of risk

334
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:29,052
we were taking
before we got here.

335
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:30,818
This isn't anything
new, Xenovia!

336
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:32,018
True.

337
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:33,885
We were sent by the higher ups,

338
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:37,985
fully prepared to sacrifice our
lives for this sacred cause.

339
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:40,718
That's what I just said.

340
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:42,952
Were you even
listening to me at all?

341
00:16:44,118 --> 00:16:45,252
[KIBA] I get it.

342
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:46,718
But I'm quite
disappointed that someone

343
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:48,652
who could wield an
Excalibur would approve

344
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:50,185
of their destruction.

345
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,018
[XENOVIA]
Speaking of disappointing.

346
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:56,018
Didn't you recently abandon your
place in the House of Gremory?

347
00:16:56,052 --> 00:16:58,085
[XENOVIA]
Since you're a stray now.

348
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,318
We could execute
you if you'd like.

349
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:04,052
[KIBA] You're welcome
to try if you'd like.

350
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:06,685
Hold it, guys!

351
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:08,852
We're trying to cooperate
here, so no fighting.

352
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:10,018
Simmer down!

353
00:17:10,052 --> 00:17:12,785
You obviously resent what
the Holy Sword Project did.

354
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:15,285
I completely understand.

355
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:17,318
That incident is viewed

356
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:19,285
with great repugnance
by those of us currently

357
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:21,252
with the Church, as well.

358
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:22,818
We know.

359
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:25,718
And that is why the person
responsible was punished.

360
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:27,052
Excommunicated.

361
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:29,885
His name
is Galilei Valper.

362
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:33,052
Also known as the
Archbishop of Annihilation.

363
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,818
I know Valper.
It was all him.

364
00:17:36,852 --> 00:17:38,918
He was responsible.

365
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:40,352
[XENOVIA] I told
you one of his tools

366
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:42,318
was a stray priest, didn't I?

367
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,752
[ISSEI] You mean Freed?

368
00:17:43,785 --> 00:17:44,952
[XENOVIA] It's not
uncommon for there

369
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:46,218
to be collusion among those

370
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:48,752
who've been banned
from the Church.

371
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:50,952
There's a high possibility
Valper is involved

372
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:54,318
with what's going
on now, as well.

373
00:17:54,352 --> 00:17:55,385
Well, after hearing that,

374
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:58,785
there's no reason for me
not to cooperate with you.

375
00:17:58,818 --> 00:18:01,052
Yay! Then I guess
it's been decided.

376
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:02,218
We shall return the favor

377
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:06,685
for the food someday, Red
Dragon Emperor Issei Hyodo.

378
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:10,885
So this is
good news, yeah?

379
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:12,252
This is not good news!

380
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:13,752
This is not good news at all;

381
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:14,785
not only could we
have been killed,

382
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:15,952
but we could've been responsible

383
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:17,618
for another war with the Church!

384
00:18:17,652 --> 00:18:19,052
[KIBA] Issei.

385
00:18:20,652 --> 00:18:21,452
Seemed like our turn

386
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:23,585
to help since you're
always saving us.

387
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:25,252
[KIBA] I want you
to stay out of this.

388
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:28,618
What's going on here
is my revenge, not yours.

389
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:30,118
I cannot allow this.

390
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,885
I don't want you all involved.

391
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:33,285
But we're
family, aren't we?

392
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:34,952
We're supposed to be friends!

393
00:18:34,985 --> 00:18:36,818
You tell me that I'm wrong!

394
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:39,218
No, you're not wrong.

395
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,552
but still, there's--

396
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:42,585
But nothing.

397
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:44,652
How can you expect us
to just let you go?

398
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:46,152
To be what? A stray?

399
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:47,885
And it's not only us, either!

400
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,885
Have you thought about Rias?

401
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:54,285
President Rias,
of course.

402
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:55,952
Of course.

403
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:58,085
I first met her
because of the project.

404
00:18:58,118 --> 00:18:59,952
I would be dead if not for her.

405
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:03,618
[KIBA] We were just kids,

406
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:07,152
being experimented
on day after day.

407
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:08,718
Our freedom was taken,

408
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:10,818
and we weren't
even treated as humans.

409
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:13,885
Yet, we all believed
we were chosen by God.

410
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:15,285
We held to those beliefs,

411
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:17,885
hoping eventually
we'd become special.

412
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:21,752
However, not one of us became
able to wield a Holy Sword.

413
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,552
The experiment failed.

414
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:25,985
[KIBA] We were disposed
of pretty quickly

415
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:28,885
after that in order to
cover up what had happened.

416
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,352
Even as we were vomiting blood

417
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:32,052
and writhing on the floor.

418
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:34,885
We looked to God to save us.

419
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:36,152
[BOY 3C] Run away!

420
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:38,785
[GIRL 3A] Hurry! Save yourself!

421
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:45,718
[MALE SOLDIER 3-1]
Which way did he go?

422
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,285
[MALE SOLDIER 3-2]
We have to catch him!

423
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:07,285
[YOUNG KIBA] Damn it.
I have to make things right.

424
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:13,618
I have to avenge
my comrades, my friends.

425
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:20,185
[YOUNG KIBA]
No. I can't die yet!

426
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:25,318
[YOUNG KIBA] I have to live.

427
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:38,085
[RIAS] If you're
going to die anyway,

428
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:40,618
I don't mind taking you in.

429
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:43,685
So from now on,
live for me.

430
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:45,685
[KIBA] I thank Rias from
the bottom of my heart

431
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:48,052
for taking me in as
part of her House.

432
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:53,185
[KIBA] But the truth is,
I was only able

433
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,918
to run away because
of my comrades.

434
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:59,585
They're the real
reason I'm still here.

435
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:02,785
That's why I have
to destroy Excalibur.

436
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:05,618
My sword contains
my friends' pain.

437
00:21:05,652 --> 00:21:07,985
As the only survivor,
I've no choice.

438
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:11,052
[sobs] Oh, Kiba!

439
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:13,118
I had no idea you had
such a horribly tragic past!

440
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:15,252
And I don't care about
Sona's punishment anymore!

441
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:16,818
Hyodo, put me in, coach;

442
00:21:16,852 --> 00:21:18,818
I'll help you with every
single thing I've got!

443
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:21,252
Yeah? Thanks, man.
That's cool.

444
00:21:24,252 --> 00:21:26,185
[KONEKO] I will
also help you.

445
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,918
Koneko?

446
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:28,918
Don't be so stupid;

447
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:31,918
I would be sad if you
weren't with us, Kiba.

448
00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:35,218
I guess I've lost then.

449
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,185
I mean, if you're even
going along with this plan,

450
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:39,785
then I'm just
never gonna be able

451
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:41,685
to do anything rash on my own.

452
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,052
For real?

453
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:46,052
Plus we all agree who
the real enemy is.

454
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:49,118
I will accept your help,
so thanks, guys.

455
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,963
[SONA] Really? Kiba did?

456
00:21:57,996 --> 00:22:01,096
[RIAS] Do you think--
Did I make a mistake?

457
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,196
[SONA] He is still
part of your House, right?

458
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,263
[RIAS] Of course.

459
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:05,263
No matter what he says,

460
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:08,096
there's no way I'd let
Kiba leave me like that.

461
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,763
He's just being dramatic.

462
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,730
[SONA] Why am I not surprised?

463
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:15,196
After all, the House
of Gremory is famous

464
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,863
for the strong bond between
its family members, is it not?

465
00:22:18,896 --> 00:22:20,030
[RIAS] Yes.

466
00:22:20,063 --> 00:22:22,096
[SONA] I believe it's true
his feelings may have gotten

467
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,896
the best of him, at least,
for the moment, it seems.

468
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,863
I have no doubt.

469
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:30,696
He will always be a
member of your house.

470
00:22:32,363 --> 00:22:35,030
Kiba <i>will</i> come
back to you, Rias.

471
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,963
I know it.

472
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,230
Thank you, Sona.
Thank you.

473
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,896
[AKENO] Excuse us
for the intrusion.

474
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,130
Thank you both for
all of your hard work today.

475
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:52,896
It's getting
pretty late, isn't it?

476
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,896
What's going on?

477
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,163
The situation is quite grave.

478
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:01,196
[ISSEI] What? Asia?

479
00:23:03,296 --> 00:23:04,796
[ASIA] So, what do you think?

480
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,630
Do you like this on me?

481
00:23:06,663 --> 00:23:07,763
Oh yeah, not bad!

482
00:23:07,796 --> 00:23:09,063
I mean um-- what are you doing;

483
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,630
why are you wearing
that costume?

484
00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:11,630
I thought that
you might be

485
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:13,696
a little depressed
since you lost the fight.

486
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,796
So I asked Aika for some
advice on what to do.

487
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,263
This is her idea; she thought
wearing it would cheer you up.

488
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,130
Wait, you mean Aika Kiryuu?

489
00:23:21,163 --> 00:23:22,763
Basically Issei's depressed,

490
00:23:22,796 --> 00:23:24,130
and you want to
make him feel better?

491
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:25,363
Yes.

492
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:28,230
Do you really think there's
anything that I can do, though?

493
00:23:28,263 --> 00:23:30,063
[KIRYUU]
Lemme think for a second.

494
00:23:30,096 --> 00:23:30,996
Wait!

495
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,996
I have the perfect
thing to cheer him up!

496
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,230
And I just so happen to
have bought it recently!

497
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,930
[ASIA] So, Aika let me
borrow this cute outfit

498
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:40,230
from her to wear
especially for you.

499
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:41,696
She said wearing
this kind of thing

500
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,296
has a restoring effect
on the average male.

501
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,230
[thinking] That girl's
as perverted as me.

502
00:23:46,263 --> 00:23:47,296
Well then?

503
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,330
Did it make you feel
a little better?

504
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:50,996
[ISSEI] Yes,
thank you, Asia.

505
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,896
[ISSEI] Listen,
I'm perfectly fine.

506
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,796
Besides, if I let
that fight bum me out,

507
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,096
I'd be saying Kiba
should feel bad, too.

508
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,063
[ASIA] I guess
that would be rude.

509
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:00,963
How is Kiba?

510
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:03,596
He's not too upset
about everything, is he?

511
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,263
Nah, he's a trooper;
he'll be all right.

512
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:08,530
Try to have more
faith in us, Asia.

513
00:24:09,863 --> 00:24:10,996
Okay!

514
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,796
Oh yeah, by the way.

515
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,063
You can go ahead
and change out

516
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:15,730
of that get up
now if you want to.

517
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:16,363
What?

518
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:17,363
I can if you'd like that,

519
00:24:17,396 --> 00:24:19,196
but I don't think you've
been fully restored yet.

520
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,596
No, I'm fine; already
restored enough!

521
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,763
In fact, I'm starting to get
restored in a different way.

522
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:27,796
What do you mean by
"a different way"?

523
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,696
Did I do anything wrong?

524
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,096
[ISSEI] No! Asia,
get out of my head!

525
00:24:36,863 --> 00:24:38,563
I think it's great
you're working so hard,

526
00:24:38,596 --> 00:24:39,330
but why so late?

527
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:39,996
Hey, I can't help it;

528
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,863
I got an emergency summons!

529
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:44,563
When Rias gets home,
tell her I said, "Hi!", okay?

530
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:45,663
Okay.

531
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:48,663
And congratulations on
getting a regular customer!

532
00:24:49,963 --> 00:24:52,230
Thank you.
I'll be back later.

533
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,996
[ISSEI] Um, hello?

534
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,730
Yeah, it's Issei.

535
00:24:56,763 --> 00:25:00,030
I'm sorry, but I won't be able
to make it to today's summoning.

536
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:01,896
[ISSEI'S CLIENT]
Well, all right.

537
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,863
No problem;
don't worry about it.

538
00:25:03,896 --> 00:25:07,796
I'll just call for you
again some other time. Later.

539
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,563
Only a devil would
cancel on me last minute.

540
00:25:11,596 --> 00:25:12,596
Hey.

541
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,196
Have you come

542
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,630
to keep sad, lonely
little ol' me company?

543
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:21,596
That's funny.

544
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,896
I didn't realize
you ever got lonely.

545
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,896
[ISSEI] Yo, Issei here!

546
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,630
Someone even more
amazing and terrifying

547
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,730
shows up when we
try to lure Freed out!

548
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:07,296
The battle goes down
big time at Kuoh Academy!

549
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,996
Next time:
"A Strong Enemy Appeared!"

550
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,530
Let's do it, Breastacles!
