1
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,600
Here, have a gift!

2
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,066
[ISSEI] Dragon Shot!

3
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,400
Thanks, Issei!

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,533
No prob. Everyone okay?

5
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,633
[RIAS] This is too dangerous.

6
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,533
Which is why I need you

7
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:36,800
to please take care
of Gasper for me.

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,533
[SIR ZECHS] All right.

9
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:39,333
Can we kill them, now?

10
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:40,400
We're supposed to
protect this area

11
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:43,600
until the gate closes,
so let's focus on that first!

12
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:44,766
[DDRAIG] Boost!

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,566
[SIR ZECHS] The only one

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,033
who can use strong
protection magic is Rias.

15
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:56,566
This whole thing's all my fault.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,766
[ISSEI] Rias!

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,400
[GASPER] I should
help them. I wanna help.

18
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,733
Rias! Issei!

19
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,100
Please listen.
I can fight, too.

20
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,266
I want to be a
man just like Issei is.

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,100
I want to make
you all proud of me,

22
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:13,766
and I want to be worthy of you.

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,300
I will fight. I just have to.

24
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,366
I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to protect my friends!

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,633
You can't, Gasper!

26
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,566
Please, Zechs,
you have to stop him!

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,300
Do something!

28
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,366
[GASPER] I can do this.

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,666
Watch me! I can be a man, too!

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,700
[RIAS] Gasper!

31
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:05,936
Oh?

32
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:08,269
What was that?

33
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:10,469
Any idea what
just happened?

34
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:11,569
I don't have a clue.

35
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:12,969
Welcome back, Sona!

36
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,636
Will you get off of me?

37
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,603
Gasper did it.

38
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:19,803
I'm not sure how, but he
made time go back to normal.

39
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:21,803
[GRAYFIA] He stopped
the enemy gate, too.

40
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:24,303
One less thing to
worry about, so hooray!

41
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:25,736
Oh, hell yeah!

42
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:27,736
You owned them, Gasper!

43
00:03:29,436 --> 00:03:30,869
I don't understand.

44
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:32,869
We'll tell you
the details later.

45
00:03:32,903 --> 00:03:36,569
For now. I need everyone's help.

46
00:03:36,603 --> 00:03:38,203
[AKENO] You got it, Rias!

47
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:44,336
Ring out, Thunder!

48
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:48,636
Tsubaki!

49
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:49,869
I'm on it, Sona.

50
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:55,903
[AZAZEL] Well then, why don't
we start getting serious here?

51
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,669
I'm so bored right now, are you?

52
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:58,736
What're you holding?

53
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,603
[AZAZEL] Something much
more interesting than war.

54
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:03,669
Call it my hobby.

55
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:05,969
This is the Downfall
Dragon Spear.

56
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:09,636
It's an artificial Sacred Gear
developed by yours truly.

57
00:04:10,936 --> 00:04:12,969
[AZAZEL] Balance Break.

58
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:17,503
What's he doing?

59
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:24,903
[AZAZEL] Armor of
the Fallen Dragon.

60
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:27,903
Downfall Dragon Another Armor.

61
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:29,303
[ISSEI] A dragon's armor.

62
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,569
He can do a
Balance Breaker, too?

63
00:04:33,336 --> 00:04:34,869
[AZAZEL] Now, come here.

64
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:36,569
I'll kill you!

65
00:04:37,303 --> 00:04:39,503
[CATTLEYA screams]

66
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,369
[AZAZEL]
Ha ha!

67
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:44,736
[CATTLEYA] I am not
necessarily needed

68
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:47,369
for the creation
of our new world!

69
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:49,836
[CATTLEYA] If I can take out
one of the Three Great Powers,

70
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:51,936
then I welcome death.

71
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:54,269
[CATTLEYA] I'll destroy
myself for glory!

72
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:56,369
[AZAZEL] Destroy yourself?
Ha!

73
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,369
I don't want to mock
your hopes and dreams,

74
00:04:58,403 --> 00:05:00,403
but it doesn't seem worth it.

75
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:03,369
[AZAZEL] You'll still die.

76
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,669
[high-pitched wail]

77
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,836
[AZAZEL] But I'm only willing
to give up an arm for you.

78
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:13,869
And yet again
there's still plenty

79
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:15,769
of room for improvement.

80
00:05:16,636 --> 00:05:17,569
But I guess you can stay

81
00:05:17,603 --> 00:05:19,469
with me a little while longer.

82
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:22,003
My Dragon King Fafnir.

83
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:23,636
That dude is hard.

84
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:25,369
He lost his arm!

85
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:26,736
We're not done.

86
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,536
There are still a
few stragglers left.

87
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:29,769
Right, yeah.

88
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:34,369
Ascalon!

89
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:35,703
[DDRAIG] Blade!

90
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:41,869
Nice, they've
annihilated everyone.

91
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:47,536
What the hell?

92
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:48,803
Y'got me.

93
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:51,803
Must be losing
my edge. Bad, Vali.

94
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:53,403
[VALI] Sorry, Azazel.

95
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,236
Things looked more
interesting on this side.

96
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:57,436
[ISSEI] Vali!

97
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:59,369
You're the one who betrayed us!

98
00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:00,336
I can understand,

99
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:03,269
but there is something
I'd like to ask you.

100
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:04,436
[VALI]
Hmm?

101
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:06,736
[AZAZEL] You know Shemhaza,
my Vice Governor-General.

102
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:08,469
Well, he's recently
informed me of a faction

103
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:10,469
that has been gathering
the dangerous elements

104
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,536
and members of the
Three Great Powers.

105
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,336
What were they called?

106
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:16,369
Oh, yes, the Chaos Brigade.

107
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:17,936
Chaos sounds accurate.

108
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,836
Whoever's in charge
must be strong.

109
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:20,869
But why would
anyone gather

110
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:22,936
such dangerous
people together?

111
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:25,503
So. I bet I can guess
who's leading you.

112
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:27,936
Has to be Orphis,
the Ouroboros Dragon, right?

113
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:29,936
Orphis! It can't be!

114
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,703
Is that another dragon?

115
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:33,503
The Infinite Dragon God,

116
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:36,669
a dragon so strong,
even God was afraid of him.

117
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:39,469
[VALI] Yes, it is true
I have sided with Orphis.

118
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:40,803
But believe me,
neither one of us

119
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:43,903
has the slightest interest
in world domination.

120
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,269
[VALI] We're just
a group who formed

121
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:47,769
in order to use our power.

122
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:48,836
And that's all.

123
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,569
Well, that makes more sense.

124
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:51,836
Conspiring with Cattleya seemed

125
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,236
a little beneath you,
but even so.

126
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:55,836
Both of you had
Devil Titles stolen,

127
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:56,869
so I wasn't sure.

128
00:06:56,903 --> 00:06:58,503
He's a Devil King
descendant, too?

129
00:06:58,536 --> 00:06:59,536
What are you saying?

130
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,769
[VALI] My name is Vali Lucifer.

131
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:02,603
[SIR ZECHS] What?

132
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:03,536
[ISSEI] Lucifer?

133
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:04,803
[RIAS] No!

134
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:07,769
[VALI] I am a direct descendant
of one of the dead Devil Kings.

135
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,803
My mother was a human,
so I'm a half-blood.

136
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:12,469
My father was
the grandson

137
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:15,303
of the former
Great Devil King Lucifer.

138
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,867
[RIAS] No. It can't be true.

139
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,300
[SIR ZECHS]
Of course. Half-human.

140
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,600
There's no way we
could have known.

141
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:38,867
[AZAZEL] While you have the
blood of a real Devil King,

142
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,300
since you are also a
human, you just happened

143
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,100
to be able to be possessed
by the Vanishing Dragon.

144
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,267
[AZAZEL] So basically,
your very existence is a joke.

145
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,833
I would go with
"miracle" personally,

146
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:53,633
but to each their own.

147
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,700
[ASIA] Look at his wings!

148
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:58,700
[MICHAEL] Dear God.

149
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,567
[AZAZEL] I have a
feeling this one will be

150
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,767
the best White Dragon Emperor
the world has ever known.

151
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,133
Past, present, and future.

152
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,867
The best dragon ever.

153
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,833
[VALI] Issei Hyodo, fate can
be cruel, wouldn't you agree?

154
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,333
Yeah. Maybe.

155
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,300
[VALI] I am the
strongest dragon,

156
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,933
and I carry with me the
blood of the Devil King.

157
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,367
But you are just a lowly human.

158
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,500
Before becoming a devil,

159
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:26,800
you weren't even an impressive
student in high school.

160
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,033
That is to say,

161
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:32,200
aside from the Boosted Gear,
you are nothing.

162
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,767
It's disappointing.

163
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,133
It's so disappointing
it's funny.

164
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,233
Even though we are
rival Sacred Gears--

165
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:43,233
You and I are as far
apart as the sky to the earth.

166
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:46,033
No, more than that.

167
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,633
You got a point there, Vali?

168
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:50,967
[VALI] I do; I think
you should try harder.

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,667
Maybe you should
try being an avenger.

170
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,233
I could kill your parents
if that would help.

171
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,000
[ISSEI] Eh?

172
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:00,033
[VALI] If I take something,

173
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:02,300
as precious to you as
your mother and father, away,

174
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,867
surely you would be able
to act on that tragic fate.

175
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,967
Your parents would most likely

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,367
be grateful to me
for their murder.

177
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,433
Any death I would
grant them would be

178
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:14,033
far more exciting than
their current boring life.

179
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,733
Yes, let's do that.

180
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:17,767
No. How can
he be so cruel?

181
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,700
Oh, Issei.

182
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,733
I'm so gonna
kill this asshole.

183
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,767
[RIAS] Issei!

184
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,033
Why should my
parents have to die

185
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,900
for his damn convenience?

186
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,333
Like I would just sit idly by

187
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,300
and let him take
anything from me!

188
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:36,100
[DDRAIG]
Welsh Dragon Over Booster!

189
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:38,067
[ISSEI] No one hurts
the people I care about.

190
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,833
I don't care who they are!

191
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:41,867
It's his Balance Breaker!

192
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,133
[VALI] Look, Albion.

193
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,967
The boy's power has
gone up exponentially.

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,733
[ALBION] The Sacred Gear
uses strong feelings

195
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:50,633
to sustain its power.

196
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:53,833
You're facing pure
rage from him right now.

197
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:55,133
Well done.

198
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:56,867
That is one of the
most appropriate ways

199
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,100
of drawing out the dragon.

200
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,100
[VALI] So what you're saying is,

201
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,967
I'm even better at
drawing out his dragon

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,633
than he is at being one.

203
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,600
[ISSEI] Yeah, keep
talking, douchebag!

204
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:08,633
Ascalon!

205
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:09,767
[DDRAIG] Blade!

206
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,133
[ALBION] The Dragon Slayer?

207
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:16,800
I won't be able to deflect
even one cut from this.

208
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,567
[VALI] All right, then
I won't let him cut me.

209
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:22,833
Issei!

210
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,667
Let me go; he needs me!

211
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
At this point,

212
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:26,967
both of their auras
have passed their limits.

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,933
If you get too close to either
of them, you'll burn and die.

214
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:33,167
But I-- I can't just
sit here and watch this!

215
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,333
[VALI] Weak. You're too weak!

216
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,067
[splutters]

217
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:39,900
[ALBION] Divide!

218
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:45,633
[ISSEI] Damn it.
How could I have forgotten?

219
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,000
He absorbs the power
of whatever comes

220
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:49,033
into contact with his sword.

221
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:50,133
I'm so stupid.

222
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,667
[RIAS] Are you all right?

223
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,900
[ISSEI] A-okay! You don't
have to worry about me!

224
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,633
[GASPER] Issei, don't lose!

225
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,100
You have to beat him!

226
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,833
[ISSEI] I will.

227
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,233
Especially since
Rias is watching!

228
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,933
[ISSEI] I won't
lose in front of her!

229
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,200
[DDRAIG] Boost!

230
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,833
[VALI] Adorable.

231
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:10,700
What did he do?

232
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,367
[DDRAIG] He sent
the extra energy he got

233
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,267
from you out through his wings.

234
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,767
By doing that,
he can maintain his power

235
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,933
at the upper limits
of his capacity.

236
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:20,933
[ISSEI] Okay, so no matter
how amazing he might be,

237
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:23,267
there's still a limit
to what he can handle?

238
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,800
[VALI] Exactly.

239
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:26,867
[VALI] During the
fight with Kokabiel,

240
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,900
you were fighting for the sake
of your friends, weren't you?

241
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:32,900
Does this mean
I should kill your friends,

242
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:34,600
before I kill your family?

243
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,700
[ISSEI] Asia!

244
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:38,367
[VALI] What about her?

245
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,267
[ISSEI] You bastard!

246
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,633
Stop fucking around,
you piece of shit!

247
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,733
[VALI] Hate me more!

248
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:43,867
Get angrier!

249
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,067
Get stronger and
stronger for me.

250
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,067
[VALI] Let's have some real fun.

251
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:50,167
Issei, no!

252
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,067
[ISSEI] Ddraig!
Transfer power to Ascalon!

253
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,900
[DDRAIG] Transfer!

254
00:11:58,633 --> 00:11:59,733
[ISSEI] Do it again!

255
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:00,833
[DDRAIG] Transfer!

256
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,000
[RIAS] He's transferring
power to Vali?

257
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:04,967
[ISSEI] I'm going to
boost the power you absorb

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,933
along with whatever you're
releasing at the same time!

259
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,167
Eventually, your
precious wings won't be

260
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,067
able to take any more!

261
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,300
[ALBION] The mechanisms
are going into overdrive.

262
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,867
We must restart the system.

263
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,300
[ISSEI] Feel the power
of The Dragon Slayer!

264
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,967
That was amazing.

265
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,967
You completely blew
away my Sacred Gear.

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,367
I knew you could hold
your own if you just tried.

267
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,000
That's what I expect
from my rival.

268
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,100
What's going on now?

269
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:38,167
[ISSEI] Son of a bitch!

270
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,133
[DDRAIG] It won't be over
until the other person

271
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,067
is unable to fight any longer.

272
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
This is how dragons battle.

273
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,633
[ISSEI] What's wrong?

274
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,900
[DDRAIG] The armband is reaching
the limit of its effectiveness.

275
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:51,600
This is happening

276
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:53,733
because I'm too damn weak again.

277
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,100
[DDRAIG] There's no way we
can win against a time limit.

278
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,700
Run away, or you'll die.

279
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,033
[ISSEI] I can't
abandon everyone!

280
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:03,033
[ISSEI] Ddraig, the Sacred Gear
evolves in response

281
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,900
to what I'm feeling, right?

282
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:07,267
[DDRAIG] Yes, but before
you do anything rash,

283
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,100
are you really ready to die?

284
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:10,900
[ISSEI] I can't die yet.

285
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:14,100
Come on, I still have
to get it on with Rias.

286
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:17,033
Trust me, for that, I can
take on the whole world!

287
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,167
[DDRAIG] I like your resolve.

288
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,167
Now, let me show you
my determination!

289
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,667
I am the mass of power

290
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,767
known as the Red Dragon Emperor.

291
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,900
We will survive this
together as true partners!

292
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:32,000
Issei Hyodo, are you ready?

293
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,833
[ISSEI] Yeah!

294
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,800
[VALI] What can you
do so late in the game?

295
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,300
Listen, you
Vanishing Dragon Dickhead!

296
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:42,000
This is where I take your power!

297
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,000
Issei, no!

298
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,100
Um. What happened?

299
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,300
Is he okay?

300
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,333
Damn it, this fucking hurts!

301
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:53,900
The light spear
was nothing compared

302
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,767
to what I'm going through, now!

303
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,933
[VALI] Are you trying
to take in my power?

304
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,067
Kiba managed it.

305
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,767
He fused them.

306
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,667
Holy and Devil powers together.

307
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,000
I can, too.

308
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:04,867
I'm gonna take your
vanishing power.

309
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,167
Combine it with my Sacred Gear
and then kick your ass!

310
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,667
[ALBION] Rather reckless.

311
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,800
We are conflicting existences.

312
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,033
To do that would be suicide.

313
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:15,767
[DDRAIG] So you know, Albion,

314
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,267
possessing this
particular master

315
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,200
has taught me
something important.

316
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,367
Even a fool can make
the impossible possible

317
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,167
as long as he never gives up.

318
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,633
[ISSEI] I'm that fool.
I'm proud of it.

319
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:27,967
If my abilities can't win,

320
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,233
then I'll stick with being
the idiot till the end!

321
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:33,100
Respond to what I'm
feeling and do your worst!

322
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,300
[DDRAIG] Vanishing Dragon,
Power is Taken!

323
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,633
[ISSEI] Bam, Dividing
Gear in your face!

324
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,633
[ALBION] Impossible.
This is impossible.

325
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:46,033
[DDRAIG] You've definitely
taken years off your life.

326
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,933
Most devils live almost forever,

327
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,367
but you will not be one of them.

328
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,367
[ISSEI] Didn't plan to
live that long, anyway.

329
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,133
I still got shit
I want to do, though!

330
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,667
Vali, I have taken
away your power!

331
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Surrender to me or--

332
00:14:56,733 --> 00:15:01,100
[VALI] This is fun.
My turn to play seriously.

333
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:04,200
[ALBION] Half Dimension!

334
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,367
[ISSEI] What's he doing?

335
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,167
Vali is warping
the dimensions.

336
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,633
It's a very dangerous action.

337
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:13,967
Wait, how is that fair?

338
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,367
[AZAZEL] It isn't fair at all.

339
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,167
Oh, what are we going to do

340
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,300
with our two fighting
dragon lovebirds?

341
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,133
He'll have to want
it more to win.

342
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:24,833
Let's try adding another element
that isn't fair of our own.

343
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:27,700
Hey, Red Dragon Emperor. Issei!

344
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:28,833
[ISSEI] What do you want?

345
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:31,900
Let me make sure this is
simple, so you'll understand.

346
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:34,733
That power he has divides
things around it in half.

347
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,167
[ISSEI] Divides it?

348
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,633
[AZAZEL] Meaning
Rias Gremory's bust line

349
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,833
will also become half
its original size.

350
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:41,633
Huh?

351
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:42,800
[ISSEI gasps]

352
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:46,833
[ISSEI thinking] Her boobs?
Half their size?

353
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:49,933
I don't want to live in a world
where Rias has a normal rack.

354
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,667
They're such wonderful
tits, and I love them.

355
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,767
I've never loved
anything more. Boobies!

356
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,333
[ISSEI] Don't fuck with me!

357
00:15:58,367 --> 00:15:59,700
[DDRAIG] Boost!

358
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:00,800
[ISSEI] Rias's boobs
are perfect,

359
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,733
and I won't let you reduce them!

360
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:03,367
[VALI] Wait, what?

361
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,900
[ISSEI] You monster!

362
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:05,867
[DDRAIG] Boost!

363
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,967
[ISSEI] You're pure evil!

364
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,933
[DDRAIG] Boost!

365
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,700
[ISSEI] I will never
forgive you for this!

366
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,600
[DDRAIG] Boost! Boost!

367
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:13,200
Boost! Boost! Boost! Boost!

368
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:14,700
[AZAZEL]
Hahahaha!

369
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,600
This fight is hilarious!

370
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,300
His power increases
this much just

371
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,367
to keep his master's
chest from getting smaller.

372
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,167
[DDRAIG] Boost!

373
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,367
[VALI] Today has
been full of surprises,

374
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,833
but at least it's not boring.

375
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:27,667
[ISSEI] Try laying a
finger on Rias Gremory!

376
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,767
I dare you!

377
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,967
I'll destroy
you so completely,

378
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
you'll never be able to be
reborn again, you hear me, Vali!

379
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,967
[VALI] Where did
that speed come from?

380
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,933
[ISSEI] So what.

381
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:41,933
If you had your way,
would it just be Rias,

382
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,033
or would you make
everyone's boobs smaller?

383
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,967
[ISSEI] This is for Rias
and her mammoth love melons!

384
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,667
[DDRAIG] Divide!

385
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:55,700
[ISSEI] And this is
for Akeno's huge honkers!

386
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:02,967
[ISSEI] This is to make sure
Asia gets to keep on growing!

387
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:06,333
[ISSEI] For Xenovia's
killer kazongas!

388
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,700
[ISSEI] And this is for Koneko's
poor itty bitty titties.

389
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:11,767
You can't divide them.

390
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,033
The only things left would
be very lonely nipples!

391
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:23,600
[VALI] Interesting!
This is fascinating!

392
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:25,367
How can he
still stand up?

393
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,300
[VALI] All right.

394
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,067
Think you can handle
something stronger?

395
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,600
It's the Juggernaut.

396
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,067
[ALBION] Forget it, Vali.

397
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,867
That is not the best
choice for this situation.

398
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,267
[VALI] I, one who awakens,
to the supremacy...

399
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,033
[ISSEI] C'mon!

400
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,300
[DDRAIG] Boost!

401
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,233
[ALBION] Vali!

402
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,733
Are you asking me
to adapt to this power?

403
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,633
[VALI]
...and join with me.

404
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,633
[VALI] Bikou, what
are you doing here?

405
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:50,633
[BIKOU] We're finally
going to fight

406
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,000
with the Northern earth gods,

407
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:54,100
so I was sent to find you
and bring you back.

408
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:56,033
[VALI] I see. It's about time.

409
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:57,167
[ISSEI] Who are you?

410
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,800
Where the hell
did you come from?

411
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,133
[AZAZEL] That's Bikou.

412
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:03,067
A descendant of the
Victorious Fighting Buddha.

413
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,867
[ISSEI] What?

414
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,933
Oh, come on,
surely you've heard

415
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:07,333
of the trickster monkey
from the Saiyuki legends.

416
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:08,800
You know, Son Goku?

417
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,600
Huh?

418
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,567
He's related to Goku?

419
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,333
I have to say, Bikou,
I never expected you

420
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:14,733
to become a member
of the Chaos Brigade.

421
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,667
Hell must have frozen over.

422
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,733
On the other hand,
the White Dragon

423
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:20,933
and Son Goku do
look good together.

424
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:21,900
Hahaha!

425
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:24,067
Well, charm and beauty
do run in my family,

426
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,300
so I look good with
just about anybody.

427
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,967
Until next time,
Red Dragon Emperor.

428
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,800
[VALI] When our
battle continues,

429
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,833
we should make this
fight more intense.

430
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:36,367
Make sure
you're ready, Issei.

431
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,633
Wait, are you
running away?

432
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,633
Even if it was
only for a short moment,

433
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,833
he released an
explosive amount of power.

434
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,700
He's out of steam.

435
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,933
Issei! Are you all right?

436
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:48,867
Yeah, I'm good.

437
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,800
But more importantly, I did it.

438
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,800
And your boobs get
to stay perfect.

439
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,067
Oh, Issei.

440
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,767
[RIAS] Finally a joint effort
between all of us.

441
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,200
It looks like
we really have

442
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:08,033
achieved peace
this time, doesn't it?

443
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:09,233
Apologies, Azazel;

444
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:11,300
Cattleya was one of
our internal issues.

445
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,800
Vali from our side
caused problems, as well.

446
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,100
And, it was my mistake

447
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:17,133
not to nip that in
the bud a long time ago.

448
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:19,167
Everything truly
is starting anew.

449
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,167
Excuse me, um, Chief Michael?

450
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:25,300
[ISSEI] I uh-- I just
wanted to ask a favor.

451
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,167
As long as it's within
my power, anything.

452
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,167
Do you think you could maybe

453
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,933
allow Asia and Xenovia
to start praying again?

454
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,867
I know it would mean
so much to them.

455
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,933
Well ladies,
is that the truth?

456
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,700
Yes.

457
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,200
[MICHAEL] Then let
me ask you this.

458
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:41,167
Would you still pray

459
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,133
even though you know
God isn't here anymore?

460
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:45,233
Yes.

461
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,267
Even if there is no God,
I'd love to be able to pray;

462
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,200
it brings me comfort.

463
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,133
Same for me.

464
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,833
I'd appreciate the
chance to give thanks

465
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:53,000
to God as well as
to you, Chief Michael.

466
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:54,833
I'll ask the same
on their behalf;

467
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:56,133
please let them pray.

468
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,233
Irina.

469
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:59,200
I didn't know
the entire story,

470
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:02,233
and I was so devastated when
I thought you had betrayed us.

471
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,633
I'm so sorry.

472
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:04,433
Well don't be;

473
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:06,267
there's nothing
to apologize for.

474
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,667
[IRINA] Asia,
what I said to you

475
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,833
was mean-spirited
and just plain cruel.

476
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:11,900
Oh, not at all.

477
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,633
I'm used to it anyway.

478
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,600
I hope you
can forgive me.

479
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:16,700
No, please.

480
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:19,300
I-- I wasn't really even
all that upset, believe me.

481
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,433
[LEVIATHAN] How cute;

482
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:22,733
a friendship between the
believers of the Devil and God!

483
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:23,900
Michael, can you do it?

484
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,000
Perhaps granting them their wish

485
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:26,900
will be a symbol of our peace?

486
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:28,067
Yes.

487
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,133
And besides, I seriously
doubt two devils

488
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,100
that don't receive damage

489
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:33,633
when they pray will
be the end of the world.

490
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,267
How merciful, Chief Michael!

491
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,033
Yes, thank you!

492
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,600
Thank you so much!

493
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:38,933
Dear God.

494
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,533
Give it time, ladies;

495
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,867
I have to return to headquarters
and change the system first.

496
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,367
I think I'll stay
here for a while.

497
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,000
I can't believe how much
I like this place.

498
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,233
Surprised?

499
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:52,267
I told you I'd do something
for you only I could do, right?

500
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,200
[ISSEI] Yeah, so what's
that supposed to mean?

501
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,267
[AZAZEL] I'm tired now.

502
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,067
I'm going home.

503
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:07,889
[GASPER] Koneko,
please tell me it's over.

504
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:08,989
[KONEKO] Don't worry.

505
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:11,255
I promise nothing scary
will happen to you anymore.

506
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:12,855
[GASPER] Finally, huh?

507
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:15,522
[RIAS] Hey, Gasper.

508
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:17,222
Oh. I'm sorry, Rias!

509
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:19,189
This is-- this
was all my fault

510
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:21,289
because the bad
guys wanted me.

511
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,155
No, this was my fault

512
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:24,289
because I failed to
protect you, Gaspie.

513
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:26,189
You're wrong;
that's not true!

514
00:21:26,222 --> 00:21:27,022
Yes, it is true.

515
00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:29,522
[RIAS] You did
a good job, Koneko.

516
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,689
You both did a good job.

517
00:21:32,722 --> 00:21:34,689
Gasper, I'm so proud of you.

518
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:35,789
You were very brave just

519
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:38,855
so you could help
the rest of us.

520
00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:40,822
And that makes me happy.

521
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:44,522
I haven't been this
happy in such a long time.

522
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:45,989
Yeah, me too.

523
00:21:46,022 --> 00:21:48,222
You made me really
happy, too, Gaspie.

524
00:21:48,255 --> 00:21:51,855
Oh, President Rias, and Koneko.

525
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:03,522
[LEVIATHAN]
Sona. Confession time!

526
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,822
I've taken a fancy to this
town and this high school.

527
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:07,522
Oh, is that right?

528
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:11,589
So, I'll come back soon!

529
00:22:15,655 --> 00:22:17,555
[SONA] No. Please don't do that.

530
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:18,989
Please don't? Why?

531
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:20,922
Um-- because
I uh-- said so.

532
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:22,589
Hey Tsubaki,
you won't mind

533
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:24,855
if I decide to come back
here again, will you?

534
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:27,689
Uh-- I-- course not.

535
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:28,855
[SONA] Tsubaki.

536
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,889
But that's me.

537
00:22:30,922 --> 00:22:33,855
The president should be the
final judge of that, after all.

538
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,655
[LEVIATHAN] No fair!

539
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,022
[ISSEI] Chief Michael.

540
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,989
Thank you very much
for granting my request.

541
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:42,289
Let me know how I can repay you.

542
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:43,722
But you already have.

543
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:45,889
You performed a
distinguished service.

544
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:47,522
Granting your request
doesn't even begin

545
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:49,255
to compensate for what you did.

546
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:51,789
[ISSEI] No sir,
that's not true at all.

547
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:53,589
[XENOVIA thinking] I see.

548
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,022
It's not because he has
the power of a Dragon.

549
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:57,689
It's because he's a good man,

550
00:22:57,722 --> 00:23:01,889
the kind that attracts
people like Rias and Asia.

551
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,622
And so, I must
return to Heaven

552
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:06,689
to report on the
peace agreement.

553
00:23:06,722 --> 00:23:09,889
Next, we will work on measures
against the Chaos Brigade.

554
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,155
Farewell.

555
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:16,055
[ASIA] Issei.

556
00:23:16,955 --> 00:23:18,222
[ISSEI]
Isn't everything great, Asia?

557
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:20,922
[ASIA] Oh, Issei. I love you!

558
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:24,889
What did you
just say? Hey, Asia!

559
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:26,955
Oh my goodness.

560
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,922
Asia, I like how bold
you're getting to be.

561
00:23:31,222 --> 00:23:32,389
[SIR ZECHS] Well.

562
00:23:32,422 --> 00:23:34,555
I guess it was an important
factor after all, wasn't it?

563
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:35,655
[GRAYFIA] What do you mean?

564
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:37,155
[SIR ZECHS] Issei Hyodo.

565
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:40,022
The true source of his power.

566
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:42,289
[ISSEI] Xenovia!

567
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:44,555
Now you can pray all you want!

568
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,855
Isn't that awesome?

569
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:48,689
Oh. Yeah. But um--

570
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:53,922
No. I-- I
mean thank you.

571
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:59,022
Now. Club
activities start tomorrow!

572
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:01,089
[CLUB] You got it, Rias!

573
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:08,255
[AZAZEL] And so, starting
from this day forward,

574
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:11,789
I have become the advisor
for the Occult Research Club.

575
00:24:11,822 --> 00:24:13,689
Wait... you can't be serious.

576
00:24:13,722 --> 00:24:16,222
Oh, but I am; I asked
Sir Zechs and everything.

577
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,055
He told me I should talk

578
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,155
to Serafall's little
sister about it.

579
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:20,522
[ISSEI] You did this, Sona?

580
00:24:20,555 --> 00:24:21,722
Look, I didn't
have much of a choice;

581
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:24,289
if I didn't agree with it
my sister threatened the worst.

582
00:24:24,322 --> 00:24:26,022
She said she'd come instead.

583
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:29,889
So basically, what you
mean is you sold us out.

584
00:24:29,922 --> 00:24:31,589
Anyway. I'll leave you to it.

585
00:24:31,622 --> 00:24:33,155
[RIAS] Hey, Sona!

586
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:35,922
[ISSEI] Dude.
How'd you get that arm?

587
00:24:35,955 --> 00:24:38,589
Oh, my new friend here
is the omnipotent arm

588
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:40,755
I made during all
my Sacred Gear research.

589
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:42,789
I've always wanted to
equip something like this,

590
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:44,922
and I'm so glad I did.

591
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:48,655
Now, understand, Sir Zechs
had one condition for me.

592
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:51,555
I cannot stay here unless
I provide a gift to you.

593
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:53,755
[GASPER] Yeah?
What kind of gift?

594
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:54,989
As long as I'm around,

595
00:24:55,022 --> 00:24:58,022
I will help you properly develop
your immature Sacred Gears.

596
00:24:58,055 --> 00:24:59,222
[chuckles]

597
00:24:59,255 --> 00:25:00,622
The mysterious Boosted Gear

598
00:25:00,655 --> 00:25:02,722
with unpredictable evolution.

599
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:04,255
The Holy Devil Sword.

600
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:06,055
And Forbidden Balor View.

601
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,555
[AZAZEL] I can use the research
I've done to evolve them

602
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:11,189
on an individual level,
understand?

603
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:14,655
So, then, from now on you can
call me Mister Azazel, okay?

604
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:17,255
Uh, "Mister Azazel"? Dude.

605
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:19,722
Nothing personal, but that
feels weird in my mouth.

606
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:21,955
I'm looking forward
to working with you all.

607
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:23,589
Hold it; I never
agreed to this;

608
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:24,255
how can we even trust you?

609
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,389
[AZAZEL] Oh, yeah.

610
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:28,089
Sir Zechs gave me another
message for you, as well.

611
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:29,189
Another message?

612
00:25:29,222 --> 00:25:32,755
It seems when he stayed
at Issei's house previously,

613
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:34,889
he learned the importance
of a good skinship

614
00:25:34,922 --> 00:25:36,555
between household members.

615
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:37,955
Notably for you.

616
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:39,655
Apparently that's what
the Red Dragon Emperor

617
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:41,289
needs to charge his power.

618
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:42,155
Okay.

619
00:25:42,189 --> 00:25:43,789
I don't get what
you're saying at all.

620
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:44,789
[AZAZEL] All right, then.

621
00:25:44,822 --> 00:25:45,789
This is an official order

622
00:25:45,822 --> 00:25:47,889
in the name of the
great Devil King Lucifer.

623
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:48,955
All of the
current female members

624
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:51,822
of the Occult Research Club
are hereby directed

625
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:53,989
to move in with
Issei immediately.

626
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:54,922
There ya go.

627
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:55,989
Move in?

628
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,189
[AKENO] Issei.

629
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,255
I'm here, and I swear
no matter what,

630
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:01,189
I'll never leave your side!

631
00:26:01,222 --> 00:26:03,155
[ISSEI] Hey, cool, thanks!

632
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:06,589
[XENOVIA] Should I just stay
in the same room as Asia then?

633
00:26:06,622 --> 00:26:09,622
Issei. I need to say something.

634
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:10,189
Yeah?

635
00:26:10,222 --> 00:26:10,889
If you peek in my room,

636
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:12,989
and steal or sniff my panties.

637
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:14,822
I will make you suffer.

638
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:16,989
This isn't fair.

639
00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:17,889
Yeah.

640
00:26:17,922 --> 00:26:19,255
I know, but my big
brother ordered it,

641
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:21,955
so what can we do?

642
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:24,622
I've got it!

643
00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:26,222
I'm going to demand
that my brother

644
00:26:26,255 --> 00:26:28,189
to remodel this
house completely!

645
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:30,089
[ISSEI] You what?

646
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:37,122
The White One is after power.

647
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:40,022
And the Red is after women.

648
00:26:40,055 --> 00:26:42,022
Well, at least their
motives are pure,

649
00:26:42,055 --> 00:26:43,089
in their own way.

650
00:26:47,922 --> 00:26:48,522
[ISSEI] Hey!

651
00:26:48,555 --> 00:26:50,055
[AZAZEL] Even without God.

652
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:52,189
The world keeps
right on turning.
