1
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,633
[ISSEI] Eh! Titties!

2
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:19,366
I'm awake.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,433
Why am I still
seeing lady balls?

4
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:24,533
The President?

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,300
I'm not exactly sure
what's going on, here.

6
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,433
But I might as well
make the most of it.

7
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,533
Issei. Good morning.

8
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:36,333
Yeah totally
good morning.

9
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:38,333
Why are you in
bed with me, again?

10
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:39,333
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:41,400
You had gone to sleep
by the time I arrived,

12
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,300
so I decided
to let myself in.

13
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,033
Cool, but that's not the
main issue I've got-boobs.

14
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:48,200
Oh, I couldn't
help myself;

15
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,566
I felt like sleeping
with you as a hug pillow.

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,533
So, this is what
you wanted?

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,633
Issei, we've still
got some time.

18
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,533
Do you think something
sexy would help

19
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:00,133
deepen communication
with my servant?

20
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:05,066
I am a dude, so, yes,
I think that; absolutely.

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,000
[RIAS] Then you
want to come at me?

22
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,166
[RIAS] Don't worry.

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,366
I'm willing to do anything

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,266
for you as long as
it makes you happy.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,533
[ISSEI]
Anything to make me happy?

26
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:18,533
So much cool shit fits
into one little anything.

27
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:19,400
Let's do this!

28
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:20,366
[knock knock]

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,100
Oh!

30
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,233
[ASIA] Are you
up yet, Issei?

31
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:24,700
It's almost time for you to
start your morning training!

32
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:25,666
[ISSEI] Asia!

33
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,533
Oh, well shoot;

34
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,300
I completely forgot
about the training.

35
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,066
[ASIA] Issei, can you
hear me? Are you awake?

36
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,800
[ISSEI] Ah, yeah!
I'm up. Just gimmie a sec.

37
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,300
Asia, do you mind
waiting another moment.

38
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,300
Issei and I need to get ready;
we're both still in bed.

39
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,466
Asia, hey, morning!
Sleep okay?

40
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,133
hope you're
doing well today.

41
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,366
[ISSEI] It's not
what it looks like!

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,433
Whatever; I'm taking
off my clothes, too!

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,000
I swear I'm not gonna
be left out anymore!

44
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:51,800
It's Five AM!

45
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:55,166
So up and at 'em,
if you know what I mean, sexy!

46
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:29,407
So good.

47
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,841
I know you're
technically foreign,

48
00:03:30,874 --> 00:03:32,641
but this tastes
like the real deal!

49
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,507
Well, I've been living
here for a while now.

50
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:36,741
Either way.

51
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:39,107
I've never had
anything this good. Yum!

52
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:42,874
Thank you.
That was sweet.

53
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:46,241
I have to admit,
Rias, I was surprised

54
00:03:46,274 --> 00:03:48,074
when I found out you
wanted to board here

55
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:49,274
like Asia is doing.

56
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:53,007
But, I can't help but love
that you help out with cooking!

57
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,241
Helping you
is only natural, Mother.

58
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:57,141
Let's not forget
about how much Asia

59
00:03:57,174 --> 00:03:59,907
has been doing with the
cooking and laundry, too.

60
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:01,774
You are both so appreciated!

61
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,707
Like Rias said, you're
taking care of us,

62
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:05,841
so it's only natural.

63
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:09,974
[RIAS] Oh, Mother,
would it be an imposition

64
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:15,074
for the club members to
come over after school today?

65
00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:16,607
[MOTHER] Sure, that's fine.

66
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:18,107
What are you
talking about? Here?

67
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:19,607
The old school
building is having

68
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:21,141
its annual
spring cleaning,

69
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:22,907
so the Occult Research
Club won't be able

70
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:24,707
to meet there
this afternoon.

71
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:27,641
Having the club meetings
at home seems kind of fun!

72
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:28,941
I can help host it!

73
00:04:28,974 --> 00:04:30,807
You want me make
sure the tea is ready?

74
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:33,807
Oh, yes. That would
be wonderful, Asia.

75
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:41,674
After that BS
went down with Riser,

76
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:43,174
Rias started being
way nicer to me

77
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,141
than she's ever been before.

78
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:48,141
But every time that happens,
Asia gets weird about it.

79
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:49,874
Still though, I can't
help but wonder

80
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:51,807
what that sexy communication
thing might mean.

81
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:54,474
[MATSUDA] Hey, Issei, what you
smiling like a bitch for, son?

82
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:56,007
Dude, what is
your problem?

83
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,574
There are some rather odd
rumors about you lately,

84
00:04:58,607 --> 00:04:59,941
so you might wanna
be more careful.

85
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:01,207
What rumors?

86
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:02,407
One, for example,
you're messing around with

87
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:05,974
super hot ladies and following
the path of certain evil.

88
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:07,774
[ISSEI] What?

89
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:11,741
[MATSUDA] Yeah, yeah. For real.

90
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:14,074
And like, uh, you're using Rias
and that fly ass Akeno's secrets

91
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:17,741
as blackmail for some
real nasty erotic shit, man.

92
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:18,774
[ISSEI] What?

93
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:20,807
[MOTOHAMA] On top of that,
you're nothing more

94
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:21,674
than a villain.

95
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:23,474
One who has even
turned his perverted eye

96
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:25,507
to the school mascot,
Koneko Toujou!

97
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,707
It's being said you devoured

98
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,741
her prepubescent body
like a wild beast!

99
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:32,574
[KATASE] Asia, your hair
is like the prettiest, ever.

100
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:33,807
[ASIA]
Oh, I don't think so at all.

101
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:36,507
[MURAYAMA] Shut up. I would
kill for blond hair like that.

102
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,607
[KIRYUU] Right?

103
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,707
And, all the boys are
enchanted by your hair, too.

104
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,074
They're enchanted?

105
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:44,941
[MATSUDA] Besides that,
your bent sexual freakiness

106
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:47,874
be all up in Asia's business,
and that honey just got here!

107
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:48,941
[ISSEI] What are
you talking about?

108
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,174
Confession; we're the ones
spreading those rumors!

109
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:52,007
Huh?

110
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:52,841
Snap!

111
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:53,774
If you don't let
us do--you know--

112
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:56,141
we won't be able to
handle this enviousness!

113
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:58,141
Yeah, and it may
already be too late, see?

114
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:00,107
I'm so confused.

115
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:01,741
[MATSUDA] Chill, brother!

116
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:03,941
We're not just spreadin'
rumors about girls.

117
00:06:03,974 --> 00:06:05,974
We're also tellin'
people you and Kiba

118
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:07,874
are gay for each other and shit.

119
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:08,974
[MOTOHAMA]
Did you know some girls

120
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,574
are in to that kind of thing?

121
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,074
Don't fuck with me!

122
00:06:12,107 --> 00:06:13,241
[KIRYUU] So, the
Three Stooges have given in

123
00:06:13,274 --> 00:06:16,507
to their primal urges and
are talking about sex, now?

124
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,007
[MOTOHAMA] Aika?

125
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:17,974
[MATSUDA] Kiryuu?

126
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:20,574
Asia, there are
so many nice boys around.

127
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:21,941
You don't have
to waste your time

128
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:23,574
with that jerk
as a boyfriend.

129
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:24,874
Whaddaya mean
"boyfriend"?

130
00:06:24,907 --> 00:06:26,507
Whaddaya mean
"that jerk"?

131
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,741
Anyway, I'm just helping
her out for a little while

132
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:31,007
since she's brand new
to this country, okay?

133
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,007
I'm not her
boyfriend at all.

134
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,007
Then why are you
always all over each other?

135
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,641
I mean, the whole school agrees.

136
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:37,807
There's no way you two

137
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:40,007
aren't having relations
like every night.

138
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,474
Relations?

139
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:42,174
What's that?

140
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:43,207
[ISSEI] Knock
it off, Kiryuu!

141
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:44,807
We're just
friends! See?

142
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,141
Now, get
that straight!

143
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,874
Uh, so, yeah--I gotta
go do something.

144
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:51,707
You do? What is it?

145
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:52,741
Go see Akeno.

146
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:54,041
Is it your arm again?

147
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:55,741
Yeah.

148
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:57,107
[MATSUDA]
What's his problem, yo?

149
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:59,007
Oh. It's for
the club we're in!

150
00:06:59,041 --> 00:06:59,841
So you're telling
me you guys

151
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:02,074
seriously aren't
together like at all?

152
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:02,874
Do what?

153
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:05,074
Come on, Asia, admit
the truth, you--

154
00:07:05,107 --> 00:07:06,007
Aika, please stop it!

155
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,474
I don't want you to
say that stuff anymore!

156
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:10,541
Why is it always him?

157
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,903
[door shutting]

158
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:19,469
Sorry about the wait.

159
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:24,503
No, I'm sorry I didn't
give you much time.

160
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:27,403
[AKENO] That's hardly
your fault, Issei.

161
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:31,136
Now. Let's get
this started.

162
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,403
Sure, whatever you say.

163
00:07:34,803 --> 00:07:36,169
Oh no, what's wrong?

164
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:38,969
[ISSEI] Nothing.
It's just you're all wet.

165
00:07:39,003 --> 00:07:40,836
[AKENO] I only had time
to grab a quick shower

166
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,169
before the ceremony.

167
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:45,103
I didn't have time
to dry my body properly.

168
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:47,103
Is it distracting?

169
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:48,503
[ISSEI] No, it's totally fine.

170
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:50,703
If anything, this is
my kind of distraction.

171
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,703
Wait, forget I said anything.

172
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:56,469
[AKENO] The issue is with
your dragon arm's spirit.

173
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:59,569
It is far stronger
than any of us expected.

174
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:04,903
Changing its shape with magic
was only effective temporarily.

175
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:06,703
Sucking it
from your fingers

176
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,669
is the only way to
clear everything out.

177
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:12,436
[moans]
Ohh...

178
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:19,003
[pleasurable moaning
and sucking noises]

179
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:23,869
[ISSEI thinking] Dude.

180
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,736
If those other clubs knew
what they were missing out on,

181
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:27,769
those d-bags would
totally flip out.

182
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:29,736
Best extra-curricular ever.

183
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:32,636
Occult Research Club
for the win!

184
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,569
Holy crap!

185
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:34,736
This is like the
sense of touch equivalent

186
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:36,703
to eating a campfire s'more.

187
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,803
Ddraig, my man.
I'm telling you.

188
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:43,736
Getting killed was the luckiest
thing that ever happened to me!

189
00:08:45,903 --> 00:08:48,403
[climatic moan]

190
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:51,703
Honestly.

191
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:53,936
It's just a simple procedure;
you're getting flustered

192
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:57,203
so easily it just makes me
want to taunt you even more.

193
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,903
[ISSEI] Seriously?

194
00:08:58,936 --> 00:08:59,903
[AKENO] Of course.

195
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:01,803
Trust me, if you could
see your face right now,

196
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:03,003
you would totally get it.

197
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:05,703
I'd be remiss if
I didn't torment you more.

198
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:07,069
Hey, do your thing.

199
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:09,236
Guess what?

200
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:13,003
I have a crush on this cute guy,
but he's totally clueless.

201
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:15,103
Wait--
It's Matsuda, isn't it?

202
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:18,669
[ISSEI thinking] Okay, that's
her casabas rubbing all over me.

203
00:09:18,703 --> 00:09:20,503
Jackpot city!

204
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:25,869
Oh man.
Are you bare down there?

205
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:28,669
[AKENO] Au naturel is
all part of the ceremony.

206
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:29,503
[ISSEI] That a fact?

207
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:32,103
Then I won't
argue with tradition.

208
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:35,736
[AKENO] But if I make a move
on you, Rias will get jealous.

209
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:38,569
And we both know what
she's like when she's upset.

210
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:44,903
For now we had better
stand on ceremony.

211
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:49,036
[ISSEI thinking] If this is what
Akeno considers

212
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:52,036
'standing on ceremony'
and 'not making a move',

213
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:55,469
now I wanna know what she would
do if she really let loose!

214
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:01,069
[ISSEI moans loudly]

215
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,469
[AKENO] The dragon's
spirit is gone.

216
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:09,136
You should be fine,
at least for a while.

217
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:11,769
Oh good;
thanks a lot, Akeno.

218
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:14,103
[AKENO] Remember your
battle with Phoenix?

219
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:15,436
Yeah, of course I do.

220
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:17,569
[AKENO] You got up
time and time again

221
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:19,603
after being beaten down.

222
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:23,536
You were the definition
of manliness, Issei.

223
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:26,203
And then, crashing
the engagement party

224
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:28,136
like you did to save Rias.

225
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:28,936
Impressive.

226
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:30,969
You even managed
to defeat Phoenix,

227
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:32,903
who was rumored to be immortal.

228
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:34,669
After I got
to see a gentleman

229
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:38,869
in such a brilliant fight,
well, I don't know; I feel so--

230
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:40,636
[moans]

231
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:43,703
I wonder,
could this be love?

232
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:48,903
[bells ringing]

233
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:51,436
We should do this
again sometime.

234
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,636
[RIAS] Well then, let's
begin our regular meeting.

235
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:01,003
This month's
contract numbers are in.

236
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,169
Akeno, eleven.

237
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:02,703
[AKENO] That's right.

238
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:03,836
[RIAS] Koneko, ten.

239
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:04,403
[KONEKO] Sounds good.

240
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:05,469
[RIAS] Kiba had eight.

241
00:11:05,503 --> 00:11:06,036
[KIBA] I did.

242
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:07,103
[RIAS] Three for Asia.

243
00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:08,036
[ASIA] Yay!

244
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:09,803
No way; that's really
impressive, Asia!

245
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,603
Good for you, lady!

246
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:13,069
You should be proud of yourself.

247
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:14,169
Especially
considering

248
00:11:14,203 --> 00:11:15,769
you're brand new
at contracts.

249
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:17,936
Oh my goodness!
Thank you so much!

250
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:18,869
And Issei.

251
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:20,103
[ISSEI]
Huh?

252
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,736
Zero.

253
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,903
Ugh. I'm an
embarrassment.

254
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:27,969
[RIAS] You know, if you don't
work hard and get contracts,

255
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:30,169
you'll never become
a high-ranking devil.

256
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:31,403
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

257
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:34,069
Next month, I'm gonna do what
it takes to get first place!

258
00:11:34,536 --> 00:11:35,769
[MOTHER] Sorry to intrude, kids.

259
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:37,503
[ASIA] Oh, welcome to
the meeting, Mother!

260
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:38,603
Thank you.

261
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:39,469
Now, this little gathering is

262
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:41,836
for the insult
research club, right?

263
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,036
She's always so close
yet so very wrong.

264
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:45,136
[MOTHER]
Well, I brought something

265
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:47,003
that might inspire everybody!

266
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:48,769
[ISSEI] Mom!

267
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:49,936
[MOTHER] So who
wants to see Issei

268
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:51,603
when he was just a little boy?

269
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:53,769
[AKENO] Wow;
he's completely naked.

270
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:56,103
Aw, so small and so adorable!

271
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:59,703
[KONEKO] The bare-nekkid
truth about Issei's tiny past.

272
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:01,836
[MOTHER] This picture
is from kindergarten.

273
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:02,836
And all he's done since then

274
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,436
is chase around after
girls and their bottoms.

275
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:06,469
[ISSEI thinking]
Someone kill me.

276
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:10,436
Oh no, it's a tiny,
itty, witty, bitty Issei!

277
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:12,103
I totally
agree with Rias!

278
00:12:12,136 --> 00:12:13,903
Tiny, itty, bitty and cute!

279
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:16,536
I mean, right;
he's just ridiculous.

280
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,703
It's too much!

281
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,203
Awesome. Why'd
you have to go

282
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:21,169
and freakin' break
my balls like this, Mom?

283
00:12:21,203 --> 00:12:22,869
She seems like a
great mother to me.

284
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:24,403
Like you'd know!

285
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:26,703
Yeah, it must be nice
to have a family.

286
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:30,803
Wait, are you saying you
don't, like, have a family?

287
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:33,203
Hey, Issei, this picture.

288
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,869
Huh?

289
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:36,969
Oh, that kid lived down
the street from me.

290
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,603
We used to play
together all the time.

291
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:42,136
They had to move once one of
his parents got a job overseas.

292
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:43,636
Hmmm...

293
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:45,536
Man, I can't remember
that kid's name.

294
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:47,103
It's been a while, though!

295
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:50,603
[KIBA] One more thing.
Do you remember this sword?

296
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,903
[ISSEI] Naw, I mean, you know.

297
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:53,803
I was five.

298
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:56,436
I guess anything's
possible, huh?

299
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,003
[bicycle tires rolling]

300
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:02,969
I have got to get
a contract today.

301
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:04,003
Forget about Kiba;

302
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:06,669
even Asia is getting
ahead of me at this point.

303
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,536
Speaking of, what was
Kiba's deal earlier?

304
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:12,703
It's funny, I never
expected to see it

305
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:14,703
in a picture with
you. Imagine that.

306
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:16,003
What do you
mean by that?

307
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:17,936
This is a Holy Sword.

308
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:18,669
A what?

309
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:21,836
Never mind.
It's not a big deal.

310
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,569
Great pictures!
Thanks, man.

311
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:25,936
[thinknig] What was that about?

312
00:13:29,836 --> 00:13:31,936
Here we are.

313
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:35,036
[ISSEI] They'll probably
give me the

314
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:37,869
"What kind of devil rings
the doorbell?" crap again.

315
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:40,836
What's up?

316
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:42,936
You're the dude who summoned
the devil, aren't you?

317
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,869
Now, I know this
seems weird, but it's not!

318
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:46,203
I get how
I should appear.

319
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:48,469
You know, like bam out of
one of these magic cards

320
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:50,869
which is a hell of a lot cooler
than ringing the doorbell,

321
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:52,469
but I'm in transition.

322
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:54,136
[ISSEI'S CLIENT] Well,
you might as well come in.

323
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,169
What's the problem?

324
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,736
You're still a devil, right?

325
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:14,124
This place is amazing.

326
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:15,090
It's weird, though.

327
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:16,557
He doesn't look like
he's from around here,

328
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:21,924
so I wonder what he does.

329
00:14:21,957 --> 00:14:23,424
Something to
drink, perhaps?

330
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:26,224
Oh, no thanks; I'd love to,
but I'm still a minor.

331
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:28,324
[ISSEI'S CLIENT] Really? Bummer.

332
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:31,157
I was hoping to have
a partner to drink with.

333
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,357
[ISSEI] So you wanted
a devil to have drinks?

334
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,357
What-- is that bad?

335
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,190
No, it's fine.

336
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:38,457
The contract will be formed
when I fulfill your request

337
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,057
and receive a fitting
compensation in return.

338
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,390
Unfortunately,
all I have is sake.

339
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,990
You okay with tap water?

340
00:14:45,024 --> 00:14:46,057
[ISSEI] Yeah, sure.

341
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,890
[ISSEI'S CLIENT]
Hahaha!

342
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,090
So your magic is so
weak you have to ride a bike

343
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:55,924
to go see the people
who've summoned you?

344
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:57,324
Well, kinda.

345
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,957
[ISSEI'S CLIENT]
That's hilarious.

346
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:03,357
[thinking] Being laughed at like
this will never not piss me off,

347
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,124
but I don't have much of a
choice if I want that contract.

348
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,424
[ISSEI'S CLIENT] That was fun.

349
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:11,357
So what would you
like as compensation?

350
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,857
[ISSEI] What? Already?

351
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,324
[ISSEI'S CLIENT]
You're a devil right?

352
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:15,057
I guess you want my soul.

353
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,490
No, I don't
want your soul.

354
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:17,890
All I did was have
a drink with you,

355
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:19,490
so that wouldn't fit
the contract at all.

356
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:21,557
[ISSEI'S CLIENT] Oh.
That's unexpected.

357
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,724
Yeah, I know,

358
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:25,157
but regardless my master's
motto is still "honest billing."

359
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,190
Will this suit
your fancy?

360
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:29,990
It's not a
reproduction.

361
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:31,924
[ISSEI] Doesn't that
seem kind of expensive?

362
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:33,224
[ISSEI'S CLIENT] I don't
have anything else

363
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:34,324
to pay you with
at the moment.

364
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:36,957
[ISSEI'S CLIENT] If it
won't work, I have my soul.

365
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,124
[ISSEI] It's cool;
the picture's fine.

366
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:43,490
[ISSEI] That dude
was crazy as hell,

367
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:45,357
but at least I got
one contract down,

368
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,357
so that's another step
closer to my final goal!

369
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,224
I'm gonna be
Harem King of the world!

370
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,324
Oh, it's Rias.

371
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:01,957
This looks like the place.

372
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,257
[RIAS] Issei, over here.

373
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:06,290
[RIAS] I'm sorry I had
to make you come out.

374
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:08,557
Nah, it's fine.

375
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:11,624
[ISSEI] There's something
going on inside there, huh?

376
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:14,457
[KONEKO] No one can miss
the smell of a rogue devil.

377
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,624
[AKENO] No kidding.

378
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:17,257
We've been given
orders to take it down

379
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,224
before the night is over.

380
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:23,257
Whatever it is must
be extremely dangerous.

381
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,424
We shouldn't try
to fight it inside.

382
00:16:25,457 --> 00:16:27,124
Asia, you wait at the rear.

383
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:28,157
Yes, ma'am.

384
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,557
Akeno and I will be
ready and waiting outside.

385
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,224
So Koneko, Kiba, and Issei,

386
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,590
draw the enemy out
where we can take care of it.

387
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:35,990
Makes sense to me.

388
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:36,890
Right.

389
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:40,290
I'm on it. Boosted...

390
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:41,857
...Gear!

391
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,890
Kiba?

392
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:47,524
Yeah, right.
Got it.

393
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,457
Well, then
let's roll out!

394
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,257
Come on, guys!

395
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:53,057
[KIBA] Right.

396
00:16:58,224 --> 00:16:59,124
I wonder what it'll be.

397
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:02,090
Probably another
crazy ass monster, right?

398
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,957
Nice. Why can't you warn
me when you do that?

399
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,624
Let's go.

400
00:17:07,657 --> 00:17:09,290
Oh, right.

401
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,424
[ISSEI] I can't see
shit in this place.

402
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,224
Koneko?

403
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,290
[KONEKO] It's here.

404
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:27,157
[ISSEI] See, I told you so!

405
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,824
[DDRAIG] Boost!

406
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:30,890
[KONEKO] Kiba, focus.
What are you doing?

407
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,524
Hey! Kiba!

408
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:34,057
Sorry.

409
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:40,157
Bastard!

410
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,457
[DDRAIG] Boost!

411
00:17:42,424 --> 00:17:43,890
[DDRAIG] Explosion!

412
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:45,357
[ISSEI] Dragon Shot!

413
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,024
Damn it!

414
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:48,924
I guess I haven't powered
myself up enough yet.

415
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:51,390
What are you
zoning out for, princess?!

416
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:01,424
Kiba!

417
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:05,257
It's time to go.

418
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:09,590
Akeno.

419
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:11,390
I'm all over it, Rias!

420
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:16,590
[RIAS] Wanton devil,
you who ran wild away

421
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:19,857
from your master to
fulfill your own desires.

422
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,790
For such a crime,

423
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:23,090
you deserve to die
a thousand times over.

424
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:25,424
And now, in the name
of the Marquis of Gremory.

425
00:18:25,457 --> 00:18:28,857
You shall pay
with your life.

426
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,190
Time to die!

427
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:33,024
Hell yeah!

428
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:33,857
That poor
creature's heart

429
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,924
is completely
lost at this point.

430
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:38,057
You could barely even
call her a devil anymore.

431
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,990
I don't want to
end up like that.

432
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:41,024
Now you know
what deserves

433
00:18:41,057 --> 00:18:42,624
an emergency
subduing order.

434
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:44,424
[ASIA] Koneko,
do you need help?

435
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,824
Yes, please.

436
00:18:47,524 --> 00:18:49,024
[slap]

437
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:51,324
[RIAS] Think you've
got it together now?

438
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:52,890
With a mistake like that,

439
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,390
you put everyone
here in serious danger!

440
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:56,857
[KIBA] I apologize.

441
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,490
What's the matter, Kiba?

442
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:00,024
This isn't like you.

443
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,990
I'm fine; just
having an off day.

444
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:05,390
Now, if you will
excuse me, President.

445
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:07,524
Kiba?

446
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:11,290
[ISSEI] Kiba! What the hell?

447
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:12,624
You're acting nutso.

448
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:15,124
Why would you be so
rude to the President?

449
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:17,024
It's got nothing
to do with you.

450
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:18,924
That doesn't mean
I can't be worried.

451
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,357
Worried? Why would
youever be worried?

452
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:25,890
[KIBA] Devils are, by
nature, selfish beings.

453
00:19:25,924 --> 00:19:28,124
[ISSEI] I've got not idea
what you're point is here.

454
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:31,324
[KIBA] Well, for the record,
I do think I was wrong.

455
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:31,924
Later.

456
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:33,024
Hold on!

457
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:35,590
If you're that upset, then
you can talk to me about it.

458
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:37,357
I mean, we are
friends, aren't we?

459
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,257
Friends, huh? Right.

460
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,857
Issei, I appreciate
your passion.

461
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,224
However,
something's recently

462
00:19:45,257 --> 00:19:46,924
been brought
to my attention.

463
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:48,524
[ISSEI]
Something like what?

464
00:19:48,557 --> 00:19:50,290
A purpose.

465
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:53,290
See, I remembered
my reason for living;

466
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:55,457
that is to say,
the reason I fight.

467
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,590
[ISSEI] I thought you
were fighting for Rias.

468
00:19:57,624 --> 00:19:59,057
[KIBA]
You thought wrong.

469
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,624
All I want is revenge.

470
00:20:01,657 --> 00:20:03,190
[ISSEI] Revenge?

471
00:20:03,224 --> 00:20:05,124
[KIBA] It won't
be much longer now.

472
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:07,357
I'm going to
destroy Excalibur.

473
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,557
That alone is my purpose.

474
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:16,257
[RIAS] Holy Swords are the
worst weapons against devils.

475
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:20,157
Simply touching one
burns a devil's body.

476
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,390
More importantly, to be cut

477
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:23,957
by a Holy Sword could
mean instant death.

478
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,324
The truth is a Holy Sword
can annihilate a devil.

479
00:20:27,357 --> 00:20:29,524
Wow, okay, that's
kind of intense.

480
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:30,390
It is.

481
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:31,624
The fact that
those who can use one

482
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:35,390
are extraordinarily rare is
the swords' biggest weakness.

483
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:36,857
The church did
what they could.

484
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,090
They tried to raise
people artificially.

485
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:41,024
Perhaps they could
wield Excalibur,

486
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:43,557
then, they could annihilate
devils everywhere.

487
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,490
It's known as the
Holy Sword Project.

488
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:48,157
Holy Sword Project?

489
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,957
The church must've
kept that super secret

490
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,357
because I never heard anything
about it when I was there.

491
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,857
[RIAS] I would think not.

492
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,124
It's in the past.

493
00:20:56,157 --> 00:20:58,557
I heard the project
failed completely.

494
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,957
[ISSEI] Well, let's hope so.

495
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,490
[RIAS] Kiba barely
survived the project.

496
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,557
[ASIA] Oh, poor Kiba.

497
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,257
[RIAS] What is it?

498
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,490
[ISSEI] I think I know
what freaked him out.

499
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:16,224
[ISSEI] When Kiba
looked at this,

500
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:18,990
he said that was a Holy Sword.

501
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:22,357
It's not nearly as
powerful as Excalibur,

502
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,057
but there's no mistaking it.

503
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,390
Kiba was right.

504
00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:26,890
That is a Holy Sword.

505
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:27,724
I knew it.

506
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:29,190
And I'm pretty sure
he only started

507
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:31,290
getting weird after
seeing this picture.

508
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,357
I don't understand

509
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,890
why would it have been
so close to Issei, though.

510
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:36,090
Hold on a second!

511
00:21:36,124 --> 00:21:37,990
This kid's family
invited me to go

512
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:40,024
with them to church
like all the freakin' time.

513
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:41,990
It was really annoying.

514
00:21:42,024 --> 00:21:44,024
So that's how
it is, then.

515
00:21:44,057 --> 00:21:47,190
I understand why the predecessor
here is gone, but still.

516
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:50,090
I thought for sure.

517
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:51,057
For sure what?

518
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,024
Oh, I'm sorry.

519
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:53,590
Look at how late it is.

520
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:55,490
C'mon, let's get to bed.

521
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,857
Slow your roll.

522
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,590
Why are you taking off
your clothes in here?

523
00:21:58,624 --> 00:21:59,690
[RIAS] What?

524
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:03,290
You know I can't sleep
unless I'm completely naked.

525
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:04,257
No, I mean why--

526
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,257
why are you getting
all naked in my room?

527
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,624
[RIAS] Well, obviously

528
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:10,224
because I'm gonna
sleep with you, silly.

529
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:11,524
Then, I'm doing it, too!

530
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:14,824
Here goes. I'm
sleeping with Issei!

531
00:22:17,257 --> 00:22:18,124
Fair is fair.

532
00:22:18,157 --> 00:22:21,024
I claimed him first;
he's mine tonight!

533
00:22:21,057 --> 00:22:22,557
No way.

534
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,490
It's not fair for you to
keep him all to yourself.

535
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:27,024
I think I should
be given the chance

536
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:29,457
to spend the night
with Issei as well!

537
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,157
[ISSEI thinking]
We have reached Titical Mass!

538
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,290
It's a double dose
of dairy-pillows!

539
00:22:34,324 --> 00:22:36,990
Pull it together, you
got two bombs to defuse!

540
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,290
Hey, come on, now.

541
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,424
There's no need to fight. Right?

542
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:41,357
Fine.

543
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,157
I suppose the decision
will be left to Issei.

544
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,590
Yes, I agree.

545
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:45,890
All right, Issei.

546
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:47,290
Which will
you choose?

547
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,890
Too much. Can't choose!

548
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,224
[RIAS] Don't make
me wait, Issei.

549
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:03,924
[ASIA] I'm ready now.

550
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:06,024
Please be gentle.

551
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,324
[ASIA] I started
living with Issei first!

552
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,524
I'm getting tired of
always waiting my turn!

553
00:23:14,557 --> 00:23:15,390
[RIAS] Yes you've
been very patient,

554
00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:18,057
so what's one more day?
Let's go, Issei!

555
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,357
[ASIA] I might lose
based on the size

556
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,290
of my chest, but not my heart!

557
00:23:21,324 --> 00:23:23,424
My feelings for Issei
are bigger than anyone's!

558
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:24,924
[RIAS] Same here!

559
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,424
[XENOVIA] I'd say that
"utter ruins" describes it.

560
00:23:47,457 --> 00:23:49,324
[IRINA] Rumor has it there
was a disturbance here

561
00:23:49,357 --> 00:23:52,490
recently caused by a
fallen angel and a devil.

562
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:54,024
[XENOVIA] It's getting late.

563
00:23:55,124 --> 00:23:56,424
And you're
certain this is it?

564
00:23:56,457 --> 00:23:58,924
We're supposed to be
meeting him here, correct?

565
00:23:58,957 --> 00:24:00,524
Oh, please, like
I would be wrong.

566
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:01,557
On top of that,

567
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,424
I lived in this city with
my parents as a kid.

568
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:05,390
Gimmie a little
credit, okay?

569
00:24:15,524 --> 00:24:17,857
I mean, we are
friends, aren't we?

570
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,324
[KIBA] I apologize, Issei,

571
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,857
but it wouldn't be right
for me to have friends.

572
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,024
I don't deserve that.

573
00:24:24,057 --> 00:24:25,390
Not now.

574
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:29,457
[MALE PRIEST 1A]
Please, help me!

575
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:31,724
A priest?

576
00:24:31,757 --> 00:24:34,357
[FREED] Neener, neener! Yoo-hoo!

577
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,190
It's been a while, hasn't it?

578
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,924
Did you miss me?

579
00:24:37,957 --> 00:24:39,324
It's nice to
see the playboy

580
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:42,124
of the scum underworld
has come to pay a visit.

581
00:24:42,157 --> 00:24:44,224
[KIBA] So, it's Freed Sellzen.

582
00:24:44,257 --> 00:24:46,924
Have you been hiding
in town this whole time?

583
00:24:46,957 --> 00:24:48,224
[FREED]
Such a wonderful reunion!

584
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:50,857
It's bringing a
tear to mine eye!

585
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,357
[KIBA] Unfortunately for you,

586
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,324
I'm not in the best mood today.

587
00:24:57,124 --> 00:24:59,324
[FREED] That's perfect;
I need some fun!

588
00:24:59,357 --> 00:25:02,357
These pussified priests
are getting so boring!

589
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,390
[KIBA] No. That light.

590
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:05,957
That aura. It can't be.

591
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,590
[FREED] Oh, but
it can! Nice timing!

592
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:10,124
As penance for
your previous actions,

593
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:12,390
let's have a little test
to see which is stronger.

594
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:13,924
So tell me what you think.

595
00:25:13,957 --> 00:25:15,990
Will your filthy cursed
sword be the one?

596
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:17,124
Or do you think it's more likely

597
00:25:17,157 --> 00:25:20,290
the Holy Sword known as
Excalibur will be the victor?

598
00:25:23,257 --> 00:25:27,090
[KIBA] I will never forgive
Excalibur for what it did to me.

599
00:26:58,324 --> 00:26:59,157
[ISSEI] Yo, Issei here!

600
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,457
Damn, two new
hotties hit the scene?

601
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,157
Wait a sec--
Holy swords, seriously?

602
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,257
Aw man, gimme a freakin' break!

603
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,557
Next time:
"The Holy Sword is Here!"

604
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,971
Some boobs'll be here, too!
