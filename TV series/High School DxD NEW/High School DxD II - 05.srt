1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,066
[SONA] We've covered
the entire school

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,433
with a protective barrier.

3
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:21,433
If nothing drastic happens,
it should be able

4
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:24,066
to keep anything within
it from getting damaged.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,300
Thank you, Sona.

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,466
This means so much.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,300
Understand that
this will only work

8
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,533
if conditions remain the same.

9
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,200
[RIAS] Got it.

10
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,700
[ISSEI] Tsubaki. How's Irina?

11
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,733
Her condition is
not life threatening.

12
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:38,066
She can thank Asia for that.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,200
What a relief.

14
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,133
Where's Xenovia?

15
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,133
I wonder if she'll
even come now.

16
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,700
Have you heard
from Kiba, either?

17
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:48,100
No, we haven't
seen him at all.

18
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,766
We know he'll be here, though.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,533
Right.

20
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:52,766
[SONA] I'll keep the barrier up,

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,700
but I might not be able to keep
the school from collapsing.

22
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:58,266
As much as I'd
prefer to avoid it.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,800
I'm not going to
let that happen.

24
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,133
[SONA] Rias, it's not too late.

25
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,466
You can still
contact your brother.

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,233
You know what I don't see?

27
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:09,633
You trying to contact
your big sister.

28
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,500
With good reason, too.

29
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:13,233
Sir Zechs loves you.

30
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:15,433
You know he would
want to assist us.

31
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,800
There's no doubt
that he'd come here

32
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,666
as soon as you
called him. So call him.

33
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:21,733
[AKENO] There's no reason.

34
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:23,633
I've already
contacted Sir Zechs.

35
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,233
How could you do that
without asking me first?

36
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:27,366
Look, Rias.

37
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,433
I understand you don't want

38
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:31,700
to bother your brother
unless we absolutely must.

39
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:34,666
Our enemy is a
leader-class fallen angel.

40
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,266
He's not someone you
can take on your own.

41
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:41,733
I think that qualifies
this to be a "must."

42
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:43,366
Fine.

43
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,300
I thank you for your
consideration, President.

44
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,800
Sir Zech's is on his way.

45
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,466
I believe that his
forces should arrive here

46
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,133
in just about an hour.

47
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,366
Good grief, girl.

48
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,566
I cannot win
against you, can I?

49
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,133
Should be a fun hour.

50
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:35,802
[RIAS] Issei. I need you
to be on support this time.

51
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:37,069
[ISSEI] Support?

52
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:38,669
[RIAS] I want you
to use your ability

53
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:40,602
to transfer your
power to the rest of us

54
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:41,802
to increase our strength.

55
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:43,802
No problem.
I'm all over it!

56
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:45,636
In the meantime,
I think we can stall

57
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:48,602
until Issei can transfer his
power to everyone, don't you?

58
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:50,469
Yeah, I bet we
can manage that.

59
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:51,969
Absolutely.

60
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:52,936
[RIAS] Issei?

61
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,469
I'm still here!

62
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,502
Yes, and we're
counting on you.

63
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,702
Sure thing!

64
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:58,436
[RIAS]
Let's concentrate on being

65
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,602
on the offensive
for this battle.

66
00:04:00,636 --> 00:04:01,636
We have to get into the school

67
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,869
and prevent Kokabiel
from releasing his power,

68
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:05,702
whatever that may be.

69
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:07,569
Unlike the fight with Riser.

70
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:09,869
Our lives will be
at risk this time.

71
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:11,169
But believe me,

72
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,002
I will not allow us
to die today.

73
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:14,936
We will survive,
my dear servants.

74
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:16,836
We'll survive this fight
so we can come back here

75
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:18,202
and go to school once more!

76
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:19,636
[GROUP] Yes, ma'am!

77
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:21,936
[ISSEI] Promotion to Queen!

78
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:32,836
[ASIA] What in
the world is that?

79
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:34,602
[KOKABIEL] It seems
like the four Excaliburs

80
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,569
have been made into one.

81
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:38,869
That is just so
Valper, you know?

82
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:39,969
[RIAS] Kokabiel!

83
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:41,902
So, is big brother
on his way, yet?

84
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:43,936
Or is it Serafall instead?

85
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:46,502
Right now, we're the
ones here ready to fight.

86
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,436
That's all that matters.

87
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:49,936
[ISSEI] Be careful!

88
00:04:58,636 --> 00:04:59,669
[ISSEI] The gym!

89
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:02,902
[KOKABIEL] This is so boring.

90
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,969
I need a diversion.

91
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:06,669
No freakin' way.

92
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:07,536
[DDRAIG] What's wrong, kid?

93
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:08,369
You skeered?

94
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:09,702
I've never seen
that big of a lance

95
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:11,236
made of light before, dude.

96
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,502
It's like from
another dimension!

97
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:14,336
[DDRAIG] Of course it's

98
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:16,002
from another
dimension; look at it.

99
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:17,102
We're talking about a man

100
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:20,002
who survived fighting
with God and the Devil King.

101
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,802
You really think we
can still beat him?

102
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:23,502
[DDRAIG] When it
comes down to it,

103
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:24,702
I'll beat him even if I have

104
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:26,969
to turn most of your
body into a dragon.

105
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:29,069
Most of my body, huh?

106
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:31,202
Well, as long as you leave
me the important parts.

107
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:32,769
Since you came all
this way to see me,

108
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:36,502
I might as well let you
play with my favorite pet!

109
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:47,802
[RIAS] Cerberus?

110
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:50,069
[AKENO] Living at the
gates of the underworld,

111
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:51,836
it's the Watchdog of Hades.

112
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:53,202
So he's real?

113
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:54,769
What are we gonna do?

114
00:05:54,802 --> 00:05:56,602
Bringing him to this
world is forbidden.

115
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:58,636
Let's send him back!
Akeno! Koneko!

116
00:05:58,669 --> 00:05:59,802
[BOTH] Yes, ma'am!

117
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:01,936
[RIAS] Issei, use the Sacred
Gear to enhance our power!

118
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:04,669
Right! Boosted Gear!

119
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:06,002
[DDRAIG] Boost!

120
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,569
[ISSEI] Asia, get back!

121
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:12,169
[ASIA] Okay.

122
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:13,102
[ISSEI] We'll be fine.

123
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:14,869
Trust me; our girls
will have no problem

124
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:16,469
taking care of that puppy.

125
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,936
[DDRAIG] Boost!

126
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,202
I think he wants more!

127
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:39,602
[ISSEI] Jeez, how
tough is this bitch?

128
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:40,802
[DDRAIG] Boost!

129
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:41,869
Not yet.

130
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,202
I don't have enough
power built up to transfer.

131
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:46,636
[ISSEI thinking] Damn it,
if only I were stronger,

132
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:49,069
I could enhance
everyone in a split second!

133
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:58,069
[ISSEI] What the hell?
There're more than one?

134
00:06:58,102 --> 00:06:59,602
[DDRAIG]
Boost!

135
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:01,569
If I get attacked or
attack something else,

136
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:03,569
the multiplier is reset on me.

137
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:06,036
Run, Asia!
I'll get its attention!

138
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:07,569
Issei!

139
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:15,702
Look out, Koneko!

140
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:16,269
You look out.

141
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,636
I'll take care of this.

142
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:19,669
[ISSEI] But you
can't take him alone!

143
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:22,802
[KONEKO] At the least,
I can stall for time.

144
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:24,069
Or you could die.

145
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:25,602
[DDRAIG] Boost!

146
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:28,002
All right, Koneko,
but be careful!

147
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,069
Are you all right?

148
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,202
For the most part.

149
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,536
[ISSEI] Okay, I'll take
it from here!

150
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:02,469
Asia, help Koneko out for me!

151
00:08:02,502 --> 00:08:04,669
Hey, you piece
of shit dog!

152
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:07,169
What's wrong; can't tell your
opponent's standing right here?

153
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:09,536
I think I pissed him off!

154
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,636
Now all I've gotta do
is lure this thing over in time!

155
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:15,002
[DDRAIG] Boost!

156
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:18,569
So, you think this
is gonna end up okay?

157
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:20,602
We have no choice
but to trust them.

158
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:22,202
I think we'll be fine.

159
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,669
Besides, I believe in Rias
Gremory and her household.

160
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:29,069
Issei, please be careful!

161
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:32,069
[ISSEI] I'm doing my
best here; trust me!

162
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,936
You need
a little help, here?

163
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,869
[ISSEI] Xenovia!

164
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,036
And that is
exactly the damage

165
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:51,802
you can expect a Holy
Sword to have on evil.

166
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:53,202
I'd rather we didn't
need the help,

167
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:55,169
but I am glad you're here.

168
00:09:02,136 --> 00:09:05,036
She's amazing!
What is that?

169
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:06,136
[DDRAIG] It's the signal.

170
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,602
We've reached an appropriate
multiplier for fighting.

171
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:10,836
Seems kinda convenient
to have that built in.

172
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:12,002
[DDRAIG]
Let's chalk it up to you

173
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:13,469
and the sacred
treasure maturing.

174
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:15,569
What you want can be
a reality and all that.

175
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:17,469
[ISSEI] Cool! Heads up, ladies!

176
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:18,136
Good boy!

177
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:20,102
Oh. Fun!

178
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:24,069
[ISSEI] Boosted Gear!
Gift!

179
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:25,769
[DDRAIG] Transfer!

180
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:33,402
Nice work.

181
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:36,002
I didn't realize you were
strong enough to do that, Issei.

182
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:37,069
We're ready now!

183
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:38,469
Oh, yeah.

184
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:39,269
Akeno?

185
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:43,069
Of course. Now,
ring out thunder!

186
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,102
No! Asia!

187
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:58,636
[ASIA screams]

188
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,969
Kiba made it.

189
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:06,769
Kiba, you're here!

190
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:09,002
More!

191
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:10,769
I would love to!

192
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:17,836
Awesome!
That was so cool, Kiba!

193
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:19,936
[KOKABIEL] Awesome
is a bit of a stretch.

194
00:10:22,236 --> 00:10:24,102
[RIAS] Take this!

195
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:26,136
[ISSEI] That's huge!

196
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:35,736
Impressive.

197
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,969
Look how much stronger
you've become

198
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:40,636
now that you've had a little
Red Dragon Emperor inside you.

199
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:44,169
Sexy. And fascinating,
as well!

200
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:50,669
[VALPER] It is complete.

201
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:57,902
[KIBA] Oh no.

202
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:01,602
[VALPER] Finally, it is done!

203
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,187
[KOKABIEL] Now, I get
to have the massive power

204
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,787
that results from the
combination of the swords.

205
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,220
That's our trade off.
Sweet deal, huh?

206
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:24,954
[RIAS] So that
power is what you used

207
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:26,987
to make the ground collapse?

208
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,120
[ISSEI] Seriously?
So then, what?

209
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:32,487
Does that
mean you guys're

210
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,020
gonna use it to make
our town disappear?

211
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:36,520
[VALPER] I suggest
you leave quickly.

212
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:38,254
This whole area is
going to be destroyed

213
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:39,854
in less than twenty minutes.

214
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:43,420
[KOKABIEL] If you
want to save it,

215
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:47,020
you'll have to defeat me. Oh no.

216
00:11:50,454 --> 00:11:52,154
Ready, Rias Gremory?

217
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,020
I'm ready!

218
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:09,920
[KOKABIEL] Fool!

219
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,820
[AKENO] Rias!

220
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:18,820
[ISSEI] Akeno!

221
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,187
[AKENO] Issei?

222
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,954
Are you okay?
You feel awesome!

223
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:29,287
I'm sorry, Issei.

224
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,054
You wasted all that power on me.

225
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:33,254
[ISSEI] I'm not worried
about it right now.

226
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,320
Hey, asshole, how could
you do that to her?

227
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,354
Now, you're gonna
have to pay big time!

228
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:41,887
And there he goes; the
passionate hero as always.

229
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,354
It doesn't look like
we'll be able to hold out.

230
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:50,120
What's taking Sir Zechs so long?

231
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:54,154
We have to find
a way to win. Kiba?

232
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,554
Kiba!

233
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:58,087
[KIBA] Valper Galilei.

234
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,854
I'm a survivor of the
Holy Sword Project,

235
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:04,187
or more accurately, of
those you tried to murder.

236
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,154
[KIBA] I was able to live
because I was reborn as a devil.

237
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,487
I refused to die
because I knew one day

238
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,887
I would avenge the
deaths of my comrades!

239
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,787
Kiba! No!

240
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,754
Kiba!

241
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,254
[KOKABIEL] You were able
to avoid a direct attack?

242
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:30,020
What a quick little rat.

243
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:30,587
[KOKABIEL] Freed.

244
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,354
You called? I'm here!

245
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:33,454
[ISSEI] Not you again!

246
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:35,920
[KOKABIEL] This is our
last piece of entertainment.

247
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:38,154
Use the Excalibur with
the power of four swords

248
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:39,854
to get rid of all this debris.

249
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,020
[FREED] I would love to!

250
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,787
You know that
fancy Excalibur

251
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,120
with those ridiculous specs?

252
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:49,120
Surprise! I just
got one as a gift!

253
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:53,020
Now, who wants the pointy
end of this bad boy first?

254
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,487
Well, I'll just go
ahead and chop up

255
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,020
that devil and bitch
believer a little, then.

256
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:00,054
That sound okay?

257
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
[ISSEI] Xenovia!

258
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,954
[FREED] Too slow!

259
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:09,587
[FREED] Have you met?

260
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,454
Say hello to the
Chopper Rapidly!

261
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:13,820
So fresh!

262
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,987
Such an amazing Excalibur!

263
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,787
This bad boy can
make anything happen!

264
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,187
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

265
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,854
My face! You scum bitch!

266
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:34,820
Who kicks a beautiful
creation like this;

267
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:36,920
I'm going to tear
you apart for that!

268
00:14:36,954 --> 00:14:39,420
I'll turn you into a
slip-n-slide, you hear me?

269
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:41,887
Prepare for your
final reckoning.

270
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:50,387
It's not just mimicry,
you know! Yahoo!

271
00:14:52,987 --> 00:14:54,754
It's a nightmare.

272
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,054
[FREED] This is the power
of the Excalibur Nightmare!

273
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:02,320
Ba-dum, dum-dum dum!

274
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:03,954
How do you like it, princess?

275
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:04,854
[XENOVIA] An illusion?

276
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,754
[FREED] Now, Transparency!

277
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:14,087
[XENOVIA] He can
use all their abilities;

278
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,854
all the swords
that were combined.

279
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:18,054
[FREED] All righty,
brace yourselves, dears!

280
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:18,920
Y'mean Xenovia can't even

281
00:15:18,954 --> 00:15:20,954
do anything to this creep?

282
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,320
[XENOVIA] I can't defeat
this guy on my own.

283
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:29,287
[ISSEI] Don't forget
we're here too, asshole!

284
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,936
[VALPER] I'd heard about you.

285
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,570
They said one of the
subjects had escaped.

286
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:48,270
[VALPER] How tragic
to survive only

287
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:50,403
to live as a lowly devil.

288
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:52,236
I am grateful to
you and the others.

289
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,670
You taught me what
I needed to know

290
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,070
to complete the project.

291
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:55,936
[KIBA] Complete it?

292
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,970
The subjects we
used didn't individually

293
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:00,136
have enough of a
particular gene required

294
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,503
to use the Holy Swords.

295
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:02,903
After I realized that fact,

296
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:04,370
I came to a conclusion.

297
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:06,436
So... All I did
was take out the gene

298
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,003
from the kids who
carried any of it.

299
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,003
Then, I found a
way to combine

300
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,203
and crystallize their genes!

301
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:16,436
This crystal contains the
correct quantity of the gene.

302
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,670
It's the last one made

303
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:20,170
from those pathetic
little brats.

304
00:16:20,536 --> 00:16:22,136
[FREED] The other guys
they tested the crystals

305
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,070
on died halfway in
because they were too weak

306
00:16:24,103 --> 00:16:26,470
to take all the gene goodness.

307
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:27,403
If you think
about it that way,

308
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:30,370
you're lucky to be
fighting one of a kind!

309
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:32,503
[ISSEI] Bastard!

310
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:34,403
[XENOVIA] The crystal.

311
00:16:34,436 --> 00:16:37,903
Holy Sword users
receive a blessing.

312
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:40,403
Something like that is
put into their bodies.

313
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:43,970
A gene deficiency.

314
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,236
That must be what they've
been using them for.

315
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,936
[VALPER] Those hypocrites!

316
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,036
After excommunicating
me as a pagan,

317
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,270
they shamelessly
use my research?

318
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,303
Typical church behavior.

319
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:57,003
Of course, we're
talking about Michael.

320
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:58,970
So even if he took
genes from his subjects,

321
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:01,470
I bet he didn't take
the time to kill them.

322
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,903
[KIBA] There was no
need to kill us either.

323
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:07,636
[KIBA] How could you?

324
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,603
You were nothing more

325
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:11,270
than materials used
in a top-secret project.

326
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:12,636
We had what we needed.

327
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,170
What were we supposed to do?

328
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:18,536
[KIBA] We believed what
we were doing was for God.

329
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,470
We bore everything
because of that faith.

330
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:23,270
And then--You--

331
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:27,103
You just threw
us away, like trash.

332
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:30,036
No.

333
00:17:33,003 --> 00:17:34,270
Here, why don't
you take this?

334
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,236
I no longer need it;
we've gotten to the point

335
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,570
where we can mass-produce
higher quality crystals,

336
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:40,570
no martyrs required.

337
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:44,136
Run away!

338
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,070
Hurry; save yourself!

339
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,003
Gone.

340
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,636
[ISSEI] Valper Gaililei.
You'll pay for this!

341
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:56,436
[KIBA] How many.

342
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,303
How many lives did your
blessed research cost?

343
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:02,470
How many deaths did it take?

344
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:06,370
[ASIA] What is that?

345
00:18:06,403 --> 00:18:08,103
[KONEKO] Look.

346
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:10,270
[ISSEI] It kinda
seems like people.

347
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:13,903
[AKENO] It's probably
the different powers

348
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:16,203
from the battlefield combining.

349
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:18,203
And Kiba.

350
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:20,236
Our powers on
top of the trembling

351
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,403
of his heart must have freed
the souls from the crystal.

352
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,236
I prayed, and wondered.

353
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,570
Why was I the only one? Why me?

354
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:34,070
It wasn't fair for
me to have survived.

355
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,470
[KIBA] There were kids who
had bigger dreams than I did.

356
00:18:39,503 --> 00:18:42,636
Kids who wanted to
live more than I did.

357
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,003
It was a mistake.

358
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:46,136
Someone better
than me should have

359
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,070
made it out of that nightmare!

360
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,436
It's okay.

361
00:19:11,436 --> 00:19:13,936
Let's all gather together.

362
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,570
[BOY 3B] Take us in. It's time.

363
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:18,403
[GIRL 3A] You don't
have to be scared,

364
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:20,303
even if there is no God.

365
00:19:20,336 --> 00:19:23,036
[GIRL 5B] Though God may
not be watching over us.

366
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,103
[BOY 3C ] Our hearts
will forever be one.

367
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:29,603
Yes.

368
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:35,536
[KONEKO] Aw, that's sweet.

369
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,470
I can't stop crying!

370
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:42,470
Damn it, Kiba.
You're breaking my heart.

371
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:45,036
[DDRAIG] The Knight has Peaked.

372
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,436
It happens when the thoughts

373
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,303
and wishes of the
user oppose nature.

374
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:51,203
When they go against
the natural course

375
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:53,403
of things in this world.

376
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:57,070
The Sacred Treasure Peaks,
or as it is also known:

377
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:58,503
The Balance Breaker.

378
00:19:58,536 --> 00:20:00,103
[KOKABIEL] Oh?

379
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:02,370
My comrades,
they never wanted

380
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:04,670
me to wish for revenge.

381
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,270
They wanted me free.
But I'm not.

382
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:11,603
First, I need to destroy
the evil in front of me.

383
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:15,136
Then no one else
will have to suffer.

384
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:20,003
No one but you!

385
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:21,336
Help me! Freed!

386
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,503
Yes? I'm here!

387
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:28,103
You are such a little fool.

388
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:31,003
You should have let yourself
be killed with the rest of them.

389
00:20:31,403 --> 00:20:33,003
[ISSEI] Kiba!

390
00:20:33,036 --> 00:20:35,103
Go on and kick that
Freed bastard's ass

391
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:36,470
along with those Excaliburs!

392
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:38,570
No point in wasting
your friends feelings now,

393
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:40,236
or their souls!

394
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,203
[KIBA] Issei.

395
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:42,936
You can do it, Kiba.

396
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,536
Fight like a member
of the House of Gremory;

397
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,670
take them down.

398
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,103
Besides, no true Knight of mine

399
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:49,470
would ever lose to
such a pathetic foe.

400
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:50,370
Come on, Kiba!

401
00:20:50,403 --> 00:20:51,636
We all believe in you.

402
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,236
I wanna see blood.

403
00:20:53,703 --> 00:20:55,503
Kiba!

404
00:20:55,536 --> 00:20:56,336
Thank you.

405
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:56,903
[FREED] Gross.

406
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:58,136
Another "moving scene"

407
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,170
from the House
of Gag Me Gremory!

408
00:21:00,203 --> 00:21:02,003
Now my skin is
starting to crawl

409
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:03,336
and is creeping me out!

410
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,636
I can't take it!

411
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,536
I need to hurry
up and kill you.

412
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,436
Yes. That should make
me feel much better!

413
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,536
Time for a new sword.

414
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:17,436
Dear comrades whose souls
have merged with mine.

415
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,436
We shall overcome this together.

416
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,270
All our dreams that were
stifled can now come true.

417
00:21:22,303 --> 00:21:23,970
I'll create a sword for Rias

418
00:21:24,003 --> 00:21:25,970
and for all of
my fallen friends.

419
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:27,636
Sword Birth, go!

420
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:33,236
It's the Sword of Betrayer,
a sword vested

421
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,270
with both Holy and Devil powers.

422
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:36,903
Try and stop it.

423
00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:40,170
[RIAS] Holy and Devil
powers fused together?

424
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:41,503
[ISSEI] Now it makes sense!

425
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,270
I get what Ddraig
was talking about!

426
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,170
He said Kiba had Peaked.

427
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:49,436
So that must be Kiba's
prohibited technique.

428
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,036
That sword is his
Balance Breaker!

429
00:21:52,503 --> 00:21:54,103
[VALPER] A Holy Devil Sword?

430
00:21:54,136 --> 00:21:55,070
It's impossible.

431
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:57,470
Two opposing elements
cannot mix together.

432
00:21:57,503 --> 00:21:59,670
Something like
that is an aberration!

433
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:01,603
Talk to me, Knight
of Rias Gremory.

434
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:04,070
Are the two of us still
fighting on the same side?

435
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,436
I'd like to
think we are.

436
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,370
I have a
thought, then;

437
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:08,903
why don't we destroy
that Excalibur together.

438
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:10,270
Are you sure?

439
00:22:10,303 --> 00:22:11,536
I understand
that technically

440
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,436
we're looking at a Holy Sword.

441
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,670
But there's nothing
holy about that.

442
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:17,436
Agreed.

443
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,070
Oh, Peter.

444
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:23,236
Oh, Basilius and Dionysius,
and the Blessed Virgin Mary.

445
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,903
I ask you to please
hear my prayers!

446
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:36,203
[XENOVIA] In the
name of the saint

447
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:38,203
living within this blade...

448
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,970
I hereby set you free!

449
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,503
This is called Durandal.

450
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:46,570
Durandal?

451
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:48,336
It's a Holy Sword!

452
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,570
[AKENO] A sword on
par with Excalibur,

453
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,403
said to cut everything
in this world.

454
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:54,470
[VALPER] That's impossible.

455
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:56,970
My research didn't go
into how to use Durandal;

456
00:22:57,003 --> 00:22:59,636
no one should be able
to wield that thing.

457
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,603
You're wrong.

458
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:02,336
Unlike Kiba or Irina.

459
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,670
I'm one of the
rarely found naturals.

460
00:23:04,703 --> 00:23:06,270
[VALPER] One who
is perfectly suitable,

461
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:09,136
also known as a
true Holy Sword user!

462
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,470
[XENOVIA] This kiddo cuts
anything he touches to pieces.

463
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:15,203
He doesn't always
listen to me, either.

464
00:23:15,236 --> 00:23:17,336
Besides that, he's
infinitely dangerous

465
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,503
if not stored in
another dimension.

466
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:20,636
[FREED] I don't believe you!

467
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:26,670
Damn, I love a
good plot twist!

468
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:29,036
[XENOVIA] What you have is
simply a broken Holy Sword.

469
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,003
It's no match for my Durandal!

470
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,536
Kiss my ass!

471
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,170
[FREED] I have decided
that I don't like you!

472
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:36,636
[KIBA] The feeling's mutual!

473
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:41,003
[KIBA] It wasn't enough
to sever our hopes!

474
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:42,403
[FREED] My sword broke!

475
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:44,270
Are you fucking kidding me?

476
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:46,970
How could I be taken
out by lame devil scum?

477
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:48,970
No!

478
00:23:51,103 --> 00:23:52,536
Yes! Did you see?

479
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,170
Our powers overcame Excalibur!

480
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:56,236
[VALPER] How is this possible?

481
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,270
In theory, the fusion of
holy and devil powers is--

482
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:03,003
Prepare yourself,
Valper Galilei!

483
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:04,036
Yes.

484
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,136
I understand now;
if the balance between holy

485
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:09,470
and devil powers is disrupted,
it could be possible!

486
00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:11,236
Which means, not
only the Devil King,

487
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,603
but also God!

488
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:20,203
[KOKABIEL] Oh Valper,
you really were very talented.

489
00:24:20,236 --> 00:24:22,236
Unfortunately,
you weren't supposed

490
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,270
to figure that part out.

491
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:27,603
[RIAS] Okay, Kokabiel, what
are you trying to do here?

492
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:31,003
[KOKABIEL] I'm destroying
everything I find tedious.

493
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,470
Now, I'm even more
bored than before.

494
00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:34,670
Hey there, little boy!

495
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:35,703
[ISSEI] Yeah, what do you want?

496
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:37,436
[KOKABIEL] Raise the
Dragon's power as much as

497
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,636
you can and transfer
it to one of them.

498
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,603
Why would you
want me to do that?

499
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:42,436
[RIAS] So what?

500
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,203
Are you offering
to give us a chance?

501
00:24:44,236 --> 00:24:46,236
Don't bother; we don't need it!

502
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,536
[KOKABIEL] You're being
ridiculous, Rias, my dear!

503
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,436
You're gonna need more
than a little power up.

504
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,636
Rias.

505
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,570
We're out of time.

506
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:02,303
Let's go. We can do it.

507
00:25:10,103 --> 00:25:11,436
Issei.

508
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,536
[DDRAIG] Boost!

509
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:16,870
Really?

510
00:25:17,436 --> 00:25:19,070
[DDRAIG] Boost!

511
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,103
[DDRAIG] Boost!

512
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,536
[ISSEI] Yo, Issei here!

513
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,970
Kokabiel's power
isn't letting up at all!

514
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:03,970
But don't discount
Kiba just yet.

515
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:06,370
Or, for that matter,
the rest of us!

516
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:09,721
Next time:
"Go, Occult Research Club!"

517
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:12,187
Never underestimate a man
who's still got titties to lick!
