[DDRAIG] Boost!

2
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,266
[ISSEI thinking]
It's not enough.

3
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,533
[DDRAIG] Boost!

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,600
[DDRAIG] Boost!

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,566
I'm ready now.
Are you?

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,266
[RIAS] Absolutely.

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,033
Boosted Gear,
Gift! Transfer!

8
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:48,066
[DDRAIG] Transfer!

9
00:01:02,674 --> 00:01:03,941
Holy shit!

10
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:05,041
She's amazing!

11
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:08,441
I can feel the waves of
power, even from over here.

12
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:13,141
[KOKABIEL] Now things
are getting interesting.

13
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:14,341
Yes, what you've
got there is

14
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,641
a devil's power to
the highest degree.

15
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:18,341
You've been blessed
with strength on par

16
00:01:18,374 --> 00:01:21,407
with that of your big,
bad brother, little girl.

17
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,474
In that case, be gone!

18
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:35,541
So much better, and
far more interesting.

19
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:37,841
Almost as good as Sir Zechs!

20
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,907
Rias! No!

21
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:52,907
Go! Akeno!

22
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:55,074
Now ring out, Thunder!

23
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:03,341
[KOKABIEL] Could it
be she who possesses

24
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,274
the power of Barkiel
is trying to fight?

25
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:06,541
[AKENO] Don't speak his name.

26
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:09,474
I am nothing like that creature!

27
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:11,207
What's a Barkiel?

28
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:13,074
One of the fallen
angel leaders.

29
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:15,007
He can use
lightning and thunder.

30
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,074
So basically,
Akeno's power.

31
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:19,274
Well, that's a
strange coincidence.

32
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:26,174
[KOKABIEL] Oh dear,
say it isn't so.

33
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:29,241
Why choose to fall
so far as to be a devil?

34
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,641
What an amusing house, Rias.

35
00:02:31,674 --> 00:02:33,541
The Red Dragon Emperor.

36
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:36,407
A ruined Holy Sword
Project subject.

37
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:38,574
And Barkiel's daughter!

38
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:39,374
What?

39
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:40,407
No, it can't be!

40
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:42,107
For real, Akeno?

41
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:44,874
You're the daughter
of a fallen angel?

42
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:46,574
How terribly amusing.

43
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:51,141
A propensity for inferior
products must run in the family.

44
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:52,074
[RIAS] Your insulting comments

45
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:54,941
about my brother will
not be tolerated!

46
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,307
But for insulting
my servants,

47
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:59,574
you will pay the
ultimate price, and die!

48
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:03,174
By all means,
go ahead and try.

49
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:04,607
Possessor of the Welsh Dragon,

50
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:06,174
Crimson Haired Ruin Princess,

51
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:08,641
and the Devil King's
baby sister!

52
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:10,141
Please tell me you realize

53
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:12,941
you're confronting
the archenemy of devils.

54
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:15,641
Might as well take advantage
of this opportunity.

55
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:17,407
You may never get it again.

56
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:19,341
[ISSEI]
Hey, fallen angel douche nozzle!

57
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:20,341
Issei!

00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:22,474
If you say one more rude
thing to Rias or Akeno,

59
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:24,307
I am going to beat
the shit out of you!

60
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:28,874
Don't test me, either,
you bird man freak!

61
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:31,641
Really?
You must be an idiot.

62
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:33,141
[ISSEI] I am what I am, asshole!

63
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:34,974
Stay right there
if you want some!

64
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,041
Now Boosted Gear, go!

00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:39,541
Don't, Issei! No!

We've got your back.

68
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:46,107
I think we can buy you
a little more time!

69
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:47,507
Just focus on
powering up for now!

70
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,241
Right. Totally focusing!

71
00:03:49,274 --> 00:03:50,574
[DDRAIG] Boost!

72
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:05,907
Oh!

73
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,174
What's more fun than Holy Sword

74
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:09,941
and Holy Devil Sword
attacks at the same time?

75
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:11,174
[KONEKO] This.

76
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:20,874
[ISSEI] Koneko!

77
00:04:28,974 --> 00:04:30,507
Hyodo. Come on.

78
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,607
I'm about to hit my limit here.

79
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:34,474
Saji, do what you
can to keep focus!

80
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,274
Yes, ma'am!

81
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:37,907
[SONA thinking]
Other than Tsubaki and me,

82
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:40,074
everyone else is
running out of power.

83
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:42,907
[SONA thinking]
Hurry, Rias.

84

00:04:46,507 --> 00:04:48,474
[ISSEI] Damn.

86
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:01,641
I hate this jerk.

87
00:05:01,674 --> 00:05:02,874
Are you okay, Asia?

88
00:05:02,907 --> 00:05:03,907
[ASIA] I'm fine.

89
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:06,107
But what about those two?

90
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,574
[XENOVIA] We're not done yet!

91
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:11,041
[KOKABIEL]
Still wanting more, huh?

92
00:05:11,074 --> 00:05:13,107
Well, hop to it already!

93
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:19,841
Sword Birth!

94
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:26,974
Cute, but is that
all you've got?

95
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:38,941
[KOKABIEL] Give up, yet?

96
00:05:38,974 --> 00:05:40,207
[KIBA] Never!

97
00:05:47,574 --> 00:05:49,174
[KOKABIEL] You cut me!

98
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:00,341
[DDRAIG] Boost!

99
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:03,007
A little bit more.
Almost there.

100
00:06:03,307 --> 00:06:05,107
[KOKABIEL] Why fight so
hard for a group of losers

101
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:07,241
who don't even know
they've lost their master?

102
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:08,207
[XENOVIA] What?

103
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,307
Mind clarifying?

104
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:11,507
[XENOVIA] Kokabiel, tell
me what "lost their master"

105
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,041
is supposed to mean!

106
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:14,874
[KOKABIEL] Whoops.
That just slipped right out.

107
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,041
[XENOVIA]
Answer my question now!

108
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:26,541
I guess I am trying
to start a war.

109
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:28,374
There's no point in
hiding it any longer;

110
00:06:28,407 --> 00:06:32,574
I might as well tell
you the brutal truth.

111
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:33,841
In the previous
three-way war,

112
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:38,274
God was actually killed along
with the four great Devil Kings.

113
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:41,441
No way. God's dead?

114
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:44,041
He's what?
God has been dead?

115
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:46,074
How is that possible?

116
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:48,607
You're lying; I've never
heard anything about that!

117
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,541
[KOKABIEL] Back then,
the devils lost all their kings

118
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:52,874
and most of their
high-level devils.

119
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:54,407
The angels and
fallen angels lost

120
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:57,307
almost everyone except
for their leaders.

121
00:06:57,341 --> 00:07:00,074
Pure angels could
not increase their numbers,

122
00:07:00,107 --> 00:07:03,441
and purebred devils are
just as rare, aren't they?

123
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:05,907
It's not true.
It can't be.

124
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:08,607
[KOKABIEL] All sides have
been ruined to the point

125
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:11,541
where they have to
rely on humans to survive.

126
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:14,907
Angels, fallen angels, devils.

127
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:16,274
The leaders of the
three factions had

128
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:18,207
to seal away this information.

129
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:21,407
That way the God-fearing
humans would keep on fearing.

130
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,074
[XENOVIA] Lies. They're lies.

131
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:26,007
It's not true.

132
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:26,907
[KOKABIEL] Now, try to remember

133
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:29,474
I couldn't care less
about any of that.

134
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:30,874
What drives me crazy is the fact

135
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:34,207
that after God and
those devil kings died--

136
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:37,141
It was decided
to stop the war!

137
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:38,274
Why would they do
something like that

138
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:39,641
in the middle of winning?

139
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:40,841
How dare they try to keep me

140
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:44,207
from squashing my enemies
just when it was getting fun!

141
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:45,474
We would have won!

142
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,041
Even that bastard
Azazel declared

143
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:49,107
there would never
be another war.

144
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:51,341
What the fuck?

145
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:54,607
[ASIA] God doesn't
exist anymore?

146
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,507
hen where is the love

147
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,374
that has been given
to us coming from?

148
00:07:58,407 --> 00:08:01,307
Heh! Michael has been
holding his own so far.

149
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:02,307
He's the one who's been keeping

150
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:05,474
the angels and humans
together in God's stead.

151
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:09,041
The archangel Michael
is acting as God's agent?

152
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:11,274
That means all our prayers?

153
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:13,141
[KOKABIEL] As long
as the system works,

154
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:16,341
prayer and exorcisms will
endure to a certain extent.

155
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:19,307
I'm sure someone
has been listening.

156
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:22,341
[ISSEI] Asia!

157
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:25,007
It's a natural--
a natural reaction.

158
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,607
I'm surprised I can
still think right now.

159
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,574
[KOKABIEL] Well,
I suppose knowing the number

160
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:32,241
of believers in God
has drastically dropped

161
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:34,541
probably doesn't
help anything, does it?

162
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:37,107
But without anyone
to manage the balance

163
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,907
between good and evil,

164
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:41,174
it's no wonder that
something contradictory

165
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:43,574
like the Holy Devil Sword
would appear.

166
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,141
Which means the
war must continue!

167
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:49,874
And I'll keep it going by
taking your heads if I have to!

168
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:51,174
Are you okay?

169
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:57,107
Again. I let my
pride get in the way.

170
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:58,374
It's my fault.

171
00:08:58,407 --> 00:08:59,374
[ISSEI] Don't fuck with me!

172
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:00,641
Issei!

173
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,374
[ISSEI] I'm not gonna let you
destroy this town or my friends.

174
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:06,107
And I don't really care what
bullshit reasons you've got!

175
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:08,907
Besides, I don't
think you understand!

176
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:16,141
[ISSEI] I'm going
to be Harem King!

177
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,507
And some cliché
wing flappin' fallen angel

178
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,207
is not gettin' in
the way of my glory!

179
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:23,541
A Harem King?

180
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:24,374
You mean, that's all the

181
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:26,907
infamous Red Dragon
Emperor wants?

182
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,407
Then, join me.

183
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:30,407
You'll be Harem King
in no time.

184
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:33,207
Beautiful girls falling
at your feet wherever you go.

185
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,874
You just point at the
ones you like and take them.

186
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:40,641
I won't fall for your sweet,
sweet, awesome words,

187
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:43,641
even though that totally
sounds like the shit!

188
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:44,341
Issei?

189
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:45,374
Yes, ma'am?

190
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:47,907
Sorry; you know how
I get with the word harem;

191
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:49,574
this guy ain't
playin' fair at all.

192
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:52,818
If you really like girls
that much, listen up.

193
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:54,585
After we get back home,

194
00:09:54,618 --> 00:09:57,285
I will let you do
whatever you want to me.

195
00:09:57,318 --> 00:10:00,518
[echo] I will let you do
whatever you want to me.

196
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,285
[ISSEI] Like, for real?

197
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:05,718
So, uh, not just basic groping,

198
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:09,985
but like, I can
suck on dem tittays?

199
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:11,051
You can.

200
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:13,885
If that's what it takes,
it's a small price to pay.

201
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:20,451
No way!

202
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:21,551
I know that light.

203
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:22,585
I swear I've
seen it before!

204
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:25,185
It's a Sacred Gear
releasing power after being

205
00:10:25,218 --> 00:10:27,551
perfectly aligned
with its master's wishes.

206
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,051
Yes. Bring that
shit on, Kokabiel.

207
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:31,651
You're going down.

208
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:33,885
And I'm going to suck
on a pair of jumbos!

209
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:36,551
Man, I can almost feel
them in my mouth already!

210
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:39,551
Oh yeah!

211
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:41,918
I feel like I could
kick God's ass right now!

212
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:44,018
Lucky for him,
he's already dead.

213
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:45,018
No offense!

214
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:46,185
Wow.

215
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:49,085
[DDRAIG] Explosion!

216
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:09,885
[KOKABIEL] All the
Red Dragon Emperor had to do

217
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,751
to release this
much power was think

218
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:13,885
about sucking on some breasts?

219
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:15,285
Unbelievable.

220
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:17,251
What in the world are you?

221
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:20,251
[ISSEI] Remember me, Kokabiel!

222
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:22,851
My name is Issei Hyodo!

223
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:25,918
I possess a Boosted Gear
powered on sex and passion.

224
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,185
I am also
Rias Gremory's pawn!

225
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:31,151
This is
embarrassing.

226
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:32,818
I bet he thinks
that sounds cool.

227
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:35,585
Being a twisted pervert
will never be cool.

228
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:38,751
Well, I suppose that's
Issei for ya, right?

229
00:11:39,218 --> 00:11:40,718
I'm sorry, Rias.

230
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:42,651
I'm starting to like him, too.

231
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:43,618
He's right;

232
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:45,251
what's important now
is we haven't lost yet.

233
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:47,685
You can only lose
when you give up.

234
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:49,285
Let's take Issei's lead, guys!

235
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:50,718
You got it, Rias!

236
00:11:51,718 --> 00:11:53,585
For such a low-ranking devil

237
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:55,685
to reach my face is
damn near impossible.

238
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:56,918
This is interesting, boy!

239
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:59,185
I find it very interesting!

240
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,785
[VALI] Haha! Him? Really?

241
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:03,218
Who's there?

242
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:11,918
[TSUBAKI] What is that light?

243
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:41,177
[ISSEI] My body is
starting to shake.

244
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,877
What is that thing?

245
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,044
[KOKABIEL] Why is the
Vanishing Dragon here?

246
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:46,944
The Vanishing Dragon?

247
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:48,877
What the hell's going on here?

248
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,144
Come on.

249
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:52,744
Surely the White Dragon must be
captivated by the Red as well--

250
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,544
What is he doing to him?

251
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,144
I don't know.
I couldn't see.

252
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,244
[VALI] Your wings
remind me of a filthy crow.

253
00:13:03,277 --> 00:13:07,077
Azazel's wings are deeper,
like everlasting darkness.

254
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,310
You bastard!

255
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:10,077
What are you trying to do?

256
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,877
[VALI] Someone who's
fallen lower than

257
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,177
the ground hardly needs
wings, don't you agree?

258
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,777
[ALBION] Divide!

259
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,044
[KOKABIEL] What've you done?

260
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,777
[VALI] His name is Albion.

261
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,210
One of the powers of my
Sacred Gear is Divine Dividing.

262
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:38,444
Every ten seconds,
it cuts in half the power

263
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:40,210
of whatever it's
touching, sustaining me

264
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:41,877
with that power instead.

265
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,477
Cuts power in half?

266
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,444
[VALI] Better hurry,

267
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:47,377
or you won't even be
able to defeat a human.

268
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,910
[RIAS] The Red Dragon
Emperor multiplies

269
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:51,977
its owner's power and
transfers it to something,

270
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,444
while the White
Dragon Emperor halves

271
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:56,310
the enemy's power, using
that gain for its owner.

272
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:58,477
[RIAS] So the
legends were right.

273
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,544
[VALI] Are you still "bored"?

274
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:05,277
Here, let me make this a
little more "fun" for you.

275
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:09,244
[VALI] I've been told
you're getting out of hand.

276
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:11,110
Azazel asked me
to bring you back,

277
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:13,810
even if it took all my power.

278
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:19,844
[KOKABIEL] Azazel!

279
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:30,477
The waves from the
magic square are disappearing!

280
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,177
Then Rias must have won.

281
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,910
But if so, what was
that light from earlier?

282
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,477
[VALI] Oh, good.

283
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,544
There are a few things I need

284
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:41,477
to ask our stray priest as well.

285
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,744
We'll take care of
the rest afterwards.

286
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:51,077
[DDRAIG] Are you going
to ignore me, White One?

287
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,410
[RIAS] The dragon hand talked?

288
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:55,877
[ALBION] You are
still alive, Red One?

289
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,710
[DDRAIG] I've been wondering

290
00:14:56,744 --> 00:14:58,477
when we would
finally meet again.

291
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,444
[ALBION] As have I.

292
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:01,210
We are still fated to fight.

293
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:04,144
[ALBION] It is inevitable.

294
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:06,977
[RIAS] I can't imagine a
battle between those two.

295
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,077
[ALBION] Let's meet
again soon, Ddraig.

296
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,977
[DDRAIG] Yes, let's. Albion.

297
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,310
[ISSEI] Hey!
What the hell is going on?

298
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:16,244
I don't even know who you are!

299
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:18,844
[ISSEI] More importantly,
you just ruined everything!

300
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,210
I was gonna win!

301
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:22,144
Now I won't get to
suck on Rias's boobs,

302
00:15:22,177 --> 00:15:23,844
and it's all your fault!

303
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:25,077
[VALI] Before you
can understand,

304
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,810
you will need more power.

305
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,777
Become stronger, my archrival.

306
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,310
We will fight someday.

307
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,144
[SONA] Rias.

308
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:39,110
[RIAS] Sona!

309
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:40,777
[SONA] I wonder why
the White Dragon Emperor

310
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,377
showed up out of
the blue like that.

311
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,110
I wonder if he realized
he saved our town.

312
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,844
Oh, I certainly doubt it.

313
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:47,877
Now, Tsubaki.

314
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,844
Time to repair the damage
done to our school.

315
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:52,977
[TSUBAKI] We should be able
to manage before classes start.

316
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:53,844
[RIAS] We can help.

317
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:55,210
[SONA] No, taking
care of the school

318
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:57,510
is the job of the
student council.

319
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:02,510
Is it over then?

320
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,577
No.

321
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,877
There are people who
took over Valper's research.

322
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,377
My fight is not finished, yet.

323
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,144
[ISSEI] You did it, pretty boy!

324
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,344
Thank you, Issei.

325
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:13,910
Hey, is that the
Holy Devil Sword?

326
00:16:13,944 --> 00:16:15,410
It's totally bad-ass, man!

327
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:16,944
Look, I wanted
to say something.

328
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,310
No. Dude, don't say
another word, okay?

329
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,344
It's over now,
isn't that good enough?

330
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:23,510
For the Holy Swords,
and your friends?

331
00:16:25,177 --> 00:16:28,177
Besides, there's been way
too much drama going on,

332
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,010
so whatever you were gonna
say is too much for my brain.

333
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:34,110
UUm, Kiba?

334
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:36,844
We can do club activities
together again, right?

335
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:38,444
Hey there, Asia.

336
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,144
[ISSEI thinking] I can't
imagine how she must be

337
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:42,310
feeling after
learning the truth.

338
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:44,144
But still.

339
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,077
What's important
is everyone is safe.

340
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,310
The town is safe.

341
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:48,477
That's enough for now.

342
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,844
[RIAS] Kiba.

343
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:50,777
[KIBA] Rias.

344
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,444
I'm glad you decided
to come back to us.

345
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:53,710
And for you to be
a Balance Breaker,

346
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:57,510
as your master, I can't tell you
how proud of you that makes me.

347
00:16:58,944 --> 00:16:59,977
[KIBA] Still though.

348
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,777
I betrayed the club members.

349
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,477
And more importantly,

350
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,910
I betrayed the one person

351
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:06,544
who saved my life
such a long time ago.

352
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:09,210
I can't make up
for what I've done.

353
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:10,544
But you came back.

354
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:12,277
That's enough for me, Kiba.

355
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,544
That's enough for all of us.

356
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:17,877
Next time, don't let everyone's
feelings go to waste.

357
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,277
President.

358
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,510
I'll make my vow
to you once more.

359
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:26,144
I, Kiba Yuto,
promise to protect you

360
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:29,077
and your companions as a
Knight of the House of Gremory

361
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,077
for the rest of my life.

362
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:39,344
[RIAS] Thank you.

363
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:41,177
And welcome home.

364
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,044
[ISSEI] Hey!

365
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:43,944
Get your face off there,
that's my spot!

366
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:45,177
[KIBA] Whoa, calm down, man.

367
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,344
[ISSEI] Instead of
being a stupid Pawn,

368
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:47,944
I wish I could have
protected everyone

369
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:49,177
as a Knight like you did.

370
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,044
But I guess you're it.

371
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:52,277
You're the only guy I know

372
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,910
who's good enough
to be her Knight.

373
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:55,910
So no more flaking out.

374
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,510
Oh... I don't know
if I'm ever gonna get over

375
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:01,344
missing the chance
for that sweet meat

376
00:18:01,377 --> 00:18:03,144
nipple fun time suck-a-thon.

377
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:05,044
The prodigal
pervert returns.

378
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:06,177
[RIAS] Now, then, Kiba.

379
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,010
[KIBA] Yes?

380
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:09,777
[ISSEI] Oh shit, don't tell me!

381
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,044
It's time to
accept your punishment.

382
00:18:12,077 --> 00:18:14,477
Here's one
thousand spankings.

383
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,277
[KIBA] What?

384
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,144
[ISSEI] This is awesome!

385
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:18,977
Good luck taking it, pretty boy!

386
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,110
[KIBA] Shut up, Issei!

387
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,240
[XENOVIA]
Hey, Red Dragon Emperor.

388
00:18:31,273 --> 00:18:34,140
[ISSEI] Uh, why are you here?

389
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:35,707
[RIAS] Oh good, you found us.

390
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
[ISSEI] Rias? Why is she here?

391
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:40,273
She's the newly-made
Knight of the House of Gremory.

392
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:41,807
Welcome home, Xenovia.

393
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,207
[AKENO] Now it's important
you get along with her, Issei.

394
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,473
[ISSEI]
Wait, she's your new Knight?

395
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:48,907
This has to be a joke.

396
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,773
[ASIA] You've been
transformed into a devil?

397
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:52,673
Well, that's a rather
unexpected development,

398
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:54,673
to say the very least.

399
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:57,340
After I found out that
God had actually died.

400
00:18:57,373 --> 00:18:59,473
I was desperate, so I
begged her to take me in.

401
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:02,473
Wait, you begged for this?
Seriously?

402
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,440
[RIAS] It'll be nice
to have the Durandal user

403
00:19:05,473 --> 00:19:06,507
added to our ranks.

404
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,173
With this, you and Kiba
will be the swordfighters

405
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:10,840
covering our right
and left flanks.

406
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:12,607
That's so cool. Yay.

407
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,807
And I transferred
to this school

408
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,773
as a second-year
student earlier today.

409
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:18,473
It looks like we get
to work together!

410
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:20,540
Don't try to sound cute
while making that face!

411
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:22,240
My goal was
to mimic Irina,

412
00:19:22,273 --> 00:19:24,373
but I guess I just
didn't quite get it right.

413
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:27,240
So like, are you for sure
this is what you wanted?

414
00:19:27,273 --> 00:19:28,907
Without God,
I have no meaning.

415
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,540
I honestly don't
know if becoming

416
00:19:30,573 --> 00:19:32,407
my old enemy is
the best thing.

417
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,307
But for the little
sister of the Devil King,

418
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,207
she's been shockingly kind.

419
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,307
Oh, I hope I made
the right choice.

420
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,407
I feel like I have,
but there's so much doubt.

421
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:46,607
Please help me, O Lord!

422
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:49,340
[KONEKO] Anyone else
getting' déjà vu?

423
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:51,473
That girl's a
genuine crazy person.

424
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:55,507
Oh, speaking of,
what happened to Irina?

425
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,673
[XENOVIA] She returned
to our headquarters.

426
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:05,373
You have all four of the
destroyed Excalibur's cores.

427
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:06,307
There should be no problem

428
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,807
re-forging those cores
into holy swords.

429
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,340
At this point, they only
have to get the alchemists

430
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:13,307
to take care of that for them.

431
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,540
Irina, you should be very proud;

432
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:19,173
you've accomplished
your mission.

433
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:20,740
Oh yes, I know.

434
00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:22,840
I just wish you
did it with me.

435
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,673
Yeah, I feel
that way, too.

436
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:26,140
Tell me why!

437
00:20:26,173 --> 00:20:28,640
Why did you let yourself
be reborn as a devil?

438
00:20:28,673 --> 00:20:29,907
And I can't understand
why the church

439
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,507
would simply accept
it like they did, too!

440
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,440
You know what you are?

441
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:39,340
You're a traitor.

442
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,673
[XENOVIA thinking] The next time
we meet, we may be enemies.

443
00:20:51,507 --> 00:20:53,640
[XENOVIA] Irina's faith
is deeper than mine.

444
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:55,407
I didn't tell her
because I didn't know

445
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,273
if she'd be able
to handle the truth.

446
00:20:57,307 --> 00:21:00,540
And, as for me, I'm now
a dangerous person

447
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:03,407
who found out the truth about
something I shouldn't have,

448
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,840
so the Church has
declared me a heretic.

449
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:07,140
They kicked you out.

450
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:08,773
That's why you
became a devil.

451
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:12,140
Yes, and Asia,
I owe you an apology.

452
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:13,140
If there is no God,

453
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:15,207
then there is no hope
of salvation or love,

454
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,873
so I am very sorry.

455
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:19,607
The things I said to you
were wrong and hurtful.

456
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,840
You may hit me if it
will make you feel better.

457
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:22,907
[ASIA] Um, no thank you.

458
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,373
[XENOVIA] For a Holy Sword user

459
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:26,307
who should be respected
to be cast out

460
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,873
for knowing the truth.

461
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:30,407
It's changed the way
I look at everything.

462
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,207
I can't get their treatment
of me out of my head.

463
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,807
I must have made you
feel the same way.

464
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,573
[ASIA] Xenovia.

465
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:38,773
Don't feel bad.

466
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:41,773
In case you couldn't tell,
I'm incredibly satisfied here.

467
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:44,440
Even though I'm
technically a devil now,

468
00:21:44,473 --> 00:21:46,373
I've never
felt more blessed.

469
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:49,273
I've met so many people
who mean so much to me.

470
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:52,740
I've never been this happy
before in my whole life.

471
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,740
I see.

472
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,740
Oh, and I had a favor
I wanted to ask of you.

473
00:21:58,773 --> 00:21:59,807
What do you want?

474
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,873
I would really
appreciate it

475
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:03,707
if you would show me
around the school sometime.

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,873
I'd love to!

477
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,807
Also, if it isn't
too big of a deal,

478
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,507
I think it would be fun to
try out my Holy Sword Durandal

479
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,907
against your Holy
Devil Sword again.

480
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,607
I was thinking
the same thing.

481
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,807
[ISSEI thinking]
I don't really get her,

482
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,540
but that doesn't mean
she's a bad person.

483
00:22:18,907 --> 00:22:20,440
Now, we've
got a new member,

484
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,673
so let's go ahead and get
the Occult Research Club

00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:24,273
back open for business!

486
00:22:24,307 --> 00:22:25,573
[EVERYONE] Yes, ma'am!

487
00:23:57,173 --> 00:23:59,507
[RIAS] I wonder which one
Issei would like the most.

488
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,407
Hey, so, what do
you think, Akeno?

489
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,307
[AKENO] I wonder.

490
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,140
Oh well, that's like a
pretty vague answer,

491
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:05,507
don't you think?

492
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,773
[AKENO] Fine then,
I think Issei

493
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:09,207
will like this kind
of bathing suit best.

494
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,373
What's going on
with you, lady?

495
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,873
You've been acting kind of
strange ever since that battle.

496
00:24:12,907 --> 00:24:16,240
No, I think your
imagination is running wild.

497
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:23,507
I should send a selfie!

498
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,373
[AKENO thinknig]
I think I will, too.
