1
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,400
[VALI] I am Vali,
White Dragon Emperor,

2
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:21,633
but you can call me
the Vanishing Dragon.

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,333
Holy crap.

4
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,600
[thinking] My left hand
is freaking out again.

5
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,000
Sure picked a
crappy time to do it.

6
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:31,066
How vulnerable you are.

7
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,233
It wouldn't take much to
defeat you with my magic.

8
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:35,700
Almost too easy.

9
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:37,066
Boosted--!

10
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,633
Don't you think this joke
has gone on long enough?

11
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,166
It wouldn't be smart for us
to allow you to start a fight

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,533
with the Red Dragon Emperor
here, now would it?

13
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:48,733
[ASIA] What's going on?

14
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,366
Asia, get back.

15
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:52,733
Is this really the best move?

16
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:56,400
If all of you fighting still
couldn't bring Kokabiel down,

17
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:58,333
you'll never beat me.

18
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:00,433
But don't take
my word for it.

19
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:03,666
Keep going if you don't
care about causing a scene.

20
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,466
[VALI] Tell me, Issei.

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,600
How do you think you compare

22
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:13,766
to those with the
power in this world?

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,700
What do you mean?

24
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:17,533
I'm talking about
your Balance Breaker.

25
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:20,133
It looks quite incomplete,
if you ask me,

26
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,666
but still a four digit ranking.

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,700
On a scale of strongest
to weakest, that is.

28
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:27,366
I'd say between
one thousandth

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,333
and fifteen hundredth or lower.

30
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:31,666
That's great.
So what's your point?

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,333
[VALI] My point is that
you're a valuable player.

32
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:37,333
You should be taken care
of and properly nurtured.

33
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:39,633
Don't you agree, Rias?

34
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,066
What the hell?

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't need your advice.

36
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:48,033
[RIAS] Mind telling me
what this is all about?

37
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,666
If you've come here on
behalf of the fallen angels,

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,433
I can assure you it's
a huge waste of time.

39
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:55,066
[VALI] Were you aware
that the Welsh Dragon

40
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,433
and the Vanishing Dragon called
upon the Twin Sky Dragons?

41
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,333
People involved with
the Red and White Dragons

42
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,266
have never had the best of luck.

43
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,500
I'm fascinated.

44
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:07,133
Makes me wonder
how your life will turn out.

45
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,100
[VALI] Calm down.

46
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,233
I didn't come here
to fight with you.

47
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,633
[VALI] I've much more
important things to do today.

48
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,633
Are you okay?

49
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:30,666
[ISSEI thinking]
Her hands are sweating.

50
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,066
She must be freaking out.

51
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:18,511
At least it's
calming down a bit.

52
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:19,778
Good thing.

53
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:23,445
I didn't want Akeno to suck the
power out of me during class.

54
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:26,245
So Vali's the
White Dragon Emperor?

55
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:28,678
Goddamn.

56
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:32,078
I gotta admit his
fighting style's impressive.

57
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,411
It's almost like
Riser's except his--

58
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:36,578
[DDRAIG] His is
the complete form.

59
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,578
[DDRAIG] Yours couldn't
even begin to compare.

60
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,411
[ISSEI] Thanks, Ddraig.

61
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:42,811
So what's going on
between the White Dragon

62
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:45,211
and the Red Dragon, exactly?

63
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:47,711
[DDRAIG] When all
the great powers--

64
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,511
God, the Angels,
the Fallen Angels,

65
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:52,345
and the Devils--were at war,

66
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:54,478
the other creatures and
humans were suddenly forced

67
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:57,678
to choose sides to
ensure their survival.

68
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:00,645
[DDRAIG] The only ones who
refused were the Dragons.

69
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:01,611
[ISSEI] Why?

70
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:02,811
[DDRAIG] The majority
didn't think the war

71
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,645
had anything to do with them.

72
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:07,211
They ignored it and
lived how they pleased.

73
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:09,111
However, in the
midst of the war,

74
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:12,545
two foolish dragons decided
to start a massive fight.

75
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,345
Are you saying
what I think you are?

76
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:17,078
[DDRAIG] Not caring
about the great war

77
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,811
that had taken over the world,

78
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:21,545
they fought wildly
on the battlefield.

79
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:22,378
I don't get it.

80
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:24,178
Why were they
fighting like that?

81
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,278
[DDRAIG sighs] Hell if I know.

82
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:28,578
They probably don't remember
the reason themselves.

83
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,711
Okay I'm
already over this story.

84
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:32,111
[DDRAIG] It gets better.

85
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:34,178
Unless something was
done about those two,

86
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:36,445
the war wouldn't
be able to continue.

87
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:38,711
The three great powers
called a temporary truce

88
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:41,111
in order to deal
with the rebel dragons.

89
00:05:41,145 --> 00:05:43,645
That makes it sound like
it was more than just a fight.

90
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:46,578
What happened after
they were stopped?

91
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:47,845
[DDRAIG] Fury.

92
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:50,611
Their anger became
wild beyond imagination.

93
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:51,845
They lashed
out at the leaders

94
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:55,411
of the angels, devils,
and fallen angels.

95
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:57,078
They didn't like
anyone--not even God

96
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:59,745
or the Devil King--interfering
with their battle.

97
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:02,478
It was payback,
plain and simple.

98
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:03,811
[ISSEI] I wouldn't
want to mess with them.

99
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:05,678
Dragons are nuts!

100
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:09,078
[DDRAIG] Our story
doesn't end there.

101
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:12,278
The Dragons ended up getting
diced into thousands of pieces,

102
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:13,711
and their wicked
souls were sealed

103
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:16,778
within humans as Sacred Gears.

104
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:19,211
[DDRAIG] From that day on,
those same Dragons

105
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,211
have used humans
as intermediaries

106
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:25,111
to meet and fight,
over and over again.

107
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:27,311
Let me take a wild guess.

108
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,845
Those two dragons are
called Ddraig and Albion.

109
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:30,678
[DDRAIG]
I've been wondering

110
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:32,678
when we would
finally meet again.

111
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:36,245
[ALBION] As have I.
We are still fated to fight.

112
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:38,145
It is inevitable.

113
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:40,745
I think I know where
you're going with this now.

114
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:42,645
[DDRAIG] There have been
times where the human host

115
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:46,378
has died before the two
have had a chance to meet.

116
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:48,811
[ISSEI] And since I'm alive
and I've met the other Dragon,

117
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:51,611
I have no choice but
to help you fight him!

118
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,378
Well, even if it is my fate,

119
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,345
I'm a low-rent
devil and a loser.

120
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:58,211
There's no way I'd be able
to take on someone like him.

121
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:01,078
Damn.

122
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:04,345
[thinking]
Screw this fate shit, man.

123
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:06,578
I'm not going to
let that stop me!

124
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:10,078
I said I'd be Harem King
someday and damn it, I will!

125
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:13,478
Issei, you bastard!

126
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:16,311
[MATSUDA] Everyone knows
what you did, punk.

127
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:17,745
[MOTOHAMA] Somehow you
got that Xenovia chick

128
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:19,778
to join the Occult
Research Club!

129
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:22,611
I'm tired of cool stuff
happening to you all the time!

130
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:24,278
Remember that
time you hit me?

131
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,478
What was that about?

132
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,311
You asked for it.

133
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,745
Look at all these
super-hot girls

134
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:29,711
who get all excited
whenever you're around.

135
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:31,611
Yeah, you're supposed
to have my back, Bro!

136
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:32,811
Why you gotta
play me like that?

137
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:33,645
Like what?

138
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:34,411
Don't even.

139
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:36,178
Both of you shut up.

140
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:37,711
I just want to
know about Xenovia.

141
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:40,045
You haven't hooked up
with her yet, have you?

142
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,078
Of course not,
have at it.

143
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:43,845
[XENOVIA] At what?

144
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:45,078
[ISSEI] Oh hey! What's up?

145
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,345
I'm sorry about
the other day.

146
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:48,745
I didn't mean to spring that on
you when you weren't prepared.

147
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,811
[ISSEI] Oh, right. It's cool.

148
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,611
But let's not
talk about this here.

149
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:54,711
I brought you something.

150
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:56,711
Keep these with you
for the next time.

151
00:07:56,745 --> 00:07:58,811
[ISSEI] Are you crazy?
[MATSUDA and MOTOHAMA] Damn it!

152
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,345
Hi guys. Oh,
those are pretty.

153
00:08:02,378 --> 00:08:04,145
Here, you should
probably take one, too.

154
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:05,711
Oh thanks.

155
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:09,511
[ASIA] But what are you
supposed to do with it?

156
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:11,578
Looks like Issei's
throwing a party later.

157
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:12,278
Where's it at?

158
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:13,245
This has nothing
to do with me.

159
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:16,345
Hey, do you have any
idea what these are for?

160
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:18,111
[KIRYUU] You use it when
you're doing The Naughty

161
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:20,311
and you don't want
to have random babies.

162
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:22,478
[ISSEI]
All right, that's enough!

163
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:23,611
Asia isn't interested!

164
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:25,178
[KIRYUU] Uh, are you sure?

165
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:25,578
[ISSEI] Huh?

166
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:26,511
Nice retort.

167
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:28,278
I think she'd be
very interested to know

168
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,378
what you're planning
to do with Xenovia.

169
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:30,445
No, it's okay!

170
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:31,445
If he doesn't want to tell me,
I don't want to know!

171
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:32,845
You dick!

172
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:35,445
Oh no, please
don't hurt him!

173
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:37,178
No one's hurt.

174
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:38,311
[ASIA] Please don't hurt Issei.

175
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:39,645
He's a good guy.

176
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:41,478
I promise he means well.

177
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:44,078
Thanks for
being there for me.

178
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:45,711
I think you're
the only one who is.

179
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:48,311
Of course I am,
I always will be.

180
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:50,211
I'm here for you no matter what.

181
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:51,211
[ISSEI] Wow. Thanks.

182
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:52,511
Hey, Issei.

183
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:53,445
[ISSEI] Wha--?

184
00:08:53,478 --> 00:08:54,511
You ready?

185
00:08:54,545 --> 00:08:56,511
Let's go make intercourse.

186
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:58,411
No, I'm not!

187
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:03,111
What the hell has
gotten into Xenovia?

188
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:05,211
Someone ate a
Crazy Sandwich today.

189
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,378
[RIAS] Hello, Issei.

190
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:09,378
[ISSEI] Oh, hey ladies.
What's up?

191
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:10,678
How's your arm feeling?

192
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:11,678
[ISSEI] Awesome!

193
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:14,145
It went back to normal
after I rested a bit.

194
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,178
I hear you met the
White Dragon Emperor.

195
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:18,211
Yeah. I guess he just
wanted to come here

196
00:09:18,245 --> 00:09:20,111
and check out the
sights or something?

197
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:21,211
[SONA] Seriously?

198
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:23,411
I doubt he has
time for sight-seeing.

199
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:25,345
He seems to be working
for the Fallen Angels

200
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:26,678
so I don't think
we have to worry

201
00:09:26,711 --> 00:09:29,245
about him making rash decisions.

202
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,545
Regardless of
his intentions,

203
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:32,645
I don't want him on
the school grounds.

204
00:09:32,678 --> 00:09:34,278
Me either.

205
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:35,145
Especially since we'll have

206
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:37,778
a much bigger problem
to deal with soon.

207
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,745
Good. We agree.
Talk to you later.

208
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:43,778
[RIAS] All right.
Take care of yourself.

209
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:46,478
Those two seem
a little depressed.

210
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:48,211
Did something happen or--?

211
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,611
No, nothing specifically.

212
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:51,778
They're just a little
stressed out about Open House.

213
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:54,311
Open House? But why?

214
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,311
I mean, I totally get
why Rias is freaked,

215
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,711
but why Sona?

216
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:02,645
Looks like you're
feeling better.

217
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:05,578
I'd say your arm healed up
quite nicely now, didn't it?

218
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:06,745
Uh, yeah.

219
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:08,811
I guess it wasn't really
that big of a deal.

220
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:11,178
Aw, that's unfortunate.

221
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,811
I was hoping there
was still energy left in it.

222
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:18,145
Sucking those juices out
of you was good for me, too.

223
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:23,445
[RIAS] Akeno!

224
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,078
You startled me.

225
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:32,411
[RIAS] Obviously you
two can't be left alone.

226
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:33,778
[AKENO] I was just
checking on Issei

227
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:35,778
to see if he needed anything.

228
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:37,211
[RIAS] Sure you were.

229
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:51,308
[thinking] Azazel and the
White Dragon Emperor, Vali, huh?

230
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:52,908
Just great,
it's like all the guys

231
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:54,842
I don't want hanging around me.

232
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:56,742
Crap, I'm sorry!

233
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:57,375
Oh, Issei?

234
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,408
[RIAS] Oh, Issei.

235
00:10:58,442 --> 00:10:59,742
Rias, it's you!

236
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:01,275
Were you
gonna take a bath?

237
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:03,142
[ISSEI] Uh, no.

238
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:04,842
[RIAS] Asia's in here, too?

239
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,108
Oh, hi.

240
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,775
I don't want to have
to wait for both of you.

241
00:11:08,808 --> 00:11:11,142
Why don't we just
take a bath together?

242
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:14,742
[RIAS] Asia, you
have beautiful skin.

243
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,075
[ASIA] Really, you think so?

244
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,042
I always thought
your skin was whiter

245
00:11:18,075 --> 00:11:21,408
and smoother than practically
anyone I've ever met.

246
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:24,275
[RIAS] Well, that's
nice of you to say.

247
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:26,742
[ISSEI thinking] What kind
of world am I living in?

248
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,708
Not that I'm complaining!

249
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:30,142
Damnit, I want
to look straight on

250
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,308
and save it in my brain,

251
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,675
but if I look straight on
at such a provocative scene,

252
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,275
I'll dirty the bathroom
with my nosebleed,

253
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:37,408
and that won't be good either!

254
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,442
Whaddaya want?

255
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:43,442
Nothing it's just
that I've always wanted

256
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:45,275
to take a bath in
here like this with you.

257
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:47,308
Are you like
being for real?

258
00:11:47,342 --> 00:11:50,042
[thinking] This is so fucking
intense, my brain can't keep up!

259
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,008
What's wrong, Issei?

260
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:53,442
Don't you like taking
a hot bath with me?

261
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:54,775
[ISSEI] Oh no! I do!

262
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:57,208
It's the best thing ever,
like ever ever.

263
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:58,075
[RIAS] Good.

264
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,942
Just hearing that
makes me so happy.

265
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:03,708
I want to take a bath
with you like this every day,

266
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:05,375
but I don't think
your body can take it,

267
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:07,708
so how about once
every three days?

268
00:12:07,742 --> 00:12:10,275
Or maybe once every five days?

269
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:12,908
Once a week just
isn't enough, though;

270
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,275
I want you more than that.

271
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:16,108
Whoa, too hot!

272
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:17,708
[thinking] Damnit, we
can't do anything dirty

273
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:20,675
because Asia's here.

274
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,775
If only I had
more courage,

275
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:24,275
I could take her on,
here and now.

276
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:27,108
Wanna piece of me?

277
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:30,775
I wonder if you would've
come after me already

278
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:32,408
if Asia wasn't around.

279
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:33,942
It should be just us two.

280
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:34,842
[ASIA] No way!

281
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,108
I don't want to be left out!

282
00:12:36,142 --> 00:12:37,242
It's not fair;

283
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:39,442
I think I should be able
to take a bath with you, too!

284
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:40,308
Listen, Asia!

285
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,875
Since I have the chance,
let me be clear.

286
00:12:42,908 --> 00:12:44,408
Issei belongs to me.

287
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:47,675
The child is part of my
household as well as my servant.

288
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,008
He's my Issei!

289
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,275
Do you understand?

290
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:51,742
[ASIA] What you
say might be true,

291
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:54,175
but that doesn't mean
he's not my Issei, too!

292
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,308
[RIAS] Asia.

293
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,375
Issei dotes on you every day.

294
00:12:57,408 --> 00:13:00,075
You should be more giving
of him during times like this.

295
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:01,875
[ASIA] But I don't want to!

296
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:04,342
Trust me, as it is,
I'm already holding back

297
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,842
a lot on how much
I want him to dote on me.

298
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,708
[RIAS] Come on Asia,
like you could do this?

299
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,742
[ASIA] Yeah,
I can do that all day!

300
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:15,708
[ISSEI] Wait! You too, Asia?

301
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:16,875
I have a question.

302
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:18,842
Do you like me or Rias better?

303
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,408
Now, tell the truth, Issei!

304
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:23,208
I know I might be smaller in
size, especially in the bust,

305
00:13:23,242 --> 00:13:24,775
but I won't lose
at anything else!

306
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:25,842
I promise!

307
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:26,808
Oh dear.

308
00:13:26,842 --> 00:13:29,208
Issei's favorite thing
ever is big bosoms.

309
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,975
In fact, he never
stops telling me

310
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:33,075
how much he loves my huge chest.

311
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:34,008
Isn't that right, Issei?

312
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,708
[ASIA] No! That's
not true, is it, Issei?

313
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:37,342
[RIAS] Issei?

314
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,442
[ASIA] Issei?

315
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:39,942
[RIAS] Hey, Issei!

316
00:13:39,975 --> 00:13:40,942
[ASIA]
Issei, what's wrong?

317
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:42,942
Get a hold of yourself!

318
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:48,775
[MALE TEACHER 8A] On your
desks you'll see a lump of clay.

319
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:51,008
Your assignment is to
create something original.

320
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:52,075
It can be whatever you want

321
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:54,408
as long as it's
meaningful to you.

322
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:56,408
We all see life and
situations differently.

323
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:59,142
It's the same with every day
conversations we may have.

324
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:00,342
We use the same words;

325
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,942
but it's our personal expression
that defines the thought.

326
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:05,842
[ISSEI] Something
meaningful to me, huh?

327
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,175
[MOTHER] We're so
proud of you, Asia!

328
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,675
Look over here and
smile for the camera!

329
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,875
What the hell are
they doing here?

330
00:14:12,908 --> 00:14:14,742
Man, this is awkward.

331
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:17,708
Rice balls.

332
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,608
Oh great.

333
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,342
I'm the only one
who hasn't started yet.

334
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,908
[ISSEI thinking] I don't
know what to make.

335
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:25,942
Something meaningful to me.

336
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:29,675
Hm. It can be real as
long as I think it's special.

337
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:32,308
[ISSEI] What could that be?

338
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:34,808
[RIAS] Hello, Issei.

339
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:37,875
[ISSEI thinking]
Rias's body!

340
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:39,742
Those perfect
lumps of sexy time,

341
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:43,742
that nearly microscopic waist,
'dat ass, 'dem thighs!

342
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:49,008
I could sculpt it all in vanilla
pudding with my eyes closed!

343
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:50,808
Pudding.

344
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:52,942
[MALE TEACHER 8A] Ahem! Issei!

345
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,175
[ISSEI] I'm here!

346
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:57,242
[KATASE] Holy crap;
it's a gray Rias.

347
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,308
[MURAYAMA] Amazing.
It looks just like her.

348
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:01,108
[MALE TEACHER 8A]
You've been holding out on us!

349
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:03,908
I didn't realize we had
a sculptor in the class!

350
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:05,742
[ISSEI] Oh we don't,
really-- I just, um--

351
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:07,142
It was an accident!

352
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,408
[KIRYUU] You must
be feeling her up

353
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,975
so much that you have
her body memorized!

354
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:13,975
I don't believe
anyone was talking to you!

355
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:15,675
[MATSUDA] I knew he
was creepin' with her!

356
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,875
[MOTOHAMA]
What do they feel like?

357
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:17,908
You're such a pervert!

358
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:18,842
I don't know why Rias

359
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,275
would mess around
with a freak like you!

360
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:21,242
Check it out, man.

361
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:23,408
That thing is obviously
stressin' ya big time.

362
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:23,942
Let's trade.

363
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:24,875
Don't do it, Issea!

364
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:25,875
I'll give you half
my allowance for a week!

365
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:28,242
I'll give you half
my allowance for a month!

366
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,975
Rias's body isn't property
to be sold, you guys!

367
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:32,942
Look how
talented our son is!

368
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,242
And to think,
I always thought of him

369
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:36,275
as a total loser whose
only skill was coming up

370
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:37,408
with unique and creative ways

371
00:15:37,442 --> 00:15:39,008
to describe women's breasts!

372
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:41,342
I can't believe how wrong
I was about everything.

373
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,342
Huh?

374
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,042
I mean about Open House.

375
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:47,108
I never imagined it would
actually be this entertaining.

376
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:50,675
Yeah, I guess if you're
into people arguing.

377
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,775
I hate it here.

378
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:56,742
[RIAS] It is very well made.

379
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:57,975
[AKENO] Oh my!

380
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:00,275
Well I guess I shouldn't be
surprised considering the fact

381
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:03,308
that you're groping on
Rias's body every day, right?

382
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:06,175
[ISSEI] Believe me,
it's not every day!

383
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,342
And because of that,

384
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,808
I've been forced to carve
the image deep into my mind!

385
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:12,308
In that case, I'd love it
if you'd make one of me, too!

386
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:12,975
What?

387
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:14,108
You mean while you're naked?

388
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:15,275
Without any clothes on?

389
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,342
I want it to be
extremely accurate.

390
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,142
You may have to touch
to learn my curves.

391
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:20,675
You mean with my hands?

392
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,942
[AKENO echo] You may
have to touch me.

393
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:24,742
You may have to touch me.

394
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,808
You may have to touch me.

395
00:16:25,842 --> 00:16:26,708
[ISSEI] I may have to touch her!

396
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:27,542
I didn't know there
was a magic phrase

397
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:29,275
that would make
me feel so creative!

398
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:30,442
When do we start?

399
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:31,442
[RIAS and ASIA] You don't.

400
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:32,775
[ISSEI] Just kidding. I can't.

401
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:33,675
[MOTOHAMA] Aw, no way!

402
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,675
A MagiGirl photo shoot?

403
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:36,875
[MATSUDA] Come on!

404
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:37,808
As former photography
club members,

405
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:40,375
we gotta represent
and record this thing!

406
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:41,242
[ISSEI] MagiGirl?

407
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:42,242
It can't be!

408
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:43,842
Or can it?

409
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:45,742
[MOTOHAMA] You can do it!

410
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:47,142
Just put your back into it!

411
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:48,408
[MATSUDA] Ooh girl,
watch yourself!

412
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,008
Show me what
you're workin' with!

413
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:53,908
[ISSEI] What the what?

414
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:55,175
[ISSEI] Am I awake?

415
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,108
Is that a Magical
Girl Milky Spiral Seven,

416
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,142
Alternative cosplay?

417
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,942
[ASIA] Issei, how do you
know about that costume?

418
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:06,075
Because I watched the
whole show in one sitting.

419
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,708
A friend of mine was obsessed

420
00:17:07,742 --> 00:17:09,908
with it and insisted
we do a marathon.

421
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,875
Sounds fun. Which friend?

422
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:13,742
[SAJI] Knock it off!

423
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:15,842
We are still on
school property!

424
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,742
You've seen enough of this!

425
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:19,342
[MOTOHAMA] Dude!
You're blocking my shot!

426
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,975
[MATSUDA] It's just
a frikkin' photo shoot!

427
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:21,975
[MALE STUDENTS]
Move out of the way!

428
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:22,875
[SAJI] We don't need this kind

429
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,808
of commotion on the
day of Open House!

430
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:25,675
Get out of here!

431
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,608
[MALE STUDENT 8A]
That's not right!

432
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:28,742
[MALE STUDENT 8B]
See you later, Milky!

433
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:29,675
All right.

434
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,942
Are you related to
someone at this school?

435
00:17:31,975 --> 00:17:33,175
Okay, well,
they should've told you

436
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,942
that this sort of outfit
is unacceptable here.

437
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:41,208
[LEVIATHAN] Sparkle,
shine, your command is mine!

438
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,908
You have to stop that.

439
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:45,808
[ISSEI] Well, well.

440
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:47,675
Hard at work as usual, huh?

441
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,842
[SAJI] I don't have
time for you.

442
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,408
[SONA] Saji!
What's going on here?

443
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:53,742
Oh hey, Sona.

444
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:54,342
This girl says--

445
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,375
I finally found you, Sona!

446
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,342
[ISSEI] Who's that?

447
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,342
[SAJI thinking] Sona knows her?

448
00:18:04,408 --> 00:18:06,142
I'm so happy to see you!

449
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:08,275
What's the matter? You look sad?

450
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:10,275
Your face is all red.

451
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:13,875
Aren't you excited to finally
be seeing your big sister again?

452
00:18:13,908 --> 00:18:15,842
I'm gonna require a lot
more happiness from you!

453
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:16,942
Come on!

454
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:17,775
You should run into my arms

455
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:18,842
and tell me how
much you missed me!

456
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,908
And then I'll say,
"oh Sona, I've missed you too!"

457
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:21,575
And I'll give you a big fat kiss

458
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:22,542
and then you'd kiss me back

459
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:23,175
and that would lead
to girl on girl action

460
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,642
and wouldn't that be hot?

461
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:28,942
She has a sister?

462
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,175
That is the
Lady Serafall Leviathan.

463
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,142
"The Lady" who?

464
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:34,875
She's currently one
of the four Devil Kings.

465
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:37,275
I'd always heard things
about Sona's sister.

466
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:38,208
But I didn't recognize her

467
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,242
since this is the
first time we've met.

468
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:42,142
Your line's next.

469
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:43,808
This is the part where
you say how long it's been

470
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:45,942
and how excited
you are to see me.

471
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:48,242
It's been quite a long
time, Lady Leviathan.

472
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:50,808
Oh, yes it has. Rias.

473
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:52,708
How excited are you to see me?

474
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:55,142
Very. Thank you for asking.

475
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,675
Did you come here to
visit Sona for Open House?

476
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,642
Yeah!

477
00:18:58,675 --> 00:19:00,442
But I had to find out
about it on my own!

478
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:02,708
Sona's a meanie
and didn't tell me!

479
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,442
I was so mad when
I found out the truth.

480
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:07,808
I almost attacked
Heaven out of frustration!

481
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:08,708
What am I missing?

482
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:11,075
Is she still talking
about Open House?

483
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:13,308
Hey look!

484
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:15,742
Is he the guy who's
supposed to be the Dragon?

485
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:17,275
He is. Issei!

486
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:18,708
I want you to meet someone.

487
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,208
Uh, sure.

488
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:21,575
I'm Issei.

489
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,108
It's nice to meet you!

490
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:26,175
I'm a pawn in the
service of Rias Gremory!

491
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,675
I can see that!

492
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,375
And I'm the Devil King,
Serafall Leviathan!

493
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,075
But you can call
me Little Levia!

494
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:40,942
[ISSEI] Uh. Cool.

495
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:42,042
[SONA] Listen to me.

496
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:45,708
I am responsible for the
entire student council here.

497
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:47,075
Even if you are family,

498
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:49,208
this is inappropriate
school attire.

499
00:19:49,242 --> 00:19:50,775
You're going to have to change!

500
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:52,442
[LEVIATHAN] Why do you
have to be like that?

501
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:54,808
Can you hear the tone
of your voice right now?

502
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:56,975
You're borderline violent!

503
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:58,808
You know that I've never
asked for anything!

504
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:01,008
All I want is to
be a Magical Girl!

505
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:01,875
You know, I feel like

506
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,908
I've heard this
line somewhere before.

507
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:08,042
With my sparkling staff,

508
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:09,108
I will do my duty

509
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,442
and obliterate all the
angels and fallen angels!

510
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:13,342
Do you have
any respect at all?

511
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,408
If you start sparkling,

512
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:17,142
you could annihilate a
small country in minutes.

513
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,075
I just had a thought.

514
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:20,875
Why didn't Sona mention
her to us earlier?

515
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:22,142
Like when Kokabiel attacked,

516
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:24,108
you think she would've,
like, needed her help.

517
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:25,408
Is it because they
don't get along?

518
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,442
[AKENO] No, it's the opposite.

519
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:28,575
[AKENO] The problem is actually

520
00:20:28,608 --> 00:20:31,675
that Lady Serafall loves
her sister a little too much.

521
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,242
Some would say she's obsessed.

522
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,708
Sona could've
asked for help.

523
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:36,808
But it would've
gotten out of control.

524
00:20:36,842 --> 00:20:38,708
[SAJI] Also, if she found
out her baby sister had been

525
00:20:38,742 --> 00:20:40,342
violated by a fallen angel,

526
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,375
she would've started
a war right then.

527
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,675
Ahh! I can't take it anymore!

528
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,875
[LEVIATHAN] Sona, wait!
Don't leave!

529
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:47,742
[SONA] Stay away from me!

530
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:49,342
Looks like Sona's
going to need my help.

531
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,842
I'll talk to you later.

532
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,675
I hear ya.
Check ya later!

533
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,042
Saji's headed for
a rough time, isn't he?

534
00:20:56,075 --> 00:20:58,675
It's not really
my place to say, Asia.

535
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,808
But yes, he is.

536
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,442
All the devil kings
are like this.

537
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:03,442
He's got his work
cut out for him.

538
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:04,942
[ISSEI] What do
you mean 'like this?'

539
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:07,408
[RIAS] High strung
and excitable.

540
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:09,408
It can be exhausting.

541
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:17,317
[FATHER] Ahoy there, Issei!

542
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,850
Hey Dad.

543
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:19,850
[LORD GREMORY] There you are!

544
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:21,450
I've been looking for you, Rias.

545
00:21:21,484 --> 00:21:22,450
Hello, Father.

546
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:25,350
What? Rias has a dad?

547
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,317
But he's so young!

548
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,984
[LORD GREMORY]
You must be Issei.

549
00:21:29,017 --> 00:21:30,717
I'm Rias's father.

550
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,750
Thank you for taking
care of my daughter.

551
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:34,217
[ISSEI] Hi. Nice to meet you.

552
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,284
What's going on?

553
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:37,650
[FATHER] Your mom and
I ran into him in the hallway.

554
00:21:37,684 --> 00:21:38,517
And here we are,

555
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,984
still talking to
each other in a hallway.

556
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:41,950
Why don't we go
back to the house

557
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:43,450
where there's room to sit?

558
00:21:43,484 --> 00:21:45,350
That sounds like
a wonderful idea!

559
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:46,850
[gasps]

560
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:48,350
[FATHER] Great!
Then it's settled!

561
00:21:48,384 --> 00:21:49,484
We'll head on over!

562
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,617
Should I stop by the store
and grab us some whiskey?

563
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,584
[LORD GREMORY] Please!

564
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:54,584
Whiskey?

565
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:57,350
So dad's gonna get faced
with Rias's dad, huh?

566
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,250
He doesn't realize
who he actually is.

567
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,817
[SIR ZECHS laughs]
That's brilliant.

568
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,217
Why are you laughing?

569
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,584
It looks
like we're having

570
00:22:04,617 --> 00:22:07,317
a family slumber party
with Father tonight.

571
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,650
[sighs]

572
00:22:09,684 --> 00:22:11,317
[LORD GREMORY] This is splendid!

573
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,784
[SIR ZECHS]
Everything looks delicious.

574
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:14,350
[MOTHER] It's like I told Rei:

575
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:16,817
if you can't cook big,
then go home!

576
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,417
[FATHER] Let's raise a
glass to our new friend!

577
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,917
Cheers!

578
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:24,684
[MOTHER] Watch her face
when she notices the camera!

579
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:26,317
[ASIA] I'm so embarrassed.

580
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,617
Issei, why do you
always look like

581
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,850
you ate a sour lemon
when we film you?

582
00:22:29,884 --> 00:22:32,250
After this, I'd love
to show you Rias's.

583
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,384
You got video, too?

584
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:34,517
Let's see it!

585
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,350
[ISSEI] It's Rias in class!

586
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:38,284
[LORD GREMORY] The way I see it,

587
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:39,417
it's part of a father's duty

588
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,350
to embarrass his
daughter at school.

589
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:43,850
I feel like I'm in the
lowest level of Hell right now.

590
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:44,984
[SIR ZECHS] Isn't that sweet?

591
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:47,384
Our little Ri-Ri is answering
the teacher's question!

592
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:49,784
Oh and she got it right!

593
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:51,217
I've had about
enough of this!

594
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,417
I'll be in my room. Stupid jerk!

595
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:53,817
Rias!

596
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,984
[laughter]

597
00:22:56,017 --> 00:22:57,617
[MOTHER] It's too true!

598
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,117
[MOTHER] Here you go.

599
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,317
[LORD GREMORY] Oh, thank you.

600
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:06,350
[ISSEI] Um. Rias?

601
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,284
[ISSEI] Do you want to
come hang out in my room?

602
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:24,650
[ISSEI] So uh--
I know it's awkward

603
00:23:24,684 --> 00:23:25,650
with the videos and stuff;

604
00:23:25,684 --> 00:23:27,784
and your brother's being
kind of a douche-canoe,

605
00:23:27,817 --> 00:23:29,617
but I don't think it's
necessarily a bad thing

606
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,784
that our parents met and
are getting along, ya know?

607
00:23:31,817 --> 00:23:34,184
[RIAS] No, I know it's not.

608
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:36,784
[RIAS] Can I ask you something?

609
00:23:36,817 --> 00:23:37,917
[ISSEI] Of course.

610
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,217
[RIAS] Be honest.

611
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,317
Are you glad that you met me?

612
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:45,550
[RIAS] I'm very happy here.

613
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:46,717
[ISSEI] It's been an honor!

614
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,917
[ISSEI] I mean, yeah!

615
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,984
I'm glad that I met you!

616
00:23:49,017 --> 00:23:50,817
And I'm glad that you're here!

617
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,584
[ISSEI] But--

618
00:23:52,617 --> 00:23:53,850
[RIAS] But what?

619
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:55,950
[ISSEI] Nothing. Never mind.

620
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,450
[ISSEI] She's gonna
end up with someone else.

621
00:24:00,484 --> 00:24:02,750
I don't think
I can deal with that.

622
00:24:13,717 --> 00:24:14,717
I knew it! It's not fair!

623
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,217
You're always with her!

624
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,417
I made the first move,

625
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,817
and the first strike starts the
war--that's what Akeno says.

626
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,850
[ASIA] Well I say the
second strike starts the war!

627
00:24:23,884 --> 00:24:25,350
What do you
mean by that?

628
00:24:25,384 --> 00:24:26,250
[SIR ZECHS] It's a bad idea.

629
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:27,617
Fights are never good.

630
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,317
How long have
you been there?

631
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,517
[SIR ZECHS] Long enough.

632
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,550
There's something I've been
meaning to discuss with you.

633
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:33,717
[RIAS] Go ahead.

634
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,284
All right.

635
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:36,217
I was thinking that it might be

636
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,750
about time to release
the other Bishop.

637
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:41,784
What is he
talking about, Rias?

638
00:24:41,817 --> 00:24:44,617
Hard to imagine Asia's
powers could be matched.

639
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,217
[RIAS] The Bishop's
gifts were dangerous.

640
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,950
So they were sealed away

641
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:50,650
because I wasn't strong
enough to handle them.

642
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:52,650
Dangerous how?
What does that mean?

643
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:55,650
You're the one who organized
all this; aren't you?

644
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:56,984
Guilty as charged.

645
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:58,884
Rest assured,
after observing the fight

646
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:02,284
with Phoenix and Kokabiel,
I've reconsidered.

647
00:25:02,317 --> 00:25:03,450
Then why?

648
00:25:03,484 --> 00:25:05,850
There are a lot more
pieces to work with,

649
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:08,550
and you're stronger now
than you've ever been.

650
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:11,384
I am more than confident
that the time is right.

651
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:13,284
Release the
Bishop, Rias.

652
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,950
[RIAS] If you-- I mean, yes,

653
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:18,717
if the Great Devil
Lucifer orders it done.

654
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,417
[ISSEI] Yo, Issei here!

655
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,317
I'm about to get
another underclassman.

656
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,450
And she's a cute little
girl who's a shut-in!

657
00:27:03,484 --> 00:27:07,584
Wha--? Girl? Huh?
Wa--? Seriously?

658
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:10,350
Next time,
"I Have a Junior!"

659
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:11,650
Dude, I don't have nips!
