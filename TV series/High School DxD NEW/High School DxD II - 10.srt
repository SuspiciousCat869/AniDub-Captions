1
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,733
[ISSEI thinking] This guy
is Heaven's head-honcho?

2
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:38,266
Wait. If he's such a big deal,
what's he doing here--?

3
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:40,033
[ISSEI thinking]
What the hell?

4
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:42,266
It feels like my
skin is crawling.

5
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,566
And I don't think
Blondie's causing it.

6
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,100
[MICHAEL] Behold, young pervert.

7
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,266
[ISSEI] C'mon, man!

8
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,733
[MICHAEL] This is Ascalon.

9
00:00:56,766 --> 00:01:00,366
This Holy sword has
also earned another name.

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,200
Dragon Slayer.

11
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,238
[ISSEI] Wow. Helluva nickname.

12
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:40,405
[MICHAEL] It is a name the
sword's previous wielders

13
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:42,472
quite capably earned.

14
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:45,705
Many dragons fell to the power
contained in this blade.

15
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:48,172
That would explain
why I was feeling on edge.

16
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:49,505
Fear not, Issei Hyodo,

17
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:52,705
for this weapon was
sent unto you from on high.

18
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:54,138
Dude. For real?

19
00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:55,405
[MICHAEL] For real indeed.

20
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:56,705
In the hope that you
might assimilate it

21
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:58,638
into your Boosted Gear.

22
00:03:00,338 --> 00:03:01,405
I've heard
your reputation

23
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:03,105
as the weakest host in history,

24
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:04,872
and hope the might of
Ascalon will give you

25
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:08,172
the necessary strength
in times of tribulation.

26
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:09,638
History's weakest?

27
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:12,538
Well, it's totally not for
lack of trying, Your Angelness.

28
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:14,772
It still really sucks
to hear it though.

29
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:16,738
But why would you give it to me?

30
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:17,838
Hear me, child.

31
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:21,305
The time has come for
all of us to work together.

32
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:22,738
Or die trying.

33
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:24,838
The Great War ended
large scale fighting,

34
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:28,538
but, as you know, we still
have small skirmishes.

35
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:32,105
So you'd call that
a small skirmish?

36
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:34,438
[MICHAEL] If this
is allowed to continue,

37
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:37,305
all will be brought to ruin.

38
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:39,272
It is entirely possible
a different power

39
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:41,638
may attack us in
all of the confusion.

40
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:43,538
A different power?
Like what?

41
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:45,205
[MICHAEL] There are more
things in Heaven and Earth,

42
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:47,572
than are dreamt of
in our philosophy.

43
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:49,338
And this upcoming
summit will provide us

44
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:50,872
with a great opportunity.

45
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:53,572
Uh? For what?

46
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:56,405
For the Three Great Powers
to forge an alliance.

47
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:58,872
To put an end to years
of senseless fighting.

48
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,805
[ISSEI] Stop the fighting?

49
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:03,105
It would not be
the first time.

50
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:07,405
Long ago, we all came
together and fought as one.

51
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:09,372
We had to end
the destruction caused

52
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:11,838
by the red and
white dragons' battle.

53
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:15,505
[MICHAEL] I beseech you,
O Red Dragon Emperor.

54
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:16,505
Please.

55
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:20,138
Help align the goals of
the Three Great Powers.

56
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:23,172
Now, Issei.

57
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:25,438
This is the part where
you accept his gift.

58
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:26,438
Oh right!

59
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:29,472
If it'll help out,
then yeah, sure, totally.

60
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:37,772
Assimilating
a Holy Sword?

61
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:40,572
I mean, is that even possible?

62
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:43,238
[DDRAIG] The Sacred Gear
follows the wants of its host.

63
00:04:43,272 --> 00:04:47,138
If that is what you desire,
it can totes be done.

64
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:49,572
Then let's get it done, Ddraig.

65
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:55,872
[DDRAIG] All right then!

66
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:59,505
Focus all your thoughts
on the Sacred Gear.

67
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:01,405
[ISSEI] Done!

68
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:06,272
[DDRAIG] Match your
wavelength to the sword!

69
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:18,772
[ISSEI screams]

70
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:24,805
They merged, incredible!

71
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:27,338
[MICHAEL] I have done
what I set out to do.

72
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:30,105
And now I will
take my leave.

73
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:31,205
No, hold on!

74
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:32,272
Before you go,

75
00:05:32,305 --> 00:05:34,205
there was something I
really wanted to ask you.

76
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:37,238
My apologies, but I
haven't the time, child.

77
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:38,305
I'll gladly hear you out.

78
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,605
When next our paths cross.

79
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:42,438
Promise me you
won't forget, okay?

80
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:44,372
Yes. You have my word.

81
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:46,105
Farewell, Issei.

82
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:00,238
[ISSEI] So.

83
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:01,705
You came to this temple
with him to do magic

84
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:03,805
or whatever on the sword?

85
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:04,772
[AKENO] Yes.

86
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:06,272
We conducted a ceremony here

87
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:09,272
that tailored Ascalon's
specifications to you.

88
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:12,238
[ISSEI] Wow, cool, thanks a lot.

89
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,705
Akeno, can I ask
about the other day?

90
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:16,372
What about
the other day?

91
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:19,472
When we were
fighting Kokabiel,

92
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,805
he said something to you.

93
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:23,972
[KOKABIEL] Could it be she

94
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:26,572
who possesses the power of
Barkiel is trying to fight?

95
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:28,172
[AKENO] Don't speak his name.

96
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,838
I am nothing like that creature!

97
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:35,138
That name he said.

98
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:36,738
Who's this Barkiel?

99
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:40,172
[AKENO] My father. That's right.

100
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:41,205
I'm the half-breed daughter

101
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:45,105
of the fallen angel leader
Barkiel and a human.

102
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,172
[AKENO] My mother was
a young shrine maiden.

103
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:51,672
One day she found
a wounded fallen angel,

104
00:06:51,705 --> 00:06:54,205
and nursed him back to health.

105
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:56,338
She did her job well.

106
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:58,372
They fell in love.

107
00:06:58,405 --> 00:07:00,772
And soon enough, I came along.

108
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:05,572
[ISSEI] I'm such an idiot.

109
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:08,172
I should mind my own business.

110
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:16,338
[ISSEI] Those wings!

111
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:18,372
[AKENO] Yes. I know.

112
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,338
One from an angel,
and the other from a devil.

113
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:24,438
Signs of my heritage
that I try to hide.

114
00:07:24,472 --> 00:07:26,538
I grew up hating
my angel side.

115
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,472
I jumped at the
chance to become a devil

116
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:30,205
when Rias made me the offer.

117
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:31,772
To spite father.

118
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:33,805
Maybe it was
my half-breed blood.

119
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:34,772
But the results were a sad

120
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:38,405
and garish mix between
both types of wings.

121
00:07:40,638 --> 00:07:42,272
And what could
be a better way

122
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:44,138
to showcase my impure lineage?

123
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,272
Some mismatched plumage.

124
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:48,872
I never knew.

125
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:50,405
The truth is,

126
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:53,138
I've wanted to tell you
for such a long time.

127
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,638
[AKENO] But you
hate fallen angels.

128
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,105
They were the cause

129
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:04,205
of so much pain
for you and poor Asia.

130
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:06,672
And it almost killed you.

131
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:07,738
Not to mention
their attempt

132
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:11,405
to destroy this town
and the people living here.

133
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:13,838
It isn't hard to guess
what you think of them.

134
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:19,338
You're right.
I hate fallen angels.

135
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:22,538
[ISSEI] But there's more
to you than who your dad is!

136
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,172
[ISSEI] I apologize.

137
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,172
Sorry for making things awkward.

138
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:31,438
I don't mean to be
an ass all the time.

139
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:32,672
[AKENO] No, forget
I said anything;

140
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:35,138
I don't want things
to get weird between us.

141
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:36,538
[ISSEI] Not gonna happen!

142
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:38,972
Hey, you never know.

143
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:42,238
My apparent congeniality
could just be a mere faade.

144
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,472
A tactic to distract you

145
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:45,538
from the fact that
I'm half-fallen angel.

146
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:46,638
There's no way
you're convincing me

147
00:08:46,672 --> 00:08:48,205
you're a bad person.

148
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:50,238
[AKENO]
Oh, but it's true, Issei.

149
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:52,205
I'm a terrible woman.

150
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:53,638
That's bullshit!

151
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:55,138
As far as I'm concerned,

152
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:56,538
you're one of the
most awesome women

153
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:58,605
a guy like me
could hope to meet!

154
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:04,172
Uh, what I'm saying is,

155
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:05,838
I do totally hate fallen
angels and all that.

156
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:08,738
But it doesn't matter that
you're a half one, y'know.

157
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:09,772
I mean, you're still you, Akeno!

158
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:12,105
And, like,
I think you're terrific!

159
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:13,738
No, you're better than terrific!

160
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:16,105
I mean, you're strong,
you're smart, you're refined--

161
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,572
And let's be honest,
you've got a killer rack.

162
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:19,838
You're not just
an awesome woman,

163
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:22,538
you're awesome
at being one, too!

164
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:23,872
Wait. Did that come out right?

165
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:26,272
It sounded a lot
cooler in my head.

166
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:29,238
Damn.

167
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:30,405
Things get all
jumbled up in here.

168
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:32,605
[AKENO] You can stop worrying.

169
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,105
You said everything right.

170
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:38,472
You say
sweet things like that.

171
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:40,772
And what's a girl to do?

172
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:43,405
C'mon, I wasn't trying
to make you cry, okay?

173
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:46,405
I bet I'm up for a foot-
in-mouth award about now.

174
00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:48,738
Yeah, I should
probably stop babbling.

175
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,138
[ISSEI] Forget I said anyth--

176
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:55,705
[ISSEI]
Akeno, is everything okay?

177
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:57,205
[AKENO] I've decided.

178
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:58,005
[ISSEI] Huh?

179
00:09:58,038 --> 00:10:00,538
[AKENO] I said
I made a decision.

180
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:02,672
[ISSEI] Uh, what does that mean?

181
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:03,805
[AKENO] Guess what, Issei?

182
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:05,572
[ISSEI] Uh, what?

183
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,872
I'm totally fine
with being your third.

184
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:09,138
[ISSEI] Hold on-- Third?

185
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:11,272
Third. And stop repeating me.

186
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:13,472
Don't you think it's
a pretty good position?

187
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:15,705
The third?

188
00:10:15,738 --> 00:10:17,538
Just the thought
gets me hot.

189
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:19,205
Like having an affair!

190
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:21,305
Whatever you're talking
about, I'm so on board.

191
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:22,372
[AKENO] Yes, I can tell.

192
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:25,672
Feels like Little Issei
woke up and wants to play!

193
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:27,372
[AKENO] Hey, I'm flattered!

194
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:29,605
Now I want to do
something special for you.

195
00:10:29,638 --> 00:10:31,638
I think I could handle that!

196
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,305
But first, Issei.

197
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:36,272
I want to hear you tell me
what a bad girl I am.

198
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:37,238
[ISSEI] I dunno.

199
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:39,438
That sounds pervy, even to me.

200
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,572
But I've been
so very naughty.

201
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:43,572
Scold me.

202
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:46,605
[ISSEI] You're a bad girl?

203
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:48,538
Thank you, Issei!

204
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:50,272
[ISSEI thinking] Oh man.

205
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:51,605
Close contact with
her milk jugs is better

206
00:10:51,638 --> 00:10:53,538
than I could've dreamed!

207
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:58,138
Yes. I like it
when you talk dirty to me.

208
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:01,838
It turns me on. Come here, you.

209
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:06,138
[ISSEI thinking] Horniness
reaching critical overload!

210
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:09,772
[thinking]
My face is just inches

211
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:12,272
from where the magic happens!

212
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,072
[ISSEI] Major Boobage!

213
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:17,472
I thought I'd take

214
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:20,638
one of Rias's special
privileges for myself!

215
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:23,572
Now I actually
am being a little naughty!

216
00:11:23,605 --> 00:11:25,738
Issei, dear.
Do you feel good?

217
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:27,738
Yes! This is great!

218
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:29,872
Things don't get
much better than this!

219
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:33,305
It's perfection, as long
as Rias doesn't find out.

220
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:35,438
Doesn't find out about what?

221
00:11:35,472 --> 00:11:36,672
Answer me, Issei.

222
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:37,372
[ISSEI] Oh! Hey.

223
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,605
How long have you been there?

224
00:11:40,738 --> 00:11:42,672
Dude, I'm freakin' toast!

225
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:44,738
Hi there!

226
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:45,872
[ISSEI] Whoa! I can explain!

227
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,172
I dropped a contact in her lap!

228
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:51,405
[RIAS] You don't wear contacts.

229
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,338
Did you at
least get the sword?

230
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:55,838
I got it, yes ma'am!

231
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:57,338
And the angel?

232
00:11:57,372 --> 00:11:58,738
He returned home!

233
00:11:58,772 --> 00:12:02,205
Then that means your
business here is concluded.

234
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:03,138
Let's go.

235
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:04,472
[ISSEI] Okay.

236
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:06,138
You don't have
to be so jealous;

237
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,272
you're still the
favorite, silly!

238
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:15,572
Hey, thanks for
your help, Akeno.

239
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:17,805
Rias, wait for me!

240
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:30,272
[ISSEI thinking] Yep.

241
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:32,372
Seems like she's
pretty pissed off.

242
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:33,605
[RIAS] Issei, I--

243
00:12:33,638 --> 00:12:35,138
Yes ma'am?

244
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,338
[RIAS] Your goal is to
have a harem one day, right?

245
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:38,638
[ISSEI] Yeah.

246
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:40,538
[RIAS] What do you
think about Akeno?

247
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:42,638
Would she have
a place in your harem?

248
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,605
[RIAS]
Would I?

249
00:12:45,638 --> 00:12:47,372
You're my master.

250
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:52,672
[RIAS] Of course.

251
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,572
There's no room for me.

252
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:56,105
I'm your master.

253
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:57,172
Hey.

254
00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:58,438
The Lady of the House
of Gremory is way too good

255
00:12:58,472 --> 00:13:01,505
for some stupid
servant's pipedream!

256
00:13:01,538 --> 00:13:04,705
[RIAS] If I really
am the favorite.

257
00:13:04,738 --> 00:13:08,538
Then why do I feel the
furthest away from him?

258
00:13:18,905 --> 00:13:20,572
[ISSEI] Wait. Hold up!

259
00:13:21,472 --> 00:13:23,538
[RIAS] The summit
takes place tomorrow.

260
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:26,172
Final preparations
need to be made.

261
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,105
Do you have a plan to
make yourself useful?

262
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:30,538
[ISSEI] Guess I'm
heading back to school.

263
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:33,138
Gotta help with
Gasper's training, you know?

264
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:36,105
Of course.

265
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:38,238
This is where we part ways.

266
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:47,538
[ISSEI] Rias?

267
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:12,037
[ISSEI] Awesome!

268
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:13,703
[ASIA] Good work, Gasper!

269
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:16,070
You're able to catch it once
out of every twenty tries now!

270
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:18,070
[ISSEI] Which is a big
improvement from zero!

271
00:14:18,103 --> 00:14:19,203
[ISSEI] All right.

272
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:20,437
Next ball!

273
00:14:20,537 --> 00:14:21,203
Incoming!

274
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:23,303
Ready or not,
here we go!

275
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:25,003
Okay!

276
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:27,470
Are you okay?

277
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:28,670
[GASPER] Uh, Issei?

278
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:30,337
I think I'm done for today.

279
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,337
Don't puss out, yet!

280
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,403
We've got a dream to
turn into reality here!

281
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:35,637
And I can't do
it without you.

282
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,303
Come on, Gasper!

283
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,270
You're right,
I'm sorry!

284
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:41,137
[ISSEI] You've gotta hurry up

285
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,237
and master your
ability to stop time!

286
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,537
And then it'll be gropin'
season on the frozen foxy babes!

287
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,403
C'mon kid!

288
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,437
Bring in a win for Team Awesome.

289
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,370
And learn to control
that power, quick!

290
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:53,370
Yes!

291
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:55,003
I swear I'll never
let you down again, Issei!

292
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:56,170
Kickass!

293
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:58,370
Go Team Awesome!

294
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:02,603
[ASIA] Is this where the
inspiring montage comes in?

295
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:04,170
[ISSEI] Right!
Here we go, Gasper!

296
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,470
I'll do it for you,
Issei! Go!

297
00:15:09,303 --> 00:15:10,270
[ISSEI] Gasper.

298
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:12,303
Does my arm look like
the ball to you, buddy?

299
00:15:12,337 --> 00:15:14,737
[GASPER] I screwed
everything up again!

300
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,403
I'm sorry, Issei!

301
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:17,537
[ISSEI sighs]

302
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,037
Hey, don't worry about it.

303
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,737
I mean, you're
still in training.

304
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,470
I'm no good!

305
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:25,537
[ISSEI] Not true; you don't suck
nearly as hard as you used to.

306
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,537
Remember?

307
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,170
You froze my entire body
when we first started!

308
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:31,437
[GASPER] I'm bad
at being a vampire.

309
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,237
I'm lousy at being a devil.

310
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,370
I hate always letting
everybody down!

311
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:36,370
Stop that!

312
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,270
[GASPER] Stop what?

313
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,037
[ISSEI] Criticizing
yourself, dammit!

314
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,970
If you think like
that, you've lost!

315
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:44,603
Don't whine about your
problems, face them head on!

316
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:46,603
Otherwise, you're
your own worst enemy!

317
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,470
You're right. But--

318
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:50,403
I'm rooting for you, kiddo!

319
00:15:50,437 --> 00:15:52,270
And I know Asia is, too!

320
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:56,070
Right! I believe in you!

321
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:58,103
It's true.

322
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:00,470
Because you're my friend, silly!

323
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:02,270
You mean it?

324
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,003
[ISSEI] Of course, dude!

325
00:16:04,037 --> 00:16:05,737
Hell, we're like family!

326
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,103
The Gremory chess pieces
have to stick together!

327
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:09,070
[GASPER] Thanks, you guys!

328
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:12,170
And I swear, I'll never
be a quitter again!

329
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:13,203
[ISSEI] Hell yeah!

330
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:14,337
[GASPER] Right!

331
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,437
I'll just slip this on,
to help me harness my energy.

332
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,103
[ISSEI] Dude, don't.

333
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:18,037
That's creepy!

334
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,270
[ASIA] If the two
of you work together,

335
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:21,337
I know in my heart
you can do it!

336
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,437
[ISSEI] You hear that, Gasper?

337
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,203
You got a stone cold fox
cheering you on, my brother!

338
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:27,270
Hey, weren't you helping
out with his training?

339
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:28,703
Every time I tried
to help train him,

340
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,737
the poor kid would
break down crying.

341
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,603
Kept saying something about

342
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:34,370
how training him
made him feel guilty.

343
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:36,270
[KONEKO] I've only
seen Issei this happy

344
00:16:36,303 --> 00:16:38,370
about training once before.

345
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:40,370
[XENOVIA] When was that?

346
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:42,070
[KONEKO] We were at
the training camp.

347
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,103
That was when
he came up

348
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,603
with his perversely perverted
joke of a finishing move.

349
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:49,003
You mean he
was this excited

350
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:50,603
when he came up
with the Dress Break?

351
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:52,237
Mhmm.

352
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,070
Let's make our dreams
come true, at last!

353
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:55,537
Get ready for another hundred!

354
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,403
[GASPER] Thank you sir!

355
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:58,070
May I have another?

356
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:00,337
[ISSEI] Great! Here we go again!

357
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,237
[ASIA] Umm. Issei?

358
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:02,970
Huh?

359
00:17:03,003 --> 00:17:04,403
You keep talking
about this dream

360
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:05,537
you and Gasper have.

361
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,303
Can you tell me about it?

362
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:09,137
It's to use my power
on all the girls,

363
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,437
so that Issei can then--

364
00:17:12,003 --> 00:17:14,537
It's still in development,
so too early to say.

365
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,437
[ISSEI thinking] I'm in
no position to train anyone.

366
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,603
Who am I kidding?

367
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:22,503
I've barely even scratched
the surface of my own power.

368
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:24,470
If anybody needs
a teacher, it's me.

369
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:28,103
Someone who knows a thing
or two about Sacred Gears.

370
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:35,203
I suspect you'll
want me to attend

371
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:38,370
that boring meeting with
you tomorrow, won't you?

372
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:40,003
That's right, Vali.

373
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:42,737
After all, you are the
White Dragon Emperor.

374
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,337
So, Azazel.

375
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,037
What are the odds that
we'll all go to war again?

376
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,003
Exactly what I'd expect

377
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:51,303
from the mouth
of the White Dragon.

378
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,703
Are you trying to live
fast and die young?

379
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:55,070
[VALI] Why not?

380
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:57,370
There's no point
to anything anymore.

381
00:17:57,403 --> 00:17:59,103
I hate this place.

382
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:01,970
I hate this era
my birth thrust me into.

383
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:04,737
A world where God is dead.

384
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,370
I just wanted a shot at Him.

385
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:10,137
[AZAZEL] You're the
Vanishing Dragon, all right.

386
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:14,270
There's nothing left
in this boring world

387
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,703
to interest me.

388
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:23,351
[ISSEI] Oh, Akeno.

389
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:26,251
You're the girl who's always
smiling on the outside.

390
00:18:26,284 --> 00:18:29,784
But she must've been suffering
on the inside this whole time.

391
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,184
Compared to everything
she's been through.

392
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,717
I've got it super easy.

393
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:34,951
God, I'm a dick.

394
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:38,351
I can't even think this
without hating myself.

395
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,517
I suck!

396
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,317
All I've got to worry about
is how much Rias likes me.

397
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:41,951
[knock knock]

398
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:42,917
Yeah?

399
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:47,484
[ISSEI] Rias? Akeno?

400
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,351
Why is Akeno here?

401
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:51,517
[RIAS] Our meeting ran late,

402
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:53,651
so she's going to have to
sleep over with us tonight.

403
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:56,217
I figured you wouldn't
mind the situation too much.

404
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:57,817
That's right.

405
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:01,451
[ISSEI thinking] Oh good.
She's back to normal.

406
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:03,251
They really are best friends.

407
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:05,317
[RIAS] Also, Akeno
said she really wanted

408
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,784
to take a moment
to apologize to you.

409
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:08,917
[ISSEI] What for?

410
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:11,784
Obviously, I am very sorry
for surprising you today,

411
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,617
and I hope you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

412
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,851
[ISSEI] Oh, that's--
I didn't really--

413
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:18,384
I heard.

414
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,351
[ISSEI] What?

415
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:21,217
That's right, I heard
what Akeno told you

416
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:23,517
and what your reply was to her.

417
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:26,184
[ISSEI] I'm sorry!

418
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:27,851
[ISSEI] I couldn't resist
the temptation of her lap,

419
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:30,651
and so I used it as a pillow.

420
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:33,184
Oh, forget about
that nonsense, Issei.

421
00:19:33,217 --> 00:19:35,251
I mean what happened before.

422
00:19:35,284 --> 00:19:37,584
She's not upset
with you, silly.

423
00:19:37,617 --> 00:19:39,284
Rias is talking about
when you told me

424
00:19:39,317 --> 00:19:41,284
that you liked me
no matter who I was.

425
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:42,484
She what?

426
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:45,251
Um, why isn't she
pissed off, though?

427
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,884
I was happy to
hear your kindness,

428
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,951
and I felt so proud of you.

429
00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:50,817
That is definitely my Issei!

430
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,717
Yeah, that's me.

431
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:54,384
[ISSEI thinking] I'm happy
to be praised and everything,

432
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:58,384
but I'm still not exactly sure
what I'm being praised for.

433
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:00,317
Oh my goodness, Rias.

434
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:01,484
Now, you know
he's gonna have

435
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:03,617
to be my Issei from
here on out, too.

436
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:04,651
What? Akeno?

437
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:06,817
You know what, Akeno,
we may be best friends,

438
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:08,284
but that doesn't
mean you shouldn't act

439
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:09,717
with a little bit of restraint.

440
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,684
Yes, well, restraint is
forbidden in a serious battle.

441
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:13,851
How could the
big bad king

442
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:15,684
ever say something
so cowardly?

443
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:18,584
Oh, I can't lose after
hearing you say that.

444
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,917
Go on, hit me with your
best shot, sister queen.

445
00:20:23,317 --> 00:20:25,184
So is this how
we're playing?

446
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:28,517
[ISSEI thinking] I don't
really know what's going on.

447
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:29,717
I don't really know,

448
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:33,917
but I'm definitely experiencing
the pinnacle of paradise!

449
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:37,751
No fair, you two!
No fair!

450
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:41,451
[ISSEI] Oh, maybe not.

451
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:43,417
[ISSEI] So heavy.

452
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,217
[VALI] Tonight's
finally the night.

453
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:57,284
All the higher-ups are gathering

454
00:20:57,317 --> 00:21:00,517
to discuss the most boring
issues ever to be discussed.

455
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:04,251
[ORPHIS] "There's nothing
left in this boring world

456
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:06,484
to interest me."

457
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:08,384
Orphis?

458
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:09,584
Vali.

459
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:14,517
[ORPHIS]
That is what you always say.

460
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:15,717
[VALI] That's right.

461
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:19,651
There's nothing left in this
boring world to interest me.

462
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:24,817
[RIAS]
Well. Time to go.

463
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:25,851
[ISSEI] Right!

464
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,251
And Gasper.

465
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:28,951
Behave yourself
while we're gone.

466
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:29,651
[GASPER] Okay.

467
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:30,851
[RIAS] I don't mean to scold,

468
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:34,284
but if you activate your power,
it'll stall negotiations.

469
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:35,584
And we don't want that.

470
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:36,884
I hope you understand.

471
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:37,684
Yes ma'am.

472
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:39,417
But Koneko is
going to stay here

473
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:41,484
and take care of you,
isn't that right, Koneko?

474
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:43,351
[KONEKO] Yes. Of course.

475
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:45,651
[ISSEI] Hey dude.
Go easy on Koneko.

476
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:47,651
And you can borrow this.

477
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:48,184
[GASPER] Awesome!

478
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:48,884
Thanks a lot, Issei!

479
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,884
I'll try not to let you down!

480
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:54,217
[KONEKO] I also stocked up
on some snacks for us.

481
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:56,851
[GASPER] Whoa! I don't
even know where to begin!

482
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:58,617
[ISSEI thinking]
I bet they're all for her.

483
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,284
[ISSEI] And one last thing
for you before we go.

484
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:03,817
Wear it as much
as you want, dude!

485
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:04,851
Sweet! Thanks!

486
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:06,917
Hey, anything
for you, buddy!

487
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,484
[ISSEI thinking] So. Awkward.

488
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:11,584
If this is really the best
I can do, how sad is that?

489
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:15,684
I just-- I just really want
to do something to help him.

490
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:17,817
A kid like Gasper deserves more.

491
00:22:21,284 --> 00:22:22,451
[RIAS] May we come in?

492
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:39,717
Irina?

493
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:46,884
Everyone's here.

494
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:49,817
This is my sister, Rias,
and her retainers.

495
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:51,684
They're the ones who
fought against Kokabiel

496
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:54,451
during his surprise
attack a few days ago.

497
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:56,484
That is a rather
impressive feat.

498
00:22:56,517 --> 00:22:58,784
I thank each one of you
for all of your hard work.

499
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:01,251
Once again, I apologize.

500
00:23:01,284 --> 00:23:03,951
It seems one of my boys
caused you a bit of trouble.

501
00:23:03,984 --> 00:23:06,417
So what's up
with that dick?

502
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:09,684
[SIR ZECHS] Now that all the
participants are represented,

503
00:23:09,717 --> 00:23:11,551
let this summit commence.

504
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:21,751
[RIAS] The rest of the
details regarding the incident

505
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:23,517
between Kokabiel
and my household

506
00:23:23,551 --> 00:23:26,184
can be found in my
official report.

507
00:23:26,217 --> 00:23:27,917
[SONA] As a witness,
I, Sona Sitri,

508
00:23:27,951 --> 00:23:31,317
confirm the veracity of the
report given by Lady Gremory.

509
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:32,417
[SIR ZECHS] That will be all.

510
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:33,617
Thank you very much.

511
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:34,684
Great job, ladies!

512
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:36,651
You make me so proud, Sona!

513
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,484
[SIR ZECHS] Perhaps
the Governor-General

514
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:41,684
of the Fallen Angels would care

515
00:23:41,717 --> 00:23:43,817
to share his opinion
of their report?

516
00:23:43,851 --> 00:23:44,917
[AZAZEL] Kokabiel went rogue;

517
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:47,617
therefore my thoughts on
the incident are irrelevant.

518
00:23:47,651 --> 00:23:49,584
[MICHAEL] So he acted
entirely on his own?

519
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:50,817
Well, he never
had my permission,

520
00:23:50,851 --> 00:23:52,917
if that's what you're asking.

521
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:54,817
But something tells me
the damn fool wouldn't have

522
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:58,351
tried to destroy the whole town
if he knew I was staying here.

523
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:01,217
I've grown quite fond of
this quaint little place.

524
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:03,851
[SIR ZECHS] Try and stay
on topic, if you please.

525
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:06,751
I sent the White Dragon Emperor
in to resolve the issue.

526
00:24:06,784 --> 00:24:09,884
And the culprit is frozen stiff
in the lowest level of Hell.

527
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,617
He won't bother you again.

528
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:12,551
What I find most troubling

529
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,417
about the attack itself
is his motivation.

530
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:17,451
It seems that he was
rather dissatisfied

531
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:19,217
with the status quo.

532
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,417
[AZAZEL]
Yeah, the war ending halfway

533
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:22,384
through really
stuck in his craw.

534
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,717
What he wanted
was perpetual combat.

535
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:26,384
But at this late
stage in the game,

536
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:29,351
I have no interest in a war.

537
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:32,217
'The seeds of discontent'.

538
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:35,551
[AZAZEL] That behavior
isn't exclusive to my faction.

539
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,384
Again I ask that we stay
focused on the matter at hand.

540
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:40,584
After all, that is why
we've convened here.

541
00:24:40,617 --> 00:24:42,484
Spare the verbosity,
won't you?

542
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:45,517
Let's just make peace
and be done with it.

543
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:50,951
That's the purpose of
this grand summit, isn't it?

544
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:53,284
Of course it is.

545
00:25:00,217 --> 00:25:01,251
[GASPER] I'm worried.

546
00:25:01,284 --> 00:25:02,351
I hope they're okay.

547
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:04,884
What if the summit turns
chaotic, and war breaks out?

548
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,217
And-- And then, everyone dies!

549
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:08,917
I can't take it!

550
00:26:58,251 --> 00:26:59,584
[ISSEI] Yo, Issei here!

551
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,651
A terrorist attack?

552
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:03,551
And Gasper and Koneko in
the clutches of the enemy?

553
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:07,484
Then we'll have to fight
no matter who our opponent is!

554
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:09,651
Next time!
"The Leader's Summit Begins!"

555
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:11,651
So many milk jugs in one room!
