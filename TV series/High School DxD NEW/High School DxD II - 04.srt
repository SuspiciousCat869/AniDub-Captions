1
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,233
[SAJI] A devil actually
put on a priest's clothes.

2
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:20,200
[IRINA] Not without kicking
and screaming about it.

3
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:22,700
Nothing will stand in
the way of me and my goal.

4
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:25,466
[XENOVIA] I think we'll be
more efficient in two groups.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,633
Let's split up.

6
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:27,800
[ISSEI] Sounds
like a plan to me.

7
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,300
We'll take on the east.

8
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,533
[XENOVIA] Then Irina
and I will conduct

9
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:32,600
our search in the
west part of town.

10
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,133
If you see anything
at all, call the cell.

11
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,333
[ISSEI] Understood.

12
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:38,366
Oh. Wait,
before you go,

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,466
there's something important
I forgot to tell you.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,600
[ISSEI] Okay.

15
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:44,300
[XENOVIA] We appreciate being
taken such good care of.

16
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,066
So, as thanks, you should know

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,133
the White Dragon has awakened.

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
[DDRAIG] I'm saying be careful.

19
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:53,066
You never know
when the White One

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,733
will decide to make an
unexpected appearance.

21
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:58,100
[KONEKO] Everything okay, Issei?

22
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:58,766
Yeah!

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,833
I'm fine.

24
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:01,666
Just trying to figure out
where we should go next.

25
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,533
[KIBA] Probably some
place without people.

26
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:05,700
Does that mean you
have something in mind?

27
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,100
[KIBA] Yeah, I think so.

28
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:46,024
This place?

29
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:48,924
[ISSEI] It's where we
defeated that stray devil,

30
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,558
Riser, isn't it?

31
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:53,324
You fought a stray devil?

32
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:54,958
[ISSEI] Yeah,
and he was a monster.

33
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:57,391
We couldn't tell if he
was a man or a devil.

34
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,458
It was wicked.

35
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:01,524
Kiba, hold on.

36
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:03,458
[ISSEI] Wait. Something's wrong.

37
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:05,291
Look!

38
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:06,991
Yahoo!

39
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:09,591
Clink!

40
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,691
[FREED] I forgot to
thank you earlier!

41
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:14,391
For what?

42
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:15,724
[SAJI] Is that the stray priest?

43
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:17,058
[ISSEI] You psychotic bastard!

44
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:18,558
Oh hi!

45
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:20,758
If it isn't the little
midget and friends!

46
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,424
[FREED] Ha ha! Whoops!
I mean "Little Lady!"

47
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,291
Forgive me.

48
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:25,591
You know, I was
really looking forward

49
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:27,424
to some good ol'
priest hunting tonight,

50
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,558
but all I found was a
bunch of devils in costumes.

51
00:03:33,724 --> 00:03:34,991
[KONEKO]
Careful with that sword.

52
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,058
It's powerful.

53
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,891
[ISSEI] Right.
It feels familiar.

54
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:39,991
Like the one Irina was carrying.

55
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:41,691
It's an Excalibur!

56
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:43,991
[DDRAIG] Boost!

57
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,891
[FREED] Oh my, my.
Four of you in one night?

58
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:49,591
I'm overwhelmed
by my own popularity.

59
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:50,724
[KIBA] Don't get too excited.

60
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:52,658
I'm your only opponent.

61
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:54,724
[ISSEI] Kiba!

62
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:56,724
Hi!

63
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:58,724
What's hysterical is
that no matter how many

64
00:03:58,758 --> 00:04:00,524
brave little devils
sling themselves at me,

65
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:02,624
they are no match
for this sword.

66
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:07,924
Thank you for playing!

67
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:10,724
[FREED] Some have called the
Holy Sword of Heavenly Flashes

68
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:12,958
the "Excalibur Rapidly,"
but I don't.

69
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:15,658
I call it the
"Super Fast Sword"!

70
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:21,424
[ISSEI] Oh man!
He wasn't kidding!

71
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,958
It's moving faster than Kiba!

72
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:25,991
I guess that's why they say it
can seal away a knight's speed.

73
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:28,358
[KONEKO] Worst day ever.

74
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,858
[FREED] Aw! Feeling left out?

75
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:31,758
Don't worry!

76
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,024
There's plenty left
over for you, too!

77
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:35,024
[ISSEI] No thanks.

78
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:36,558
[DDRAIG] Boost!

79
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:38,024
[ISSEI] Damn it!

80
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:39,858
If there was some way
I could stop Freed,

81
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:42,591
I'd be able to transfer
more power to Kiba!

82
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:43,458
So wait.

83
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,758
You just need to
slow him down, right?

84
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,291
Line up!

85
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:50,958
What's happening?

86
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:56,724
[SAJI] You'll see!
Okay, Line, Go!

87
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:02,524
[SAJI] What'd you think?

88
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:03,924
It's called the Absorption Line!

89
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,691
Or you could call
it my Sacred Gear.

90
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,391
[ISSEI] You have
a Sacred Gear, too?

91
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:09,591
[SAJI] Hell yeah!

92
00:05:09,624 --> 00:05:10,858
[ISSEI]
Frikkin' awesome!

93
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:12,391
And go!

94
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:16,358
Damn it! Damn! Damn it!

95
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:19,391
This must be another
one of those dragon sorts!

96
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:21,658
[ISSEI] Yours is
a dragon, too?

97
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:23,491
[DDRAIG] Boost!

98
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,058
[KONEKO] Calm down.

99
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:30,324
[ISSEI] No! Damn it, Koneko!

100
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:30,924
[DDRAIG] Boost!

101
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,391
[FREED] What the hell?

102
00:05:32,424 --> 00:05:33,358
Hold on, Issei!

103
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:34,824
[ISSEI] Heads up!

104
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:37,291
[DDRAIG] Transfer!

105
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:41,691
Yup, the dragon's awake.
And so is his power now!

106
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:44,624
This power that
I've been given is a gift.

107
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,958
I will use it gratefully!

108
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:48,358
What?

109
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,591
[KIBA] Get up!

110
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:51,424
[FREED] Why can't
I get this off?

111
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,258
[KIBA] Sword Birth!

112
00:06:01,524 --> 00:06:02,858
[VALPER] Sword Birth, huh?

113
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:04,624
[KIBA] Who's there?

114
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:06,624
[VALPER] A Sacred Gear
that can exhibit

115
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:10,324
invincible power based
on the user's ability.

116
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:11,458
Oh Freed.

117
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:12,891
Looks like your
use of Holy Swords

118
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:15,524
could still use some
brushing up, couldn't it?

119
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:17,491
[FREED] Look!
It's Old Man Valper!

120
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:21,558
That must be the guy
Xenovia was talking about!

121
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,791
[KONEKO] He's the mastermind

122
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:25,358
behind the Holy Sword Project.

123
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:27,424
Valper Galilei!

124
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,958
[VALPER]
Hmph. The one and only.

125
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:32,058
[FREED] One and
only what, Old Man?

126
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:32,891
Make yourself useful

127
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:35,591
and get this
lizard tongue off me!

128
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:37,324
[VALPER] You need to
pour all your energy

129
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:39,058
into the blade of the sword.

130
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:40,758
Oh, is that all it takes?

131
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,458
One energy cocktail coming up!

132
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:46,558
Be careful,
you guys! This is bad!

133
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:55,558
[FREED] It's making sense now.

134
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:57,324
If I figure out the perfect way

135
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:59,791
to use the holy elements,
I'll continue to gain power.

136
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:01,591
I like this game.

137
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:03,124
[FREED] I have an idea.

138
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:04,324
Why don't you
all just stand there

139
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,324
and become prey for my sword!

140
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:10,491
You first!

141
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:11,791
[FREED] What the--?

142
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:12,958
Xenovia?

143
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:14,491
[IRINA] Yoohoo!

144
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:18,524
[SAJI] Irina?
What are you doing?

145
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:19,958
What? What do you mean?

146
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:22,024
You contacted me
so I came to help, duh!

147
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:22,924
We did?

148
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:23,758
Yeah.

149
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,058
Good to know you're
paying attention.

150
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:26,424
[XENOVIA] You're both traitors.

151
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,491
Hear me, Freed Sellzen,
and Valper Galilei.

152
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:32,824
I condemn your souls
in the name of our God!

153
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:34,324
How dare you say that!

154
00:07:34,358 --> 00:07:35,291
Don't you ever croak

155
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:37,991
that disgusting name
in my presence again!

156
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:44,891
[VALPER] You're done.

157
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:45,891
All you had to
do was get rid

158
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,624
of those vermin from the
church who had snuck in.

159
00:07:48,658 --> 00:07:49,891
Easy.

160
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:51,658
But there they are
with Holy Swords

161
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:53,591
and you're outnumbered.

162
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:54,824
Time to pull back.

163
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:56,758
[FREED] Aw, so soon?

164
00:07:57,358 --> 00:07:59,458
Well. See ya!

165
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,991
Damn.

166
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,354
[XENOVIA] Let's go, Irina!

167
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,987
[ISSEI] Wait! I want to go, too!

168
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:14,754
[ISSEI] What's happening now?
Why're we stopped?

169
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:17,687
[RIAS] Goodness, what have
you gotten yourselves into?

170
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:18,221
[SAJI] Sona!

171
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:19,421
[ISSEI] Rias!

172
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:21,787
[RIAS] I'm sure this
will be a lively story.

173
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:23,021
I can't wait.

174
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:25,954
[SONA] Whenever you'd like to
start explaining, I'm ready.

175
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:31,187
[RIAS] I know we said
we wouldn't intervene

176
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:33,287
but I at least want to
know what's going on.

177
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:34,754
Therefore, Akeno and Tsubaki

178
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:36,654
will be keeping an eye on them.

179
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:37,321
[ISSEI] Wait, what?

180
00:08:37,354 --> 00:08:38,854
[SONA] Saji!

181
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:39,954
Um, yes?

182
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,287
[SONA] You weren't
nearly as cautious

183
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,721
as you needed
to be back there.

184
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:46,387
Seriously. I'm disappointed.

185
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:50,121
I-- I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

186
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,054
[RIAS] Well, I'm guessing
Kiba isn't here

187
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:54,787
because he went to look for
that Valper, is that correct?

188
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:55,487
Yeah.

189
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:58,287
Along with Xenovia and Irina.

190
00:08:58,321 --> 00:08:59,954
But I'm pretty sure
if something happens,

191
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:01,254
he'll let us know.

192
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:02,254
I wonder.

193
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:04,654
His head is so filled
with thoughts of revenge.

194
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:07,821
Plus I don't know that he
could call if he wanted to.

195
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:08,787
Damn.

196
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:09,654
[RIAS] Koneko.

197
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:10,721
Yeah?

198
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:13,654
[RIAS] Why did you ever
get involved with all this?

199
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:18,287
Because--I didn't want
Kiba to go away. Sorry.

200
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:22,787
Well, there's no use
dwelling on it now, is there?

201
00:09:22,821 --> 00:09:25,321
I need you to be
mindful of your actions.

202
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:26,821
The choices you make will always

203
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:28,754
have an effect
on the rest of us.

204
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:30,287
You understand that, right?

205
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:31,121
[KONEKO] Yes.

206
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,987
[ISSEI] Yes.
I'm very sorry, Rias.

207
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:33,721
[KONEKO] Me too.

208
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:36,954
[smacking and
SAJI screaming]

209
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:38,187
[SONA] I think you
need more time

210
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,287
to reflect upon your actions!

211
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,321
I'm sorry, Sona!

212
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:42,987
I beg your forgiveness!

213
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:43,887
Not yet.

214
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:45,921
Not until you've had
a thousand spankings.

215
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:47,721
She's using her
powers to spank him?

216
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,987
No way!

217
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:53,621
What's Rias gonna do?
I'm screwed!

218
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:56,821
Issei. Koneko.

219
00:09:56,854 --> 00:09:58,154
What? Yes?

220
00:09:58,187 --> 00:09:59,654
[RIAS] What is
wrong with you kids?

221
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:02,321
All you do is make me worry.

222
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:03,721
How come they
get hugs over there

223
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:05,821
and I'm getting my ass beaten?

224
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:08,787
[SONA] That's them. This is us.

225
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:14,987
[ISSEI thinking] I'm so
glad I'm Rias's servant!

226
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:18,787
[RIAS] All right. Issei.

227
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:21,321
I need you to bend over please.

228
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,221
[ISSEI] What?

229
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,687
I thought you were
going to forgive us!

230
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:25,854
That's not how it works.

231
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:28,921
A master is responsible for
disciplining her servants.

232
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:30,354
You, too, will
be punished

233
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:31,354
with a thousand spankings.

234
00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:32,987
What? A thousand?

235
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:34,121
That's right.

236
00:10:34,154 --> 00:10:35,987
Give me your bottom, Issei!

237
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:38,354
Wait just a
moment, Rias.

238
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,221
Issei is not the only
person at fault here.

239
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:42,354
So please.

240
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:45,021
I think I should be punished
with half of the spankings.

241
00:10:45,054 --> 00:10:47,254
Are you serious?

242
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:50,021
Okay, then. Koneko.

243
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:51,921
Get ready for your spankings.

244
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:52,987
[KONEKO] Yes, ma'am.

245
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:57,721
[ISSEI] Wait, Rias, please!

246
00:10:57,754 --> 00:11:00,654
Forgive dat ass; don't spank it!

247
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:02,821
[ISSEI] This whole
thing was my stupid idea,

248
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:04,087
so just punish me.

249
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,387
I don't think Koneko deserves
to get what I should get at all.

250
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:10,154
You're wrong.

251
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:12,387
Rias!

252
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,821
Please, take it out on my
butt as much as you want.

253
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:17,987
I'm begging you!

254
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:19,954
[RIAS] Move out
of the way, Issei.

255
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:21,254
[ISSEI] Oh, come on!

256
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:23,754
Are you ready?
Here I go.

257
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:25,987
Ready. Thank you.

258
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:27,821
Go ahead.

259
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,721
[RIAS] Okay, all done, Koneko.

260
00:11:39,754 --> 00:11:40,687
That's right.

261
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:42,121
It's commendable for
you to have reflected

262
00:11:42,154 --> 00:11:44,287
on your actions in
the way you've done.

263
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:46,154
So this is the
punishment I've decided

264
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:49,721
to give you in response
to your choice today.

265
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:51,287
I-- I don't
know what to say.

266
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:52,954
Thank you.

267
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:55,787
Classic Rias Gremory!

268
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:58,354
She can be firm
but kind, too.

269
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:01,287
[RIAS] Now, it's
your turn next, Issei.

270
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,387
Right on! Go!

271
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:05,721
All right, I'm going
to do the rest now.

272
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:07,221
Wait, like
all the rest?

273
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:09,287
Koneko took your place
for one out of a thousand;

274
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:10,821
you should be grateful.

275
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:13,287
You only have nine hundred
and ninety-nine left!

276
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:17,021
Nine hundred and
ninety-nine spankings?

277
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:22,354
[smacking and screaming]

278
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:24,321
[ISSEI] I'm sorry!

279
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:33,721
[ISSEI] I think you
put my ass in a coma.

280
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,921
Welcome home, you guys!

281
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:38,987
[ASIA] You must be exhausted
after working so late.

282
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:41,054
I'll start getting
dinner ready right away.

283
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,221
Any requests?

284
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:43,054
[ISSEI] Just a question.

285
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:44,854
Do you realize
what you're wearing?

286
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:46,721
Oh, yeah.

287
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:49,221
Some of the girls
at school suggested it.

288
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,387
[ASIA] They said the best way
to help a guy feel better

289
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:55,821
after a tough day is to
wear things like this.

290
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:57,687
[ISSEI] It was that four-eyed
pervy wench, wasn't it?

291
00:12:57,721 --> 00:12:58,721
[RIAS] Impressive!

292
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:00,721
It's simple,
yet quite effective!

293
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:02,154
[RIAS] Well done.

294
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:05,187
You are going to become a
wickedly sexy devil one day.

295
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:06,287
I'm proud of you.

296
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:08,154
[ASIA] But, um,
what if I don't want

297
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,254
to be sexy or wicked?

298
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:11,221
Yeah.

299
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:12,187
Then you probably want
to go change, right?

300
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:15,021
I mean, what's gonna
happen if Mom sees you?

301
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:18,754
[MOTHER] Oh! I am just
living for these outfits!

302
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:20,921
Welcome home.

303
00:13:20,954 --> 00:13:21,987
[ISSEI] She didn't
know how to wear it!

304
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:22,754
Of course not!

305
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:25,054
That's why I
helped her, Goofy!

306
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:26,054
Mother?

307
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:27,354
I'd like to wear one, too!

308
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:28,721
Just like Asia.

309
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:30,287
Wonderful!
I've got plenty.

310
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:32,254
Let's find one for you!

311
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,754
[RIAS] If you'll excuse me.

312
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:37,254
Oh, by the way?

313
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:38,687
Yeah?

314
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:41,354
You were very close
to out doing me here.

315
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,821
You should be proud of yourself.

316
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:45,654
[ASIA] Thank you!

317
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:46,787
What just happened?

318
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:48,754
Nothing's making sense today.

319
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,254
[ASIA] Issei?

320
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,921
So you don't like
what I'm wearing, or--?

321
00:13:52,954 --> 00:13:54,021
[ISSEI] What? No!

322
00:13:54,054 --> 00:13:55,954
I mean, yes! I do.

323
00:13:55,987 --> 00:13:59,054
You look amazing and
I should've said so earlier.

324
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,221
Also?

325
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:03,421
If those punks from the
church show up again;

326
00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:05,821
I've got your back.

327
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:07,187
I don't want you to have

328
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,654
to deal with that crap anymore.

329
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:11,321
At least not without
me by your side.

330
00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:13,221
[ASIA] Thank you, Issei.

331
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:17,221
So you know, I don't
regret becoming a devil.

332
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:19,854
I won't ever forget
my faith or love of God,

333
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:21,387
but I realized that
making this change

334
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:25,021
has introduced me to
something even more precious.

335
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:27,287
Meeting Rias,
our club members,

336
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:30,887
other friends from school,
your amazing mother and father

337
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:34,754
who have been so kind, and you.

338
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:38,421
That's something I know is
real and moves me every day.

339
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:41,421
[ASIA] I want us all to
stay here together forever.

340
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:43,721
I don't want to
be alone anymore!

341
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:49,654
[ISSEI thinking] Apron!
Aprons don't have backs!

342
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:52,621
Which means she is totally
hanging out right now!

343
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:55,287
[ISSEI] Hands! Don't do it!

344
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:57,954
It's like they've
got a mind of their own!

345
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:00,021
[RIAS] Issei?

346
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:00,721
Nothing!

347
00:15:00,754 --> 00:15:02,187
It's just a one-sided hug! See?

348
00:15:02,221 --> 00:15:03,687
What do you think?

349
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:05,654
I can't think!

350
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:08,187
[RIAS] It's already pretty late,

351
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:10,087
so let's just make
it quick and easy.

352
00:15:10,121 --> 00:15:11,987
[ASIA] 'Kay!

353
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,187
It's almost like you have
two wives, isn't it?

354
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:23,054
[ISSEI] Two half naked
babes cooking in the kitchen.

355
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:25,054
Dad is going to freak!

356
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:49,669
[FREED] Found
you, little girl!

357
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:53,603
[FREED] You can
run all you want,

358
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,503
but it seems
you're all alone now.

359
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:57,936
So, who's
gonna save you?

360
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:06,769
Oh yes,
the Excalibur Mimic.

361
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:09,669
Don't wanna leave
without that, now do I?

362
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:32,503
Let me go,
you pathetic traitor.

363
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:35,569
[FREED] What to
do with pretty you?

364
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:37,236
[KOKABIEL] That's enough.

365
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:39,603
[KOKABIEL] Keep her alive.

366
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:42,836
Even if she's small fry,
we still have use for her.

367
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:48,903
[ISSEI thinking]
I guess that's it--

368
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:51,936
if no one's heard from
Kiba since last night.

369
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:54,203
Looks like we've got

370
00:16:54,236 --> 00:16:56,769
a snoozer loser situation
on our hands, brah!

371
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:58,869
You don't need
to be that close to me!

372
00:16:58,903 --> 00:16:59,936
[MATSUDA and MOTOHAMA]
So. Are you worried

373
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:01,803
about whose titties
you're going to grab first?

374
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:02,969
Do you need our help?

375
00:17:03,003 --> 00:17:04,936
Akeno or Rias?
Rias or Akeno?

376
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:06,269
Who's it gonna be?

377
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,536
I don't need
help with that.

378
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,869
I think about it all the time.
Wanna know?

379
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,736
Yes! Tell us!

380
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:13,569
[ISSEI] Rias's are
definitely firmer.

381
00:17:13,603 --> 00:17:16,603
Akeno's are soft, but they
have a great shape to them.

382
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,803
Of course, I prefer the
way Rias's look overall.

383
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:21,736
But Akeno's got
this perfect slope

384
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:23,803
that curves upwards
with a perky tip.

385
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:24,703
Perky?

386
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:25,769
Hot!

387
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:27,303
[ISSEI] Now if you're
just grabbing with hands,

388
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:28,869
Akeno's are the way to go,

389
00:17:28,903 --> 00:17:31,736
but Rias for everything else.

390
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:34,736
Damn it, son.

391
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:35,703
You better watch
out you don't get

392
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:38,303
clocked by some
jealous brothers out here!

393
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:39,136
That includes us!

394
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:42,369
We're the jealous
brothers, too, man.

395
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:44,269
Listen close,
my friends.

396
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:47,236
When you're grabbing boobs,
you're grabbing life.

397
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,736
Damn! That's church!

398
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:51,669
Your words burn
deep into my soul!

399
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:53,569
[ASIA] Are you sure?

400
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:56,003
[ISSEI] So does that
mean Kiba contacted you?

401
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:58,303
[AKENO] Nope. Not even one time.

402
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,903
Good news is, the two he's
with are pretty skilled.

403
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:02,969
I figure they could at
least take on a stray priest

404
00:18:03,003 --> 00:18:04,636
if they run into one.

405
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,836
So um-- I'm really sorry
if I made things worse.

406
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:10,036
[AKENO] You didn't.

407
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:12,736
But we couldn't sit around
waiting for him to contact us.

408
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:14,203
We had to act.

409
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,203
[AKENO] We sent our familiars
to search around town for us.

410
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:28,503
[ISSEI] Irina!

411
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:30,869
[AKENO] We found one.

412
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:32,769
[ISSEI] Asia!

413
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:34,469
Can you hear me?

414
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:37,669
What happened to you?

415
00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:40,469
Where are Kiba and Xenovia?

416
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:42,836
I don't know.
They got away.

417
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:44,369
[ISSEI] Got away from what?

418
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:48,469
I let them down.
I was too slow.

419
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:50,336
[ASIA] Try not to push yourself!

420
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:53,303
I couldn't get away.
He was too strong.

421
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:54,303
Who's 'he?'

422
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:56,669
Please be careful.

423
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,903
Irina!

424
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:02,769
[ISSEI] Hey guys.

425
00:19:02,803 --> 00:19:04,936
[RIAS] Thank you so
much for coming, Sona.

426
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:05,869
[SONA] Of course.

427
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:08,503
I came right after
I received your message.

428
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:10,403
The damage is
pretty bad, isn't it?

429
00:19:10,436 --> 00:19:12,336
[ASIA] Um, yeah.

430
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:13,903
Twilight Healing
isn't strong enough

431
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:16,503
to restore consumed stamina.

432
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:19,369
[SONA] It's okay.

433
00:19:19,403 --> 00:19:21,503
I have the equipment
to treat her at my house.

434
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:22,303
Tsubaki?

435
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:23,803
[TSUBAKI] Right.

436
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:27,969
[SONA] I'll leave her with you.

437
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:29,203
[TSUBAKI] Understood.

438
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:35,269
[ISSEI] So does that mean Kiba
and Xenovia are okay for now?

439
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:36,369
[ASIA] Yeah.

440
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:37,669
[SAJI] So how's your rear doing?

441
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:39,869
[ISSEI] Actually fine
after Asia's treatment.

442
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,936
Sorry you had to
go through all that.

443
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:42,903
My bad.

444
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:45,003
It's cool, but what
the hell happened, man?

445
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:47,969
[ISSEI] We just got here,
too, so I have no idea.

446
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:49,669
What's this in my chest?

447
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:50,903
No way!

448
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:54,336
[FREED] Well, well, well, would
ya lookie what we have here!

449
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:56,936
If it isn't the
"We All Took The Bait" Club!

450
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:58,903
Welcome, all of you.

451
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,969
So many damn devils!

452
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:01,836
[ISSEI] Thought it was you!

453
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:02,903
[SAJI] Figures!

454
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,369
Asia Argento.

455
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:08,469
The traitor nun who gave
her soul to the devils.

456
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:11,903
How much do you love
your new life as Devil Scum?

457
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:15,836
Shut up! You lay one
hand on her, I'll do it!

458
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:19,869
[FREED] Whoa whoa whoa! Hold on!

459
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:21,669
Don't blaze the
messenger, all right!

460
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:24,503
Someone wants
to talk to you, Red.

461
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:25,569
[RIAS] Which someone?

462
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:29,569
Heh heh... My boss!

463
00:20:30,703 --> 00:20:32,303
Fallen angel.

464
00:20:33,036 --> 00:20:34,603
[AKENO] And he has ten wings.

465
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:35,936
He's of the leader class.

466
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,536
[KOKABIEL] It's a
pleasure to meet you,

467
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,503
daughter of the
House of Gremory.

468
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:41,603
I am Kokabiel.

469
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,569
The pleasure
is all mine, I'm sure.

470
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:46,903
And please, call me Rias.

471
00:20:46,936 --> 00:20:49,269
So you're the leader
of the dark angels?

472
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:52,369
It's nice to put a
face with the name.

473
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:54,603
Your crimson hair is
quite breath-taking.

474
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:57,469
Just as lovely as the
Scarlet haired Devil King.

475
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:59,603
Even the facial
expressions are similar.

476
00:20:59,636 --> 00:21:01,836
That is absolutely nauseating.

477
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:02,769
[RIAS] Thank you.

478
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,869
Is there something
you'd like to discuss

479
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:06,536
with me or are you just here
to review my appearance?

480
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:07,669
Not that I'm rushing you.

481
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:10,236
It's nice to see a
leader so close-up.

482
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,569
[KOKABIEL] I'm thinking I'd
like to do a little damage

483
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:15,003
while I'm here starting
with this institution

484
00:21:15,036 --> 00:21:16,969
and moving on to
the rest of the town.

485
00:21:17,003 --> 00:21:18,803
[RIAS] Why would you
want to harm our school?

486
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:19,936
[KOKABIEL] I figure if I do,

487
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:22,903
Sir Zechs will have to
emerge to help out his sister.

488
00:21:22,936 --> 00:21:24,603
[KOKABIEL] What do you think?

489
00:21:25,403 --> 00:21:26,636
If you choose to do that,

490
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:27,903
then you will be
starting the war

491
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,336
between God, the fallen angels,
and the devils all over again.

492
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:32,469
[KOKABIEL]
Hahaha!

493
00:21:32,503 --> 00:21:34,903
Better than what I got
after stealing the Excaliburs:

494
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:37,636
I thought for certain
Michael would come after me,

495
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:39,769
but all I got were
some amateur exorcists

496
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:43,603
and two pathetic
Holy Sword users.

497
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,703
[KOKABIEL] Honestly.
It was disappointing.

498
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:48,536
[AKENO] So wait,
that was your goal?

499
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:50,803
You actually want
to start a war?

500
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:53,469
[KOKABIEL] Yes. Yes!

501
00:21:53,503 --> 00:21:56,803
After the first three-way
war ended, I was so bored!

502
00:21:56,836 --> 00:21:58,636
There was nothing to do!

503
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:00,269
[KOKABIEL] Azazel and
Shemhazai were being

504
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:02,503
so passive about when
the next one would start.

505
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:03,436
[ISSEI] Wait a sec.

506
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:05,703
I know those names, but how?

507
00:22:07,403 --> 00:22:08,303
That's right.

508
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:12,303
Raynare; she mentioned
those two before.

509
00:22:12,336 --> 00:22:13,369
[RIAS] Azazel.

510
00:22:13,403 --> 00:22:16,236
He's the General Governor
of all fallen angels.

511
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:18,369
[ISSEI] Sounds like
a good guy to know.

512
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,436
[KOKABIEL] Not only is
Azazel busy being distracted

513
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:23,269
by impending wars, he's also
spent time collecting

514
00:22:23,303 --> 00:22:25,503
something called
The Sacred Gears.

515
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,236
He always gets completely
immersed in his collections.

516
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:29,503
[ISSEI] So stealing
the Holy Swords

517
00:22:29,536 --> 00:22:30,769
wasn't enough for you guys?

518
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:32,403
Now you need Sacred Gears, too?

519
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,703
No need to generalize.

520
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:36,403
Also, I have no interest
in your Boosted Gear.

521
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:38,536
I realize that it might
be a useful weapon,

522
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:39,836
but I've got what I need.

523
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:41,069
Azazel might want it.

524
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:44,636
I'm sure he'd love to add a
devil's toy to his collection.

525
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:46,603
[ISSEI] Like I would
just hand it over to him!

526
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:48,636
[KOKABIEL]
Fallen angels, God, devils--

527
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:51,836
we are just barely in
a state of equilibrium.

528
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:55,603
Which means
I can start the war

529
00:22:55,636 --> 00:22:57,869
at any time with
my own two hands!

530
00:22:57,903 --> 00:22:59,636
[RIAS] You're a
complete war maniac.

531
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,903
[KOKABIEL] Obviously!

532
00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:03,536
Why do you think
I'm using devils this time?

533
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:07,803
I've got you, Rias Gremory--
Lucifer's little sister.

534
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:11,869
Then I also have Sona
Sitri--Leviathan's sister.

535
00:23:12,836 --> 00:23:14,236
I have no doubt that there is

536
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:15,603
an abundance of
power hanging over

537
00:23:15,636 --> 00:23:17,369
the school the
two of you attend.

538
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:19,469
It'll make the perfect war zone.

539
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:21,836
I know I will
enjoy it immensely.

540
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:22,836
That's insane!

541
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,503
Yeah, if by 'insane' you
mean totally 'effed up!

542
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:27,869
[FREED]
Hahahaha!

543
00:23:27,903 --> 00:23:29,536
Don't you just love it

544
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:32,536
when he lets his
psychotic side shine?

545
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:35,303
I'm starting to get
excited about war, too!

546
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:36,169
And look!

547
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:38,903
I even have toys
to bring to the party!

548
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:40,703
[KONEKO] Holy Swords.

549
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:44,403
[ISSEI] Does that mean all the
swords he has are Excaliburs?

550
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:45,769
[AKENO]
That's what it looks like.

551
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:46,969
[SAJI] Shit-balls.

552
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:48,669
The fun part is
that every one of them

553
00:23:48,703 --> 00:23:50,869
is in hyper state
and ready to be used.

554
00:23:50,903 --> 00:23:52,403
Who's your daddy?

555
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:54,336
[chuckles]

556
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:56,369
And I scored this

557
00:23:56,403 --> 00:23:58,803
Holy Sword of Mimicry,
Excalibur Mimic!

558
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:03,469
[FREED] It was a gift from that
sweet little girl in pigtails.

559
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:07,469
[KOKABIEL]
Oh, don't act so surprised.

560
00:24:07,503 --> 00:24:10,669
What do you say, dear little
sister of the Devil King?

561
00:24:10,703 --> 00:24:12,803
Nice day for a war, isn't it?

562
00:24:13,836 --> 00:24:15,903
Everyone! Leave now!

563
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:22,369
I can't see
where he went!

564
00:24:22,403 --> 00:24:23,836
[KONEKO] I saw him go that way.

565
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:26,369
They're headed
toward the academy.

566
00:24:26,403 --> 00:24:28,369
[ISSEI] They're gonna
destroy the entire school.

567
00:24:28,403 --> 00:24:29,503
[SONA] Guys.

568
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:31,803
They said that they were
going to start at the academy,

569
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:33,836
but it probably
won't be ending there.

570
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:34,669
[RIAS] True.

571
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:36,369
[ISSEI] Now what?

572
00:24:36,903 --> 00:24:38,903
No telling what
he'll do exactly.

573
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,436
But it would be very easy

574
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:42,969
for a fallen angel of
that class to wipe us out.

575
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:44,469
Like the whole town?

576
00:24:51,903 --> 00:24:52,836
[ISSEI] This is bullshit.

577
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:55,503
Don't fuck with me,
you fallen angel dicks!

578
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,336
Try it and I swear, it'll be
the last thing you ever do!

579
00:24:58,369 --> 00:24:59,303
It's time.

580
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:01,203
We need to make our
way toward the school.

581
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:02,936
[ISSEI] On it!

582
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,869
[sinister laughter]

583
00:25:07,903 --> 00:25:11,436
[VALPER] This'll be fun.
I can't wait!

584
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:19,503
[VALPER] Today is the day all
my dreams finally come true.

585
00:26:58,803 --> 00:27:00,369
[ISSEI] Yo, Issei here!

586
00:27:00,403 --> 00:27:02,903
We're starting our fight
with Kokabiel without Kiba!

587
00:27:02,936 --> 00:27:03,736
Come on, guys!

588
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:06,936
It's time to protect
the whole town!

589
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:09,903
Next time, "Decisive
Battle at Kuoh Academy!"

590
00:27:09,936 --> 00:27:11,936
Move forward, Mush Melons!
