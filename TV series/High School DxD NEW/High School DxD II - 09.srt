1
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:17,466
[ISSEI] In here?

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,033
[ASIA] That's where
the other Bishop is?

3
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:22,533
[RIAS] Last night,
my brother insisted

4
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:24,100
for me to release the seal,

5
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,633
and allow the Bishop
to leave this area.

6
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:30,166
I'm not sure why, but the
Bishop refused the offer.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,066
So this one's
literally a shut-in.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,333
Such a shame really,

9
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,533
considering the child used to
be the largest earner we had.

10
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:37,133
No way!
You can't be serious!

11
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,800
With special contracts.

12
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,100
The Bishop used a
computer to make them.

13
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,666
Which means the
power this Bishop had

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,200
must have been
fairly dangerous

15
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,033
if it needed to
be locked away.

16
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:50,566
And the seal
has been broken.

17
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,433
All right, let's see
how this goes.

18
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,666
[high-pitched scream]

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,633
[ISSEI] What the hell?

20
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,100
[RIAS] Hello.

21
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:06,100
I'm glad to see
you're looking well.

22
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,233
[GASPER] I don't
understand what's going on!

23
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:11,100
[RIAS] The seal has been broken.

24
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:13,400
So you're free to come
home with us now, okay?

25
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:15,700
[GASPER] No, I don't
want to ever leave here!

26
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:18,400
The outside is too scary!

27
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:21,100
[ISSEI] What?
She's just a little girl!

28
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:21,733
And look!

29
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:23,233
She looks a lot like Asia.

30
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:24,166
Does that mean all Bishops

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,633
have to be pretty
blondes or something?

32
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,600
[ISSEI] Hey! What's so funny?

33
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:30,133
[RIAS] The child is a boy.

34
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,566
[ISSEI] Eh?

35
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:36,200
[ISSEI] Uh, wait.
What did you say?

36
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:38,400
[RIAS] I realize he
may look like a girl.

37
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:41,633
But he is most
definitely a little boy.

38
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:45,333
[AKENO] As you've noticed,

39
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:47,600
he does like to dress
up like a girl, though.

40
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,700
[RIAS] Everyone say
hello to Gasper Bloody.

41
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,566
The other Bishop
in my household.

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,733
He's a first year student, here.

43
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:58,733
And before I had the honor
of turning him into a devil,

44
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:02,200
this little guy was actually
half human-half vampire.

45
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:04,433
[ASIA] What?
He's a real vampire?

46
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:07,333
[ISSEI] As in a bloodsucker?
You're kidding?

47
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:44,182
[ISSEI] He's not a girl?
What the hell?

48
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:46,082
Oh, God, why have
you forsaken me?

49
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:48,815
[ASIA] Technically, I think
you're the one who forsake.

50
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,782
[ISSEI] You look way too hot
in chick's clothes, dude.

51
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,282
And plus, if you
don't go anywhere,

52
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,582
who are you dressing for?

53
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:56,115
Um. I-- For me, I guess.

54
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:58,549
I just think these clothes
are cuter, that's all.

55
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:01,482
Don't pull that
adorable bullshit on me!

56
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:04,482
[ISSEI] When I first saw you,
it was like a dream

57
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:07,682
of two beautiful blond bombshell
Bishops had come true.

58
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,349
He's all those things,
too, you know;

59
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,149
he's just a boy.

60
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:12,182
Hey, Gasper.

61
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:14,682
Why don't you come with
us outside, now? Okay?

62
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:17,082
I don't wanna;
please don't make me!

63
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:20,349
Come on, dude, let's go;
you heard the lady.

64
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:23,682
[ISSEI] What?

65
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:26,115
[GASPER] I'm sorry,
I made you mad, didn't I?

66
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:28,415
Please don't hit me;
oh please; I didn't mean it!

67
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:29,382
Was that just me,

68
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,549
or did you guys feel
something weird, too?

69
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:34,115
I did, and I'm pretty
sure he's behind it.

70
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,515
It looks like the
Forbidden Balor View to me.

71
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:40,582
[AKENO] Also known as The Evil
Eye that Stops the World.

72
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:43,482
It's Gasper's Sacred Gear.

73
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:44,449
[KONEKO] When he
gets too excited,

74
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:46,449
he can stop whatever
he happens to be looking

75
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:49,549
at in that moment for
a certain amount of time.

76
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:53,715
[AKENO] Unfortunately, Gasper
couldn't control his power,

77
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:55,382
so Sir Zechs decided
that he should be

78
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:58,182
sealed away here as
a precautionary measure.

79
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,482
[RIAS] On top of that,

80
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:02,415
his ability seems to grow
stronger unconsciously,

81
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,415
so there's a distinct
possibility it could

82
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:06,449
become a Balance Breaker.

83
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:08,549
What? Isn't that good?

84
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:12,382
[GASPER] I don't
like it when you guys

85
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,615
talk about me like I'm not here.

86
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,649
Why can't you just ignore
that I'm alive like normal!

87
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:18,815
[ASIA] How'd he get there?

88
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:21,349
Wow man, you are
not very good at hiding.

89
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:22,782
Come out!

90
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,549
[GASPER] Leave me alone!

91
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:25,315
I'm not hiding;
I'd just rather be

92
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:28,082
a Gasper-in-a-box
than be around you all!

93
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:30,249
So I take it he's shy.

94
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:31,049
Um, Rias.

95
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,815
I think it's about
time for us to go.

96
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,182
Yes, you're right.

97
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:35,049
If you'll excuse us,

98
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:37,115
Akeno and I must
leave to go to a meeting

99
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:39,082
about getting ready
for the leaders' summit.

100
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:40,215
Kiba?

101
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:41,549
Yes, how can I help?

102
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:42,849
[RIAS] My brother said he wants

103
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:44,515
to know more about
your Balance Breaker.

104
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:45,749
I'd like for you to join us,

105
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:47,449
as long as you're free, that is.

106
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:48,749
Yes, I'm free.

107
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,149
Wonderful, thank you.

108
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:52,249
Now, everyone else, I'd like you

109
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:54,782
to take over Gasper's
training until we get back.

110
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,249
How are we
supposed to do that?

111
00:05:57,282 --> 00:05:58,582
[GASPER] No!

112
00:05:58,615 --> 00:06:00,215
[XENOVIA] Do you
call this running?

113
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:01,515
If you don't move
those legs faster,

114
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:04,549
you'll wind up
Durandal's next victim.

115
00:06:04,582 --> 00:06:07,215
[ISSEI] It just looks like
she's a vampire hunter.

116
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:09,515
I don't understand

117
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,615
why you have to
be so mean to me.

118
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:14,549
[XENOVIA] A healthy mind
lives in a healthy body.

119
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,549
Trust me, you won't think

120
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:17,715
I'm so mean when
you're stronger.

121
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:20,215
[ISSEI] Well, at least
Xenovia looks like

122
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,449
she's having a good time.

123
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:22,515
[ASIA] Yeah, that's true.

124
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,349
It seems like she really
enjoys yelling at people.

125
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:27,149
I can't do this anymore!

126
00:06:27,182 --> 00:06:29,515
What you say doesn't matter
if my legs won't work!

127
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:31,615
[KONEKO] Gasper.

128
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:34,115
You'll feel better
immediately if you eat this.

129
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:36,849
No way!
You trying to kill me?

130
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:39,582
[KONEKO] This is
no time to be picky.

131
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,715
Come on, you can wash
it down with Holy Water.

132
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:43,315
[ASIA] Koneko seems to be
having fun training, too.

133
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:46,282
[ISSEI] Who knew she'd ever
care enough to tease someone?

134
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:48,649
Oh. Hey guys. Having fun?

135
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:49,715
Saji. What's up?

136
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:52,215
Heard Rias finally
released her dangerous Bishop,

137
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:54,182
so I wanted to check things out.

138
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,315
[SAJI] Another pretty blond?

139
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:59,815
Pretty but still
a dude, man.

140
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,082
[SAJI] A dude? Oh, why?

141
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:04,415
Why have I been forsaken so?

142
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,082
Yeah, right?
Believe me.

143
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:08,115
I know exactly
how you feel, Saji.

144
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:09,182
[AZAZEL] Well.

145
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:11,215
Don't tell me the
households of the Devil Kings

146
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:12,515
have all come out
to play together

147
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:15,149
because that would
be just too sweet.

148
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:16,749
Do you know
who he is, Issei?

149
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:19,115
Ah! Hello
there, Devil Boy.

150
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,549
Oh, sorry. I mean
Red Dragon Emperor.

151
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:22,482
You're looking well.

152
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:23,782
Hi, Azazel!

153
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,615
[SAJI] Whoa,
wait a minute, Issei.

154
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,215
That's Azazel?

155
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,382
Yeah, that's him.

156
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,382
I should know; I've met the
douche nozzle plenty of times.

157
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:36,515
You could come
at me all at once,

158
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:38,582
but that would
still end in failure.

159
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:39,449
Even low-ranking devils

160
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:41,649
such as yourselves
realize that much.

161
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:42,582
[ISSEI]
What do you want?

162
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:44,815
I figured I should
stop by to pay a visit.

163
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:46,749
Is that Holy
Devil Sword guy here?

164
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,449
[ISSEI] No,
Kiba's not here.

165
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:50,815
Word to the wise; you better
leave him the hell alone!

166
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:53,282
[DDRAIG] Boost!

167
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,582
[AZAZEL] Always the
feisty one, aren't you?

168
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:59,082
So, no Holy Sword
Devil guy, huh?

169
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:02,449
Boring! Hey, you,
adorable vampire!

170
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:06,782
[AZAZEL] Forbidden
Balor View, huh?

171
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:09,249
You know, this type of
Sacred Gear can wind up

172
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:13,249
extremely dangerous if the
user's capacity is too low.

173
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:14,482
And let me guess,

174
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:17,415
you've got the Black Dragon
Pulse, Absorption Line, right?

175
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:19,682
[AZAZEL] During practice,
you should get that one

176
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:21,682
to connect with the
vampire so he can take away

177
00:08:21,715 --> 00:08:24,349
all that extra power
no one can control.

178
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:26,082
You're welcome in advance.

179
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:27,615
Take away power?

180
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:28,815
You mean, I can do that?

181
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,182
[AZAZEL] Don't tell
me you didn't know!

182
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:34,849
Your Sacred Gear has the power
of the Evil Black Dragon King.

183
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,682
Otherwise known
as Prison Dragon,

184
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:37,582
it scatters the power

185
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:40,249
of whatever it comes
into contact with.

186
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:42,315
Of course, attaching
itself to something else

187
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:46,415
for a short period of
time is another perk.

188
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:48,415
This thing is more
badass than I thought.

189
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:49,682
Although, actually,
there is a faster

190
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:52,615
and simpler way to go about it.

191
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,149
He can drink the
Red Dragon Emperor's blood.

192
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:56,415
Hope you don't mean me,

193
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:58,349
because I don't
do vampire bites.

194
00:08:58,382 --> 00:08:59,549
[AZAZEL] Don't get mad at me.

195
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,315
He's the vampire.

196
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:02,182
The blood thing is best,

197
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:04,382
but I'm sure you
guys can figure it out.

198
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:06,149
Hold on a sec!

199
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:08,082
I wanna know why you
hid your real identity

200
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,082
when you first contacted me.

201
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,749
[AZAZEL] Oh, right.

202
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:15,682
That's just
kind of my thing.

203
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:21,549
[XENOVIA] So he's
the Governor-General

204
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:23,549
of the fallen angels?

205
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:26,082
I do not understand him.

206
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:30,315
Here we go!

207
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:34,549
'Kay. I'm ready.

208
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:38,615
All right,
then have at it!

209
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,649
[SAJI] Whoa, did
he just disappear?

210
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:45,315
[ISSEI] That's not how
this was supposed to work;

211
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:46,582
his goal was just
to stop the ball,

212
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:48,082
but he stopped us, too.

213
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:49,749
[KONEKO] Guess who was
about to run away again.

214
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:52,182
[GASPER] I'm sorry;
I didn't mean to.

215
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:54,315
This training would be
fairly difficult for anyone.

216
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:56,515
And his power isn't
helping much, either.

217
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:58,215
It's too strong
for his own good.

218
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:59,115
Poor guy.

219
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:00,515
Saji, do you think
you could take away

220
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:01,649
a little more from him?

221
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:03,115
Absolutely.

222
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:09,015
Awesome.

223
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:10,282
Thanks for helping us out, man.

224
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:11,815
Don't worry about it.

225
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:12,749
I mean, hey,
I'm the one who's got

226
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:15,115
to learn how to use
a new power, right?

227
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:15,915
True.

228
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,415
But I wonder why
Azazel helped us.

229
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,215
And what about that blood thing.

230
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:21,182
Ugh, the whole idea of
it just freaks me out.

231
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:23,415
Me too!
I hate blood so much!

232
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:24,649
[ISSEI] You what?
How does that work?

233
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:25,749
You're a vampire.

234
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:26,649
[GASPER] I can't help it!

235
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:28,315
The smell of blood
makes me wanna puke.

236
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:29,482
I hate that stuff!

237
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:32,249
You're like the
worst vampire ever.

238
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:35,149
Why are you so
mean to me, Koneko?

239
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:37,549
Wow, that whine
is killing my brain.

240
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,163
[RIAS] Gasper, please come out.

241
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:55,096
I want you to know
I never wanted you in here.

242
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,396
Hey, I'm sorry about this.

243
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,930
The last thing I wanted
to do was bug you

244
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:01,363
in the middle of
your big meeting.

245
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:02,330
No, don't worry.

246
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:03,996
It means a lot to me
that you're all working

247
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,030
so hard and want
the best for him.

248
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:08,163
[GASPER] I can't leave.

249
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:09,863
It's too scary out there!

250
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:12,163
I feel like we're just
making things worse, though.

251
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:14,596
Well, to be honest,
knowing Gasper's background,

252
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,963
there's only so much we can do.

253
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:18,196
How come?

254
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,063
Gasper's father
is a vampire

255
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,563
from a well-known and
distinguished family.

256
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:25,130
However, his mother
is a mere human.

257
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:26,596
Vampires are even more concerned

258
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,430
with pedigree than devils.

259
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:29,396
As a result,

260
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,430
Gasper was discriminated
against by everyone,

261
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:34,096
including his own family.

262
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,863
And sadly, when it
came to the human world,

263
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,930
he was treated like a monster.

264
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:43,130
Of course, that's all on
top of his power to stop time.

265
00:11:43,163 --> 00:11:46,130
A power he didn't have
the ability to control.

266
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,030
He wasn't just feared;
he was loathed.

267
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:51,263
A person can't know
what happens to them

268
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:53,063
when they've been frozen.

269
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:55,130
Naturally, nobody wants
to be near someone

270
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:56,530
with that kind of power.

271
00:11:56,563 --> 00:11:57,863
I get it, now.

272
00:11:57,896 --> 00:11:59,063
Sounds like Gasper and Asia have

273
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:01,330
a lot in common, don't they?

274
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:02,963
[RIAS] Yes, they do.

275
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:04,563
And like her, we know
he would never use

276
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:06,563
that power to do anything bad.

277
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,363
[GASPER] I wish
I couldn't do it.

278
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,863
I wish everyone wouldn't stop.

279
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,063
Then, they wouldn't
be so scared of me.

280
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:15,996
I hate it as much
as everyone else.

281
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,063
My friends freeze right
in front of my face,

282
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:19,863
and there's nothing
I can do about

283
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:22,230
what I'm making happen.

284
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:24,930
[RIAS] What kind
of king am I to him?

285
00:12:24,963 --> 00:12:26,196
Don't say that!

286
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,963
Listen Rias, I can
take care of this.

287
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:30,530
You can count on me!

288
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:32,296
Thank you, Issei.

289
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,363
This is so huge!

290
00:12:33,396 --> 00:12:34,363
Finally, there's someone around

291
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:35,996
younger than me who's a guy!

292
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,263
And I gotta keep it that way!

293
00:12:41,263 --> 00:12:42,163
I guess that's true.

294
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,096
All right, I'll let
you take care of it.

295
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,130
I got this in the bag!

296
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:55,930
[ISSEI] All right,
Gasper. It's on.

297
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:57,063
I'm not moving from this spot

298
00:12:57,096 --> 00:12:59,163
until you get your
ass out of there.

299
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,863
Oh yes, I understand.

300
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:02,063
Of course, of course.

301
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:04,430
I'll be one hundred
percent fine; I promise.

302
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:07,263
All right, well then
I wish you good luck! Bye.

303
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,096
That was Issei.

304
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,196
He said he won't be
able to come home tonight.

305
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,363
So it's a test
of endurance

306
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:14,930
until Gasper finally
comes out, huh?

307
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:16,430
I know this is
the way he wants it,

308
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,196
but I still feel bad
leaving Issei to deal

309
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,230
with Gasper all by himself.

310
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:22,030
Really? 'Cause
I don't at all.

311
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:23,363
Well, our options
are limited;

312
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:25,930
what could we possibly
do to help him?

313
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:30,063
[XENOVIA] Sorry.

314
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:32,396
I'm even borrowing
your bathroom.

315
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,430
[KONEKO] I apologize for
having to be included, too.

316
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:39,230
[ASIA] It's better than just
talking for a long time outside.

317
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:40,663
[XENOVIA] But why did you want

318
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,896
to discuss this in the bathroom?

319
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:46,330
[ASIA] I heard someone
talking once about

320
00:13:46,363 --> 00:13:49,363
what they called a
"bare-all relationship."

321
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:53,930
[XENOVIA] Oh?

322
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:55,863
I've never heard of that before.

323
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:56,796
[KONEKO] It's a little off,

324
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,596
but I suppose it's
not technically wrong.

325
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,696
[XENOVIA] I see.

326
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,163
So we can deepen our friendship

327
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:07,463
while discussing what
to do about Gasper.

328
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:09,396
We'd kill two birds
with one stone.

329
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,096
[ASIA] That's right!

330
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:14,963
[XENOVIA] I sweat a
lot chasing after Gasper,

331
00:14:14,996 --> 00:14:16,963
so I'm glad we have
the chance to take a bath.

332
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:18,430
Xenovia and
Koneko, I have to say

333
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:20,596
I'm impressed with how
hard you both worked.

334
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,863
[XENOVIA] No, that's nothing
compared to Issei's enthusiasm.

335
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,096
What's really
impressive to me

336
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,363
is that he's still working hard

337
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:28,496
all by himself
for Gasper's sake.

338
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,496
[KONEKO] I guess
no one can ever say

339
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,330
hat Issei doesn't care
a lot about his friends.

340
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:34,263
[XENOVIA] I'm beginning
to understand that.

341
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:36,096
Especially because
the only reason I'm able

342
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,096
to be with you guys
in the first place is due

343
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,863
to Issei wanting to
save his friend Kiba.

344
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:43,863
[KONEKO] He really
is a good person,

345
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:46,330
except for that
whole pervert thing.

346
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:48,330
[ASIA] Speaking of Gasper,
I'm confused

347
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:51,063
because I thought vampires
could only be active at night,

348
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:53,563
but Gasper seemed perfectly
fine to me, you know?

349
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:55,396
[KONEKO] It seems
Gaspie has the blood

350
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,996
of the Daywalker
vampires in him,

351
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,196
so that conveniently
explains that.

352
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,196
[XENOVIA] As I thought.

353
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,996
I had actually figured
as much already myself.

354
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,130
What's a Daywalker vampire?

355
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:07,063
[XENOVIA] A special
type of vampire,

356
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:09,363
one who's resistant to the sun.

357
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:10,230
Yeah.

358
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:12,930
He doesn't necessarily
like the sun,

359
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:15,996
but it doesn't seem to
impede his movements, either.

360
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,996
[ASIA] Oh yeah,
I guess that makes sense.

361
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,030
So I've been thinking about
what we could do for Gasper.

362
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:22,296
[XENOVIA] Me too.

363
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,196
And, the biggest problem right
now is his extreme misanthropy.

364
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,563
Having him run
from place to place

365
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:28,530
isn't technically training.

366
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:31,330
[KONEKO] That's true.
That is the first thing.

367
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,430
[ASIA] Um...

368
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:34,163
[XENOVIA] What is it?

369
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:35,930
Did you think of
something, Asia?

370
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:36,896
No.

371
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,596
That's not what I was
just thinking about.

372
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,296
I kinda realized I'm not very
good around people at first,

373
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,363
either, so I think
I understand how he must feel.

374
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:48,030
[ASIA] I'm okay on
the phone in general,

375
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:49,230
but when it comes
to face to face,

376
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:53,263
and I can't tell you why,
I still get completely nervous.

377
00:15:56,396 --> 00:15:58,330
Face to face, huh?

378
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,863
[ISSEI] Hey. Are you scared?

379
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:10,030
I mean of your Sacred Gear,
and us for that matter.

380
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:11,963
I've got a dragon in me.

381
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:15,196
He's supposed to be the
strongest one in the world, too.

382
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,496
It can be frightening.

383
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,463
And every time
I use that power.

384
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,963
I feel like, well,
like a part of me

385
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:24,263
is turning into something else.

386
00:16:24,296 --> 00:16:26,030
It's scary as hell.

387
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:28,296
But I refuse to
let fear stop me.

388
00:16:29,063 --> 00:16:30,930
[GASPER] But don't you worry

389
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:32,330
about the things
you care about most?

390
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:34,996
You might lose them
all because of your power.

391
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,930
I don't understand how you can

392
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:38,630
keep going without
any doubts like that.

393
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:39,930
Well, I'm kinda stupid,

394
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:42,230
so I might not get
the whole picture.

395
00:16:42,263 --> 00:16:43,863
It's just--

396
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:45,396
[GASPER] Just what?

397
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,196
I've seen Rias cry.

398
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,496
I never want to again.

399
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,196
[ISSEI] My friends had
been defeated one by one,

400
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,630
and in the end,
I was the only one left.

401
00:16:54,663 --> 00:16:56,930
But I wasn't in great shape.

402
00:16:58,063 --> 00:17:00,263
[ISSEI] I honestly
don't remember much of it,

403
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:02,263
except for Rias's tears.

404
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:05,396
I think they've been burned
into my heart forever.

405
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,496
That was the hardest thing
I've ever had to watch.

406
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,963
[GASPER] Oh. I've heard
about that fight.

407
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:12,830
I'm sorry.

408
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:14,930
I was locked in
here when it happened.

409
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:15,963
[ISSEI] I don't blame you, man,

410
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:18,630
but things'll be different
from now on, right?

411
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,630
[GASPER] Maybe.

412
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,163
If I'm there, though,

413
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:23,163
I'll only bother
everyone anyway.

414
00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:24,363
[ISSEI] You don't bother me.

415
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:25,363
Not even a little.

416
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:26,263
[GASPER] Huh?

417
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,163
[ISSEI] You're like
my little brother,

418
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:29,230
even though you've
been a devil longer.

419
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:31,463
But what's most important
is that you're my friend.

420
00:17:31,496 --> 00:17:32,463
You mean it?

421
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:35,130
You bet I do.
Help me out.

422
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:38,030
Lend me your power
so we can support Rias,

423
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:39,963
and I promise,
if anything scares you,

424
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:41,863
I'll blow that sucker away!

425
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,130
I dunno.

426
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:46,630
What about
drinking my blood?

427
00:17:46,663 --> 00:17:48,463
You wanna see if that works?

428
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:50,263
What if he's right?

429
00:17:50,296 --> 00:17:51,996
If it works, you might be
able to control your power more.

430
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,396
No, it's too scary!

431
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,430
I don't like drinking
blood from living things.

432
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:58,296
It takes everything
I've got just to drink blood

433
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,630
from transfusions
every once in a while.

434
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,396
Besides, I'm already
terrified of this stupid power.

435
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,563
If it somehow got worse,

436
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:06,363
I don't think I could handle it.

437
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:08,163
It's too much.

438
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:09,863
[ISSEI] Wow,
is it really that bad?

439
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:10,930
Weird, right?

440
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:13,263
Because I'm totally
jealous of what you can do.

441
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:14,163
What?

442
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:15,396
You're really jealous of me?

443
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,496
Being able to stop time

444
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,230
would be amazing as hell!

445
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,430
Oh yeah. Yeah.

446
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:22,296
Imagine all the girls' skirts
I'd be able to peek under!

447
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,463
So much panty time!

448
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:26,496
On top of that,
I could freeze Rias

449
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,496
and play big ol' boobie
bonanza whenever I wanted!

450
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,963
And don't forget about Akeno;

451
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:33,530
I'd have a full-on
nipple-palooza with her!

452
00:18:35,996 --> 00:18:38,130
Imagination blue balls!

453
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,163
Sorry. I'm a perv.

454
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:44,163
[GASPER] That's true.

455
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:46,896
But you're a nice perv.

456
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,096
No one's said they were
jealous of me before.

457
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,963
You even have a
good reason for it.

458
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,263
I don't know why,
but it makes me feel better.

459
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:55,263
Yeah, well, uh--

460
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:56,496
It's funny.

461
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,096
You're jealous of
something I've believed

462
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,463
for my entire life
that I needed to hate.

463
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:01,896
[ISSEI] You fool!

464
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,163
You and I are the
bearers of Sacred Gears,

465
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:06,563
Gasper, and we will
never escape this fate!

466
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:08,930
It's time for you to
learn to accept your path.

467
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,196
That is, unless
you want to be afraid

468
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,430
for the rest of your life!

469
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:16,963
Believe it or not.

470
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:19,263
I have a goal with the
Red Dragon Emperor's power.

471
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:20,463
There has to be
a way I can use it

472
00:19:20,496 --> 00:19:22,296
to boost Rias's boobs!

473
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,330
Her meat loaves will be

474
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,396
like nothing ever seen before!

475
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:30,130
Oh, I think
you're amazing, Issei!

476
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:31,563
You bear this
legendary power,

477
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:33,630
but instead of being afraid
of that responsibility,

478
00:19:33,663 --> 00:19:36,096
you're ignorantly positive! Wow.

479
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,496
I wish I could be more
blinded to reality like that!

480
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,263
It's like your
depraved carnal desires

481
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:43,196
somehow give you this
unbelievable courage!

482
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:45,096
Oh, stop, you.

483
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,530
You're making me blush, man.

484
00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:47,563
Y'know, I'm not sure why,

485
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:49,130
but finding out you can be brave

486
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:50,996
makes me feel
kinda courageous, too!

487
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,630
Thanks, that's
cool of you to say.

488
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:54,596
If you like that, then get this.

489
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,230
In an epic twist of fate,

490
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,530
my right hand
has actually groped

491
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,296
both of Rias's breasts!

492
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,230
What? Both of them, really?

493
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,296
That's amazing.
So did she hit you,

494
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,930
or like, did she
ask you to do it?

495
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,363
You wanna know
something completely insane.

496
00:20:09,396 --> 00:20:12,963
The idea of boosting her
boobs came from Sir Zechs.

497
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:14,263
[GASPER] I bet his
power could even twist

498
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,996
the possibilities of Longinus,

499
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,196
a man who stabbed God himself!

500
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,130
He really does care
about the greater good;

501
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:22,030
our Devil King is the best!

502
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:22,963
I know.

503
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:24,363
He's a pimp, and I
plan on following him

504
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:26,130
for the rest of my life.

505
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:27,163
[KIBA] Look at you two.

506
00:20:27,196 --> 00:20:28,263
Nice work, Issei.

507
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:29,430
[ISSEI] Hey! Welcome back.

508
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:30,930
And Gasper,
you seem to be

509
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,330
quite a bit more
comfortable now.

510
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:33,630
Dude, perfect timing!

511
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,163
While talking to
Gasper, I've come up

512
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:36,863
with a kick-ass
team-play by the boys

513
00:20:36,896 --> 00:20:38,996
of the House of Gremory
that you are gonna love!

514
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,896
Oh yeah?

515
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,963
Sounds like a good
time to me; I'm in.

516
00:20:41,996 --> 00:20:43,496
[ISSEI] Get this:
I'll transfer my stored power

517
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,330
to Gasper, and then,
Gasper will stop time!

518
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:48,630
All right, cool!
And after that?

519
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:49,930
This is the best part.

520
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:51,063
After the girls get frozen,

521
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:53,363
I'm gonna grope them like crazy!

522
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,863
Okay, if that's the case,

523
00:20:56,896 --> 00:20:59,230
then you're not technically
going to need me, are you?

524
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,330
[ISSEI] Are you serious?

525
00:21:00,363 --> 00:21:01,330
Of course I will.

526
00:21:01,363 --> 00:21:03,530
While I'm pervving out,
we might get attacked.

527
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:04,363
You're gonna have to use

528
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,196
your Balance Breaker
to protect me!

529
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,896
eah.

530
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,563
This is the perfect team-play.

531
00:21:10,196 --> 00:21:11,630
Now, listen, Issei.

532
00:21:11,663 --> 00:21:13,030
Normally, you know I would do

533
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,630
practically anything for you.

534
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:15,663
But you might want to think

535
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:17,863
about how this would
affect us in the long run.

536
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:18,796
[ISSEI] You shut up, Kiba!

537
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,896
And don't look at me
like I'm some freak!

538
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,996
It's easy for you!

539
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,196
No one's ever told you
that just making eye contact

540
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,496
with them was creepy!

541
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,163
And you!

542
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:27,530
You're back inside the box.

543
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:29,196
How come? What's that about!

544
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,363
Oh. I'm sorry.

545
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:32,963
If I'm talking to people,
I just feel better in here.

546
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:34,863
But hey, don't
take it personally.

547
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:36,296
I didn't close the top, right?

548
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,863
No, but that doesn't
really make it not weird.

549
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:40,063
Gasper, you know
that it's time

550
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:41,963
to get over these fears.

551
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,430
You're not sealed away any more.

552
00:21:43,463 --> 00:21:45,530
Yeah. I know.

553
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:46,563
[XENOVIA] How nice.

554
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,196
You all seem to
be getting along.

555
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,063
[KIBA] Hey.

556
00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:49,963
[ISSEI] What's going on?

557
00:21:49,996 --> 00:21:50,963
Why are you three here?

558
00:21:50,996 --> 00:21:52,330
And why all together?

559
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:54,996
Well, after leaving, and
after talking about it,

560
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,130
we decided to do what we could

561
00:21:56,163 --> 00:21:58,496
to help take care
of Gasper, as well.

562
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,096
And then,
we brainstormed

563
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,896
several different ideas
that might help him

564
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,496
deal with his life better.

565
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,996
You all want to help me?

566
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,196
Of course, you're our
precious companion, too.

567
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,296
Thank you, Koneko!

568
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,430
[KONEKO] These are for you.

569
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,163
Aaaaaaah!!!

570
00:22:13,196 --> 00:22:15,330
No! It's garlic!

571
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:21,130
You like that?

572
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:23,963
[GASPER] Maybe. I feel calmer.

573
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,863
I think I do like it.

574
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:28,230
[KIBA] Uh, what
just happened here?

575
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,963
[KONEKO] It was Asia's idea,
and it was a good one.

576
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:32,463
Yeah? You really
came up with that?

577
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:34,230
Well, not exactly.

578
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:35,196
I know I'm not especially good

579
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,063
at talking to people
face to face, either.

580
00:22:38,096 --> 00:22:40,430
But on the phone,
I seem to handle things okay.

581
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:42,030
I just mentioned to
them that as long as

582
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:43,996
my face wasn't seen,
other people seemed

583
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,396
to be a lot easier to deal with.

584
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,196
[XENOVIA] That's when
I remembered I had these.

585
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,130
Then I thought,

586
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:52,330
"What if we put
something over his head?"

587
00:22:53,196 --> 00:22:55,163
Why are you still
carrying these around?

588
00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:56,630
[GASPER] How is it?

589
00:22:56,663 --> 00:22:59,163
Does it make me look cool?

590
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:02,930
[KIBA] It has an
indescribable impact, Gasper.

591
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:03,896
[XENOVIA] Yeah, he's right.

592
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,230
Indescribable impact
like the fear one has

593
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:08,030
when walking down an alley.

594
00:23:08,063 --> 00:23:09,396
In the dark and alone.

595
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,296
[GASPER] This is fun.
I like it a lot!

596
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,396
]]You know.

597
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,263
You seem to be pretty
amazing yourself right now.

598
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:17,163
[GASPER] You think?

599
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,230
Oh, I wonder if wearing this

600
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,363
will help me get a better
reputation as a vampire!

601
00:23:20,396 --> 00:23:22,530
[ISSEI thinking]
Somehow, I doubt that.

602
00:23:23,463 --> 00:23:24,896
[GASPER] Thank you
so much, guys.

603
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,363
You're the best!

604
00:23:30,904 --> 00:23:32,904
[ISSEI] Would've been cool if
Gasper could've come to class.

605
00:23:32,938 --> 00:23:35,071
But I guess he can't
wearing a paper bag.

606
00:23:35,104 --> 00:23:37,771
[ASIA] I think it's just
gonna take him a little time.

607
00:23:37,804 --> 00:23:38,871
Hey, guys.

608
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:40,804
Hi, ladies;
what's going on?

609
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:42,104
It's good to see you.

610
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:44,571
[RIAS] Perfect timing, as usual.

611
00:23:44,604 --> 00:23:45,538
So Issei.

612
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:46,438
I've been looking for you to see

613
00:23:46,471 --> 00:23:47,738
if you might possibly come

614
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:49,504
with me somewhere
after school today.

615
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:51,371
You want me?

616
00:24:02,471 --> 00:24:03,571
[ISSEI] Isn't a
shrine like going

617
00:24:03,604 --> 00:24:04,904
to an away game for a devil?

618
00:24:04,938 --> 00:24:06,704
[AKENO] Hello, Issei.

619
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:07,871
Thanks for coming.

620
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,704
[ISSEI] Hey, Akeno!

621
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:11,138
Please forgive me.

622
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:14,471
I apologize for the
sudden invitation.

623
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:15,438
[ISSEI] Oh, no problem.

624
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:16,604
Where's the President?

625
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:18,071
[AKENO] Right now,
she's finishing up

626
00:24:18,104 --> 00:24:20,038
her last meeting with Sir Zechs.

627
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:21,938
She'll be here
right after that's over.

628
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:24,771
[ISSEI] So, does that mean you
didn't have to be there, too?

629
00:24:24,804 --> 00:24:26,371
No, I did not;

630
00:24:26,404 --> 00:24:28,671
I had another job
with a certain someone.

631
00:24:28,704 --> 00:24:30,638
Yeah? Like who?

632
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,904
[ISSEI] I think
I have to stop here.

633
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:37,371
[AKENO] Don't worry;
we'll be fine

634
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:39,138
in this place even
if we are devils.

635
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:40,571
After all, we have a bit

636
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,438
of a special agreement
behind the scenes.

637
00:24:50,804 --> 00:24:51,704
[ISSEI] Go figure there'd be

638
00:24:51,738 --> 00:24:53,738
such a cool shrine
in a place like this.

639
00:24:53,771 --> 00:24:55,471
After its
previous god left,

640
00:24:55,504 --> 00:24:57,904
it remained
unoccupied for a while.

641
00:24:57,938 --> 00:24:59,471
Then, Rias managed to find a way

642
00:24:59,504 --> 00:25:01,371
to get a hold of
this place for me.

643
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:04,471
[VOICE] So this is
the Red Dragon Emperor?

644
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,771
[ISSEI] Hey! Who's there?

645
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:08,838
[VOICE] Issei Hyodo.

646
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:10,738
It's nice to meet you.

647
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:18,671
[ISSEI] That dude
totally has gold wings.

648
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:23,104
[MICHAEL] I am Michael.

649
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:26,504
Otherwise known as
the Chief of the Angels.

650
00:26:58,171 --> 00:26:59,738
[ISSEI] Yo, Issei here!

651
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:02,004
The leaders of the three-way
deadlock are gathering?

652
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,738
During that time, I found
out about Akeno's past,

653
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:07,704
and there seem to be a lot of
different ups and downs!

654
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:10,504
Next time,
"Various three-way deadlocks!"

655
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:11,804
Bend it like Breasthams!
