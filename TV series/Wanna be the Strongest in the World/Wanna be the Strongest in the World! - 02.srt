1
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,875
I'll go pro if
that's what it takes.

2
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:12,791
And as a pro wrestler,
I'll challenge you and win!

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,666
Now it's getting
interesting!

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,208
[cheers and applause]

5
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,916
[AIKA, YUHO, and NANAMI sigh]

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,041
[SAKURA] I know I'll be
putting the group in a bind

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,125
by doing this.

8
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,375
But there's no way
I'm backing down.

9
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,333
Beating that Kazama creep
isn't just something

10
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,791
I have to do for myself,
but for all of us!

11
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,791
What exactly
do you mean?

12
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,500
She insulted idols!

13
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:41,000
So who better to show
her up than Sweet Diva?

14
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,625
Well, in that case, go kick
some ass and take some names.

15
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,166
[gasps]

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,750
So you're okay with this?

17
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:54,333
But Sweet Diva'll lose its lead
vocal if you let Sakura leave!

18
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,083
Elena wouldn't want
this to happen.

19
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,875
I just know that
she wouldn't.

20
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,250
[SAKURA gasps]

21
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,833
Elena...

22
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,375
[NANAMI] Ah! It's her!

23
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,875
[REPORTER 2A] Elena!
[SAKURA gasps]

24
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,833
[REPORTER 2A]
Tell us, isn't it a huge blow

25
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:11,333
for your group to lose its
lead vocalist like this?

26
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,625
If you could say anything
to Sakura right now,

27
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,458
what would it be?

28
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,875
[SAKURA gasps]

29
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,500
Don't worry, I'll lead
Sweet Diva while you're away,

30
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,875
and I'll do whatever
needs to be done.

31
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,500
[REPORTER 2A] Well...
Does this mean

32
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,583
you'll be filling the vacant
position that Sakura left?

33
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,625
Sweet Diva's lead vocalist will
always be Sakura, but as for me.

34
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,375
I'll do what I need to
do until she returns.

35
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,541
[MAKOTO sighs]

36
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,375
Oh, Elena.

37
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,708
[SAKURA] I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this,

38
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,750
Mr. Inoba!
I won't let you down!

39
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,083
Thank you so much!

40
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,833
Please, there's no need to
thank me, Miss Hagiwara.

41
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,250
All I ask is that you
take this seriously.

42
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,833
If you want to become a pro,
you have to train like one,

43
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,041
and that means practicing
morning, noon, and night

44
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,250
while you're here.

45
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,875
Of course!

46
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,875
Now that's the spirit.

47
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:34,625
Nishihara!

48
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,333
[SAKURA] Eh?

49
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,541
[RYO] Mm?

50
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,416
[INOBA] This rookie is
in need of training.

51
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,250
I'm leaving that to you.

52
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,541
Then I'll show her
the ropes, sir.

53
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,875
I'm the team's coach,
Ryo Nishihara.

54
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,750
[SAKURA]
So pleased to meet you!

55
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,750
[RYO] Alright.
Let's see if she's all talk.

56
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,333
[RYO]
Training starts now.

57
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,541
Let's hit the gym and
see what you've got.

58
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,208
Follow me.

59
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,750
[SAKURA] Heh! Right!

60
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,041
[door opens, closes]

61
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,666
[BERSERK TRAINEE 2A]
Did you guys hear?

62
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,166
That idol's training
with us today.

63
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,125
[BERSERK TRAINEE 2B] Why?
She's just gonna suck and quit.

64
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,708
Probably another
publicity stunt.

65
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,750
[BERSERK TRAINEE 2C] Ryo's been
assigned as her coach.

66
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,000
[BERSERK TRAINEE 2A] Yikes!

67
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,791
Then I doubt she's gonna
make it through the day!

68
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:16,875
Good morning, coach.

69
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,916
Did that idol even
bother to show up?

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,583
Ah!

71
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:28,291
[SAKURA grunts]

72
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,041
[RYO] Nice.

73
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,333
Now take a quick breather.

74
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,666
Holy crap, coach.

75
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,791
Did she just do the
twenty set course?

76
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,375
You made the newbie do the
same routine that we do?

77
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,416
That's right.

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,208
Plus a thousand squats.

79
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,375
And she just finished doing
a hundred push-ups, too.

80
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,541
No way!

81
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,708
I can't believe it!

82
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,250
[RYO] Neither can I.
Especially from a pop idol.

83
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,208
Singing and dancing might be
a waste of her real talent.

84
00:04:53,291 --> 00:05:05,041
[SAKURA grunts]

85
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,291
Hey, you three!

86
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,041
Stop gawking and start
training immediately!

87
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,416
[TRAINEES]
Uh! Right!

88
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,416
[SAKURA grunts]

89
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,000
[SAKURA]
This is rough!

90
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,250
And I thought dance
lessons were hard!

91
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,916
What did I know?

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,708
But I can't give up.

93
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,875
I made a commitment,
and I'm gonna stick to it!

94
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:33,333
[RYO] Hm. Gotta admit
she's impressed me.

95
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,666
But still...

96
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,166
She's got a long way to go.

97
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,958
[RYO] Hey, who said
you could rest?

98
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,333
It's sparring time!

99
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,333
[SAKURA] Huh?

100
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,666
[RYO] Hurry up and
get in the ring!

101
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,750
[RYO]
First, the throws!

102
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,125
[RYO] Backdrop!

103
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,208
[SAKURA] Aaahhh!

104
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,500
Holy--A power move
already, coach?

105
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,750
[BERSERK TRAINEE 2B] That's a
little harsh to use on a newbie!

106
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,208
She's with the
big girls now,

107
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,041
she's gotta learn
how hard they'll hit.

108
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,750
Now joint holds!

109
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,000
Arm bar lock!

110
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,500
[SAKURA yells]

111
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,375
[RYO]
Spinning toe hold!

112
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,666
[SAKURA] Noo! Ow!

113
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,291
Those moves
are so painful.

114
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,666
Ryo's got some
diabolical ones.

115
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,666
Yeah, but the worst
are her choke holds.

116
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,708
She wouldn't use those
on a rookie, would she?

117
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,458
And next up are
the choke-holds!

118
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,458
[gasps]

119
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,250
[RYO]
This is a triangle choke!

120
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:34,125
[SAKURA yells]

121
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,833
And this next one is the...

00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,666
...S-T-F!

123
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,875
Aaahhh!

124
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:49,916
[rapid breathing]

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,166
What's the matter,
is this too much for you?

126
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,708
Of course it is!

127
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,916
Go easy on her, Ryo, even we
can't take punishment like that!

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,666
I'd be ticked if I had to
train some prissy idol, too,

129
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,958
but she's not even an athlete,
so give her a break!

130
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,375
[thud]
[RYO gasps]

131
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,291
[SAKURA grunts]

132
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,791
[SAKURA] They're not
taking me seriously.

133
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,041
I've gotta get up!

134
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,750
My pride's on
the line here.

135
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:18,541
I can't let them treat
me like Kazama did!

136
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,166
No breaks!
I can do this, Coach!

137
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,500
Please show me the next move!

138
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,416
No way!

139
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,416
Oh, wow!

140
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,250
[RYO] This girl.
She's the real deal!

141
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,416
Ready when you are, Coach!

142
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,791
[RYO] Maybe not as good as
Misaki, but she's got something!

143
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,375
[RYO]
She might be the one

144
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,666
to change the history
of girl's pro wrestling!

145
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:59,041
[SAKURA grunts]

146
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,875
[SAKURA yells]

147
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,833
[INOBA]
So, Misaki?

148
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,583
What do you think?
Is she ready?

149
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,583
Well, in terms of her
strength and resilience

150
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,583
she's made some big strides
and really impressed me.

151
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,125
However.

152
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,291
She still doesn't know what
real pro wrestling is all about.

153
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,666
If she did, she wouldn't
make so many fearless

154
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,083
but ultimately stupid moves.

155
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,208
Geez, how about
you tell us

156
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,625
what you really think, Misaki.

157
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:16,833
Well, it's true.

158
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,833
So are you saying
it's too early

159
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,916
for Miss Hagiwara
to take the test?

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,875
I know you want her
to debut because

161
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,125
she'll be a big draw
and up our ticket sales.

162
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,500
But if you insist on
giving her the test now,

163
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,250
let me sit this one out.

164
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,375
She's gotten much better,
but I'd destroy her in the ring.

165
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,416
Good point.

166
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,291
She's not strong
enough to face you.

167
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,500
But aside from that,
she's ready.

168
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,125
If you ask me, I say we
should see what she's got.

00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,500
Very well, ladies.

I'll try not to get
my hopes up too much.

It's up to them.

just waltz onto the team,
you're in for a surprise.

We need to find out just
how tough you really are.

If you wanna make your debut,

you've gotta go
through all of us first,

to pass our special test.

[INOBA] That's right.

218
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,500
You'll have to make it through
all ten of these wrestlers.

219

They'll each perform ten
throws, a hundred in all.

[INOBA]
Ah! Nice job!

326
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,875
Well then, Miss Hagiwara.
Congratulations on passing!

327
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,833

I did it!

Are you alright? Hey!

[BERSERK WRESTLERS chatter]

332
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,291
[RYO] So I noticed that you
went easy on that last throw.

333
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,875
Any reason why?

334
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,083
The faster she goes pro,

335
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,208
the faster I get
to fight her again.

336
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,125
And I can't wait to
trounce her sorry ass.

337
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,625
Having a tough time with
her feelings again, I see.

338
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:10,000
Maybe. We'll see how
those two get along.

339
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,708
[KAZAMA] I'm not wasting
my time fighting amateurs

340
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,000
'cause of some petty grudge.

341
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,208
[SAKURA] What if I
wasn't an amateur?

342
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,000
[SAKURA] I'm not.
Not anymore.

[WRESTLING ANNOUNCER (F)]
It's been four months since

345
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,666
she lost the Caballera
Contra Cabellera match.

346
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,916
Now the time has finally come!

347
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,958
Tonight Sakura Hagiwara
is making her pro debut!

348
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,500
[KANAE] So they're pitting you
against Chinatsu Suzumoto

349
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,875
for your first match, huh?

350
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,333
Size-wise, you're
about the same,

351
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,541
but Chinatsu's really
been improving.

352
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,833
Still, try not to lose
too quick, Sakura.

353
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,666
I gotta write a story, here!

354
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,833
This is awesome!

355
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,208
I'm so excited I
might piss myself!

356
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,916
We're about to see
Sakura's pro debut!

357
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,833
I know! She might be
on a different stage,

358
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,791
but I'm gonna be a
Sakura fan for life

359
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,166
no matter what she does!

360

Yeah, me, too!

Hey, let's all cheer
her on so she knows

her most devoted fans are
still in her corner, okay?

percent since your last match!

So. Sakura did pretty
good in there, huh?
