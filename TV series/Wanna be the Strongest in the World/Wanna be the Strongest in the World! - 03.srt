I'm useless!

322
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:29,416
[SAKURA whimpers]

323
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,666
[SAKURA] All my friends,
all my fans,

324
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,375
I'm sorry I let you down.

325
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,666
[SAKURA]
I thought I was strong,

326
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,375
but I couldn't keep my promise.

327
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:56,125
I couldn't accomplish anything.

328
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,500
[SAKURA sobs]

329
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,958
[SAKURA]
Good bye pro wrestling.

330
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,500
Good bye Sweet Diva!

331
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:12,916
[SAKURA whimpers]

332
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,583
Please stop. I give up!

333
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,791
There's no giving up
in this ring.

334
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,083
[SAKURA gasps]

335
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,041
[MISAKI] The only ones here
right now are you and me,

336
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,416
got it?

337
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,625
There's no crowd,
no referee, and no rules.

338
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,125
If you don't want me
to break your back,

339
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,333
then you stop crying
and do something.

340
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,333
[SAKURA] Oh no.

341
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:46,083
Aaaahhh!

342
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,583
[KANAE] You heard it here first,
chief, it's all about training!

343
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,000
Well, maybe that's not
exactly breaking news.

344
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,000
I mean, of course
athletes need to train,

345
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,541
but I'm talking about
special training.

346
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,000
Misaki is giving Sakura
a round of it right now,

347
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,916
and I'm expecting big results!

348
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,791
In fact, I have a feeling
we might be seeing

349
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,250
her first win soon!

350
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:38,166
Forget about Sweet Diva and
give it your all, Sakura!

351
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,625
I'll do some headline
training in the meantime!
