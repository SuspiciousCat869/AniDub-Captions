327
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:55,458
I want to get
stronger and stronger!

328
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,291
[KUREA] Rio!

329
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,583
Hey! You okay?

330
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,583
Hey, can the
screaming already.

331
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,166
I'm right here, aren't I?

332
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,333
Guess this means
I lost the match, huh?

333
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,833
[KUREA]
You did your best.

334
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:11,791
Damn lights, they're gonna
make my eyes start watering.

335
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,875
[KAZAMA]
Hey, Hagiwara!

336
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:25,250
Look, I gotta say,
you're a lot stronger now.

337
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,166
I'll accept my loss today.

338
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,916
And for an idol,
you're pretty damn tough.

339
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,083
But now that you've
beaten me, is that it?

340
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,166
What now?

341
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,708
Back to singing,
like nothing happened?

342
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,958
You went through
all that training

343
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,375
and all that suffering
just for a shot at me?

344
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,541
Is that the kind of
person I lost to?

345
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,333
Over some petty-ass grudge?

346
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,958
Take it easy.

347
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,958
[SAKURA] It was impulsive,
but I did become

348
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,833
a wrestler because Kazama
made fun of Sweet Diva.

349
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,458
So when she says
it's a petty grudge,

350
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,750
that's not far from the truth.

351
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,416
I was so naïve
I thought I could

352
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,875
beat her and be an idol
again in no time.

353
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,625
Obviously, that wasn't the case.

354
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,375
It was a rude awakening.

355
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,416
The world of wrestling was
tougher than I'd ever imagined.

356
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,416
I couldn't accomplish anything.

357
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,958
I was too weak.

358
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,708
I gave up in the ring and I
started to give up on myself.

359
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,750
But it worked
the other way, too.

360
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,000
Once I finally started
getting stronger,

361
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,583
I started getting tougher
on the inside, too,

362
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,541
and I longed for that
feeling more and more.

363
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,833
Now that I've won my battle,

364
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,833
I can put everything
in perspective.

365
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,875
I know who I am now.

366
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,208
Wait, Sakura?

367
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,083
I want to win again!

368
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:46,708
I want to become
stronger and stronger!

369
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,250
So the truth is...

370
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,625
Pro wrestling has
become very dear to me.

371
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,833
So if I can, I want
to keep fighting!

372
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,708
[ELENA gasps]

373
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,250
[gasps]

374
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,416
[CROWD cheers]

375
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,875
[AUDIENCE GUY 6H]
Damn straight, Hagiwara!

376
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,166
[AUDIENCE GUY 6I]
You're one of us now!

377
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,500
I knew you had it in you!

378
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,250
Oh, Sakura, what
will become of you?

379
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,291
Let us not shed tears,
but be inspired

380
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,791
by the strength of her resolve
and support her ever more,

381
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,958
no matter what path she takes!

382
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,708
This can't be.

383
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,916
[NANAMI] Does that mean she's
quitting the group for good?

384
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,166
That doesn't make sense!

385
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,416
Where's Elena?

386
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,041
I gotta say,
that's good to hear!

387
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,166
You can't just grab a
win and then walk away.

388
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,250
In other words,
I want my revenge.

389
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,416
All right.

390
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,625
Well, it looks like
we're rivals, then!

391
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,958
Thank you, Rio.

392
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,333
[SAKURA] Huh?
[CROWD cheers]

393
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:04,416
[CROWD chants] Sakura!
Sakura! Sakura! Sakura!

394
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:41,583
[CROWD chants] Sakura!
Sakura! Sakura! Sakura!

395
00:22:55,916 --> 00:23:00,875
[ELENA sobs]

396
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,666
[KANAE] Why yes, Chief,
I have been drinking!

397
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,916
Why? To celebrate
Sakura's first victory!

398
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,791
Oh, but that's not
even the big news!

399
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,750
You know Jackall Tojo,
the Shangri-la World Champ?

400
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,875
Yeah, well, she's
coming to Japan!

401
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,583
She's sexy, popular
and tough as nails!

402
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,125
Misaki had better watch out,

403
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,583
or she won't stand a
chance in their match.

404
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,583
Did I mention
they have a match?

405
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,125
Whew, I think I need
a cold shower.
