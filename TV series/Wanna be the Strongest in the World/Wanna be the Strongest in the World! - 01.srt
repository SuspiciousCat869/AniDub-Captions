[SAKURA] Ow!

00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,666
Heh. I like those
screams diva. Keep it up.

[SAKURA whimpers]

5
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,750
[SAKURA]
This is pathetic.

6
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,416
I can't fight back.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,875
I can't do anything.

8
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,958
[KAZAMA] Let's see
how you like this one! 

9
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,000
That feel good?

10
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,458
[SAKURA] Ah! No!

11
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,291
That hurts even worse!

12
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,000
Aaahhhh!

13
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:55,458
Well, if it hurts so bad,
why don't you tap out already?

14
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,458
[SAKURA] I didn't
know it at the time,

15
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:04,583
but that was the beginning
of everything for me.

16
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,000
[MC (F)] It's time for the Sweet
Diva Center Vocal Fan Election!

17
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,833
Where just one vote
could change everything!

18
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:47,083
Only one pop idol
can take center stage!

19
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,500
Will it be Sakura Hagiwara?

20
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:55,041
Or, will Elena Miyazawa snatch
victory from the jaws of defeat?

21
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,041
[SAKURA] Wow, Elena,
you're going all out!

22
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,666
[ELENA] Show me your worst,
Sakura, I'm not losing this one!

23
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,708
Time for the grand finale!

24
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:03,958
All right!

25
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,625
Let's give 'em something
to really scream about!

It's the Ice Cream Sault!

[CROWD cheers]

29
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,958
Thanks guys,
you're the best!

30
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,416
[MC (F)] The votes are in!

31
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,916
We have a winner!

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,083
It was a close call, but only
one girl can claim the crown!

33
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:33,541
The fourth Sweet Diva Center
Vocal election goes to...

34
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,333
...Sakura Hagiwara!

35

[SAKURA gasps]
[CROWD cheers]

36
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,750
Yay!

37
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,500
[MC (F)] The fans have spoken!

38
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,250
Sakura is their queen
and they want more!

39
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,666
That's four in a row
for the reigning champ!

40
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,666
Better luck next time, Elena!

41
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,791
You were only one hundred and
twenty votes away from victory!

42
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,041
[ELENA] Sakura.

43
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,291
Congrats on the win,

44
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,333
but I'm taking
your spot next time.

45
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,875
[SAKURA]
Bring it on, partner.

46
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:18,833
[SAKURA hums]

47
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,083
[YUHO and AIKA]
Sakura! Congratulations!

48
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,458
Thanks, Yuho, thanks Aika.
It was close.

49
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,083
So tell me the secret
to victory, your majesty!

50
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,833
Forget that, what's the
secret to that hot body?

51
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,291
I don't know if that's--

52
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,875
Wow, is that muscle
I feel under there?

53
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,791
[YUHO]
Boob muscle isn't a thing.

54
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,083
Why can't I have
a figure like that?

55
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,916
If you want to be like
Sakura that badly,

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,833
you can start by
training harder.

57
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,375
She doesn't like to
let her fans down,

58
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,750
so she keeps herself in
tip-top shape all the time.

59
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,000
All for the fans?

60
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,583
Oh, Nanami.

61
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,583
Not to mention, she has a tough
rival to keep her on her toes.

62
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,291
Right?

63
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,333
[YUHO and AIKA] Elena!

64
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,000
Can you teach us
how to be awesome?

65
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,375
[ELENA] Yeah.

66
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,250
Lesson one is "stop grabbing
people's boobs," okay?

67
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,333
[MAKOTO] All right, ladies,
nice work out there!

68
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,500
The Fan Election was
a massive success.

69
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,958
We picked up a ton of new work!

70
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,833
I'm getting exhausted
just looking at it.

71
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,375
You beast!
You're such a slave driver!

72
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,500
So we've resorted
to name-calling, huh?

73
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,000
Then maybe I should
show you how much

74
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,166
of a slave driver
I can really be.

75
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,875
[MAKOTO chuckles]

76
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,541
Girl's Professional wrestling?

77
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,166
Yep! A one-day tryout
for a TV special.

78
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,333
What?

79
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,500
And how exactly is
this a job for an idol?

80
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,875
Look, if it's popular,
we need a hand in it,

81
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,666
and right now,
wrestling is big.

82
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,083
I guess, but that's
too scary for me!

83
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,375
Well, it's not like the
entire group has to go.

84
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,916
Though I'd be grateful
for some volunteers.

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,125
If no one else wants to go,
I think I can handle it.

86
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,500
[MAKOTO] I'm sure you could
Sakura, but you're our star.

87
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,791
Are you sure you want
to spend your time--

88
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,291
[ELENA]
I want to go with her!

89
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,791
Elena?

90
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,166
Now this is rare!

91
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,500
And here I thought you hated
these hokey TV specials.

92
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,041
[SAKURA] Uh...

93
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,125
[ELENA] If Sakura
can do it, so can I!

94
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,416
If I budge an inch,
I'll be second place forever!

95
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,500
[ELENA] This is where
the wrestling team,

96
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,375
Berserk, does their training.

97
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,041
Okay, maybe this is scary,

98
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,875
but they'll go easy
on us, I'm sure.

99
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,041
Yeah, right.

100
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,625
Didn't you do your
research on these girls?

101
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,833
According to the info
the agency gave us,

102
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,500
they're serious competitors.

103
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,583
That means none of
that theatrical stuff,

104
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,750
just a heaping helping
of hard knocks.

105
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,666
Some are even ranked
in a world circuit

106
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,583
called 'Shangri-La'.

107
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,458
In other words,
they're hard core.

108
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,375
I'm sure they don't care
if this is a TV show or not.

109

[SAKURA whimpers]

110
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,333
Now let's go.

00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,666
[SAKURA] Hm!

112
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,208
[SAKURA] Whoa, this
looks intense already.

113
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,416
[SAKURA] Aaahhh!

114
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,000
Sorry Elena, nice catch.

115
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,791
By the way, why'd you volunteer
for this in the first place?

116
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:52,708
Oh, uh, mostly 'cause everyone
else was too scared to do it,

117
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,916
and Makoto said wrestling
was really big,

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,958
so I figured it would be good
for Sweet Diva's future.

119
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,958
That sounds like
something you'd say.

120
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,833
Even when everyone
else complains,

121
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,791
you always put
Sweet Diva first.

122
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,333
Of course!

123
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,500
Our group is the only place
where I can really be myself!

124
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,458
[ELENA] Heh. That's nice.

gonna get in trouble!

What's wrong?
Can't take the heat?

too real for you?

daycare, you little turd.

We're so sorry, we were just
excited to try things out.

Is she a wrestler here?
Or just some bitch?

140

[SAKURA]
For professionals like her,

141
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,375
the ring isn't just a place
to practice-it's their stage.

142
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,916
I'm sure it means
as much to them

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,375
as it does to idols like us.

Are you a secret wrestling fan?

Sweet Diva does this stuff
in practice every day.

154

We don't use
punching bags,

155
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,208
but idols need strength and
coordination training, too.

[CAMERAMAN 1A] I see.

00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,791
but as long as it sells,
I guess it doesn't matter!

472
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,333
So, uh, Sakura,
don't lose too quick.

473
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,041
We want a show.
