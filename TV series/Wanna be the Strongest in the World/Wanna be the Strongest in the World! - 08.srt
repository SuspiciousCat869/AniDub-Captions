Uh. Uh...

00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,875

I think Jackall's crazy

'cause I'm a lousy
substitute for you.

Don't be so stupid.
This is your one big chance.

you an opportunity.

Go out there and
give it all you've got.

[SAKURA] But.

00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,166
[MISAKI] What do I always
tell you before training,

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,833
and before a match?

15
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,916
"There's only one

and that's to win."

That's right. No one
ever goes into the ring

intending to lose
against their opponent.

19
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,958
That includes when
their opponent is

20
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,791
a champ like
Jackall Tojo.

21
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,625
You can beat anyone if you
just have the will to win.

No matter who that person is.

a shot at this, then?

wasn't going to happen

30

when Jackall's protégé,
Misaki Toyoda, was injured,

31
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,375

are Hagiwara's cries of pain!

Jackall may be the mistress
of a thousand moves,

but tonight she's
keeping it simple!

103
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,416
It would appear she's
giving Hagiwara a lesson

in some wrestling basics.

No!

161
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,833
Okay, then.

162
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,666
[SAKURA screams]

163
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,750
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
A Boston crab!

164
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,625
Like its namesake, it's got
Hagiwara between its claws!

165
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,666
[SAKURA] I can't move!
This move always hurts,

166
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,416
but never like this!

167
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,791
[MISAKI] Jackall is
powerful enough

168
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,000
to keep you
in that move for

169
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,916
another hour if she wanted.

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,875
Sadly, this is only
gonna get worse, Sakura.

171
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,083
[SAKURA] I can't move
at all! What should I do?

172
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,500
I have to do something,
but what?

173
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,083
[SAKURA gasps]

174
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,916
[MISAKI] What the hell?

175
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,541
[SAKURA yells]

176
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,125
[MALE FAN 8A]
Way to go, Sakura!

177
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,416
[MALE FAN 8B]
C'mon, you can do it!

178
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,458
Ow! My back!
Please, let me go!

179
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,375
[JACKALL] Hm.

180
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,791
[SAKURA groans]

181
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,708
[SAKURA] It got looser!
Gotta move!

00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:18,000
[CROWD cheering]

183
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,583
Rope break!

184
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,416
[MALE FAN 8A]
Nice save, Sakura!

185
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,125
[MALE FAN 8B]
We knew you could do it!

186
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,875
[JACKALL] Okay.
Back to the legs.

187
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,416
[SAKURA groaning]

188
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,666
[yells]

00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,333
[breathing heavily]

190
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,291
Wanna see some more?

191
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,291
[CROWD cheering]

192
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,375
How do you like it?

193
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,916
Ah!

194
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,041
Eat this!

195
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,208
[JACKALL yells]

196
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,541
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Talk about strategy!

197
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,791
Realizing both legs might
be impossible to hold,

198
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,875
Hagiwara went straight into
a single leg Boston Crab!

199
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,583
[SAKURA] Crap!
I can't stop her!

200
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,500
She's too strong!

201
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,791
[FEMALE REFEREE 2A]
Okay, rope break!

202
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,708
[SAKURA] Here goes!

203
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,708
[SAKURA grunts]

204
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,958
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Ooh, there it is, folks!

205
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,750
The Sakura Special!

206
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,875
That move's been used
to win matches before,

207
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,250
but will it be enough
to take down Jackall

208
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,250
in a stunning upset?

209
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,666
[FEMALE REFEREE 2A]
One... Two!

210
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,750
[grunts]

211
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,041
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Apparently not!

212
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,375
Hagiwara's acrobatics
don't impress a veteran

213
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,666
like Jackall Tojo one bit!

214
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,625
[MISAKI] Jackall took a lot
of punishment to her legs

215
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,458
and waist with
that Boston Crab,

216
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,125
but the rest of
her body is so strong,

217
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,583
Sakura's special move
can't hurt her.

218
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,166
That's why Jackall
took the hit.

219
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,708
Sakura's gotta come up
with something else quick.

220
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,666
[SAKURA] How 'bout this?

221
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,541
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Wait, Hagiwara's hold!

222
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,125
Could that be--? It is!

223
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,583
It's the Misaki Special!

224
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,625
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Direct hit!

225
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,791
Misaki Toyoda may
not be in the ring tonight

226
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,916
due to her injury, but she's
definitely there in spirit!

227
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,125
[FEMALE REFEREE 2A]
One... Two!

228
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,791
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Close but no cigar!

229
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,791
Even her mentor's
signature move couldn't

230
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,791
bring down the champion of
girls' professional wrestling!

231
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,208
Has Hagiwara used
up all of her cards?

232
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,125
[SAKURA] First the
Sakura Special failed,

233
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,833
and then the
Misaki Special, too?

234
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,291
Shouldn't be surprised.

235
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,916
I'm just a rookie;
Jackall's the world champion.

236
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,583
But I can't give up!
Gotta go for the win!

237
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,250
[JACKALL]
Another Misaki Special?

238
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,083
That didn't work
on me last time,

239
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,541
so why does she
think it will now?

240
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,166
[JACKALL] Uh!

241
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,041
[SAKURA yells]

242
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,583
[JACKALL] This isn't the
Misaki Special! What is this?

243
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,791
[SAKURA] This is the Misaki
Special Two-Point-Oh!

244
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,500
[yells]

245
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,125
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Wow, a new move!

246
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,916
It looked like the
Misaki Special at first,

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,833
but Hagiwara turned it into
a never-before-seen maneuver

248
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,916
and slammed
Jackall to the mat!

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,125
Jackall fell for the feint,
and she's paying for it now!

250
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:14,750
[thud]

251
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,000
[CHINATSU groans]

252
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,625
It's called the Misaki
Special Two-Point-Oh?

253
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,625
[MISAKI] Yep. It's a special
move that I was gonna

254
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,041
try out against
Jackall in our match.

255
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:27,041
It's yours now. I want
you to use it, Sakura.

256
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,166
[SAKURA] But you said...

257
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,041
I know what I
told you before.

258
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,750
If you don't figure
out a special move

259
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,000
on your own,
then it isn't yours.

260
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,458
But this will let you
see our world more clearly.

261
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,000
[MISAKI] I promise.

262
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,291
Your world, huh?

263
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,791
Not only that,
but your future.

264
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,500
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Jackall's down and Hagiwara

265
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,916
goes for the pin!

266
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,708
Is this history in the making?

[SAKURA screams]

269
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,708
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A] So close!
Jackall's still in the game,

270
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,375
but many here tonight
are shocked that

271
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,625
the champ was
almost made a chump

272
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,500
by a relative newcomer!

273
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,166
[MALE FAN 8A] Holy crap!
Sakura almost had Jackall beat!

274
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,541
[MALE FAN 8B]
Tell me about it!

275
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,083
This is the most incredible
match I've ever seen!

276
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,375
[KANAE] Sakura may be
a rookie, but it looks like

277
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,958
she might be Shangri-La
material already!

278
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:16,708
[SAKURA] I can do this! That
last move almost took her out!

[SAKURA grunts]

280
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,500
Ugh!

00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,333
[SAKURA] What the--?
Even after all those hits,

282
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,166
she can still just
brush me off like that?

283
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,208
Don't get me wrong,

284
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,041
I've enjoyed seeing
all your moves.

285
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,625
But now it's time
to get serious.

286
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,958
[JACKALL] Here we go!

287
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,958
[SAKURA yells]

288

I'm famous for this,
so try to enjoy it!

289
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,500
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A] Uh-oh,
that's the piledriver,

290
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,375
Jackall's special move!

291
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,916
This merciless maneuver has

292
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,666
obliterated opponents
across the globe!

293

[SAKURA] The blood.
It's rushing to my head!

[SAKURA yells]

296
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,541
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
What power!

297
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,833
That move knocked
the wind right out of

298
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,291
the helpless
Hagiwara and drove her

299
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,416
straight into the mat!

[yells]

304
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,000
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
And Hagiwara breaks free

305
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,708
from the pin!

00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,125

[yells]

00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,333
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Jackall isn't letting up!

309
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,458
She's already done
some damage to Hagiwara,

310
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,291
and that's got to be
taking its toll

311
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,958
on the bodacious
beauty from Berserk!

312
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,291
[SAKURA groans]

313
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,666
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Hagiwara went face down

314
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,083
to break the pin,
but her escape

315
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,375
proved to be
a short one!

316
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,208
Her brief bid for
freedom has now been

317
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,416
replaced with a
new type of captivity,

318
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,166
Jackall's Camel Clutch!

319
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,125
In her position,
I doubt Hagiwara can

320
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,000
catch a single breath!

321
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,416
[SAKURA] Oh, no!
I'm gonna black out!

322
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,500
[JACKALL] The show's
not over yet, sweetie!

323
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:55,208
[yelling]

324
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,083
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A] Another
move from Jackall's arsenal!

325
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,666
In this case, she's unleashed
a blistering Bow and Arrow!

326
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,125
From the sound of Hagiwara,
this move has definitely

327
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,041
and painfully hit its mark!

328
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,583
I don't know how much
more she can take!

329
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,041
Stop! I give u--!

330
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,791
[SAKURA yells]

331
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,833
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A] What?
Why'd Jackall let her go?

332
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,541
Let's party, people!

333
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,791
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A] Oh!
She must be setting up

334
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,333
one of her famous
finishing moves!

335
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,916
Ahhh-ha-haaa!

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,375
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A] And there
it is in all its glory!

337
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,833
The Jackall Meteor Suplex!

338
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,083
[SAKURA gasping for air]

339
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,125
[FEMALE REFEREE 2A] One...

340
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,500
[SAKURA] Oh, no. I'm a goner!

341
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,083
[FEMALE REFEREE 2A] Two...

342
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,708
[SAKURA] She loosened the pin?

343
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,916
[yells]

344
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,166
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Hagiwara breaks free

345
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,375
a half second from defeat!

346
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,833
[breathing heavily]

347
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,791
[MALE FAN 8A] Whoa, Sakura
got out of that? Amazing!

348
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,041
[MALE FAN 8B] No kidding!
This match is so kickass!

349
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,583
[MALE FAN 8C]
You da bomb, Jackall!

350
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,458
[MALE FAN 8D] No,
Sakura's da bomb, jerk!

351
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,625
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
What's Jackall doing?

352
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,000
Wait, that set-up!

353
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,750
Oh, my stars, is this
what I think it is?

354
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,083
Good night,
little princess.

355
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,291
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Yes, it is!

356
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,750
It's another one
of her finishers!

357
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,583
The Jackall Comet Buster!

358
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,041
This match might be over!

359
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,375
[FEMALE REFEREE 2A]
One...! Two..!

360
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,958
[SAKURA grunts]
[FEMALE REFEREE 2A] Thr--!

361
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,416
[SAKURA panting]

362
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,125
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Another razor's edge escape

363
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,458
by Hagiwara! Unbelievable!

364
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,833
The crowd is in awe, and
in all my years announcing,

365
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,250
I don't think I've ever seen
a match as thrilling as this!

366
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,541
[JACKALL] Hm.

367
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,875
I knew I made the
right choice by picking you.

368
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,125
[grunts]

369
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,875
You're the same as me,
and the same as Misaki.

370
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,333
[JACKALL] You're one of
the select few who can

371
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,250
show people the true
nature of pro wrestling!

372
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,541
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Is this it?

373
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,791
Is Jackall about to
unleash her super-weapon?

374
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,708
[JACKALL] Time to send you
straight to Kingdom Come!

375
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,291
Go to Heaven!

376
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,000
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A] She did!
The Jackall Super Galaxy!

377
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,041
The same move that has
felled so many of her

378
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,541
Shangri-La opponents has now

379
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,375
done the same to Hagiwara!

380
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,541
[MALE FAN 8A]
C'mon, stand up, Sakura!

[FEMALE REFEREE 2A] One!

00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,000

00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,708
[MALE FAN 8A]
Way to go, Jackall!

387
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,666
[MALE FAN 8B] That's
world class wrestling!

388
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,666
Sakura came so close to
beating the world champ!

389
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,708
Yeah, she wrestled
her heart out!

390
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,291
[MALE ANNOUNCER 8A]
Despite Sakura Hagiwara's

391
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,416
valiant efforts,
she was defeated by

392
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,208
the undisputed champ,
Jackall Tojo!

393
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,708
Now let's go ringside to
hear what Jackall has to say!

394
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,583
Thanks so much! I really
enjoyed being here!

395
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,250
How about the rest of you?

396
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:48,166
[CROWD cheering]

397
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,791
[SAKURA] Jackall Tojo, I get why
you're the world champ now.

398
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,416
That's why you let me
loose a few times, huh?

399
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,250
To give me some time
to shine in the ring.

400
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,958
And to show me how
to give the audience

401
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,041
the best match possible.

402
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,458
And judging by their
cheers, it worked.

403
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,916
I'm torn.

404
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,708
On one hand, I'm frustrated
that I couldn't beat you.

405
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,833
But on the other, I can't
tell you how gratifying it is

406
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,083
to see the
audience so excited.

407
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,541
And laying the
smack down on you

408
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,791
a few times was nice too.

409
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,208
Now then. I have
a feeling that

410
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,541
there's something
you might like to say

411
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,583
to the audience,
too, right, princess?

412
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,458
Yes, there is.

413
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,458
[CHINATSU] Sakura!

414
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,708
[JACKALL]
You're a pro wrestler!

415
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,875
You have to stand
on your own two feet!

416
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,041
[JACKALL] Understand?

417
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,458
Yeah. Right!

418
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,833
[SAKURA] I've gotta be honest.

419
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,125
I was super worried
about this match.

420
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,958
But Jackall was kind
enough to give me this

421
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,791
once-in-a-lifetime chance
and I'm so grateful.

422
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,333
Speaking of which,

423
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,041
I'm grateful to all of you
fantastic people here tonight

424
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,875
for giving me
a chance as well.

425
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,333
Thank you.

426
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,083
[SAKURA] You've all let me
see the world more clearly.

427
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:08,458
Or rather, my future.
It won't be easy, but still.

428
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,708
I'm not gonna stop
wrestling anytime soon!

429
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,666
Pro wrestling has
changed my life,

430
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,791
and I'm gonna keep getting
better until I'm the best!

431
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,000
[SAKURA] Jackall! I'll
fight you again one day!

432
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,125
[SAKURA] You hear?

433
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,458
And I'll win!

434
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,000
'Cause I wanna be the
strongest in the world!

[CROWD cheering]

436
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,041
[JACKALL]
If you wanna beat me.

437
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,500
then you'll have to
come to Shangri-La.

438
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,041
[JACKALL]
I'll be waiting.

439
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:43,041
[SAKURA] Jackall,
you'll see. I will beat you!

440
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,791
Hey, that new
move really hurt.

441
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,375
You're the one who taught
it to her, weren't you?

442
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,666
You always could see
right through me, huh?

443
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,041
[chuckles]

444
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,041
Thank you for doing
everything you did.

445
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,041
I know it was a valuable
experience for the girl.

446
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,250
[JACKALL] The pleasure's all
mine, but to tell the truth,

447
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,625
I should be thanking you.

448
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,083
I had a valuable
experience, too.

449
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,208
What do you mean
you did too?

450
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,708
What, you didn't notice?

451
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,583
While I did loosen up
a few of my holds,

452
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,916
I didn't with the
Jackall Comet Buster.

453
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,875
Not one bit.

454
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,666
[JACKALL] That means
Sakura got loose on her own.

455
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,875
[gasps]

456
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,625
She impressed the hell
out of me out there.

457
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,291
Kinda like another
young wrestler I knew.

458
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,666
I'm really happy to see you
passing on what you've learned.

459
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,416
[JACKALL] Who knows?
With the way she's going,

460
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,291
she might even surpass
you and me some day.

461
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,750
Maybe.

I've got another big
scoop for you, Chief!

00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,208
Wait 'til you
get a load of this!

471
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,958
She's still a
high school student,

472
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,625
and what's more, she's also
a karate world champion!

473
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,625
She's apparently a
bit of a wild child, too,

474
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,291
but I bet that'll make her
a total beast in the ring!

475
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,208
And she's a
huge fan of Sakura!

476
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,625
I don't like to
jump to conclusions,

477
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,875
but I think she's gonna
be one to watch out for!
