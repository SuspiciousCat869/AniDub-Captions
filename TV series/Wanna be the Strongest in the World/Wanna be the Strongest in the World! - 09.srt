00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,041
[SAKURA] You've all let me
see the world more clearly.

00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,000
Or rather, my future.

3
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,375
It won't be easy,
but still.

4
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:17,666
I'm not gonna stop
wrestling anytime soon!

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,666
Pro wrestling
has changed my life

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,750
and I'm gonna keep getting
better until I'm the best!

7
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,208
[SAKURA] I will!

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,500
[SAKURA] And I'll win!

00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,333
'Cause I wanna be the
strongest in the world!

00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,541
[GIRL] Man!
Talk about extreme!

12
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,041
That was so freaking exciting!

13
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,041
Pro wrestling is so cool!

[GIRL] So this
is it. Berserk!

This is gonna be sweet.

Oh my god!

So awesome!

Uh.

Oh, man!
I knew it was high

but I didn't know
it was this high!

[CHINATSU] Uh. Hey, you!

[KAZAMA]
The hell are you doing?

[MOE] Waaah!

00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,916
Ow, ow, ow.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You shouldn't sneak up
on people like that.

33
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,208
[KAZAMA] Hey!
[MOE] Huh?

34
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,416
Keep your cool.

35
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,083
Look, ya little punk,
the ring isn't some

36
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,125
playground for brats
like you to climb all over.

37
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,666
Huh?

38
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,833
[GIRL] Why's it
such a big deal?

39
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,583
It's not like
anyone's using it.

40
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,916
[KAZAMA]
That's beside the point!

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,458
What, are you
deaf or something?

42
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,000
[GIRL] I'm not deaf, I just
didn't wanna hear you!

43
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,458
All I wanna do
is get in the ring!

44
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,791
C'mon, let me go!

45
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,041
[KAZAMA] So?
I don't give a crap!

46
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,458
How 'bout you shut up
and listen to me

00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,666
when I'm yellin' at ya!

[GIRL] Jeez!

00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,833
Look, stop calling
me a brat, okay?

50
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,208
I know I'm small
but I'm not a brat!

51
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,458
[KAZAMA] Yeah? Because
you sure do act like one.

52
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,208
Tell ya what,
if you can beat me,

53
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,666
I won't call you
a brat and you can

54
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,083
use anything in here.

55
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,541
Whoa, Kazama!

56
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,166
Do you really mean that?

57
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,666
You'll keep your promise?

58
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,875
If you can beat me,
yeah, you got it.

59
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,125
A runt like you
doesn't have much of a--

[MOE] Ha!

61
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,375
[KUREA] Kazama?

62
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,041
[BERSERK TRAINEE 2A] Holy crap!
Did she just kick her?

63
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,125
[BERSERK TRAINEE 2B]
I didn't even see it!

64
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,333
Uh...

[GIRL] Whoa, what's with
all the scary faces?

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,583
I just did
what she told me to.

67
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,000
That was nuts.
Are you a challenger

68
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,416
from some other group?

69
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,208
And you just waltzed right
in here by yourself, huh?

70
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,541
[KUREA] You really don't
think much of Berserk, do you?

71
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay. I don't like the
direction this is heading.

72
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,750
[INOBA] Hey, hey,
what's going on out here?

73
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,916
[GIRL] Uh! What's up,
Uncle Inoba?

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,041
[WRESTLERS] Huh?

75
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,375
Did she call him
her uncle?

76
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,458
[INOBA] How many times do we
have to go over this, Moe?

77
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,250
[INOBA] Like I've said,
there are plenty of ways

78
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,166
to resolve your problems
that don't involve

79
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,541
using your fists.

80
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,666
[MOE chuckles]

81
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,666
Sure, like using your feet.

82
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,416
[CHINATSU] Mr. Inoba,
who is this kid?

83
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,166
[MOE yells excitedly]

84
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,500
I can't believe
it's you, Miss Sakura!

85
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,583
Wait, what, Miss Sakura?

86
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,500
Huh?

87
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,208
[SAKURA] Uh--ah!

88
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,416
Miss Sakura, your
special match with Jackall

89
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,375
was like, the most
moving thing ever!

90
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,125
That whole speech you gave
where you were all like,

91
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,666
"I wanna be the strongest
in the world" was just,

92
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,375
it was so great it made me
wanna be a pro wrestler!

93
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,750
[SAKURA] Oh. Okay.

94
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,166
If I'm being
totally honest though,

95
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,541
I didn't really like you
when you were doing

96
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,625
that whole
Sweet Diva thing,

97
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,458
but I absolutely
totally love you

98
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,625
and think you're
the best now that

99
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,708
you're a wrestler!

100
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,166
You are so like, my hero!

101
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,291
Uh, that's nice,
but would you mind

102
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,500
please getting off of me?

103
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,000
Huh?

104
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,791
[MOE] Nice ta
meetcha, everyone.

105
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,583
The name's Moe Fukuoka.

106
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,458
High school freshman
karate champ.

107
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,250
Little Moe here is
the granddaughter of

108
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,916
my old wrestling mentor,
and when I say "old"

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,583
I mean, ancient history.

110
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,166
[INOBA] I've known her since
she was just a bean sprout.

111
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,208
[MOE] Yep! He was the best
uncle a kid could ask for!

112
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,458
[KAZAMA] Hmph.

113
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,041
She may be
small for her age,

114
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,541
but you don't wanna
underestimate her.

115
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,208
[INOBA] The kid's got skill.

116
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,125
In fact, she's the
Bugen style karate

117
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,208
high school champion
of the entire world.

118
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,583
She was serious?

119
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:59,041
That explains her
insane kick earlier.

120
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,916
[INOBA] I've been impressed
with her fighting skills

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,916
ever since she
started competing,

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,291
so I tried to talk her into
giving wrestling a shot

123
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,166
but she kept refusing.

124
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,000
I'd pretty much given up
on her at this point.

125
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,541
[MOE] But now I
wanna be a pro wrestler,

126
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,500
just like Miss Sakura!

127
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,625
I wanna try to be the
strongest in the world too,

128
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,458
and I don't care
what it takes!

129
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,958
Please take me on
as your pupil!

130
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,458
I'll work really hard.

131
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,291
Wait. Pupil?
I'm still learning!

132
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,583
I'm the one
person on the team

133
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,583
who isn't qualified
to teach you!

134
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,666
[MOE] No! It's you
or no one else!

135
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,333
You're the only teacher
for me, Miss Sakura!

136
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,416
Well. The girl's
made up her mind.

137
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,083
It looks like you've got
a new pupil under your wing.

138
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,416
Is that all right?

139
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,083
Yeah, I guess so!

140
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,333
[SAKURA grunts]

141
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,791
[groans]

142
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,583
Ow! It, it hurts!

143
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,833
[SAKURA] I know how
painful this pull is.

144
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,166
It was almost too much for me
to handle the first time, too.

145
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:08,291
[MOE groans]

146
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,041
I give.

147
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,666
[SAKURA] Sure.
Any normal person

148
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,833
would throw in
the towel and give up

149
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,875
to get out of
this kind of pain.

150
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,500
I'll give her one
more twist and tell her

151
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,541
there's no giving up
in this ring.

152
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,875
That'll teach Moe just how
serious pro wrestling is.

153
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,041
But there's no
giving up in this ring!

154
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,375
Right, Miss Sakura?

155
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,166
Well. Yeah.

156
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,750
Okay. I'm gonna do my best!

157
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,083
[yells]

158
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,166
[SAKURA] Maybe I'm
holding back too much.

159
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,958
Well, if that's the case...

160

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,625
I can take it.

322
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,833
I'm gonna be a pro,

323
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:41,416
and I'm gonna be...
just like Miss Sakura.

You might wanna give
your muscles a break.

[SAKURA] I couldn't be
more proud of you, Moe.

339
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,250
[INOBA] Excellent work ladies,
but I'm kind of glad

340
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,500
to have that one behind me.

00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,333
Up next, we just have to
find your debut opponent.

[MOE] Found her!
I want my first match

343
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,333
to be with Miss Sakura!

344
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,666
[ALL] Huh?
[SAKURA] What?

345
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,958
I want Miss Sakura to see
how much I've learned,

346
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,500
and what better way than to
let her feel it firsthand!

347
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,458
Sure! If you feel
that strongly about it,

348
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,250
then I'd be honored to face
you in your debut match.

[MOE laughs]

Yippee! And that's why
you're my favorite!

Hey! C'mon, Moe!

Stop it already;
that tickles!

The big bad pro's
gonna fight the rookie.

Man, you really are
something else, huh, Sakura?

356
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,666
Just don't forget
about our rematch!

357
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,375
I won't go easy on you
just 'cause you have

358
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,333
another fight lined up later.

359
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,958
Yeah, of course not!

360
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,958
It's the top of my list,
it'll be the best match ever!

361
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,291
You and I may be
even at the moment,

362
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,875
but I think it's
about time I show you

363
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,500
who the real boss is.

364
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,708

have to beat me first.

Finally, their third match!

their time with this one.

[AUDIENCE GUY 9B]
I know, right?

I hear they settled
their differences.

371
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,291
I hope that doesn't
mean the match is gonna

be too tame or anything.

[AUDIENCE GUY 9C] They've both
got one win and one loss,

put Chinatsu and Rio through.

Mocking me is one thing,

but she can't treat

The match has to be a
mascara contra cabellera!

447
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,250
If you lose,
then you have to

448
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,750
take off your mask
and reveal your face.

449

After that,
you'll apologize

to Chinatsu,
Kazama, and Berserk!

Apologize for what?

You've intentionally
sabotaged our matches

Agree to my demand
or I refuse.

If that's the case,
it sounds like

456
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,875
we have ourselves a match.

is on the cusp of change,

direction it goes

[KANAE] Check it out, Chief!

465
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,916
It's the debut match
of the promising

young rookie,
Moe Fukuoka!

467
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,916
And she's squaring off
against her own mentor,

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,250
who just happens to be
our good friend, Sakura.

469
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,125
And speaking of Sakura,
right after that,

470
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,958
she's got her most
grave match to date,

facing the masked
wrestler, Blue Panther.

I cannot believe how drastic
the stakes they've set are.

But I'm not worried
about Sakura winning.

gonna put on the front page!
