[SAKURA] Huh?

64
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,166
[MOE] I left the world of
karate to try pro wrestling,

65
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,416

in the same situation.

feel kinda nervous

thinking about all the
things I left behind.

the first step into that ring,

00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,416
there won't be any
turning back to karate.

We never challenged
each other in Shangri-La,
