[MISAKI] Huh?

161
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,750
Got something
on your mind?

162
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,458
Huh?

163
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,083
Um, no, it's nothing.

164
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,458
[MISAKI] Really?

165
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,833
It's not "I trained so hard
and I'm stronger now,

166
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,375
so why can't I win?"

167
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,750
That sound about right?

168
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,291
Uh!

169
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,625
The whole reason I
became a pro wrestler

170
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,708
was to get a rematch
against Kazama.

171
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,000
Now I've got one.

172
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,083
But I haven't had
a single win yet,

173
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,333
and that makes me wonder if I
even have the right to face her.

174
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,125
Or if it'll be any
different this time.

175
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,583
So in other words,

176
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,375
you're not feeling too confident
about winning, are you?

177
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,750
[SAKURA sighs]

178
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,291
[MISAKI] Look,
there's no such thing

179
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,833
as a sure-fire way
to win, okay?

180
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,000
However, there is a powerful
weapon that might

181
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,000
tip the odds a little bit more
in your favor if you use it.

182
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,875
[SAKURA] Huh?

183
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,625
A special move.

184
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,791
A special move?

185
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,708
[SAKURA]
Oh, wait, I get it,

186
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,583
you mean something like
the Misaki Special?

187
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,458
[MISAKI] Yep.

188
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,000
You don't have a special move,

189
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,333
and that's why you haven't
been able to win yet.

190
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,375
Until you find one,
you'll keep losing.

191
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,708
But my move can't just
be anything, right?

192
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,541
Where do I start?
Like, how do I find it?

193
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,583
[MISAKI] You'll have to
figure that out for yourself.

194
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,041
[SAKURA] Uh!

195
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,958
If you don't figure out your
special move on your own,

196
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,750
then it isn't
really yours, right?

197
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,041
[SAKURA] So I guess

198
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,416
you won't let me use
your Misaki Special, then?

199
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,041
[MISAKI] Uh-uh.

200
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,583
Aw!

201
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,583
[TV VOICE (F)] Special attack!
Earthstar The Rainbow!

202
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,291
A special move.

203
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,000
A special move.

204
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,000
A special move.

205
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,708
[CHINATSU] Oh, hey,
good morning, Sakura!

206
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,416
[SAKURA] A special move!

207
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,333
[CHINATSU] Ow! That hurts!
C'mon, cut it out, would ya?

208
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,333
[SAKURA]
A special move...

209
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,750
Holy crap-balls,
what was that about?

210
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,708
It looks like the poor
girl's in a bit of a rut.

211
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,875
Why don't you just give
her a tiny little hint?

212
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,500
Special moves are
the wings that can

213
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,625
lift a wrestler to
victory in the ring.

214
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,125
Those wings have to
be earned, though,

215
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,791
and nobody can put
in the work for her.

216
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,916
[SAKURA] With my size, there's
no way throws will work well

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
against opponents
larger than me.

218
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,166
And at my weight,

219
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,666
I guess pummels wouldn't
do all that great

220
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,125
against bigger wrestlers,
either, would they?

221
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:26,333
Gotta find my own special move
outside of the existing ones.

222
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:30,083
A move that nobody
has ever seen before.

223
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,125
[distant footstep]
[SAKURA] Uh?

[SAKURA] Elena?

226
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,208
Hi, Sakura.

227
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,625
[SAKURA] Wow, it's been
awhile, hasn't it?

228
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:13,875
[ELENA] Yeah.
Too long if you ask me.

229
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,625
Sorry to interrupt
your training.

230
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,791
I hope I haven't thrown
you off track or anything.

231
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,875
[SAKURA]
No, it's okay.

232
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,916
Hey, I saw the
last fan election.

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,625
That was nice work grabbing
the lead spot this time!

234
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,375
Yeah...

235
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,583
Well, congrats.

236
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,875
I was so happy when they
announced you'd won!

237
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,458
Thanks, Sakura.

238
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,416
But look, the only reason I did
is because you weren't there,

239
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,166
so I don't really feel like
I've won anything at all.

240
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,958
Elena...

241
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,708
Oh, and I was
gonna tell you.

242
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,083
Things have been really
weird without you, Sakura.

243
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:01,541
For me and everyone
else in the group.

244
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,833
Oh, that reminds me.

245
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,916
My rematch against
Kazama has been set.

246
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,083
[ELENA] What?!

247
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,500
Wow, so it's finally
happening, huh?

248
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,750
[SAKURA] Mm.

249
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,333
[ELENA] 
W-Well, that's great!

250
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,250
Once that's done, you're coming
back to Sweet Diva, right?

251
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,250
And you can put this
whole thing behind you.

252
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, I guess so.

253
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,250
Thank goodness.

254
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,416
To be honest,
I'm pretty nervous.

255
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,250
It's just that I don't know
if I've got what it takes

256
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,125
to win at all, let alone
beat Kazama in a fight.

257

Sakura.

258
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,958
I know I should be
spending all my time

259
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,000
training right now
instead of worrying.

260
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,708
But no matter how hard I try,

261
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,083
I can't seem to find
whatever it is I need to win.

262
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,375
What should I do?

263

whenever we had stage fright!

Wow, I didn't realize
how much I needed that!

and dancing with you!

any better now?

[ELENA]
Don't thank me.

280
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,416
In fact, I should
be apologizing.

[SAKURA] Huh?

[SAKURA] What is?

[ELENA] If it wasn't for what
happened between me and Kazama,

285
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,500
you wouldn't have
left Sweet Diva

and gone into pro wrestling
in the first place.

have gotten hurt.

You wouldn't have
had to go through

all this training, either,
but you did 'cause of me.

No, you've got
it all wrong.

Look, the only person
who's responsible

293
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,875
for my becoming a
wrestler is me, okay?

294

And if anyone
should be sorry,

295
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,875
it's me for leaving you to carry
Sweet Diva without my help.

thinking the same way.

else know I'm gonna do my best

shouldn't mess with pop idols?

The only thing titanic about
my opponent are her losses,

310

and she's about to have
her biggest one yet.

the rumors that Hagiwara

313
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,166
has stepped up her training
and gotten a lot stronger?

It doesn't matter!

I should have known.

So tell me, was it
really that obvious?

[ELENA] Yeah.

342

And are you gonna go out there
with us and cheer her on?

I get it.

You haven't gone to
any of her matches

Sakura, that's all.

Yeah, for both of us.

understanding, Nanami.

lose to that psycho skank!

got all of Sweet Diva
