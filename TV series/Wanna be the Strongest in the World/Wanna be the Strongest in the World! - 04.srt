1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:09,916
[SAKURA] It's never
hurt this bad before.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,583
I'm going to pass out.

3
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,000
I can't even move.

4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,500
I'm not good enough.

5
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:16,291
I'm useless!

6
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:22,625
[SAKURA whimpers]

7
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,291
Please stop, I give up.

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,208
There's no giving
up in this ring.

9
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,500
[SAKURA gasps]

10
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,000
If you don't want me
to break your back,

11
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,375
then you stop crying
and do something.

12
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,750
[SAKURA] Oh no.

13
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:33,541
[MISAKI grunts]

14
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:38,791
A-Aaaaahhhh!

15
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,041
[footsteps]

16
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,458
[KANAE] Looks like
the gym is open.

17
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:17,791
I'll just pop in and see how

18
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,750
Misaki's secret
training's going.

19
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:20,458
[SAKURA yells]

20
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,416
[KANAE] Uh!

21
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,000
[SAKURA groans]

22
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:29,333
Aaaahhhh!

23
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:33,583
[SAKURA cries]

24
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,000
Aahhh!

25
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,166
This hurts, right?

26
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,166
Well, the only way
the pain is gonna stop

27
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,916
is if you pull yourself
over to those ropes.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
[SAKURA groans]

29
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,583
They're so far.

30
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,291
[SAKURA whimpers]

31
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,916
You can't just lie
there like that!

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,791
I'll lock you in harder!

33
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,291
Fight back and loosen
the hold any way you can!

34
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,500
But I can't move!

35
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,250
[MISAKI] That's because you
don't have enough strength

36
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,791
in your upper torso.

37
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,291
You're not doing enough
muscle training.

38
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,083
[SAKURA groans]

39
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,291
[MISAKI]
You've gotta keep moving!

40
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,333
Even if it's just
an inch, don't stop!

41
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,333
I'm not letting up,
so that's the only way

42
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,833
you'll get out of
this Boston Crab.

43
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:18,583
[SAKURA] Ahh! Oh! Ow! It hurts!

44
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,708
Come on!

45
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,541
It'll hurt worse if
I break your back!

46
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,458
[SAKURA groans]

47
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,291
[SAKURA] She's right.

48
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:29,250
Complaining... won't do a thing.

49
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,250
I have to fight!

50
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,916
Huh?

51
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,958
Aaaaahhhhh!

52
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,208
[SAKURA]
It loosened up... just a bit.

53
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,750
There ya go.
I knew you could do it.

54
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,958
Now keep going.

55
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,500
I'll lock you back
up if you don't.

56
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,625
Like this.

57
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,833
[SAKURA screams]

58
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,333
[SAKURA] The pain.
It's too much.

59
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,500
It's impossible.

60
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,125
There's no way I
can get out of this!

61
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,916
Well, what are you
waiting for, huh?

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,791
Make your next move!

63
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,666
[SAKURA whimpers]

64
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,416
Please stop.

65
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,833
It's too much.

66
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,375
Let me go.

67
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,166
[MISAKI] I told you
there's no giving up.

68
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,625
Now move!

69
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,791
Quit your damn
whining and move!

70
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,875
[SAKURA cries]

71
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,833
Misaki, I see.

72
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,750
[MISAKI] Pull, push,
squirm, move, dammit!

73
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,916
[SAKURA yells]

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,541
[SAKURA]
I've gotta do it.

75
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:35,583
If I just keep lying here...
she really will break my back.

76
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:40,125
[SAKURA groans]

77
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,833
[MISAKI] Good!
Keep it up, you're doing great!

78
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:50,000
[SAKURA yells]

79
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,500
[SAKURA] She let go
of my right leg!

80
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:57,083
[SAKURA screams]

81
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,041
No, that hurts even worse!

82
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:12,708
[SAKURA groans]

83
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,458
Just so you know,
the Boston Crab.

84
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,291
It starts off as a two-leg
hold but people typically

85
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,250
transition into a single leg
version to lock you in.

86
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,708
[SAKURA breathes heavily]

87
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,958
[MISAKI] Even though your
left side's in greater pain,

88
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,333
there's an upside to it.

89
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,041
Your right leg is free now,

90
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,833
so you can kick with that leg
to move your entire body.

91
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,625
[SAKURA]
She's right. I can.

92
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,791
It hurts like a bitch,
but the Single Leg Boston Crab

93
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,416
frees you up and
stretches your body

94
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,458
even further out
toward the ropes.

95
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,416
You can use that
to your advantage.

96
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,333
[SAKURA]
Easier said than done.

97
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,375
[MISAKI] Come on!

98
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,166
The ropes are right
in front of you!

99
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,708
The chance is yours, now swallow
the pain and focus on moving!

100
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,166
You're almost
there, now reach!

101
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,166
Aaahhh!

102
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:07,750
[SAKURA cries and yells]

103
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,541
[MISAKI grunts]

104
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,041
[SAKURA groans]

105
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,166
[SAKURA]
I can nearly touch it.

106
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,083
It's not even a foot away.

107
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:33,291
But it seems so far,
it feels like miles.

108
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,791
[MISAKI] It's not over.
Not even close.

109
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,041
Because that last reach
is the most difficult part

110
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,000
to get through.

111
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,916
[SAKURA yells]

112
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,291
Push with every muscle
that you've got!

113
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,750
Fight for it, dammit!

114
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:57,291
[SAKURA groans]

115
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,583
It's right there!

116
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,125
[MISAKI grunts]

117
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,083
[SAKURA yells]

118
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,708
Just tapping
isn't enough.

119
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,708
You've gotta grab the rope
firmly if you want out of this.

120
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,458
Aaaaahhhh!

121
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,708
Stop, my back!

122
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:23,083
[SAKURA cries]

123
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,041
[MISAKI] Use every last
drop of your strength!

124
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,291
[SAKURA yells]

125
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,541
I got it!

126
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,458
Yes, you did.

127
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,250
[SAKURA whimpers]

128
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,375
[SAKURA] The pain...

129
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:47,375
It's too much.
This is too brutal.

130
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:51,625
[SAKURA breathes heavily]

131
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,416
[SAKURA] Miss Toyoda.

132
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,041
Why?

133
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,375
[MISAKI sighs]

134
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,541
This is pro wrestling.

135
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,625
It's about enduring
your opponent's attacks.

136
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,791
You take all the
pain they dish out.

137
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,208
You take it.

138
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,750
And keep taking it.

139
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:14,166
Until you turn
the tables on them.

140
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,583
Going through that hell?

141
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,750
That's exactly what makes
the audience love you.

142
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:24,916
[SAKURA breathes heavily]

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,375
[MISAKI] If you want that,

144
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,041
then you need the resilience
to put up with the pain.

145
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,708
More importantly, you need
a will of steel to back it up.

146
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,833
Resilience and a
will made of steel?

147
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,125
A will that can see
the ring for what it is.

148
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,750
Nothing but a stage.

149
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,041
Come to think of it.

150
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,000
You do have some experience
in that territory.

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,416
[SAKURA]
For professionals like her,

152
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,375
the ring isn't just
a place to practice.

153
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,666
It's their stage.

154
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,166
I'm sure it means
as much to them

155
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,416
as it does to idols like us.

156
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,208
The kind of pain you just
felt is normal in the ring.

157
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,041
And if that was enough
to make you give up

158
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,291
and throw in the towel,

159
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,833
then you're never gonna
make it as a wrestler.

160
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,583
It's a sure bet
you'll get locked in

161
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,125
the Boston Crab again
in your next match.

162
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,625
When that happens,

163
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,208
you fight and move like you
did today and get out of it.

164

before she does.

[SAKURA gasps]

326
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,125

[KUREA]
Well, good for you.

335
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,791
I guess you're ready
for more pain.

336
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,458
Try this!

337
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,708
[SAKURA yells]
[AUDIENCE] Oh!

338
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,000

[RANDOM MALE AUDIENCE 4K]
Good job, Hagiwara!

343
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,958
Hey, that's fine.

344
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,250
'Cause I've got...

345

[WRESTLING ANNOUNCER (F)] And
there it is, the three count!

360
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,333
Hagiwara is sunk to
the mat by a power bomb!

361
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,333
But wow, what a change
for the fighting idol!

362
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,041
She was dancing to a different
tune in tonight's match

363
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:33,000
and I think it's a hit!

364
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:38,250
[AUDIENCE chants] Sakura!
Sakura! Sakura! Sakura!

365
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:42,166
Yeah, Sakura!
Awesome fight out there!

366
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,916
[SAKURA] It's the same,
right down to the cheers.

367
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,875
All the harsh lessons.

368
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:52,250
The tension on stage that
makes your heart skip a beat.

369
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,416
And the audience,
so moved by what we do.

370
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,333
Sharing our joy and sorrow.

371
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,208
Great job, Sakura!
That was superb!

372
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,708
And I know you're
only gonna get better!

373
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,125
That's one of the
best damn matches

374
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,875
I've seen in a long time!

375
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,750
[SAKURA] There's not so
much difference between

376
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,250
an idol and a wrestler.

377
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,125
That's what Ms. Toyoda
was trying to tell me.

378
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,125
I just didn't get it.

379
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,625
So this, is
pro wrestling.

can't wait for your next match!

[SAKURA]
Even though I lost...

384
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,833
I feel wonderful.

385
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,208
I can't even imagine
what it's like to win.

386
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:37,375
But next time,
I'm gonna find out.

[IDOL AUDIENCE

388
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,166
[STAGE DIRECTOR] I think it's
safe to say we pulled it off.

389
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,916
Heh! Definitely a success.
Heh, heh, ha! One show down.

390
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,125
[YUHO] We did it!

391
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,666
[AIKA] We did it!

392
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,000
[AIKA] Hey, Elena.

393
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,166
About earlier.
Sorry for what I said.

394
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,916
I know that you just
wanted to make sure

395
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,833
the show turned out
as well as it could.

396
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,000
[ELENA] No, I'm the one
who's sorry, Aika.

397
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,583
I shouldn't have been
so harsh on you.

398
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,625
Thank you, Elena.

399

[AUDIENCE cheers indistinctly]

[SAKURA] 
Ms. Toyoda!

402
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,750
This might sound funny, but
I think that thanks to you,

403
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,916
I might finally get it now.

404
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,250
I see.

405
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,125
I realized...
I just want to win!

406
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,416
And I wanna learn more about
the world of pro wrestling.

407
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,250
I'm ready to work.

408
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,125
Please teach me everything
there is to know.

409
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,250
Please, Ms. Toyoda!

410
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,875
You do realize how hard
I'll expect you to train.

411
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,000
Of course.

412
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll do whatever it
takes, Ms. Toyoda.

413
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,041
Call me Misaki, okay?

414
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,416
Sure, Misaki it is.

415
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,916
Alright.

416
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,541
If you're serious, then we
better get started, Hagiwara.

417
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:32,083
Oh, and it's okay if you want
to call me Sakura, y'know.

418
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,875
Hold on. Um...

419
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:40,625
Do you mean start the training,
like, right this moment?

420
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,541
Can't we just say my match
was training for today?

421
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,958
[SAKURA laughs]

422
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,666
[KANAE] So, Chief,
what do you think?

423
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,000
It looks like Sakura picked up
a thing or two from Misaki,

424
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:25,041
but that losing streak of hers
isn't getting any shorter.

425
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,500
She'll need a little extra
something to get through this.

426
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:31,416
You know, sweet friendship,
bitter despair, salty tears

427
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,375
that turn into steaming
hot passion for victory!

428
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:37,208
Hmm, is that poetic,
or do I just need a snack?

429
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,208
Either way, keep it up Sakura!

430
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:42,166
I'm sure your first
win will be delicious!
