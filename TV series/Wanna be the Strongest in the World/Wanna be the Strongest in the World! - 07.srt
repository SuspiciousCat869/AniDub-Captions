[FANS and JOURNALISTS shouting]

[REPORTER GUY 7A] Wow, has
she got a presence or what?

5
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,583
I can see why Jackall is
Shangri-La's world champ!

Blast from the past.

Hm?

8
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,708
It's nice to have
you back, Jackall.

00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,166
You were missed.
It's been a long time.

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,250
It has been a while, Misaki.

11
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,666
I've been hearing
about you overseas.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,500
It sounds like you're
stronger than ever.

We've all been eagerly

anticipating this student

What are your personal
feelings on the match?

I'm sure you're
all aware of this,

20

but Toyoda has
risen to the top

as Berserk's number one star.

22
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,625
I can't wait to see
if she's finally

23
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,250
got the strength to beat me.

my old teacher just
how far I've come

you're smiling.

What's up with that?

31
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,458
The whole reason I got into
wrestling in the first place

32
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,708
was 'cause I wanted to
kick ass like Jackall.

[KAZAMA] This is gonna rock.

Pro wrestling has
become very dear to me.

So if I can, I want
to keep fighting!

how great Misaki looked

next to the world champion.

still got some time

before the match. If you
don't mind telling us,

do you have any special plans

while you're back in Japan?

00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh, the usual.

48
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,416
I'll just be training
as much as I can.

49

Actually,
there is one event

50
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,291
that I'm really
looking forward to.

Even though I've gotten
used to the world stage,

keeping an eye out

for any raw
talent in the making.

What am I doing? I should
be training right now!

Me too!

Damn. Never thought
I'd say this,

61
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,916
but I wish I
was still a rookie!

Can you believe it?
We used to be inseparable,

65
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,750
[JACKALL] but I can't
remember the last time

66
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,625

Kanae. Is your back
all right these days?

68

Oh, yeah,
it's just fine.

69
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,041
Well, maybe not
for wrestling.

70
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,875
But it's strong enough
for journalism at least.

71
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,666
[JACKALL] I see.

72
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,625
So it looks like the
three of us former

73
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,375
"Golden Age" Girls
are at the top of

74
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,208
our respective games, then.

75
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,375
All's well that ends well.

76
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,208
Well, I wouldn't
say I'm at the top.

77
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,458
I could still be
a whole lot stronger,

78

but I intend to get
there and make you proud.

Don't sell
yourself short.

00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,708
You are Berserk's number
one wrestler, aren't you?

00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,000
I wouldn't even be half
the person I am today

for you, Jackall.

[JACKALL] Losing
forty-nine matches

85
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,375
doesn't mean you're weak.

86
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,333
The number of
losses is irrelevant.

There's only one reason
why you can't win.

[JACKALL] You're still too hung
up on your past as a pop idol.

You'll never have the
resolve to win a match

all of that away!

You still don't
get it, do you?

giving up in this ring!

00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,083
[JACKALL] What you just did.

104
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,333
Fighting your way
through the pain.

105
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,666
Huh?

106
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,750
[JACKALL] That's the true
nature of pro wrestling.

107
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,083
[MISAKI] True nature, huh?

108
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,000
[JACKALL] You endure the pain
and then you turn the tables

at the very last minute.

110
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,166
A win like that is
an incredible experience

111
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,208
for the audience.

112
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,583
Thanks, but
there's no need to

113
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,541
give me more credit
than I deserve.

114
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,250
Your own talent and
determination is what

115
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,208
got you where you
are today, not me.

116
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,833
Well, sometimes you
need someone else

117
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,458
to forcefully open
your eyes for you.

118
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,375
If you hadn't done that for me,

119
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,291
I'm not sure I ever
would have seen what it is

120
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,333
that I truly love
about wrestling.

121
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,791
Okay, it just
clicked for me!

122
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,708
Now I get why you've been
so passionate about Sakura.

123
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:52,333
[MISAKI] Yeah. I couldn't really
help but see myself in her.

124
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,708
[JACKALL] Wait, Sakura?
Do you mean Sakura Hagiwara?

125
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,958
Yes, that's the one.

126
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,458
Do you know
about her, Jackall?

127
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,666
[JACKALL] I think so.
She's the rookie who

128
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,333
beat Rio after her
sixty-fifth loss, right?

129
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,333
Wow, you really do
keep up with what's going on

130
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,000
in Japan, don't you?

131
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,458
[chuckles lightly]

132
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,250
[JACKALL] So this Sakura.
I'm guessing that you

133
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,583
see something
really special in her.

134
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:17,541
As a rookie, she's
overflowing with potential.

135
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,750
It's just...

136
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,208
Just what?

137
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,458
[MISAKI] She's still so
young and she's got a lot

138
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,333
of issues to sort out.

139
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,958
Especially leaving her
emotions out of the ring.

140

[MUSIC MC GIRL 7A] And now
to close our show tonight,

[MUSIC MC GIRL 7A] Thanks to
the overwhelming support

145
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,833
of their adoring fans,

Thank you!
To all our supporters!

Thank you so much!

[CROWD clapping]

151
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,250
[MAKOTO] Well, I'm sure
Sakura thought this through.

152
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,708
And I doubt that she
made the decision lightly.

153
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,041
If she really wants
to continue wrestling,

154
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,625
I'm afraid all we
can do is support her

155
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,750
and let her do that for now.

156
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,291
You're probably right.
And I guess I can't blame her.

157
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,916
She seems really
passionate about it,

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,250
so it's not like
she can just quit.

159
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,791
It's Sakura
we're talking about;
