00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,250
Nothing else matters!

165
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,791
Even now!

166
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,375
Even though we were fighting
each other, I really felt alive!

167
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,166
I realized that's my dream!

168
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,416
That if we challenge each other
and challenge ourselves

169
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,208
we can accomplish
something amazing!

170
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,666
As a friend and a rival,
I need you!

171
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,708
[AUDIENCE GUY 12E] We're with
you a hundred percent, Elena!

172
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,916
We wanna see you two
together on stage,

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,791
just like before!

[AUDIENCE GUY 12G]
Come back to Sweet Diva!

[WRESTLING ANNOUNCER (F)]
The lead members of Sweet Diva

182
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,375
have all assembled!

183
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,250
This wasn't in
the program, folks,

184
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,416
I'm as surprised as you are!

185
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,875
What am I gonna
do with them?

186
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,416
Look, Elena! You've done
a wonderful job as leader,

187
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,791
but we miss Sakura
just as much as you!

188
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,541
I'm sure all our fans
feel the same way, too!

189
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,000
Even if we can't
fight like you,

190
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,916
we're all here because
we want Sakura back!

191
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,208
You guys.

192
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,083
[YUHO]
Please, Sakura.

193
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,416
You gotta come
back to Sweet Diva!

194
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,625
We're your friends,
aren't we?

195
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,500
Please, let's try
to work it out!

196
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,708
[NANAMI] Mm-hm.

197
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,125
[AUDIENCE GUY 12H]
Yeah! She's right!

198
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,708
[AUDIENCE GUY 12I]
We've been waiting so long

199
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,250
for you to come back!

200
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,875
[AUDIENCE GUY 12J] Can't you
see you belong in Sweet Diva?

201
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,125
I don't--What do I...?

202
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,500
[AUDIENCE GUY 12K]
Don't listen to them, Hagiwara!

203
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,875
[AUDIENCE GUY 12L]
You're finally on a roll!

204
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,791
You can't quit now!
You're awesome!

205
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,791
[AUDIENCE GUY 12M]
Don't leave me!

[MOE]
Miss Sakura!

207
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,958
You won't quit on me, will you?

208
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,208
There's still so much
left for you to see!

209
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,458
Yeah, seriously!

210
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,208
Come on, we gotta do
best two out of three

211
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,041
before you up and quit on us!

212

[CROWD yells]

213
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,583
Chairman, which side are
we supposed to be on?

214
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,458
Yeah, I'm getting
kinda confused.

215
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, whatever she says!

216
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,833
Whatever choice Sakura makes,
we'll support her!

217
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,750
[SAKURA] U-Uh?

218
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,166
[WRESTLING ANNOUNCER (F)]
Whoa, it's Jackall Tojo

219
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,833
and she's got a mic!

220
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,916
The world champion
is making her way

221
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,458
to the center of the arena!

222
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,500
The crowd's gone silent
and all eyes are on her!

223
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,916
Let's see if she has an
answer to this dilemma!

224
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,583
[JACKALL] That was a great match
back there from the both of you-

225
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,250
and it's good to see there's
as much talent and spirit here

226
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,500
as when I got started
in pro wrestling.

227
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,708
So, I've made a decision.

228
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,916
Sakura, your next
stage is the world!

229
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,958
I want you to come to Shangri-La
and truly test yourself!

230
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,791
[SAKURA] Huh?

231
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,083
[AUDIENCE GUY 12N]
Shangri-La?

232
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,625
You think she's world
circuit material?

233
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,541
[AUDIENCE GUY 12P] The champ's
inviting her, isn't she?

234
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,541
If she says so, then
you better believe it!

235
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,625
Besides, you saw her fight!

236
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,083
[AUDIENCE GUY 12Q]
Dude, this is big!

237
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,833
I can't believe
we're here to see this!

[AUDIENCE GUY 12R] You guys
are out of your minds!

239
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,458
[AUDIENCE GUY 12S]
Sakura's gonna tour the world

240
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,083
with Sweet Diva!

241
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:25,250
[AUDIENCE GUY 12T] Yeah! She's
done enough wrestling already!

242
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,458
That sounds
wonderful, but...

243
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:33,208
I mean, I'd love to challenge
the world as a pro wrestler.

244
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,916
That's what all of us are
aiming for, I'm sure, but I...

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,416
What's the matter?

246
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,500
It's just I don't ever want to
break my ties with Sweet Diva

247
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,708
I love wrestling,

248
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:47,666
but I can't leave my
friends and fans behind.

249
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,500
You really mean that?

250
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,416
[SAKURA] I'm sorry.

251
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,458
There are just so many
things on my mind.

252
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,791
I don't know what I
want to do anymore.

253
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,625
I think if you step
back and look at things

254
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,125
with a little more confidence,

255
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,666
you'll see that the answer
was obvious from the start.

256
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,500
[SAKURA gasps]

[JACKALL] In other words,
just do both of them!

259
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,125
[SAKURA] Huh?

260

[CROWD murmurs]

261
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,541
Is that even possible?

262
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,458
[JACKALL] You don't
have to decide because

263
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,541
you've got what it takes to
be an idol and a wrestler.

264
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,125
It doesn't matter if you're
on stage or in the ring.

265
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,041
Your energy and your
passion will always

266
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,791
inspire your fans
and make you a star.

267
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,375
Be modest if you like,

268
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,041
but deep down,
you know it's true.

269
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,750
[JACKALL] See?

270
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,833
The answer was right in front
of you this whole time

271
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:51,541
from the very first day
you stepped in the ring.

272
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,958
[SAKURA] Of course
that would be wonderful,

273
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:58,083
but I don't know... Do you
really think I can do it?

274
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,333
[JACKALL] It's not a matter
of "can" or "can't."

275
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,208
Stop worrying and just do it!

276
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,875
If they're both
so important to you

277
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,208
that you can't let either go,

278
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,791
you have to find the
strength to do both

279
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,541
If it really means so much,
you'll find a way!

280
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,375
But you can't question if
you can pull it off or not

281
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:18,458
you just have to let
loose and give it a shot!

282
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,583
It's time for you
to decide, Sakura.

283
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:25,333
Do you wanna be the best
in the world, or not?

284
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,875
[CHAIRMAN]
You can do it!

285
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,083
You can't give up now, Sakura!

286
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,708
You'll be the best idol
and the best wrestler!

287
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,750
We'll all be cheering
for you the whole way!

I'm here for you, partner.

this off, it's you.

[JURI] Don't sell
yourself short.

[ELENA and SAKURA gasps]

300
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,333
Look, I want you
in on this too, Elena.

301
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,291
I know you have
the potential.

302
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,041
Besides, the two of you
are rivals, aren't you?

303
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,583
Well yeah, but--

304
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,041
[JACKALL] I think we have room
in Shangri-La for one more.

305
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,208
You're already taking on
the world with Sweet Diva,

306
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,666
so why not?

307
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,750
You may be a little rough
around the edges now,

308
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,375
but once we pound
you into shape,

309
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,458
you'll be shining like
a diamond in no time.

310
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,750
[ELENA] B-But I...

311
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,208
I didn't ask for this.

312
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,833
The only reason I
entered the ring at all

313
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,000
was because I
wanted Sakura back.

314
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,958
Besides, if I expected Sakura
to retire after losing,

315
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,125
then so should I.

316
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,375
[JURI] That's ridiculous.

317
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,500
There's no reason for
you to lie to yourself.

318
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,458
[ELENA]
Wh-What do you mean?

319
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,333
This match was about more than
just getting your friend back.

320
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,333
I saw the way you
were fighting just now.

321
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,625
You didn't push yourself
to win a silly wager

322
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,333
you did it because you have
the spirit of a true wrestler.

323
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,083
[ELENA gasps]

324
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,333
[JURI] In other words,
you're already one of us.

325
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,500
[CROWD cheers]

326
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,833
[AUDIENCE GUY 12O]
Listen to her, Miyazawa!

327
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,291
[AUDIENCE GUY 12D]
I wanna see you fight again!

328
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,833
[AUDIENCE GUY 12E]
You can be an idol too,

329
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,291
but don't quit wrestling!

330
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:50,750
[CROWD chants] Elena!
Elena! Elena! Elena!

331
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,416
Well ladies,
I think it's official.

332
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,291
The audience has spoken.

333
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:58,250
Now it's time to be honest with
them and honest with yourself.

334
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:06,250
[chanting continues]

335
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,208
[JACKALL]
Chop, chop!

336
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,500
Don't keep the crowd waiting!

337
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,791
It sounds like they're
ready for your answer.

338
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,375
Isn't that right, you guys?

339
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,708
[CROWD cheers]
[AUDIENCE GUY 12G] Yeah!

340
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,750
Let's hear it!
Come on, everybody!

341
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,916
[AUDIENCE GUY 12I]
Don't leave me hanging!

342
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,416
[SAKURA and ELENA chuckle]

343
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,541
[SAKURA] Whether it's
singing or wrestling,

344
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,125
we feel just as
strongly as all of you.

345
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,916
Choosing one is impossible.

346
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,916
And after all the two
of us have been through,

347
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,208
how could we ever
give up either of them?

348
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,166
[SAKURA] So even if it's
hard we'll keep fighting.

349
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,375
And we'll try our best
not to let down any fans!

350
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,291
I promise you, this is
only the beginning!

351
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,500
As idols and wrestlers,
we'll never stop improving.

352
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,458
[SAKURA and ELENA chuckle]

353
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,708
And that's because...

354
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,500
...we're gonna be the
strongest in the world!

355
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:09,541
[cheers and applause]

356
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,333
[JURI]
Misaki? Kanae?

357
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:27,458
[SAKURA and ELENA giggle]

358
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,833
Those two might just
steal your throne.

359
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,750
Don't try to make me
feel like an old lady.

360
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,958
We're just getting started!

361
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,083
We've seen them fight,

362
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,250
now let's give them
a chance to sing!

363
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,250
Wait, what?

364
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,750
You mean now?

365
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,666
[SAKURA and ELENA gasp]

366
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,041
[SAKURA] Guys!

367
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,958
If you want to try both,
now's a good time to start!

368
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,458
Then let's do it!

369
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,875
[CROWD cheers]

370
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,375
[CROWD cheers]

371
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,708
[girls laugh]

372
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,416
Miss Sakura even makes
idols look awesome!

373
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,750
I wonder if I could do that?

374
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:40,916
[AIKA and YUHO] Yay!

375
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,416
How long do you think it'll
take to get to the arena?

376
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,541
Ten minutes jogging, five
minutes going full throttle!

377
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,041
[SAKURA] Bet I can
make it in four!

378
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,166
I'll race you!

379
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,125
Okay, you're on,
but don't blame me

380
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,916
if you're all out of breath
for the big match!

381
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,916
What do you take me for,
some kind of wimp?

382
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,083
I guess we'll find out,
won't we?

383
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,791
No bruises where the
audience can see, okay?

384
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,208
You still have a concert
after the match!

385
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,708
[SAKURA and ELENA]
Yes ma'am!

386
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:11,750
[ELENA laughs]

387
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:14,000
[SAKURA and ELENA]
Let's get this show on the road!

388
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,916
[bell dings]

389
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,666
[SAKURA] Thanks for cheering
me on until the end, you guys!

390
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,750
As you may have heard,

391
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,666
Sweet Diva is
launching a world tour

392
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,250
and I'm returning to sing
and dance along with them!

393
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,666
We might even come
to your country next!

394
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,166
Also, there's an invitation
only event coming up!

395
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,458
We'll show a secret code
and phone number to call

396
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:34,916
during my next wrestling match,

397
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,416
so be ready if you want a
chance to win free tickets!

398
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,333
As always, if you don't get
Berserk Wrestling in your area,

399
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,291
contact your cable provider!
