1
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,666
Rakka, are you up?

2
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,333
Uh...

3
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,291
yes.

4
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,333
We're all
going into Kuu's room.

5
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:40,875
O...

6
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,041
kay, I'm coming.

7
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,750
Do you like the wing covers?

8
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,333
Uh...

9
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,458
I'm so glad.

10
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,750
Every one of us,
will take one of Kuu's

11
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,958
belongings to remember her by.

12
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,125
Rakka, how about the bed?

13
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,291
Do you want anything else?

14
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,125
Just those.

15
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,791
Coming through.

16
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,291
And...

17
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,541
there...

18
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,458
Wow, it's cold.

19
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,958
Good thing you got
yourself a proper bed

20
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,666
before it starts
to snow, right?

21
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,416
How are your wings doing?

22
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,208
Do I have to keep
using the medicine,

23
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,833
and keep hiding
my wings forever?

24
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,833
The walls' power to protect
us weakens in a winter time,

25
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,958
so we become even more
susceptible to the evil.

26
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,416
So until winter ends...

27
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,833
Umm...

28
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:48,208
I still wonder,
what the Haibane are.

29
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,208
Everyone says that both
the walls and this town exist

30
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,458
for the Haibane.

31
00:04:56,541 --> 00:05:01,541
But, the Charcoal Feathers are
born into this world suddenly,

32
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,333
and just as suddenly
they disappear.

33
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,166
I don't know the reason
why I became a Haibane.

34
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:17,666
I'm here, but can't remember
anything about who I was,

35
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,708
and if I'm to disappear someday
without accomplishing anything,

36
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:26,958
what's the meaning
of my existence?

37
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:43,583
You know, at one time,
I felt the same way as you.

38
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,416
I think there is a meaning.

39
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,708
But only you can find it.

40
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,208
Come on,
walk in a single file!

41
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,708
OK.

42
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,250
Rock, paper...

43
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,250
Scissors!

44
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,833
Hey!

45
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,666
You'll fall into the river if
you walk on the edge like that!

46
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,791
Oh boy.

47
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,000
This is the last time
we'll see it like this.

48
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,125
Huh?

49
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,458
We'll have snow soon.

50
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,375
Then everything around here
will be covered in pure white.

51
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,416
As white as if you are
floating in the clouds.

52
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,208
That's why we have to get ready
quickly before winter arrives.

53
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,000
Hmm.

54
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,916
Floating in the clouds...

55
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,458
In my dream in the cocoon, I saw
like I was in the clouds, too.

56
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,041
Your dream of
falling from the sky?

57
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:08,166
But you know, I don't remember
what happens to me after that.

58
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,250
Even though I think I met
someone or may be something

59
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,666
very important during my dream.

60
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,333
But there're times when
I can almost remember something

61
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:26,125
about my dream that I'm afraid.

62
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,000
As if...

63
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,791
Hey, don't get so far ahead!

64
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:30,291
Reki!

65
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,833
Come on!

66
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,583
I'll be by your side.

67
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:44,666
I went down the wrong pass
because I lost Kuramori.

68
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,625
But no matter
what happens Rakka,

69
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,666
I will always be by your side.

70
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,291
What...?

71
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,416
Oh no!

72
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,875
I told you to be careful!

73
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,875
Didn't I tell you
to walk in a straight line

74
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,791
in the middle of the road?

75
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,166
Everybody, fall-in!

76
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,458
About-face!

77
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,125
Mmm.

78
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,708
Man, the lengths
are completely wrong.

79
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,666
We gonna have to
redo the all hems.

80
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,416
Oh, great.

81
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,750
Ah, don't you start
give me that look.

82
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,375
I deserve a commendation
just for finding ten

83
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,416
in the same style.

84
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,833
I guess.

85
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,041
OK then, I'll give you a hand.

86
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,166
Rakka, pick winter wear
for yourself while you wait.

87
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,666
We won't take long.

88
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,416
Send them in after
they take off their coats.

89
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,666
OK.

90
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,750
Yeaah!

91
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:17,875
Hey!

92
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,708
I told you to take
your coat off first!

93
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:21,625
Come on!

94
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,000
Not all at once!

95
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,083
Sorry about that.

96
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,291
Hey, stop fumbling around!

97
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,666
You'll get hurt!

98
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,500
Ouch!

99
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,125
Hey, stop pulling my beard!

100
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,750
I'll finish taking
the measurements.

101
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,708
Why don't you go
and wait outside?

102
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,875
Yeah, I think I will.

103
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,125
Thanks.

104
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,833
Man, I hate kids.

105
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,208
Got used to the town yet?

106
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,291
Ah.

107
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,416
But, you are
surprised at how early

108
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,666
winter comes
around here, right?

109
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,291
This one.

110
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,416
OK.

111
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,250
Hmm...

112
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,000
You need some shoes, too.

113
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:09,833
Huh?

114
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,833
But I...

115
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,166
You must be cold
in those sandals.

116
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,875
It's gonna be snowing soon.

117
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,333
How about you try on these?

118
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,541
Well, but...

119
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,166
Ahh, be my guest!

120
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,041
A Haibane should
always be in high spirits

121
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,958
with a smile on her face.

122
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,208
But why?

123
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,416
Why?

124
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Well, how should I put this?

125
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,541
Since I was a kid,
my mom's been telling me

126
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,000
that the Charcoal Feathers
are like the ones who

127
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,250
receive blessings from above.

128
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,166
So you're kinda
a good-luck charm.

129
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,833
Well, no offense.

130
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,083
Blessings...

131
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,041
But I'm not...

132
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:41,833
Oh...

133
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,791
Don't mind what I said.

134
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,708
It's only what we
simple townsfolk believe.

135
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,458
Here.

136
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,375
Oh no, my notebook...

137
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,583
there's only one
sheet left inside.

138
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,500
Well ah, why don't we say
that the boots are ah, maybe,

139
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,000
a New Year's present.

140
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,083
Might be a little early, huh?

141
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,458
Look, I don't know
what happened,

142
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:09,208
but things gonna get
better at some point.

143
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,875
No, they won't.

144
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:11,916
I'm just...

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,708
a big failure as
a Charcoal Feather.

146
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,083
Huh...?

147
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,041
Hello.

148
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,416
Oh, hi there.

149
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,750
Let's see.

150
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,583
Do you have this
in different sizes?

151
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,916
Oh, this one comes
in only one size.

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,583
It's a little Haibane!

153
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,791
Oh, she's so cute!

154
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,375
Wow!

155
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,083
She's for real!

156
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,166
Look, it's a little
Charcoal Feather!

157
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,416
We're so lucky!

158
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,458
Something good
will happen today!

159
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,916
Leave her alone,
you're bothering her.

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,791
No!

161
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,500
I'm not bothering her.

162
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,416
Right?

163
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,791
Don't touch me!

164
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,208
Huh?

165
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,666
Hey!

166
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,333
That was a big fall you took,
young miss.

167
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,166
Aah.

168
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,000
Thank you.

169
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,958
Uh, um...

170
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,166
Thank you very much.

171
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,375
Here, I think you dropped this.

172
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,875
I don't belong anywhere.

173
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,583
Nowhere at all

174
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,208
It's better...

175
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,208
if I didn't exist...

176
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,250
at all!

177
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,125
It's calling to me?

178
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,625
The Western Woods.

179
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,250
It's going there.

180
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,000
I feel it, he's calling me.

181
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,750
The air here feels different.

182
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,750
What is that?

183
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,375
You wanted to show me this?

184
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,541
You called to me for this?

185
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,916
It's better...

186
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,875
if I didn't exist...

187
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,750
at all!

188
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,625
A dream...

189
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:20,708
I had somewhere, sometime?

190
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,125
But now...

191
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,000
It's so cold.

192
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,666
Yes...

193
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,291
I remember.

194
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,625
You can't.

195
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,958
But thank you anyway.

196
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:02,083
I guess this well
is being here for a long time.

197
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,458
What's wrong with me?

198
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,833
I should be afraid, but...

199
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,625
Are you the one
who called to me?

200
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,416
You've taken the form of
a bird now, but it feels like

201
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,833
I've known you from somewhere
else, a long time ago.

202
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:48,875
Where's Rakka?

203
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,625
Did she come back?

204
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,333
I wonder what happened to her.

205
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,833
Hey, do you think
that maybe she's...?

206
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,291
It's different from Kuu's time!

207
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,000
Rakka hasn't...

208
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,875
Were you the last one
with her, Reki?

209
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,541
Sorry about that.

210
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,333
I guess I messed up.

211
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,375
She's not a kid who needs
an adult supervision.

212
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,083
But should we go look for her?

213
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,250
Or wait?

214
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,416
Even though it's
still not too late for her

215
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,916
to be outside of old home.

216
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,375
But it is better to go look
for her now than to wait until

217
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,250
the middle of
the night and panic.

218
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,833
Even if this turns out
to be needless worry.

219
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:27,541
Alright, then.

220
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,000
Let's go!

221
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,333
You're not thinking she's
running away like you did,

222
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,583
are you?

223
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,666
The situation does have
a familiar ring to it.

224
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,500
You're right.

225
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,750
The situation is similar...

226
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,250
But she is not as stupid as...

227
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,000
As you were?

228
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,083
Sorry.

229
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,291
It's OK.

230
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,791
Let's go!

231
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,333
Forgive me.

232
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,916
I wish there are something
more I could do for you.

233
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:18,375
You know, I can't even
remember my own name.

234
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,458
They say the Haibane
are all like that.

235
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,583
So I can't remember
anything about who you are

236
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,625
as much as I want to.

237
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:34,875
Except that you are
somebody precious to me.

238
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,375
I was always lonely
and I thought that nobody

239
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:44,458
would ever grieve for me,
even if I was gone forever.

240
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,500
I felt so alone.

241
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:51,416
I just wanted to disappear
and never feel anything again.

242
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:56,416
But you were always by my side.

243
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,916
You became a bird, just to go
over the walls and let me know

244
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,916
that no matter how sad I felt.

245
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,833
I was never alone.
