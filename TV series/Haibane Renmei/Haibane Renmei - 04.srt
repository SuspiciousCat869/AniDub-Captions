1
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,208
A bird.

2
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,250
I know somewhere,
I've seen this...

3
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,083
What is this?

4
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,250
Hey! Wake Up!

5
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,083
What?! What?! What?!

6
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, Kana.

7
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,500
Don't "oh" me.

8
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:57,041
You said that you were going
to help me with work today.

9
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,458
Yes, I know. What time is it?

10
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,416
Six thirty-four in the morning.

11
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,458
I'm tired. 'Night.

12
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,750
Oh, no! Time to get up!

13
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,125
Stop it, stop it!

14
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,666
One, two.

15
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,666
Rakka.

16
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,833
Huh?

17
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,583
Okay, let's go.

18
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,833
Did you leave this out here?

19
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,125
I thought the birds
might eat it.

20
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,166
You shouldn't.
It'll attract the crows.

21
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,000
They're enough trouble as it is,
making a mess from our trash.

22
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,833
Um... um... but I...

23
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,416
Oh, the trash. Rakka, let's
take out the kitchen trash.

24
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,541
Kana! Wait for me.

25
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,875
Ugh, again!

26
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,833
Get out! Damn birds!

27
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,416
Damn, they've timed out
the swing of my broom.

28
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,541
Kana!

29
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,083
Oh, sorry.

30
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,833
That was mean!

31
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,875
I know I closed this door tight
yesterday. The crows must have

32
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,416
figured out the way
to unlock the door somehow.

33
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Wow, they're really smart.

34
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,583
Don't act so impressed.

35
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,791
Ugh, just look at
this mess they've made.

36
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,833
Uh, I know, oh, why don't
we just take out the things

37
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,000
that crows might like to eat?

38
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,791
If you keep
feeding them like that,

39
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,583
that become dependent on us.

40
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,291
Then, how will they
live on their own?

41
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,916
Oh, um...

42
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,791
Just like the Haibane...
the crows have rules.

43
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,208
You can't spoil them!

44
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,166
Come on, we better get moving!

45
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,333
Oh.

46
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,875
The birds are the only
creatures that allowed to go

47
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:10,791
beyond the walls in this town.
If we continued to feed them,

48
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,083
we create a place where they can
survive without any struggle.

49
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,541
In the end, they'll decide
to only inhabit this town and

50
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:21,000
will probably never
fly free on their own again.

51
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:25,833
They might seem to be
happy here, but it's just sad.

52
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,500
Hey, don't you give me
that wistful look!

53
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,541
If you don't keep
your eye on them,

54
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,625
they're gonna
crap all over you.

55
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,583
Oh.

56
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's go.

57
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,250
Did you sleep well?
You look out of it.

58
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,958
Well, um, I can't really
remember, but I think

59
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,833
I was having a bad dream.

60
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,666
Well then, good thing
I woke you up so pleasantly.

61
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,916
Uh, I think maybe
that's what caused it.

62
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,375
Well then, time for breakfast.

63
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,458
Where did you get that watch?

64
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,708
Nice, isn't it?
I found it gathering dust

65
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,208
in the storage room
over there and fixed it up.

66
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,208
By yourself? Amazing!

67
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,041
Oh, there was nothing to it.

68
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,041
I only had to
replace one little spring.

69
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,916
It's still amazing.

70
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,583
It's only a warm-up
compared to my next project.

71
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,416
I'm gonna challenge
a biggie soon.

72
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,916
A biggie?

73
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,458
Wanna see?

74
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,500
So, where did you get tea cups?

75
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,000
Aren't they nice? They were a
gift from the old man who owns

76
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,208
the antique shop, for
gathering reference materials.

77
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:49,500
Oh, now you're a librarian
abusing her power, right?

78
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,375
Don't go ruining my
good name. He was being kind.

79
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,541
I worked over a month for it.

80
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,041
Besides, these are second hand
items, as is the tradition.

81
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,375
Sad isn't it.

82
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,125
The older you get,
the more deceptive you become.

83
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,875
Kuu, breakfast!
Hurry up inside!

84
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,666
One, two.

85
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,416
Finally.

86
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,916
Come on up.

87
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,791
Isn't it like
a secret hide out?

88
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,916
Yes, amazing. Don't tell me
you are going to fix this?

89
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,833
No way. The big one's
completely done.

90
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,750
I wouldn't even know where
to begin on my own. However,

91
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,250
this is the one
that I really wanna fix.

92
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,750
What is that?

93
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,250
Somebody must've been living
here before, and that person

94
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,958
seems to have attempted
to modify this clock,

95
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,416
so that the gears would
move by electricity instead of

96
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,541
by pendulum. Whoever it was
that worked on this,

97
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,291
was good. It's just about
done. If the rusted parts

98
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,583
are replaced and the hands start
moving agin, even the bells

99
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,375
on the very top
might start to ring.

100
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,875
Wow. I wonder if
that person was a Haibane.

101
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,291
I don't know. There were
drawings and engineering notes,

102
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,416
but they're only
written about the clock.

103
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,833
They don't say anything about
who wrote them or how many years

104
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:24,958
ago they were written. I went
exploring in every room here

105
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:29,000
right after I was born,
and I found these in the end.

106
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,458
How should I put it, this is
like a treasure map for me.

107
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,416
Anybody would wanna
continue with this work

108
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,291
once they read it, right?

109
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,916
That's why you work
at the Clock Tower?

110
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah. There I'm still nothing
more than a lowly trainee.

111
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,625
I hope that you can fix it.

112
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,666
Ha.

113
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,500
Oh, no! My job!

114
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,750
Today is very relaxing.

115
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,958
You're right. This is how
every morning should really be.

116
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,125
Having good tea
makes a difference.

117
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,375
Ah... Kana.

118
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,416
Rakka, breakfast!

119
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,291
What's that? Good tea?

120
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,708
Kana.

121
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,083
There.

122
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,750
Jump on, hurry up!

123
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,250
That's insane!

124
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,833
Stop, Stop, Stop it! Please!

125
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,458
Shut up! You'll
bite your tongue!

126
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,208
Are we flying?!

127
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,333
I guess we just made it.

128
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,416
All right! Seems like
Master's late for once.

129
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,833
Let's go around back.

130
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,291
Looks if I didn't have to
speed here like that after all.

131
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,416
Come on, over here.

132
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,708
Oh, good, everything's working.

133
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,250
What?

134
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:02,583
Lately we've been replacing
the old parts in clock.

135
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,500
last night. A-ha, so that's
the reason Master overslept.

136
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,250
Don't judge others
by your standards.

137
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,291
You're seven minutes late.

138
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,125
Good, perfect time.

139
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:25,166
You fool! That's useless if the
screws in your head are loose!

140
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,791
Who are you?

141
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,291
The new girl I told
you about, remember?

142
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,750
She's trying out
different jobs, to pick one.

143
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,583
then, if you want to work here,

144
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,166
you'll have to make a
better impression than this.

145
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,583
Who'd want to buy a watch from a
clock maker that's always late?

146
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,125
Do you buy clothes from
a clothier wearing rags?

147
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,625
Do you buy liquor
from a tea-totaler?!

148
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,166
I'm too young to buy liquor.

149
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,333
Shut up! Stop your quibbling
and go open up the shop already!

150
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:01,375
Alright, Alright!
I hear you already, Man.

151
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,500
And your bicycle! It's
supposed to be in the back!

152
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah.

153
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,958
Damn it, he must've been
watching me from up above.

154
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,083
Hey you, what's your name?

155
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,666
M- m- my name is Rakka, sir.

156
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,333
You're new to Old Home,
aren't you?

157
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,833
Ah, yes.

158
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,708
Got used to this town yet?

159
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,375
Er, uh a little bit.

160
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,916
And Kana,
she's being nice to you?

161
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:33,500
Yes.

162
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,208
Is there anything
you like me to do.

163
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,666
OK then, you can go upstairs
and clean the room for me.

164
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,375
It's been pretty hectic
up there these days.

165
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,375
Hey Master, are we gonna be
tending the store again today?

166
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,208
Nah, you go upstairs
with her and clean up.

167
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,333
It's a total disaster area.

168
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,708
Already? Come on, Rakka.

169
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,166
And if you have any
questions, just ask Kana.

170
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,583
OK.

171
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,500
How come you're so nice
to everybody else, but me?

172
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,208
I'm treating you hard
because you have potential.

173
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,666
Don't complain.

174
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,125
So he says.

175
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,083
Wow!

176
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,791
Ugh!

177
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,625
Man oh man. It gets
like this every time

178
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,625
they replace just one gear.
I hope the clock doesn't

179
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,041
get drunk, really.

180
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,583
Late-night snack?

181
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,333
There's a lot of people who
work here at night. And I guess

182
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,833
the mess is understandable.
But, how can he be such

183
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,250
a stickler about time, and so
sloppy about things like this?

184
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,583
So where should we start off?

185
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,625
Let's do the trash first. Heh,
seems today I'm the garbageman.

186
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,166
Kana, can I have a rag.

187
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,208
Here you go.

188
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,875
Seems like everybody has a job.

189
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,791
You're already knew that.

190
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,500
But, I wonder why
the Haibane work.

191
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,666
'Cause we have to. It's a rule.

192
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,083
That's not what I meant.

193
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:04,833
Mmm, well let's see. Have
you noticed that this town

194
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,083
is extremely
protective of us?

195
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,916
Yes, sort of.

196
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,583
Doesn't it bother you?
It's kinda like...

197
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,791
we're being
treated as children.

198
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,291
So I think that we work
so is not feeling indebted

199
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,291
to the town.

200
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,375
I see. That kind
of makes sense.

201
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:26,458
Ah-ha. Now I get it, you
are helping Reki yesterday,

202
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,916
weren't you?

203
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,583
Yes. Reki, Hikari, you and
everybody else is working

204
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,833
in a job that they really
like to do. I don't know

205
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,375
what I'm supposed to be doing.

206
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,375
If there's nothing,
why don't you help Reki

207
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,208
for the time-being?
She's always short-handed,

208
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,333
having to take care of lots
of high-maintenance kids.

209
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,000
She's very accommodating.

210
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,458
Oh, but unless you work hard,
you could end up being one of

211
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,458
those high-maintenance kids
instead of an assistant.

212
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,458
Ah, really?

213
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,166
Oh no, that's not,
that's not what I meant to say.

214
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,500
What I meant to say is that
Reki is always too kind.

215
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,583
Rakka, you just got here, so
don't worry about it so much.

216
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,791
And you're working
really hard today!

217
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,166
Umm.

218
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,500
Oh yeah, why don't we go up?

219
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,083
Come on, it's OK.
There're railings out here.

220
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,958
Nice view, isn't it?

221
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,708
This is the highest point
in all the town,

222
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:49,541
so if you can stand this,
you won't be scared of anything.

223
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:53,291
Uh, I'm fine... not really.

224
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:57,333
That's 'cause you're
looking down. Look far ahead.

225
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:04,083
Uh, look far ahead?
The farthest is... the walls?

226
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,250
Yeah that's it. This town is
cone-shaped and this Tower's

227
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,250
at the bottom of it,
so maybe the walls are higher.

228
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,833
What's beyond those walls?
Do you ever wonder?

229
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,416
Who could really know. The
Haibane aren't allowed to go

230
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,083
anywhere near them. Nobody
but the Toga come into town,

231
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:23,833
and townspeople can't
go outside. If you did,

232
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,250
you'd never be allowed
to come back in again.

233
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,041
Oh, the birds.

234
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:32,916
Huh?

235
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,541
They're flying over the walls.

236
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:40,125
The Haibane believes that
they carry our lost items.

237
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,791
Lost items?

238
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,333
Things we left behind and
forgot about when we went

239
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,000
into the cocoons.

240
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:52,458
Oh, well, that's how the legend
goes. It's probably because

241
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,750
the birds come and go over
and back from the walls.

242
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:58,833
Rakka?

243
00:17:58,916 --> 00:17:59,625
Huh?

244
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,000
Feeling any better now?

245
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,625
Yes, much better.

246
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,208
You see, you've
become fearless now.

247
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,125
Cleaning's done.
And this is for you.

248
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,458
What's that?

249
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,708
Mind your own business.

250
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,791
What's next?

251
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,708
Nah, that's it.

252
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,000
What's this?

253
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,333
Punishment for being late.
The, uh, clock tower that's

254
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,541
in your home,
uh... go repair that.

255
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,916
Can I really?

256
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,958
Yeah. We're really not
supposed to meddle too much

257
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,083
in the Haibane's daily lives.

258
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,208
Alright!

259
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,000
Ah, wait!

260
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,333
Thank you for letting me
work here today.

261
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:16,375
Hey, is Kana going
to leave this place?

262
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:21,458
No! Really. Kana didn't bring
me here to replace her at all.

263
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,208
I'm just visiting everyone's
workplace each day because

264
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:28,583
I wanted to see what kind of
job they have. I believe that...

265
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,791
she really does love it here.

266
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,416
That's good. It's just that
whenever I see those wings

267
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,583
of yours, they make me think
she might just fly away on me

268
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,833
one day.

269
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,208
They might look fancy,
but the truth is that

270
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,333
they really don't work at all.

271
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,583
Oh, I see. That's a relief.

272
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,333
Rakka, can't you go any faster?

273
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,416
No, safety first.

274
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,875
Damn.

275
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,958
I wanted to say
thank you for today.

276
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,875
Yeah, did it help you out?

277
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,875
Yes, I discovered
a lot of things.

278
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:09,958
Like what, Rakka?

279
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,750
Don't judge people
by appearances.

280
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,875
Oh, you mean Master.
Don't be fooled by him.

281
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,083
He may be friendly to customers.

282
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,000
Ah.

283
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,708
But he's always
barking at me.

284
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,833
No, not him.

285
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:22,791
What?

286
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,000
Never mind. It's nothing

287
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,541
You're strange.

288
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,250
I think I can smell the river.

289
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,833
Huh.

290
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,125
May be I've seen scenery like
this one time somewhere before.

291
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,791
There you go at it again.
But this time I know

292
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:47,291
just what you mean. So,
do you remember anything?

293
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,083
Funny, isn't it? I can
remember things like how

294
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,000
to talk or how to ride
a bike, but nothing else.

295
00:20:59,125 --> 00:20:59,750
Hmm.

296
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,041
What is it?

297
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,666
I think I remember that
I used to sing whenever

298
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,875
I was feeling like this. So I
just thought now it'd be nice

299
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,875
if I could remember a song.

300
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,416
Hey! I spent a lot
of time finding that net!

301
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,208
And you stupid bird
rip it up the next day!

302
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,000
Never give up, huh?

303
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,416
Yeah, they don't
those damn crows.

304
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,916
No, I meant you.

305
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,958
What'd you say!?

306
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,666
Oops, backfired.

307
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,041
You shouldn't give up.

308
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,416
You aren't trying to
patronize me, are you, Rakka?

309
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,416
No, that's not true.
Both of you, don't give up!

310
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,583
Huh? Just what does that mean?
