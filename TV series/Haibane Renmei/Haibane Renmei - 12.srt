1
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,166
You look a little pale.

2
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,000
I didn't sleep enough,
but I'm all right.

3
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:09,625
Oh, here. You left this
on the table.

4
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,375
You can have it.

5
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,500
I don't need it any more.

6
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,125
Good morning.

7
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,750
Good morning.

8
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,500
What on earth are you wearing?

9
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,708
Hey, go get changed
and wash your hands.

10
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:35,000
Uh oh, she's becoming
a full-blooded housekeeper.

11
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,250
No, you're becoming a slob.

12
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,833
Reki, the Bell Nut Market
is being held today.

13
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,916
You do remember that,
don't you?

14
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,416
Bell nuts?

15
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,250
We need them for the
Passing of the Year Festival.

16
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,416
Are all of these from
the same kind of tree?

17
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,416
Yeah. You see,
the colors are changed by

18
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,375
mixing iron and
verdigris into the soil.

19
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,000
Good nuts are ones
with thick shells that

20
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,750
make a solid sound
when you shake them.

21
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,333
This one's a "thank-you" nut.

22
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,708
You give it to the people
you want to thank.

23
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,291
Oh.

24
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,416
Having fun?

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
The sound is very soothing.

26
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,541
Yeah.

27
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,000
So, these symbolize
appreciation?

28
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,625
Different colors mean different
things. Appreciation, apologies.

29
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,916
It's custom to mark the end
of the year by giving these

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,458
to the people close to you.

31
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:00,875
Oh.

32
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,416
Why can't you at least pretend
to be part of the group?

33
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,166
Shut up, and stop following me.

34
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,708
Hey.

35
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,333
Stop being so... Reki!

36
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,333
What do you want?

37
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,666
It's nothing.

38
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,333
If you have
something to say to me,

39
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,208
then why don't
you just say it.

40
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,958
I'm sorry for causing you
all so much trouble

41
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,333
and dragging you both
into my personal problems.

42
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,500
I was just really alone.

43
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,166
Reki?

44
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,125
The festival's not
till next week.

45
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:58,708
I don't have much time.
And, I might not see you again.

46
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,958
Huh?

47
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,333
The first saw her five
years ago. It was raining.

48
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,291
Her wings were all black,
she was crying as she walked,

49
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,333
all soaking wet.

50
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,375
She looked just like
an abandoned cat.

51
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,291
Right there, I knew
that I had to help her.

52
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,958
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

53
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,000
Shut up! Anyway,
that's the story.

54
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,583
That was the day when
Reki became one of us.

55
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,208
And then, she left,
taking you with her.

56
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,000
Back then, she was always
crying, missing her friend...

57
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,041
...who'd gone beyond the walls.

58
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,958
So, I tried to do
something for her.

59
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,833
And this idiot took Reki and
tried to climb over the wall,

60
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,416
by driving a wedge into it.

61
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,958
Hyoko... Hyoko... 

62
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,208
Hyoko!

63
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,791
We didn't think
he would survive.

64
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,375
Reki didn't even
have single scratch,

65
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,250
and I will never
forgive her for that.

66
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,791
It wasn't her fault.
I did it on my own.

67
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,250
Reki is still selfish.

68
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,125
You were one of
her best friends.

69
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,000
Why don't you shut up!

70
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,166
I have to...

71
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,916
I want to help Reki.

72
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,625
So that she can receive
the blessing properly.

73
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,250
You' are just getting her way.

74
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,916
Reki is not a kind of person
who asks for other's help.

75
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,583
You're wrong! You just
don't see what's going on,

76
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:12,375
cause Reki smiles
even when she's suffering.

77
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,583
I'll help.

78
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,875
After all, I have to
pay her back for the gift.

79
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,833
Idiot! You aren't allowed
to enter the South District.

80
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,333
Remember?

81
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,208
Don't you worry about me.
I got a brain.

82
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,041
What brain?

83
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,333
Good morning.

84
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,708
Oh, good morning.

85
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,125
Can you wait a bit?
It'll be ready in a minute.

86
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,208
Okay.

87
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,166
I'm starving!

88
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,750
Hey... Kanna why don't
you help for a change?

89
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,208
Yeah, I know, alright.

90
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,250
Rakka, have you seen Reki?

91
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,583
I don't know what I should do.

92
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,208
You just do everything
that you're capable of.

93
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,958
After that...
just have faith in Reki.

94
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:31,208
Very soon, I will be forgotten
by everybody... and vanish.

95
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,541
Where did I go wrong?

96
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:55,125
What is it that I am supposed
to do in order to help Reki?

97
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,541
Kuu!

98
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,541
Where did you learn that? 

99
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,833
I permit you to speak.

100
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,500
I felt Kuu's presence near the
sign that produces light leaves.

101
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,708
It's Kuu's sign, isn't it?

102
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,916
But its letters do not
mean the word "air",

103
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,416
the name given
by the Haibane.

104
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,083
It's a different name
with the same sound.

105
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,041
Kuu has a different name?

106
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,750
It is proof that the Haibane
attained a true identity.

107
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,916
When the time comes, the name on
the sign hanging from the wall

108
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,708
is changed to the true name.

109
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:38,875
Yes, now may be
a good opportunity.

110
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,416
We created this, using the
tag on the wall as a model.

111
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,000
Rakka.

112
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,166
Can you tell me
where that name came from?

113
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,041
It's because I isolated myself
inside the shell like a nut.

114
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:10,333
And because you sprouted here
and connected with others.

115
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:14,541
Therefore, it will be
your true name.

116
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,250
But! What about Reki?

117
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,083
She does not know
her true name.

118
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,083
She is not willing
to listen to my words.

119
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,541
Why not?

120
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,916
Five years ago,
she brought to us a Haibane boy

121
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,583
who had fallen ill.

122
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:33,208
I know. He tried to climb the
wall by driving a wedge into it.

123
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:37,666
A serious crime. I had to
call for the community watch.

124
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,416
Reki was deemed guilty,
and she shut herself inside

125
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,041
the Circle of the Sin.

126
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,208
She has been blaming
herself all this time.

127
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,250
Why is it only Reki
who can't be forgiven?

128
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,875
Why do you think
you were forgiven?

129
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,583
It's not because
I forgave myself.

130
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:59,583
That is correct. Nobody is
able to forgive themselves.

131
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,750
However, you had the bird.

132
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,958
Someone believed
in you and stood by you.

133
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,958
By recognizing one's own sin.
You can't help going around

134
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:13,958
in circles if you are alone.
But, if you have someone

135
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,666
it's by your side...

136
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,333
Give this to Reki
after the festival.

137
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,375
Now Go.

138
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,958
Reki's name. Her true name.

139
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,333
Stir lightly, being careful
not to flatten the meringue.

140
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,666
Like this?

141
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,000
That's right. Then pour it
into a dish, and bake it

142
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,666
in the oven preheated
to about 390 degrees

143
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,666
for 10 minutes or so.

144
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,708
Okay.

145
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:16,958
Hello. Good morning.

146
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,333
Good morning.
Yeah, this is good.

147
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,833
You've been a tremendous
help with this Reki.

148
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,708
I can't start getting ready
for my special dinner until

149
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,625
you relinquish
control of the kitchen.

150
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,333
Yes, I know.

151
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,750
The Passing of
the Year Festival.

152
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,750
Rakka, I don't think
I'm going into town today.

153
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,416
Reki?

154
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,791
Sorry for being so selfish.
But today of all days,

155
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,041
I would like to stay here.
So I can etch the memories

156
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,916
of my life here into my mind.

157
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,958
When I looked out from here
for the first time...

158
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,333
I was a little afraid,
thinking that I came to a world

159
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:14,583
I didn't know. But now, this
is where I feel most secure.

160
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,083
Because you are always here.

161
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,250
Thank you. And even
if you forget about me,

162
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,583
I hope that you will
always remember this view.

163
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:26,208
I won't forget.
There's no way I can forget.

164
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:31,416
Because, the time I spent with
you is everything I remember.

165
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,041
It's so busy here.

166
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,458
It'll all be quiet once
the first bell starts ringing.

167
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,041
You're supposed to observe the
Passing of the Year in silence.

168
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,166
You are?

169
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,833
That's why we have these to
express feelings without words.

170
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,208
And at the end
of festival... oops.

171
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,416
And at the end?

172
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,041
You'll see. It can't
be explained in words.

173
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,416
It this coming through...

174
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,583
Honestly. You really are
a meddler, aren't you?

175
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,041
Rakka! 

176
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,333
Dai

177
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,625
It's a cake!

178
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,666
I know I'm getting
in the way, but...

179
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,375
That's alright.
Because of you,

180
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,125
we feel like it's finally time
to have a talk with Reki.

181
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,291
What? But...

182
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,416
We have our own way of doing
things. We're totally different

183
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,916
from the snobs at your house.

184
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,416
Because you've got
no class, right, Midori?

185
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,041
Anyway, we have a little
entertainment ready for

186
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,708
the Passing of the Year.
Reki's in town, isn't she?

187
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,875
Na-nah. She said she wanted
to stay in Old Home today.

188
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,625
What?! Why? It's the festival!

189
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,125
It's the bell!

190
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,125
Oh, no! We're
running out of time!

191
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,000
Wait a minute!
What's the matter?

192
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,541
We're just doing
what you asked us to do.

193
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,041
You're too dainty
to run, aren't you?

194
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,291
You need a break?

195
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,166
Not at all. I'm the one
who started all of this!

196
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,333
Where's Reki's room?

197
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,500
West wing, third floor.

198
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,583
We won't make it
in time. Reki! Reki!

199
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,375
I came to see you!
Open the window!

200
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,041
Reki!

201
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,541
Well done.

202
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,083
Rakka? Midori!
What's wrong...?

203
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,666
We'll explain later! 

204
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,708
Look towards the
Abandoned Factory!

205
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,500
This is the answer
from Hyohko and I.

206
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,791
That's what Hyohko
wants to tell you.

207
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,250
Yellow...
What does yellow mean?

208
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:16,166
It means "I've been acting
like an idiot." That's true.

209
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,875
"Good-bye and
thank you, Reki", huh.

210
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,625
Hey, Rakka!

211
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,458
You're back early.
Did you see the fireworks?

212
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,083
Can you wait for a second?

213
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,000
What's going on?

214
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,666
Just stay here.

215
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,291
The bell stopped.
So ends the year.

216
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,958
That's right.
So what happens now?

217
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,250
The walls send the thoughts
they've been receiving

218
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,500
from everyone over
the past year into the sky.

219
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,666
The thoughts?

220
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,541
You just listen for it.
