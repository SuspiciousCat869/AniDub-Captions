1
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,375
Kuu.

2
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,166
Rakka.

3
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:10,125
Rakka, if you keep crying
like that, Kuu can't go on

4
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,791
her journey without
worrying about you.

5
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,625
Yes.

6
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,958
But...

7
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,750
Rakka, we'll be
seeing her again.

8
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,958
We have to believe that.

9
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,958
Kuu just went there
ahead of us.

10
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,333
You shouldn't be
feeling sad for her.

11
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,916
Let's go.

12
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,875
I wonder if Kuu
can hear the bells.

13
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,750
I'm sure she can.

14
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:42,500
May the bell be a guide
through her day of flight.

15
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,583
I have to find a bed.

16
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,291
Winter is here, Kuu.

17
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,541
I can't.

18
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,333
I shouldn't cry.

19
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,250
Good morning, Kuu.

20
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,208
It's already been
a month since you left.

21
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,458
Winter has finally come
to this little town.

22
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:30,208
But thanks to your advice,
I didn't catch a cold.

23
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,250
How are you doing, Kuu?

24
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,333
So what it's like
where you are now?

25
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,833
What do you do there?

26
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:45,125
I hope people there are as nice
as those in the town of Guri.

27
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,666
In case you're wondering,

28
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,666
everybody here at Old Home
is doing fine...

29
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,375
And I...

30
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:59,666
Sorry, but I can't congratulate
you like everyone else.

31
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,375
I wanted to be
with you much longer.

32
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:06,250
I wanted to go shopping
with you, eat with you,

33
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,041
and talk about a lot
of things with you.

34
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,333
There were a lot more things
I wanted you to teach me.

35
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,916
Pea soup, please.

36
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,750
Hey, I see a lot
of you these days.

37
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,541
Is that all you want?

38
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,166
You know...

39
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,375
I haven't seen that kid around.

40
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,625
Know him?

41
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:37,166
That boy he's just
a little shorter than you.

42
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,458
Kuu.

43
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,791
Ahh, that's it.

44
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,291
I didn't remember his name.

45
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,875
Oh, she's a girl?

46
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:47,958
Now, I feel bad, I kept calling
her "Boy." Tell her I'm sorry.

47
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,166
Kuu...

48
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,083
isn't here anymore.

49
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:51,833
What?

50
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,791
Then she's disappeared?

51
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,708
Well.

52
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,166
I guess that's how it always
ends up with all you Haibane?

53
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,750
I understand.

54
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,916
So this is to go, isn't it?

55
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,166
Oh, don't worry; it's on me.

56
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,916
Save that for when
you come here to have

57
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,250
a big full-course dinner.

58
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,333
But I...

59
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,375
Here you go.

60
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,166
Have some more coffee.

61
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,208
For the people of this town,

62
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,250
Kuu's disappearance
is not a big deal.

63
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,458
Life goes on.

64
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,958
Soon they'll probably
forget that she was even here.

65
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,625
Kuu...

66
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,625
Don't you care about that?

67
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,250
Hey.

68
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,375
You live in that run-down
house in the South District,

69
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,708
don't you?

70
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,458
It's called Old Home.

71
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,875
Oh, sorry.

72
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,041
But you guys call
our place "Waste factory",

73
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,791
so it seems only fair to me.

74
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,791
Get it, I'm from
the East District.

75
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,583
You're Hyoko.

76
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,791
Not Hyoko.

77
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:27,583
It's HYOHKO!

78
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,250
It means "ice lake"!

79
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,625
Hiyoko means baby chicken.

80
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,916
It doesn't matter.

81
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,166
So listen.

82
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,625
Do you remember seeing
that light that came out

83
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,166
of the Western Woods.

84
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,750
You know, about a month ago,
when the storm came?

85
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,250
My friend told me something.

86
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,666
The light only shows up
when a Haibane is gone...

87
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,916
When they are supposed
to go beyond the walls.

88
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,166
But everybody's
still around at our Factory,

89
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,916
so we thought maybe it was
someone from your run-down...

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,708
Oops, sorry I meant
to say Old Home.

91
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,958
So tell me...

92
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,291
Was it Reki?

93
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,833
That's good.

94
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,375
I was worried.

95
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,125
Oh, um, don't tell anyone
that I asked especially...

96
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,583
What do you mean
saying "that's good?"

97
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,708
We just lost a close friend.

98
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,625
Hey wait!

99
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,500
Kana!

100
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,333
Overcooked!

101
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,625
It's cooked fine.

102
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,500
No it's not.

103
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,708
Where's Rakka?

104
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,916
I went to get her
but she wasn't there.

105
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,500
She doesn't eat with us
much any more, does she?

106
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,666
Maybe she's on a diet.

107
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,833
Kana.

108
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,375
I was only joking.

109
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,625
I heard that she likes

110
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,041
to go into town more often
to eat these days.

111
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,083
Alone?

112
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,375
Maybe she wants
to be left alone.

113
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:46,083
She was the most depressed out
of all of us when Kuu left.

114
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,583
Did you know?

115
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,750
Rakka's been cleaning up
Kuu's room all this time.

116
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,875
Oh.

117
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,583
So Rakka did it too?

118
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,791
Kana, you went
to Kuu's room, too?

119
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,833
Just one time.

120
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:05,000
I've accepted it, I know
Kuu isn't with us anymore.

121
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,041
I wonder if Rakka
just can't accept it.

122
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,208
You know, I thought maybe
we should leave her alone

123
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,375
until she's ready to let it go.

124
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,625
But...

125
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,916
she has to find closure
to this event sometime.

126
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,625
I wish there was something
we could do to help.

127
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,666
I know!

128
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,041
Let's do this.

129
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,666
What am I going to do?

130
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,333
There's more of it.

131
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,208
I didn't have it this morning.

132
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,583
Good morning!

133
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,125
Rise and shine!

134
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,708
Are you awake?

135
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,750
Uh huh.

136
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,166
That's good.

137
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,833
I was thinking...

138
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,625
It's been a while since
everyone ate together, so...

139
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,375
Oh OK, hold on...

140
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,333
I'll join you when I'm dressed.

141
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,625
You go ahead.

142
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,500
Fine, we'll be waiting.

143
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,791
Looks too difficult for me.

144
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,666
Come on, help us.

145
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,375
Help you sew?

146
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,583
You're kidding right?

147
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,625
We all have to!

148
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,833
Even the kids
need to have them.

149
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,458
But Kana can't sew.

150
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,458
Whenever she starts out
making a glove,

151
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,666
it winds up looking like a sock.

152
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,583
I just don't like
doing stupid work like that.

153
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,500
Your Clock Master would
be in tears if he heard

154
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,666
what you just said.

155
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,708
I don't mind machines at all.

156
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,500
They're all built rock solid.

157
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,791
But with cloth...

158
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,041
Ah...

159
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:17,541
Um...

160
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,125
good morning.

161
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,250
Hey.

162
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,041
Good morning, Rakka.

163
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,666
Oh, what happened
to your dress?

164
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,041
Oh, it got dirty,
so I washed it.

165
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,083
Here, take a look at this.

166
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,458
What is it?

167
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,833
They are wing covers
because it'll get cold soon.

168
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,708
So I thought it would be
nice if we made everyone's

169
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,208
with the same design.

170
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,208
Rakka, are you good at sewing?

171
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,166
Me?

172
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,375
Well, not really.

173
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,250
I haven't had much experience.

174
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:45,916
Alright!

175
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,291
Welcome to the club!

176
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,125
Kana!

177
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,541
Really...

178
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,333
It's OK.

179
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,708
I'll teach you how.

180
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:52,208
It's easy.

181
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,708
Watch!

182
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,708
Just spread your wings.

183
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,708
I'll take your
measurements now.

184
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:57,708
Hmm?

185
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,125
What happened
to your feathers?

186
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,416
Uh, it's nothing.

187
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,000
They look frayed.

188
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,458
Are you taking care of them?

189
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,041
Well, not really.

190
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,458
See, it shows.

191
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,541
That's not good.

192
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,333
You're a girl,
you should know better.

193
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,750
Rakka.

194
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,750
What's this...

195
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,750
Um, well, my sofa
is really hard.

196
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:25,083
So I might have
hurt them in my sleep.

197
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,416
Oh yeah,
you don't have a bed yet.

198
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,791
I guess moving is a hard work.

199
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,583
Why don't you just put
this one in there?

200
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,458
Because it won't
fit through the door.

201
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,875
Oh, I know.

202
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,083
How about if you take
the bed that's in Kuu's room?

203
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:37,875
What?

204
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,666
Hey, that's a great idea.

205
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,666
I'll help you if
you want to move it.

206
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,333
But...

207
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,916
it's Kuu's

208
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,166
I think Kuu would be very happy
knowing that you would have it.

209
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,666
Maybe she would,
but I don't know...

210
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,000
But...

211
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,541
Rakka!

212
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,750
Rakka!

213
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:06,125
What happend, it seems like
I said something wrong to her.

214
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,833
No, it's not
your fault at all, Hikari.

215
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,958
I'd better go
upstairs and talk to her.

216
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,291
I'll come with you!

217
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,125
No, leave it to me.

218
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,000
But...

219
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,166
It's all right.

220
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,250
Rakka.

221
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,500
Rakka, I'm coming in.

222
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,083
What have you done?

223
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,125
Stay away!

224
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,458
It's alright.

225
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,666
They keep spreading.

226
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,500
I'm scared.

227
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
It's gonna be alright.

228
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,250
Am I sick?

229
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,916
You're not sick.

230
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,083
So, please don't worry, Rakka.

231
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,875
You have nothing
to be blamed for.

232
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,958
It stings.

233
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,791
It stings because
you cut off your feathers.

234
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,583
Just rinse them with
cold water when you wake up

235
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,000
tomorrow morning.

236
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,708
That should make the
black seem less noticeable.

237
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:33,958
It's medicine, isn't it?

238
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,791
So I am sick, I was right.

239
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,291
This is just a dye
collected from an Elderly Tree.

240
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,875
The legend says that can
blind the eyes of the evil.

241
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,833
An elderly Tree?

242
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,958
A snow scale tree, I guess.

243
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,791
They grow only near the
walls, and they are named

244
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:56,125
Elderly Trees because their
trunks are very much twisted.

245
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:00,375
But you stay away from
the walls no matter what, OK?

246
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,791
It's dangerous.

247
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:07,125
Reki, why do you have
such special medicine?

248
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,875
How do you know
about these things?

249
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,416
This town exists
for the Haibane.

250
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,750
The walls are there
to protect us.

251
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,458
A good Haibane lives here
happily and goes beyond

252
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,541
the walls when
their time comes.

253
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,166
But once in a while,

254
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,333
a Haibane is born who
cannot be blessed by the town.

255
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,333
A Charcoal Feather
who cannot remember

256
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,833
anything about
their dream in the cocoon.

257
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,500
The day of flight
never comes to him or her.

258
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,000
For such an
unblessed Haibane,

259
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:45,208
the town becomes a cage
which offers no escape.

260
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,416
This Haibane is
declared to be Sin-Bound.

261
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,333
So am I...

262
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,666
No, absolutely not.

263
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,083
I'm the one who
first found your cocoon,

264
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,875
and I'm the one who rinsed
the blood out of your wings.

265
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,875
Your feathers were
beautiful charcoal gray

266
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,583
when you were born.

267
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,083
You're a good Charcoal Feather.

268
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,541
You're not like I am.

269
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,500
Reki...

270
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,458
You don't have it...

271
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,708
The wings that broke out
from my back had black,

272
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,625
spotted feathers.

273
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,000
I was Sin-Bound
from the very beginning.

274
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:24,333
I could hardly remember
the dream I had in the cocoon.

275
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:28,333
Because of the black feathers,
everybody was afraid of me.

276
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,041
I was an outcast.

277
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,416
Even Nemu avoided me
when I was a newborn.

278
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,291
If it weren't for Kuramori
who had protected me,

279
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,833
I would've been
all alone to this day.

280
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,291
Kuramori?

281
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,041
She's beautiful.

282
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,083
Yeah.

283
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,875
She was like a mother
to the kids and a good mentor

284
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,166
to Nemu and myself.

285
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,375
And despite her delicate
health, she helped me by going

286
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,750
to the heart of the forest
to collect the medicine

287
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,958
from the elderly tree.

288
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,833
She's the one who decorated
the guestroom as it is now,

289
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:10,458
so she, Nemu, and I could
live there together.

290
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:16,000
Kuramori wasn't afraid
at all to be near me.

291
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,583
She was always
there by my side.

292
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,958
Not out of pity.

293
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,250
She was just there
for me when I needed her.

294
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,791
She was a good person.

295
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,833
But Reki, I think you
are a good Haibane, too.

296
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,125
Whatever you might think,
I'm still a sinner.

297
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,000
Five years ago,
Kuramori left us.

298
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,666
I didn't know anything
about the day of flight,

299
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,416
so I thought that
she had abandoned me.

300
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,250
I was so depressed that
Nemu became concerned for me,

301
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,125
so she did some research at
the library on the old legend.

302
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,750
She told me about
the day of flight.

303
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,708
But I didn't believe it.

304
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:59,166
I had became too
emotionally blinded.

305
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,333
I hated a lot of things,

306
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:05,166
and I think I said many
terrible things to Nemu.

307
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,000
I ran away from Old Home and I
kept repeating the same mistakes

308
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,166
at the place I ran away to.

309
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,708
In the end, I was caught by the
community watch and eventually

310
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,333
punished by the
Haibane Renmei as well.

311
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,541
But you, Rakka, haven't done
anything to be punished for.

312
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,375
You've done nothing at all.

313
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,958
So, I know in my heart this
must be some kind of a mistake.

314
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,791
It'll be all gone in no time.

315
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:34,833
Reki, you don't remember
your dream in the cocoon?

316
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,666
Not completely.

317
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,041
I've been drawing pictures
and pictures of it,

318
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,541
trying to remember.

319
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,791
Since I came here,
I've been haunted by nightmares.

320
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,875
In my dreams,
it's a very cold night,

321
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,916
and there's
a red moon in the sky.

322
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,708
I'm all alone.

323
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,375
Just walking on
a stone-laden path.

324
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,416
Then something happens there.

325
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,708
I can't remember what it was,

326
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,875
but it's something
very horrible.

327
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,625
Every time it happens,
I scream myself awake.

328
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,500
Always the same dream.

329
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,208
I don't understand at all.

330
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,875
Why are there good
Haibane and cursed ones?

331
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:23,041
Why was I born Sin-Bound?

332
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:49,625
Until now, I had thought
that this town was a paradise

333
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,041
to live in.

334
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:55,750
Yet, despite everyone's caring
and compassionate hearts

335
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,791
and willingness to do
their best for each other,

336
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:02,333
sad things still happen.

337
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:06,791
Some suffer from
the curses given to them.

338
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,333
What are the Haibane?
