1
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,458
Good-bye, everybody.

2
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,166
Reki...

3
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,375
Reki?

4
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:05,791
Rakka.

5
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,375
What are you doing here?

6
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,041
I'm really sorry.

7
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,916
I let myself in.

8
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,541
Look at you.

9
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:17,000
You'll be Rakka
to the very end.

10
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,250
Reki, what's...?

11
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,875
This is my cocoon dream.

12
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,041
The nightmare that has been

13
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,833
tormenting my
existence in this world.

14
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,833
I was walking along this path.

15
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,750
I remember cold winds
stinging my cheeks

16
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,416
that were wet from tears.

17
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,750
I heard a sound from far away.

18
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,958
But I was too tired to think.

19
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,875
I remember wanting
to become a stone.

20
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:51,958
A stone that doesn't feel
pain or sorrow.

21
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,750
The Haibane Renmei want me
to give this to you.

22
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,625
It's your true name.

23
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,541
I don't want it.

24
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:11,750
There's no salvation
for me inside that box.

25
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,708
Reki, even if that's true,

26
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,291
it's time for you to put an end
to this long nightmare of yours.

27
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:46,791
This is the story, of a young
girl who was called Reki.

28
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:50,000
She was doomed to
a most unfortunate fate,

29
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,708
and lost the people she
could share her sorrow with.

30
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:57,875
Believing herself worthless,
she called herself Reki,

31
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,458
using the sign
which meant "small stones."

32
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:05,125
However, the sign that
expresses her true name means

33
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,416
"the one who was run over
and torn asunder."

34
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,041
Reki?

35
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,500
No.

36
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,916
Re...

37
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,166
I know.

38
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,208
The one who was
run over and torn asunder.

39
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,583
Yes, I was run over.

40
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,291
This isn't a path.

41
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,833
It's an iron line
that carries something.

42
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,416
This is where...

43
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,958
I abandoned myself.

44
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,625
Reki, What can I-

45
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,333
You know, Rakka...

46
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,375
I believed that if
I was a good Haibane,

47
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,708
I would someday
be able to wake up

48
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,833
and shed this
feeling of guilt.

49
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,708
What a joke.

50
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,875
None of them matters.

51
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,541
This town is my prison.

52
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,958
The walls are
symbol of my death.

53
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,875
This world is
separated by death.

54
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,625
And this room...

55
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:38,583
This room is my cocoon.

56
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,250
I wasn't able to leave
this nightmare behind.

57
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,458
For seven long years,

58
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:49,750
I kept waiting for a deliverance
that would never come.

59
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:41,791
Every time I trusted someone,
I ended up being betrayed.

60
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,625
So, finally, I stopped
trusting everybody.

61
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,666
I decided I would
never be hurt again.

62
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,708
I decided to be made of stone.

63
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,458
That's the irony of it...

64
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,625
When I turn to stone
and pretend to be good,

65
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:01,166
that's when they tell me
I'm a good little Haibane.

66
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,000
They'll never know...

67
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,916
how very dark...

68
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,541
and very cold my heart is.

69
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,791
Stop that.

70
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,333
There's no way
I can believe that!

71
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,416
You've always...

72
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,791
been so kind!

73
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:15,958
Rakka.

74
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:22,250
I guess you never really
understood, you never saw...

75
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,291
How jealous I was of you.

76
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,875
No.

77
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:33,500
Both of us Sin-Bound, but in
the end, only you were forgiven.

78
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,291
Everyone leaves me eventually.

79
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:42,541
When Kuu took her day of Flight,
part of me was jealous of her...

80
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,583
and I hate myself for it.

81
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,958
That's not true!

82
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,666
You came looking for me
when I fell into the well!

83
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,416
You took care of me and went
to get medicine for me!

84
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,416
Whenever I was in pain,
you were always there for me!

85
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,291
That's right!

86
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,750
And why'd I do it?

87
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,125
I was looking for my salvation!

88
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,916
I can only forget about my sin

89
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,041
when I'm being
useful to someone.

90
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,208
And the only thought that I had
whole time I was helping you

91
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,541
was that maybe God would come
down and finally forgive me!

92
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,375
Stop it!

93
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,625
Stop it!

94
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,750
Rakka.

95
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,458
For what I needed,
you could have been anybody.

96
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,416
Stop it!

97
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,416
When I first found your cocoon,
at that moment I had a plan.

98
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,708
I told myself that if I could
make this one Haibane trust me,

99
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,250
then maybe I would
finally be forgiven.

100
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,750
It never mattered who
came out of the cocoon.

101
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,916
It was all pat of my plan.

102
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,750
Why do you think I acted
so kindly towards you.

103
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,750
It was all a lie.

104
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,541
I don't care what I do
as long as I find forgiveness.

105
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,458
It was your mistake
trusting me.

106
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,958
And now you know, so get out.

107
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,458
Get out!

108
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:22,416
From the very beginning,
there was no salvation for me.

109
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,583
Not true...

110
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,000
It's not true...

111
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:50,583
I'm going to disappear once the
sound reaches the house, right?

112
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,666
You know that Rakka
was trying to help you.

113
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,375
Maybe I don't
deserve anyone's help.

114
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,416
But...

115
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,041
why don't I ever
get to ask for help?

116
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,333
Stop it!

117
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,333
Why are you so afraid?

118
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,500
Just trust someone!

119
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,875
I won't ever be
betrayed again!

120
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,208
In my dream, and in this town,
no matter what I do,

121
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,458
no one ever comes to save me!

122
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,583
But...

123
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,375
You never actually
ask anyone for help.

124
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,458
All you do...

125
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,250
is wait.

126
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,291
I can't do it!

127
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:53,083
What if I call for help
and nobody answers?

128
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,083
What if I really am
completely alone?

129
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,583
I wish I didn't know anything.

130
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,250
I wish I could still love Reki.

131
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,541
I want...

132
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,958
to keep trusting Reki.

133
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,625
But I...

134
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,333
But I...

135
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,166
Her diary...

136
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,041
I found a caccoon all
by myself. I'm so happy.

137
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,833
This must be a special
sign from God.

138
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,125
I will be kind to her
and always be by her side.

139
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:42,000
This time I will be a good
Haibane, like Kunimore.

140
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,166
That's right...

141
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,250
Reki...

142
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,041
when I was in the cocoon...

143
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,500
Can you hear me?

144
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,916
My name is Reki.

145
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,666
This is the first time
I've ever found a cocoon,

146
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,333
so I'm real happy and excited.

147
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,833
As a Haibane, you're going to
loose your name and your past,

148
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,875
so at first you're going to
feel lonely and apprehensive.

149
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,916
But I will always be with you.

150
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,958
I will protect you,
No matter what.

151
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:23,791
So please, let me entrust
my last hopes onto you.

152
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,041
I understand.

153
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,458
She protected me.

154
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,250
She protected me
from the beginning.

155
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,000
Reki...

156
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,875
I have to be the bird
who will save Reki.

157
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,208
Just like the bird who saved me.

158
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,791
Reki!

159
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,958
Reki!

160
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,458
Let go!

161
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,666
Reki can't hear you anymore.

162
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,250
Why not?

163
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:34,625
Reki!

164
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,041
Reki!

165
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,750
Reki has chosen to vanish here.

166
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,291
No!

167
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,708
Reki asked me to
help save her from this!

168
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,541
Reki!

169
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,708
Reki!

170
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,250
Just call my name!

171
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,791
Please say that you need me!

172
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,291
Rakka.

173
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,000
Please help me.

174
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,416
Reki!!

175
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,083
Rakka...

176
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,375
Rakka!

177
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,125
Rakka!

178
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,333
Reki...

179
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,583
You're alright.

180
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,083
Rakka...

181
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,625
Thank you.

182
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,583
Does this mean...

183
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,000
that I'm finally forgiven?

184
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,750
Strange.

185
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,958
I saw this break.

186
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,416
Look at the name!

187
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,458
If a bird brings you
your salvation,

188
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:21,791
the name Reki will disappear,
and the Reki that is stone

189
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,708
will become your true name.

190
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:28,791
Believing this will come
to pass, I now introduce

191
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:33,000
a new story of
the Reki that is stone.

192
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,291
You think that will
see each other again?

193
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,291
Yeah.

194
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,125
Yeah I think we will.

195
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,833
I believe we will, too.

196
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,541
Close your eyes.

197
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,708
It's the custom for the Haibane
to disappear without notice

198
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,291
when the Day of Flight comes.

199
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,666
Reki will be Reki,
to the very end right?

200
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:14,041
She freed herself from her curse
by walking a difficult path,

201
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,166
and by being kind to the weak.

202
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,416
At first, this was
merely pretense in order

203
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,500
to attain salvation, and yet
in time it became her nature.

204
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,750
There is an ancient
staircase that serves as

205
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:32,958
a stepping stone for the Haibane
when they take the Flight.

206
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:38,625
"Reki" is that stepping stone;
the one who guides the weak.

207
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,083
So she's gone then?

208
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,958
I'm glad.

209
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,208
Reki!

210
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:56,375
You know, I'll miss her,
but it was for the best, right?

211
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:00,000
Yes, she received the blessing.

212
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,083
The western sky
is quite something.

213
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,541
Don't you want to come see?

214
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:13,000
No thanks, Besides I
already got her reply.

215
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,500
If you say so.

216
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,750
Want some cake?

217
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,250
Nah, it's sweet, right?

218
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,958
It's lemon soufflé.

219
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,083
Reki made it.

220
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,125
I already said no.

221
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,500
You can be so stupid!

222
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,416
What color is a lemon?

223
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:43,500
That evening, all of us
went into the Woods together.

224
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,833
Apparently, everyone knew
it was going to happen,

225
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:50,125
so all of us were able
to say good-bye with a smile.

226
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,375
After praying in the chapel,
we returned to Old Home

227
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,541
and had dinner at the table,

228
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,791
which we set
with one empty chair.

229
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:02,166
Reki left many
paintings behind for us.

230
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,125
I was relieved to know that,
aside from paintings of

231
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,750
her dark dream, she was
able to produce many bright

232
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,166
and beautiful works.

233
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,125
Those paintings told me
how much Reki truly loved

234
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:17,291
this town and Old Home.

235
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:21,000
And that she truly cared for
everyone she knew

236
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,833
and lived with.

237
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,250
Soon, winter will
come to an end.

238
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,833
Will a new cocoon
be found when spring comes?

239
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:39,166
Then will it be my turn to be
the reliable senior Haibane?

240
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,500
Twins!

241
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,833
Oh, This is big!

242
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,083
This is big!

243
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,875
Oh, This is big!

244
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,333
Reki, I will never forget you.
