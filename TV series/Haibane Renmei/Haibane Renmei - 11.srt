1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,208
As the winter progressed,
many things changed in the world

2
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:39,333
that I was now living in.

3
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,291
Kuu's day of flight,
the Sin-Bound illness

4
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,916
I suffered from,
the death of the bird...

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,750
I recovered my cocoon dream and
found a job with Haibane Renmei.

6
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,500
But Reki is still under
the Sin-Bound curse and

7
00:00:55,583 --> 00:01:00,750
is struggling to find the
dream that she cannot recall.

8
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:07,791
Sleep over?

9
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:08,958
He's so Lucky!

10
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,166
I wanna go, too!

11
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,666
Next year, Shorta.

12
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,083
Why does only Dai get to go?

13
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,833
No fair!

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,000
Dai!

15
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,458
You take care.

16
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,875
Of course!

17
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,625
I like the smell of the river.

18
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,958
For some reason,
it seems so familiar.

19
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,208
Yeah?

20
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,333
You are too hot?

21
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,791
Reki made me wear this.

22
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:28,333
She said I had
to wear I catch a cold.

23
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,791
So, are you going to miss her
much while you're away?

24
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,125
Why should I miss her?

25
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,041
I'm only gonna be gone
for half a month.

26
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,041
But you know...

27
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,041
I wonder if
something's wrong with her.

28
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,500
She's a lot quieter lately,
and spaced out.

29
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,583
Maybe that's because
she already misses you.

30
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,458
She makes me feel kind of
weird acting like that.

31
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,958
It's not gonna going
away forever, you know.

32
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,750
Yeah, that's very true.

33
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,916
Over here!

34
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,250
Maybe nobody's home.

35
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,583
Did I scare you?

36
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:57,333
Wha...

37
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,083
what was that for?

38
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,666
Those are valuable.

39
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,833
You shouldn't be wasting them,

40
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,166
or we'll run out
before the festival.

41
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,291
I was just saying hello
to the visitors down there.

42
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,291
It's that funny-hair chick.

43
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,041
Wow, thanks a lot.

44
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,333
Hey, you didn't
have to do that.

45
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,125
Did you make these by yourself?

46
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,208
Na-nah, Hikari did.

47
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,166
You know her?

48
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,333
Oh, I know her.

49
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,166
The girl who works
at the bakery, right?

50
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,083
Hey, what's your name?

51
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,250
I'm Rakka.

52
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,750
Try it.

53
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,541
Hey now, don't let
the kid get hurt!

54
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,208
Don't worry!

55
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,375
Man, he's such a child.

56
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,250
Well at least that makes him
a good playmate for the kid.

57
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you still angry?

58
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,250
At Hyohko, I mean.

59
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,000
No, not at all.

60
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,500
Well that's good.

61
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:17,791
Anyway, I just wanted to say
thank you for taking in Dai.

62
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,208
Actually, We should be
thanking you for taking care

63
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,416
of our kids all this time.

64
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,708
We should be
visiting the Old Home

65
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,958
to thank you guys
in person, you know.

66
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,333
But we've all grown so far apart
from each other because of

67
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,583
that trouble that happened
between some of us.

68
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,708
I guess there's just never
been a chance to break the ice.

69
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,541
What trouble?

70
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,458
Oh, right.

71
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,250
I forgot you're still new here.

72
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,875
Well, let's just say
there's a lot of history.

73
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,291
Right, Midori?

74
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,166
I wouldn't know!

75
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,000
Aw, she can be so pigheaded.

76
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,250
Hey, wait up!

77
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:00,791
I forgot.

78
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,541
Could you give this
back to Reki?

79
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,750
She let me borrow it.

80
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,500
O-Okay.

81
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,666
She is always such a
little do-gooder, isn't she?

82
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,541
So, tell me, what do
you know about us?

83
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:30,458
All I saw, I saw you guys and
Reki arguing over here before.

84
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,333
What else?

85
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:36,208
And also I heard that Reki
and Hyohko of Abandoned Factory,

86
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,125
tried to...

87
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,333
Run away together, right?

88
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,000
Give me a break.

89
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,458
Isn't it true?

90
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,166
Reki and Hyohko
were kind of together,

91
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,250
but Hyohko was a victim
of Reki's selfishness.

92
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,750
You know he almost died
because of her.

93
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:00,875
Reki...

94
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,458
Reki wouldn't do
such horrible things.

95
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:12,166
You know nothing about
what Reki's capable of doing.

96
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,916
Nothing.

97
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,750
Reki would never hurt anyone.

98
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,416
Reki has always been kind.

99
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,208
She is always
considerate of the others,

100
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,875
even when she's
suffering inside.

101
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:41,458
Although I didn't realize it
at the time, but when Kuu left

102
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:47,291
on her day of flight, when
I first became Sin-Bound,

103
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,916
it was Reki who
was suffering more.

104
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,291
And yet I was
always leaning on her.

105
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,375
Oh no the raft!

106
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,750
W-Wait!

107
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,583
What is that?

108
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,416
Wow...

109
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,916
These letters...

110
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,416
Are you finished?

111
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,916
Reki has come to get you.

112
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,333
She seems concerned.

113
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:52,000
Reki has been acting
a little nervous lately.

114
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,791
The fact that her Day
of Flight has not arrived

115
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,041
is weighing heavily on her mind.

116
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:02,875
And yet, she silently hopes
that it will never come.

117
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,125
I know...

118
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,625
It hurts me a lot to see
her suffering like this.

119
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,208
But, I still don't
want her to go away.

120
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,958
She is still lost in the dark.

121
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:18,250
Rakka, you had the bird come
to you, enabling you to fill in

122
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,291
the missing pieces
of your memories.

123
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,416
However, Reki has no one.

124
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,750
She must face the
darkness on her own.

125
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,583
It is a trying ordeal.

126
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,958
Reki keeps painting the scenes
from her dream in the cocoon.

127
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:40,083
I saw her paintings once but
I couldn't tell what they were.

128
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,833
I don't think
Reki knows, either.

129
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,750
There is not much time
left for Reki.

130
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:02,333
I know not how or when,
but by the end of this winter,

131
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,916
her journey will have
come to a conclusion.

132
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,291
If Reki is still
in darkness by that point,

133
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,041
she will be bound
to this place forever.

134
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,333
Is it possible for
a Haibane to remain here?

135
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:19,083
It is quite rare,
but some do remain.

136
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,875
However, they are
no longer called Haibane.

137
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,583
They lose their wings and
halos, and must live far away

138
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:30,583
from both humans and
Haibane, and with time,

139
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,208
they will grow old and die.

140
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:38,375
It is a quiet and peaceful,
but lonely life.

141
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,500
I, or rather, the Haibane
Renmei wishes for all Haibane

142
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,541
to take flight without problem.

143
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,000
But as it is, Reki refuses me.

144
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,875
Everything I say
makes Reki close her mind.

145
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,458
I want to help her.

146
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,583
She was suffering
inside all this time,

147
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,958
but she hid
her pain and helped me.

148
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:05,750
So this time no matter
what I have to help her.

149
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:10,333
In order to save Reki,
it will mean parting with her.

150
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,916
If she leaves here,

151
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,833
I think it's very likely that
you will never see her again.

152
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:20,083
Are you prepared
to pay that price?

153
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,750
Thanks for meeting me.

154
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,250
I had to pick up
some paints anyway.

155
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,583
With snow like this, I won't
be able to ride this thing

156
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,416
for the rest of the winter.

157
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
So how's your work?

158
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,291
Is it going well?

159
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,125
I't's okay.

160
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,916
Are you painting again?

161
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,416
No, I'm just...

162
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,333
I'm just smearing a few
paints around in studio.

163
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,291
Oh, yeah.

164
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,958
This is for you.

165
00:14:59,041 --> 00:14:59,916
From Midori?

166
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,333
Ah-huh.

167
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,166
Is she a friend of yours?

168
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,416
She was, once.

169
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,291
Did she say anything
mean to you?

170
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,125
No, she didn't.

171
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,583
Don't worry about her.

172
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:18,375
She says nasty things, but
deep down she's a good kid.

173
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,333
It's been five years already.

174
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,333
Oh well, the truth is
both of us are so stubborn,

175
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,958
we could never go back
to being friends.

176
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:31,458
Reki!

177
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,666
I'll do my best!

178
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,708
Yeah, good luck.

179
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:39,000
Your job does sound like
a bit of a drag, but remember,

180
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,916
you're not a full-fledged
Haibane unless you work.

181
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,916
Thanks for breakfast.

182
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,833
Damn, you're so lucky Rakka.

183
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,500
Your work starts
in the afternoon.

184
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,083
You shouldn't complain so much.

185
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,541
By the way, I'm very glad
you finally found a job.

186
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,791
What's the matter?

187
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,000
I have a cold.

188
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:10,583
What?

189
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,875
Don't spread it!

190
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,625
You're all heart.

191
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,625
Hey, where's Reki?

192
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,208
She said that she needs to paint
today, so I'm going to take over

193
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,541
her job of cooking
for the young feathers.

194
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,583
She's been doing
that a lot lately.

195
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,375
I wonder what's going on.

196
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,541
I was hoping she'd take
the scooter to the library

197
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,708
and tell them
I'm taking a day off.

198
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,958
Why don't you ask Kana?

199
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, no!

200
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,916
That's gonna make me
late for work.

201
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,541
Only ten minutes late.

202
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,500
That's OK, right
Actually for Master,

203
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,083
ten minutes is not OK

204
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,541
I have some time. I'll go.

205
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,583
You will?

206
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,583
Thanks.

207
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,666
Sure.

208
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,750
It's no problem.

209
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,250
Kana will give me a ride.

210
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,375
Right?

211
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,500
Thanks!

212
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:12,875
She is?

213
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,041
Oh.

214
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,291
I guess it did get
cold all of a sudden.

215
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,375
Well, thank you
for letting us know.

216
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,458
What's this...

217
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,458
Oh, Hey Rakka!

218
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,458
Why are you here?

219
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,958
Hi Sumika.

220
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,125
Wow.

221
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,583
It's almost my due date.

222
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,458
Is it still okay
for you to be out?

223
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,958
Of course.

224
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,625
I'd feel suffocated if I had
to shut myself in the house.

225
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,125
Besides, we have to
get ready for the festival,

226
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,500
and I still enjoy taking walks.

227
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,125
It's so mysterious, isn't it?

228
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,666
Yes, it is.

229
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,833
Sometimes I find
myself wondering.

230
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,666
Where this life came from.

231
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,125
By the way, where's Nemu?

232
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,625
Oh, she has a cold
and won't be in today.

233
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,458
I came by to tell them that.

234
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,125
Oh that's too bad.

235
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,083
Wow, its one of
the petrified books.

236
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,666
Petrified books?

237
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,458
Nobody knows what they really
are, but the story goes that

238
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,666
there was a ruin deep in the
Western Woods a long time ago,

239
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,583
and this was found
buried in the stones.

240
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,291
It looks like it was
turned to stone

241
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,208
by some sort of magical force?

242
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,791
So, what is the book about?

243
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't really know.

244
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,708
See all these
weird pattern things

245
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,833
that have been engraved on it?

246
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,500
Some say those are letters and
another says ancient drawings.

247
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,708
Like kind of look
like someone's hands.

248
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,125
Almost got it, one more time.

249
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,875
Rek--

250
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,750
You know nothing about what
Reki's capable of doing.

251
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,625
Reki!

252
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,541
Nemu?

253
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,875
That's very unusual.

254
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,541
You know, I should've
bought some canned peaches

255
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,750
or something else for her.

256
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,583
Oh, I didn't know
peaches were good for colds.

257
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,916
You're kidding, right.

258
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,833
Wow.

259
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,333
You've never used Peaches?

260
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,083
Well, don't worry.

261
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,208
I was just joking that they
would make a good get well gift.

262
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,458
Oh, really?

263
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,666
We walk with empty smiles
plastered on our faces.

264
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,291
Reki is always kind.

265
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,416
She doesn't want to worry
anyone, and she doesn't want

266
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,250
to lean on anyone,
so she smiles.

267
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,000
Why didn't I
realize that sooner?

268
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,375
I was always
right next to her.

269
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,958
Why couldn't I see it?

270
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,000
I wish tomorrow
would never come.

271
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,916
What, that was sudden?

272
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,250
I wish the day
after today was today.

273
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,625
And the next day,
and the next day, too.

274
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,000
I wish it was always today.

275
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:37,125
Then I'd be able
to be with you, forever.

276
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,166
There is no such thing
as forever.

277
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,208
Sooner or later,
everything ends.

278
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,041
Just like it should.

279
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:05,000
Because now is only meant
to be now, and this moment is...

280
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,500
so precious.

281
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:10,666
Yeah, that makes sense.

282
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,458
Guess you're right.

283
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,500
Off to work, huh?

284
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,500
Good luck.

285
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,750
You, too.

286
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,000
Don't cry!

287
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,958
I'm the one who will help Reki!

288
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,333
Smile...

289
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,375
Rakka...

290
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,666
Smile...

291
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:21,375
Nemu, thanks for everything
over these years.

292
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,583
If you see Kuramori someday,

293
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:27,125
tell her that I'm sorry
and that I said thanks.

294
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,708
I don't think I'm ever gonna
make it to whatever world

295
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,250
she's in.

296
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,791
Reki...

297
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,625
Now, it's time
for me to end it.
