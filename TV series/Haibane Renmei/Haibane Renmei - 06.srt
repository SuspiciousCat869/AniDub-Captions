1
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,875
This one's no good, either.

2
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,375
This is hopeless.

3
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,416
The north wing
is entirely uninhabitable.

4
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,333
Reki's room is here, and Hikari
and Nemu are in the east wing,

5
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,583
I think.

6
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,250
Kuu!

7
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,500
Good morning!

8
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,375
Hey!

9
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,875
What are you doing over there?

10
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,333
I was going to ask the same
of you since it's so early.

11
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,458
I'm so glad, it's a perfect
size for you, Rakka.

12
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,416
Are you sure?

13
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,458
You don't want to keep it?

14
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:07,083
It's way too big for me,
and winter will be coming soon.

15
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,416
Winter?

16
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,958
But it's been so warm
until just a few days ago.

17
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,458
Winter seems to
come here very suddenly.

18
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,500
That's why everybody gets
a cold in their first year.

19
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,541
So you should be careful Rakka.

20
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,708
Sure, thanks for the help.

21
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,750
You can tell when it's coming.

22
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:28,333
Just take a deep breath, if
you feel a sting in your nose,

23
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,916
that's the beginning of winter.

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,250
Oh.

25
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,791
You are so full
of knowledge, Kuu.

26
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,875
So, what's this?

27
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:35,791
Huh?

28
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,833
I thought it might be about
time for me to find a new room.

29
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,250
What?

30
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,625
This is a room for everybody.

31
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,666
It's so comfortable in here,

32
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,500
that I might grow lazy
if I stay any longer.

33
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,791
How grown-up!

34
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,166
You're now a
full-fledged Haibane.

35
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,625
Thanks to the help
of a good senior.

36
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,958
Found a good room yet?

37
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,583
Ahh, no.

38
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,875
They are all pretty much
just full of dust,

39
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,250
So every room that I see,

40
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,458
I can't tell if
they're good or not.

41
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,791
I gotta go now!

42
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,125
Huh?

43
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,125
But it's almost time
for breakfast.

44
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,833
Yeah, but I've got a lot
of things to do today.

45
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,666
Kuu...?

46
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,958
She did?

47
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,166
What's with her,
I specially made hotcakes

48
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,708
just because Kuu
said she wanted some.

49
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,625
Well, she said
she had something to do.

50
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,333
May be I Should wait
to make them for her?

51
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,500
Let's just make them now.

52
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,666
I'm sure she'll be back
when she smells them.

53
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,291
I guess you're right.

54
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,708
Hey you guys!

55
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,791
I did it!

56
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:04,750
That's great!

57
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,750
She really did fix it.

58
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,916
I guess now someone here
can wake up on time.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,375
We have to celebrate.

60
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,458
Good idea!

61
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,333
Yahoo!

62
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,375
Hey!

63
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,791
Come on over here!

64
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,000
Everybody wants to congratulate
you on your achievement!

65
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,500
Hey!

66
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,375
The triumphant hero returns!

67
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,458
Huh?

68
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,916
Now what's with
all the long faces?!

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,125
Aren't you excited
and thrilled?!

70
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,291
Uhm...

71
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,416
well it's, we're just
wondering how long

72
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,208
it's going to keep ringing.

73
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,541
Huh?

74
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,250
Oh, the ringing will stop
if I kill the breaker,

75
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,958
but then the clock
will die as well.

76
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:46,625
What?

77
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,125
Then it's useless.

78
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,375
You idiot!

79
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,958
Go kill it now!

80
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,500
What?!

81
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,833
You just told me to come and
now you're telling me to go?!

82
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,166
It'll do a great job

83
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,083
waking you up with bells
ringing so loud and long.

84
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,625
We'll never sleep!

85
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,500
Yeah, yeah!

86
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,958
Man, it was just a test.

87
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,500
Just a test.

88
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,500
I was still gonna
work some more on it.

89
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,000
She just had
to do this on a Sunday.

90
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,375
I'm tired.

91
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,875
Uh, why don't I go help her.

92
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,333
Wait a sec.

93
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,625
It stopped.

94
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,666
Oh well, that's it.

95
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,458
Sorry about this.

96
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,791
For what?

97
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,541
It would've been a failure
if the bell hadn't rung,

98
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:44,458
but it rang too much,
so I call it a great success.

99
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,541
Anyway, thanks
for coming up, Rakka.

100
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,458
But there's nothing
I really need help with.

101
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,125
And I don't want you
to get your clothes dirty.

102
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,708
That's Kuu's, isn't it?

103
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,208
Oh.

104
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,541
If she gave it to you,
so she finally gave up, I guess.

105
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,041
What do you mean?

106
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,625
Well, that's the first thing
she got after arriving here.

107
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,666
She always hated being
treated like a kid and wanted

108
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,375
to have clothes that were
the same sizes as ours,

109
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,500
but she could
never fit into them.

110
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,500
Is it OK?

111
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,041
Should I keep it?

112
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,458
She no longer has to pretend
to be what she isn't anymore.

113
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,416
Huh?

114
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,916
Kuu used to want
to copy everything we did.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,333
Really?

116
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,583
She tried to ride Reki's
scooter and ending up crashing

117
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,666
into a utility pole.

118
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,666
She got dizzy
wearing Hikari's glasses

119
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,291
and fell down the stairs.

120
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,416
Kuu's just a little kid getting
into trouble all the time.

121
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,041
But maybe she's
grown up in her own way.

122
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,375
I guess I have to grow up too.

123
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,541
One, two!

124
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:08,833
Hmm?

125
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,916
This is where I am.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And it's over here.

127
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,208
Well, I think this is it.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,583
For some reason...

129
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,541
this room feels familiar.

130
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,458
That's because...

131
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,083
this is the room
where you were born.

132
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,416
I was born...

133
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,583
in here?

134
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,041
The cocoon room.

135
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,041
We found your gigantic cocoon,

136
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,750
exactly where
you're standing right now.

137
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:07,541
Yes, I seem to
remember a little.

138
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,916
I remember...

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,625
something.

140
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,041
I remembered mine a bit too.

141
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,291
It felt right.

142
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,500
So I made it into my room.

143
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,791
How about this one?

144
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:18,958
Do you like it?

145
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,958
Oh yeah, where have you
been all this time?

146
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,375
Reki was very mad because
you asked her to make hotcakes

147
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,458
and then you didn't show up.

148
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,291
I asked her to pack up
a breakfast for me.

149
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,875
And for you, too.

150
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,125
Here.

151
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,541
Oh, thank you.

152
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,166
That's right, I almost forgot
I missed breakfast too.

153
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,750
You know, Reki was very mad.

154
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,500
Inside my mind...

155
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,750
there's a beautiful cup.

156
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,375
A very beautiful, clear cup.

157
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,500
And tiny drops
kept falling into it.

158
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,333
Drip...

159
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,166
drip...

160
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,166
drip.

161
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,791
Slowly but steadily,
every day.

162
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:34,500
And today, I felt that
the cup became completely full.

163
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,041
Kuu...

164
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,875
And that's because,
you gave me some of those drops.

165
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,875
Rakka, thank you.

166
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,875
It's getting stormy.

167
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,666
Seems like we're
gonna have some rain.

168
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,250
Too bad it's on a Sunday.

169
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,291
Yes.

170
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,083
So, are you
moving into a new room?

171
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,916
Kuu told me.

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,708
Reki...

173
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,625
did she say anything else?

174
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,666
Mmm, not really.

175
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,041
Oh yeah, was it you who
cleaned up the kitchen for me?

176
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:04,958
No.

177
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:05,625
No?

178
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,333
Who was it then?

179
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,250
Kuu.

180
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,625
Kuu?

181
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:13,166
Hmm, but I didn't find
any broken plates in there.

182
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,166
I'll go make some tea.

183
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,208
Reki!

184
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,625
What's wrong?

185
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,041
Uhm, it's nothing.

186
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,041
Everybody feels depressed
when the weather's like this.

187
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,416
Or they become obsessed

188
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,291
with the idea that something
bad is going to happen.

189
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,541
I'm not sure.

190
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,000
You can keep this room
for a while longer,

191
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,708
if you're not
ready to move out.

192
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,125
No, it's not that.

193
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:59,166
Listen, why is this town
surrounded by walls?

194
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,208
Why is it?

195
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't know for sure,

196
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,500
it's probably because
this is a protected place.

197
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,916
Protected?

198
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,416
Protected from what?

199
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,375
From everything
that's not good.

200
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,625
Or may be it protects us

201
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,000
from everything we're
not supposed to know.

202
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,333
That's not...

203
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,583
A power failure?

204
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,458
It struck somewhere nearby.

205
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,583
Stay put.

206
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,166
There's a flashlight
somewhere in here.

207
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,750
Rakka, where are you going?

208
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,541
Rakka.

209
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,083
In the Western Woods...

210
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,250
the birds

211
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,208
Mmm, they must've been
surprised as well.

212
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,166
It seems like they were
trying to tell me something.

213
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,833
Why don't you go back
and dry yourself.

214
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,208
You'll catch a cold.

215
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,791
I'll go check on the kids.

216
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,375
Stay in your room.

217
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,791
Oh boy, some were crying,
the others were excited.

218
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,333
It was a big mess.

219
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,500
Hm?

220
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,541
Reki.

221
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,625
Hey, where's Kana and Kuu?

222
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,291
Kana went to check the
generator in the basement.

223
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,291
Kuu is...

224
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,750
Not here.

225
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,708
And she's usually
the first one to come down

226
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,125
when things get like this.

227
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,958
I thought she might
have gone into town, but...

228
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,291
I hope she found some
shelter from the rain.

229
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,583
She must be miserable
if she's on the road.

230
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,833
I'll go look for her.

231
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:29,375
Look for her...

232
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,833
where?

233
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,541
What's up with Rakka?

234
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,958
No idea.

235
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,750
She's been as gloomy as
today's weather, since morning.

236
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,458
I kind of know
just how Rakka feels.

237
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:46,375
If you look at today's sky,
it makes you feel restless.

238
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,708
Yeah, it's nasty weather all
right, but it's always like this

239
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,625
when summer turns into winter.

240
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,500
It's only natural to feel
a little worried when

241
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,333
the seasons start change.

242
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,208
That's right.

243
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,583
That must be it.

244
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,333
I'll go out and look for Rakka.

245
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,083
Tell Kana to stay here
when she gets back.

246
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,500
Things could get way out of hand

247
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,541
if everyone goes off
on their own.

248
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,791
All right.

249
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,666
Oh damn, and I just got dry.

250
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,541
That's it, we should
get the bath ready.

251
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,750
In case Kuu
comes home soaking wet.

252
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,791
Rakka!

253
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,958
Whew, this umbrella is no use.

254
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,541
We better get our raincoats.

255
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,875
Glad I caught you.

256
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,041
If you'd gone out
into this rain,

257
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,500
we would've had
two sick people.

258
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,958
Don't worry, I'm sure she must
have found shelter somewhere.

259
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:42,875
Maybe...

260
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,916
Kuu didn't go into town.

261
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,416
Hm?

262
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,875
This morning, she asked you
to pack her a lunch, right?

263
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,166
Oh, yeah.

264
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,208
And she had a water bottle.

265
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:57,125
To me, it looked like she
was getting ready to go.

266
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,666
To go?

267
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,583
To go where?

268
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,750
Probably...

269
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,000
the Western Woods.

270
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:04,916
It can't be.

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,291
She wouldn't have done that.

272
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,583
The walls are most
powerful in the Western Woods.

273
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,958
Kuu knows how
dangerous it is to go.

274
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:11,958
There's no way...

275
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,958
Kuu's gone to
the Western Woods?

276
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,625
I really wasn't
trying to eavesdrop.

277
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,208
But the generator's fuse blew,

278
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,833
so I was trying to use
the one in the clock tower.

279
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,333
And I heard you say...

280
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,625
Well, we were just
saying she might have.

281
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,291
Because she's late
to come back here.

282
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,208
But what if she
really did go there?

283
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,291
Then that means that...

284
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,291
Kana!

285
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,416
We don't know
anything for sure.

286
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,291
What's that?

287
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,125
What do you mean?

288
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,291
Rakka, I know you've never
been to the Western Woods.

289
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,875
So, what makes you
think she went there?

290
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,666
When the rain got started,

291
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,291
the birds went crazy
in the Western Woods.

292
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,458
As if trying to
tell me something.

293
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,583
That was because of the rain.

294
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:58,291
But then I saw
a light there for a moment.

295
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,708
Like lightning?

296
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,500
Um-Um, it was coming out

297
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,791
of the woods and
heading towards the sky.

298
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,708
You saw it?!

299
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,625
Are you sure?!

300
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,541
You really saw it?!

301
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,958
I think.

302
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,958
But it was quickly
hidden by the clouds.

303
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,708
You're lying!!

304
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,791
Kana?

305
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,583
I refuse to believe
that happened!

306
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,291
It just can't!

307
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,750
I didn't want to believe it
either, But it seems that Kuu

308
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,708
might have really
left all of us.

309
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,083
What?

310
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,333
The time when a Haibane

311
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,458
goes outside the walls
on their Day of flight.

312
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,041
Reki told us to wait here.

313
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,791
What's wrong, Kana?

314
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,333
Kuu's in the Western Woods.

315
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,166
We still might be able
to catch up with her.

316
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,625
What do you mean?

317
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,708
Her Day of Flight has come.

318
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,958
I'm going!

319
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:50,958
You can't.

320
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,500
It's too dangerous
after sunset.

321
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,708
All the more reason why
we can't leave Kuu by herself!

322
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,833
A guiding hand is given to the
Haibane on their Day of flight.

323
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,166
You might know things
we don't, but until I see it,

324
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,541
it's nothing but a myth.

325
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,791
Kana, even if you go,
there's nothing you can do.

326
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,375
I know that!

327
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,458
I...

328
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,000
I just want to see her
one more time.

329
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,416
Just see her face.

330
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,666
Don't you even care

331
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,833
that you never gonna get
to say goodbye to her?!

332
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,166
Reki, is it true about Kuu?

333
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,041
If there's still time,
I want to see her, too.

334
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,666
We all want to see her.

335
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,375
But think, if you go into
those woods without knowing

336
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,791
where you are, you will
never come out again.

337
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,416
We need to have
a point of reference.

338
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,250
What's that?

339
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,083
Kana!

340
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,375
The bell in the clock tower!

341
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,291
What?

342
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,541
Start the bell!

343
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,541
The tower's
generator works, right?

344
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,750
Then you can keep
the bell ringing, can't you?

345
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,916
That's right!

346
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:43,916
Rakka.

347
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,250
Please, Reki.

348
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,416
I know that I'll regret it

349
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,750
forever if I don't
do anything right now.

350
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:53,125
So, bring three more
raincoats, or four more?

351
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,583
All right then.

352
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,291
We all go together.

353
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:01,291
But promise me you will not go
near the walls, no matter what.

354
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,791
The legend goes that
there are an ancient ruins

355
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,333
in the heart of the Woods,
and that a Charcoal Feather

356
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,625
is lead there on
his or her Day of flight.

357
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,000
The day of flight is the
time when the Hibane leaves

358
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,625
the nest to go beyond the wall.

359
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:29,125
There was no way of telling when
that day will come or to whom.

360
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,958
He or she just disappears
one day without warning.

361
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,791
No one knows why
such things happen.

362
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,291
A Charcoal Feather who
is about to leave the nest,

363
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,458
never speaks of it to others.

364
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,916
Besides, we haven't
had any days of flight

365
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,416
for the past few years,
mainly because for a long time

366
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,458
there weren't any
new cocoons appearing.

367
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,500
So nobody has left
the nest for quite a while.

368
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,541
Perhaps we were all forgetting,
or hoping that we could forget,

369
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,625
that there may come a day
when we have to say good-bye

370
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,500
to one of us, like today.

371
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:17,000
Kuu!!

372
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:12,666
You gave me some
of the drops, Rakka.

373
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,875
So, thank you.

374
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,833
Kuu!

375
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:15,208
Everybody, in the end
everybody leaves me.
