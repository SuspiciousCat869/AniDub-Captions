1
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:12,791
Wow, the uninhabited
areas are really scary,

2
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,333
just like a haunted house.

3
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,125
I'm pretty sure this
is the right floor.

4
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,250
That was close.

5
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,250
What's wrong with this ring?

6
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,875
Huh?

7
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,208
Reki?!

8
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,125
Reki?

9
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:13,958
Reki?

10
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,291
Reki!

11
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,833
I'm sorry, but I let myself in
because I heard a loud noise.

12
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,875
I'm sorry for scaring you.
I'm such a restless sleeper

13
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:35,083
and fell off a bed again.
These wings are pretty useless,

14
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,375
aren't they?

15
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,250
I guess that my name
is more suitable for you.

16
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,500
Damn.

17
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,333
Sorry about the mess. 

18
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,625
I used to use this as a studio
before became my bedroom,

19
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,083
but it's gonna be a lot of
work to clear out the junk.

20
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,333
Are you a painter?

21
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,041
Yeah, but I'm not
a real one though.

22
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,000
Can I see?

23
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,708
Sorry, it's not finished.

24
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,333
Besides there's
not much to look at.

25
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,458
Oh,

26
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,875
And the studio is over there?

27
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:08,791
Don't!

28
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,958
Ah

29
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,958
It's really... quite
a big mess in there.

30
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,125
Oh, sorry.

31
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,333
It's OK.

32
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,833
Oh, I forgot, breakfast. You
were the only person missing,

33
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,541
so I came to get you.

34
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,666
I'll eat later.

35
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,375
Okay. I'll be going, then.

36
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,375
I've been called to
the Haibane Renmei Temple.

37
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,291
The Temple? 

38
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,458
By yourself?

39
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,958
No. Hikari says
she'll come along with me.

40
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,750
OK. Well then, you take care.

41
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,125
I will.

42
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,291
The same dream again.

43
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,166
You're worrying too much!

44
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,708
But I came into her room
without knocking or asking.

45
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,708
Maybe she was offended.

46
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:09,541
Reki wouldn't think like that!
The guestroom you're using now

47
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,375
was Reki's to begin with, but
it was turned into a guestroom

48
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,333
because we all
hung out there so much.

49
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,375
So you shouldn't
even worry about it.

50
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,041
I don't know.

51
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,208
Reki's always grouchy
when she wakes up,

52
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,541
and she's a light sleeper.
You know we used to share

53
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,666
a room together and
two of us always fought.

54
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,458
Really?

55
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,666
We are going this way.

56
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,541
What, the Temple isn't in town?

57
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:40,041
Well uh, it's kind of located at
in the far outskirts of town.

58
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,250
Nobody really goes near
there unless they have to

59
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,625
because there's
a graveyard nearby.

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,708
Well, take care.

61
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,750
It's staying up on its own.

62
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,583
What?

63
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,041
Your Halo... 

64
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,875
I was worried before because
it didn't want to stay up.

65
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,833
Oh, yeah. But now
everything is sticking up.

66
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,250
Eh, what is it?

67
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,375
Uh, well, it's nothing,
forget it.

68
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,750
Hikari, why did you want
to be the Halo bearer?

69
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,541
Oh, well, no reason, really. 

70
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,291
Look, you can see it now.

71
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,625
What's wrong?

72
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,291
Ah...

73
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:35,000
Don't worry. It swings a bit,
but it's not scary. See.

74
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,833
See, it's not scary at all. 

75
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,166
Huh?

76
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,875
Hey, you weren't scared?

77
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,708
It's scarier to be
just watching you.

78
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,833
You should be careful.

79
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,625
Ahh...

80
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,208
The Communicator
we saw yesterday?

81
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,666
It's not. Don't speak
unless I say it's OK.

82
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,500
A, ah...

83
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,583
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you.
We are forbidden from speaking

84
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,583
inside the temple.
This is their greeting,

85
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,375
this is how you say "yes".
This is how you say "no."

86
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,166
The Communicator is the
only person who can speak,

87
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,541
so let's go find him first.

88
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,250
Mmm...

89
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,541
Haibane.

90
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,416
What business have you here?

91
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,291
Shhhh.

92
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,458
One Haibane came
to return the halo mold.

93
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:40,625
The other is the newborn
I summoned. Is this correct?

94
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,958
Proceed into the garden.

95
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,625
Newborn, what is your name?

96
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,791
Your name is Rakka, is it not?

97
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,208
You should endeavor to make your
wings a properly working part

98
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:23,458
of your body. Feather Rakka, you
are hereby accepted as a member

99
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,708
of the Charcoal
Feather Federation.

100
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,083
This will serve you as proof.

101
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,000
It guarantees your daily life.
In return for what it provides,

102
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,458
you are to work
in this town. For yourself,

103
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,333
for your dwelling place,
and as an example to

104
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:45,208
the Young Feathers,
you must become a good Haibane.

105
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:50,000
We are here if you need us. Come
here when you are in trouble.

106
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,791
Is there anything else?

107
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,083
Whew, that was tense,
don't you think?

108
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:13,166
You were mean. Why don't
you warn me in advance,

109
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,750
I could have been prepared.

110
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:18,625
I'm sorry. An honest mistake.
But, because you had responded

111
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,625
well under pressure,
you can now move your wings.

112
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,333
But still.

113
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, there's Kuu.

114
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,500
Kuu!

115
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,291
Huh?

116
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,625
I saw Kuu just now.

117
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,583
By the windmill over there.

118
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,833
That strange.
Maybe she didn't hear me.

119
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,708
That's probably it.
I heard those windmills

120
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,125
are electric generators. The
Hill of Winds is the nice place

121
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,958
to be on sunny days, but
those mills are very noisy.

122
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,583
Oh, really?

123
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,041
I have to go to work now
at the bakery in town.

124
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,708
What about you, Rakka?

125
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:58,791
Hmm. I think I'll go back
to Old Home for now.

126
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,208
I better see Reki.

127
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,791
You worry too much.

128
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:03,958
But I...

129
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,541
Well. See you
in the evening, then.

130
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,500
Okay, thank you.

131
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,083
Come back!

132
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,291
You kids haven't
finished your lunch!

133
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,041
Reki.

134
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,791
Oh, back already. So,
are you all finished?

135
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,583
Uhm...

136
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,791
Hmm?

137
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:43,041
I was worried that Hikari
might mess things up again.

138
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,500
I'm glad to hear that
I was worrying for nothing.

139
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,833
Did you see the Communicator?

140
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,541
Yes. I got scolded since
I couldn't move my wings.

141
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,083
Oh, you shouldn't worry about
it. That old man doesn't know

142
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,083
any other way
to kill time besides

143
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,833
giving lectures to everybody.

144
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,166
Reki, you know...

145
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,500
Hmm?

146
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,958
Oh, never mind.

147
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,000
Do you cook all the time
for the little ones?

148
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,875
Yeah, sometimes we get take-out.
Other times the old housemother

149
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,166
and I cook. Nemu and Hikari
drop in to help us when

150
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,000
they have time to spare.
Sometimes not.

151
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,583
Must be hard work.

152
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,958
Supposed to be my job. But
the little brats have no regard

153
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,791
for the trouble we go through.
Some of them ran away

154
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,041
because the old housemother
decided to serve carrots

155
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,708
with their omelets.

156
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,166
Why don't you let me help.

157
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,500
A Haibane is
supposed to work, right?

158
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,666
All right, if you want.

159
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,666
The places that Haibane
can work are very limited.

160
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,000
So, I think you should go
visit the places each of us

161
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,541
work and then pick the one
that suits you best.

162
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,208
You're late!
Where are the brats?!

163
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,458
Got away. I'll give them
a good talking-to.

164
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,833
You still at it? Why don't
you want to eat the carrots?

165
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,500
Because they're bitter.

166
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,458
Bitter!

167
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:21,166
Damn, now they're good
buddies at a time like this.

168
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,333
At a time like this,
the teacher must set for them

169
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,916
a good example!

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,916
You do it.

171
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,833
Eh? Eh? Eh?

172
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,666
Today, our special guest
teacher, Rakka will show how

173
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,541
to eat carrots.
So everybody watch carefully.

174
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:43,083
I just have to eat this, right?

175
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,750
Right, just act like
you're enjoying them.

176
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,958
Reki, go eat them yourself?

177
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,750
Come on, it's your
first job. Work hard.

178
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,833
Uh...

179
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,750
Eat with a smile.

180
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,541
Mmm. Yummy, yummy.

181
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,750
Amazing.

182
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,916
See, the Older Feathers
are really terrific!

183
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,708
OK then, now it's
your turn to eat them.

184
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,041
Come on, you won't
grow big and strong

185
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,583
unless you eat them up.

186
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,041
So what!

187
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,416
If you are a bad girl and
don't finish your carrots,

188
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,625
a huge scary carrot
monster will come to get you

189
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,166
in the middle of the night.

190
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,125
She smells just like cake!

191
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,416
Quit it, don't lie
to avoid eating.

192
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,125
I'm not lying.

193
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,416
Let me see. 

194
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,458
No she doesn't.

195
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,833
Yes she does! I can smell it! 

196
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,750
Yeah, just like pancakes.

197
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,708
I want some pancakes!

198
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,958
Pancakes, pancakes!

199
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,000
Uh Hem.

200
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,416
Ah, only those who have
cleared their lunch plates

201
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,416
will get pancakes for a snack.

202
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,375
Then why did we go through
all that trouble for?

203
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,583
You hold the carrot
with a stick.

204
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,833
Don't forget to
get me some, too.

205
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,208
So this whole thing
is because you

206
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,958
just wanted some pancakes?

207
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,041
Um, I'll go get them.

208
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,125
You sure?

209
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,458
I can get them
at Hikari's bakery.

210
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,666
I wanted to visit there anyway.

211
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,583
Oh. So you're the
carrot-haters, aren't you?

212
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,000
What? Who told you
that we hate carrots?

213
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,166
Unless you go back to
the classroom and apologize

214
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,208
to Teacher Reki and your
housemother, there will be

215
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,000
no snacks for any of you.

216
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,250
What kind of snacks?

217
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,541
Pancakes!

218
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,500
The sweet kind?

219
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,708
Ah-ha.

220
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,916
--What! Let's go back!
--I want pancakes!

221
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,125
Hey, Rakka!

222
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,041
Hmm? Oh, Kuu.

223
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,416
Where are you going?

224
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,458
A little trip to the bakery.
Oh that's right. Kuu,

225
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,625
do you know how to get to the
bakery where Hikari works at?

226
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,000
What, you don't know it? 

227
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,250
Then, why don't
I take you over there.

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,791
You were walking on the
Hill of Winds this morning,

229
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:18,458
right?

230
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,958
Huh? Oh, yeah. 

231
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,541
I went to town
to pick up this hat.

232
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,375
Wow. It looks nice.

233
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,708
Fasten your seat-belts! 

234
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,333
The Junk Bicycle express
is about to take off!

235
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,541
Wouldn't it be nice
if we can really fly?

236
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,625
We can.

237
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,041
What?

238
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,208
If you really believe it,
then you can fly someday.

239
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,166
I really believe it's true.

240
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,750
Maybe you're right.

241
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,125
Kuu, are you sure
this is the right way?

242
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,791
Of course!

243
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,458
I helped clean that café
the other day and the owner

244
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,500
gave me some sugar cubes.

245
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,125
You are working, too? 

246
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,083
That's great.

247
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,041
Because you're the
newest Charcoal Feather,

248
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,916
I've now become your senior.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,750
But, I'm still the smallest
among the Older Feathers.

250
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,875
Rakka, I wanted to let you know,
and please don't get mad

251
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,958
about this, but I was first
hoping you would be like

252
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,541
a little sister. After
I thought about it for a while,

253
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,666
I realized you'd be put into
the Young Feathers' group

254
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,250
if you were any smaller than me.
So, what I'm trying to say is

255
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,541
I'm glad you're bigger
than me. That way we can still

256
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,083
be together.

257
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,125
That's a great way to think.
I'm glad that I have a senior

258
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,041
like you to guide me, Kuu.

259
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,208
Hurry up, Rakka. Let's go!

260
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,375
Hey, get out here!
How many times do I have to

261
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,958
tell you birds to leave?

262
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,750
Kana hates the crows and she
always calls them scavengers.

263
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,375
But I don't think it's true.
I think the crows really

264
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,875
just wanna be our friends.

265
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,250
Huh?

266
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,875
What we think is trash,
the crows think of as food.

267
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,166
I think they just want
to be friends with us.

268
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,875
They're asking for us
to leave them our trash.

269
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,416
I became friends with
the café owner because

270
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,875
I'm a Charcoal Feather
and I can talk to him.

271
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,791
That's why he gave me some
sugar cubes. But the crows

272
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,375
are pitch-black and
scary-looking and they can

273
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:33,083
only say caw-caw. So people
won't give them food and Kana

274
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:37,833
chases them with a broomstick.
It doesn't seem fair.

275
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,375
I just wish we could
talk with the crows.

276
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,458
You know, the bakery
where Hikari works at

277
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,958
is the only bakery in the
town of Guri where any of

278
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,125
the Haibane can work.

279
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,208
Oh, then it must be
a special store

280
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,291
with a very good reputation.

281
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,916
Nah-ah. It only means that
it's the oldest bakery in town.

282
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,125
Oh.

283
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,041
Are you friends of Hikari's? 

284
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,625
She's working inside
the back kitchen.

285
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,250
You just have to go that way.

286
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,416
Oh, thank you.

287
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,541
Croissants ready!

288
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,416
Yes!

289
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,375
Bacon rolls ready!

290
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,250
Yes.

291
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,750
Butter rolls ready!

292
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,416
Yes!

293
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,458
This is great!

294
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,666
We better not disturb Hikari.

295
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,500
Oh, you must be
friends of Hikari's?

296
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,625
Ah, yes.

297
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,250
Hey, your friends are here.

298
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,083
Oh, hi.

299
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,583
We came to buy some snacks. 

300
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,083
Little treats for the kids.

301
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,750
Really? Then you can
pick whatever you like.

302
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,208
Wow

303
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,041
It must be hard work.

304
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,875
I don't do much. They
start working at three o'clock

305
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,333
in the morning. And they're
standing on their feet all day.

306
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,916
I only tend the register
and do little things like this.

307
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,083
Now, now, you don't have to act
so modest Hikari. Look at this.

308
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,125
She came up with the idea
for these all by yourself.

309
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,416
Try one. Be careful.
They're hot.

310
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,375
Thank you so much.

311
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,875
Hikari, this is great!

312
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,791
She brought in an interesting
frying-pan the other day,

313
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,791
so we experimented with it.

314
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,375
Hikari? No, you didn't!

315
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,583
You caught me.

316
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,083
So that's why you wanted
to volunteer so much

317
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,750
to be the Ring bearer.

318
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,208
That's a smart idea!

319
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,041
Hikari!

320
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,458
But you see.

321
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,500
I just couldn't help trying it
when I saw that mold.

322
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,166
How could you even think
of doing something like that?

323
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,458
I washed it clean.

324
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,833
That's beside the point!

325
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,000
Some of them like it
if I made them carrot cakes?!

326
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,500
You can't eat
carrots either, can you?

327
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,458
I can eat carrots just fine
if I close my eyes!

328
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,791
That doesn't count
as eating them!

329
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,583
Honestly, you grew taller
but haven't matured

330
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,458
a bit on the inside.

331
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:12,000
Damn, so today's carrot lesson
was really aimed towards me.

332
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,291
It wasn't for the kids?

333
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,833
Well, I guess you've grown up
enough to know not to run away.

334
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,375
Give me a break.

335
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,083
And when we sell them at
the store, we put two pieces

336
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,250
on top of each other
and then put strawberries

337
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,541
and whip cream in the center.

338
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,166
Let's just eat them. Hurry up.

339
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,750
Hmm. Sounds good.

340
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,875
Hey, Rakka! They'll be
all gone if you don't hurry!

341
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,541
I'm so tired.

342
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,333
Rakka, I'm really sorry.

343
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,166
It's alright, forget it.
