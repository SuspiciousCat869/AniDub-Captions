1
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,208
Mmm... There.

2
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:32,333
Feeling this pain must mean they
really are a part of my body,

3
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,208
I guess.

4
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:37,250
Reki, play with us!

5
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,875
How many times that I told you
kids not to come into this room

6
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,625
with muddy shoes on!

7
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:46,000
Reki, why aren't you
coming to class with us?!

8
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,916
I told you before
I won't be there because

9
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,958
I have to take care
of the new girl.

10
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,041
Oh, you have a scrape on
your arm. Did you fight?

11
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,000
Uh-uh, I just fell down!

12
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,291
I'm gonna catch you.

13
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,833
I'm gonna get you.
Better watch out!

14
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,500
Are you dressed?
Does it fit?

15
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:08,375
Ah, yes. I think it's ok.

16
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,541
Glad to hear that. Otherwise,
you wouldn't be able to get you

17
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,583
to go outside. Let's go
out onto the balcony.

18
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,291
It's such a nice day.

19
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,125
Hey wait up!

20
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,625
Hey, Rakka, why don't you sit
out here and let your wings

21
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,125
dry in the sun for a while.

22
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,666
They're still little damp.

23
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,791
I don't know this town at all.
Even though I can't remember

24
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:10,000
where I used to live before,
I can somehow tell in my heart

25
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,458
that I've never
been to this town.

26
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:18,041
Hi there. Are you the new
person from that big cocoon?

27
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,583
Hey, can you do this? Watch?

28
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,875
Well, I...

29
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,708
Huh, what's wrong?

30
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,708
OK.

31
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,375
One, two,

32
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,166
Hana! Don't teach her
that silly stuff!

33
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,375
You gonna hurt your wings
if you use them too much.

34
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,500
You should be careful.
You still have scabs.

35
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,666
You see.

36
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,125
Oh, I'm sorry.
They do that on their own

37
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,833
when I try to move my arms.

38
00:04:55,833 --> 00:05:00,416
Ah, I see. Don't worry.
You'll soon get used to it.

39
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,291
Uh.. OK.

40
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:07,083
Hey, she's got a halo holder.
It's a halo holder!

41
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,833
Hah? Holder?

42
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,708
Can I take a look at your back?

43
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,791
Uh, yeah sure.

44
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,291
Wow, that must've hurt.

45
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,541
So, did you cry?

46
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,791
I didn't cry.

47
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:18,958
That's a lie.

48
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,541
How do you know it's a lie!

49
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,708
Because it is!

50
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,333
Hey guys, cut it out!

51
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,541
Hey! I'll practice with you.

52
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,375
Hold your hands out
in front of you.

53
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,458
Like this?

54
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:34,125
Follow me, in-out,
in-out, in-out,

55
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,375
in-out, in-out, in-out.

56
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:41,375
Reki! Good morning!

57
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,250
We picked up some breakfast!

58
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,333
Oh, thank you.

59
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,708
You look well,
Rakka. I'm so glad.

60
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,208
Yeah, me too. How's the fever?

61
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:57,125
Well, it was all gone when
I woke up this morning.

62
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,458
Honestly, what makes
everybody think my room

63
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,166
is their hang-out?

64
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,750
Well, it's comfortable
here for some reason.

65
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,750
You always come in without
asking, as if it was

66
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,666
your own room, and that's why
the kids are doing the same.

67
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,208
The truth is Reki just moved
herself into the guestroom.

68
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,625
Excuse me! It was my room
from the very beginning!

69
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,916
Honestly, I shouldn't have
picked up such a big table.

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,458
Which room are you
going to move into?

71
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,375
The end room on the floor above.

72
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,791
But there's a vacant room
right next door.

73
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,291
I've been using the room
upstairs as my studio,

74
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,625
and I have a feeling I won't be
sleeping quietly on this floor.

75
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,250
But you're the noisiest person

76
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,041
whenever you get out of bed.

77
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,458
I don't believe
I'm hearing that from

78
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,875
someone who never
even wants to wake up.

79
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,458
Yeah, Nemu's snoozes
are really hard-core.

80
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,750
She was even sleeping
during in her cocoon dream.

81
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,375
Right, Nemu?

82
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,291
Oh come on, can't we
just drop the subject.

83
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,625
Oh, that's right.
You're all named according

84
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,583
to the first dream
that you had in a cocoon.

85
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,500
Yep. We don't know who started
it, but that's the custom.

86
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,458
Too bad that young feathers
don't have any respect

87
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,958
for it at all, though.

88
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,041
I like flowers,
so I want to be a florist.

89
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,541
That's why I'm Hana.

90
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,125
I wanna be a carpenter!

91
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,875
A dream for the future.

92
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,041
Shortcake!

93
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,125
Huh?

94
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,416
That's just your
favorite food, Shorta.

95
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,125
No it's not. I really
did dream about it.

96
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,166
You two, I told you
to stop fighting.

97
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,083
Mmm...

98
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,916
What about Reki?
What it's mean?

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,500
Huh? I, uh...

100
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,333
Reki means little stones!

101
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,583
What?

102
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,166
Well uh, it's Reki as in
gareki, meaning pebbles.

103
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,583
I remember a moonlit night,
and I was walking all alone down

104
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:43,291
a pebble-laden path. Walking.

105
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,166
Come to think of it, you like
to walk, don't you, Reki?

106
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,041
Yeah, and switching rooms, too.

107
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,333
Give me a break.
You made me move.

108
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,375
Hey, everyboby!
Let's go for a walk?

109
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:58,583
How about it, Rakka? Let's all
go to town, think you can walk?

110
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,875
It's OK, isn't it?

111
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,791
Only if Rakka wants to.

112
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,833
Aren't you
coming with us, Reki?

113
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,416
No, I have to finish
moving the rest of my stuff.

114
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,333
And bring these 3 back
to the other Young Feathers.

115
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,333
Well, see you later.

116
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,708
Rakka.

117
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,208
Hmm?

118
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,666
You should try to take it easy,
you're still recuperating.

119
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,625
Uh, yeah.

120
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,625
Well now.

121
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,583
All right!

122
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:36,958
Let's go!

123
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,291
They say it was some sort of
dormitory building for a school.

124
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,333
But everyone started
leaving it over time.

125
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,125
It was completely
deserted at some point.

126
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,916
And that's when it became
a nest for the Haibane.

127
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,625
We call it the Old Home.
It's a nice place.

128
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:43,625
Although it's kinda scary
at night without a lamp,

129
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,958
since half of that
has no electricity.

130
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,500
And now, the only residents
left in old home are us,

131
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,291
the kids we call Young Feathers
and the old lady who works

132
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:56,458
as a housemother. Say, you
can pick any room you like.

133
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,958
Sure.

134
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,041
You gonna be hanging around
with us a lot anyway, right.

135
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:01,708
Ah.

136
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,375
Watch out!

137
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,375
Not everyone has
wings like we do.

138
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,708
Of course not. 

139
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,250
To be precise, the humans
are letting us Haibane

140
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,833
 live in their town.

141
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,666
That's right. And it's supposed
to be the Haibane's obligation

142
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,875
to only use things that
humans no longer need.

143
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,375
Really?

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,916
I know. Hey everybody,
Rakka needs some clothes.

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,916
Let's go shopping.

146
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,416
That sounds pretty good, 

147
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,541
but you mean that
thrift shop, don't you?

148
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,041
Thrift shop?

149
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,291
It's a rule that the Haibane
can only wear used clothes.

150
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,583
But that's the reason why we've
all become very good at sewing.

151
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,166
So we can make wing slits.

152
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,875
Wing covers, too,
so when it gets cold.

153
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,958
Wing covers? Mmm? Mm...

154
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,000
Welcome.

155
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,208
Eh? Oh, just some
of you Haibane.

156
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,500
Hey, looks like you've
got a new face there.

157
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,791
Oh, she's a newborn.

158
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,833
Yeah? Ahh. That's why.

159
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,625
Uh? Ah...

160
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,791
All right, then why don't
you pick out something you like

161
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,083
from that clothing
section over there.

162
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,208
Is it OK?

163
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,958
Hey, what about us?

164
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:38,125
For you guys... these.

165
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,541
Ugh.

166
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,750
Don't "ugh" me. This is
a box full of absolute steals,

167
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,791
just unsorted and unwashed.

168
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,375
You should at least wash them!

169
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,791
Yuck!

170
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,958
This is disgusting.

171
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,833
Hey, you can only have
one piece each, all right.

172
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,500
Ya, we get it.

173
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,208
What a cheapskate.

174
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,250
Now, you gonna tell me being
a Haibane isn't easy, right?

175
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,125
Although you seem not
to have a care in the world.

176
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,416
 'Course it isn't easy.

177
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,625
Rakka, have you decided yet?

178
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,541
Ah, uh, well.

179
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,083
Yes, this one.

180
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,541
What's that?

181
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,791
This? It's the Haibane-Notebook
of the Haibane-Renmei.

182
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,666
We use it in place of money.

183
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,625
Oh that's right, you don't
have a notebook yet.

184
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,875
Well, in that case,
you can sign here.

185
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,708
Oh, and leave a feather.

186
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,208
Sorry, did I hurt you?

187
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,416
I'm OK. Thank you.

188
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,208
Oh all right.
Our extra special service!

189
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,125
Rakka!

190
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,208
Yeah!

191
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,500
We got some tea!

192
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,791
Coming!

193
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:19,333
Oh, one thing, what's that
Haibane-Renmei you spoke of?

194
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,333
It means Charcoal
Feather Federation.

195
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,083
The group which
guarantees our living.

196
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,583
Soon, you should be
receiving a notebook from them

197
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,375
just like ours.

198
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,875
The Haibane are not allowed
to receive any money

199
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,625
from their employment.
So you jot down in the Notebook

200
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,916
what you earned from your
work, and you use it when

201
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,916
you buy things. I work at the
Clock Tower just over there.

202
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,541
You should come
and see it sometime.

203
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:44,250
I work at a bakery and
Nemu works in the Library.

204
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,500
You need to find work once
you get used to the town, too.

205
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,291
Oh.

206
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,375
Hey, look over there.

207
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,250
They're holding market
at the Great Gate Square.

208
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,458
The Toga must be here.

209
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,125
Toga?

210
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,958
See, those people there bringing
in the carts are the Toga.

211
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,208
Look at those walls.

212
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,708
This town is surrounded
by walls on all sides.

213
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,875
Both the Haibane and townspeople
are forbidden to leave it.

214
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,375
That's the way it's been
since I've been here.

215
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,250
The only exceptions are the
Toga. They come from the outside

216
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,333
to trade with the town. And
those standing next to them

217
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,500
are the gate keepers
and the Communicator

218
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,041
from the Haibane-Renmei.

219
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,416
Communicator?

220
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,583
The residents of the town
aren't allowed to speak with

221
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:13,666
or touch the Toga. Likewise, the
Toga would never come near us,

222
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,333
and they are forbidden to use
their voices while in town.

223
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,375
The only person who can
"speak" with the Toga

224
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:24,375
during that visits is the
Haibane Renmei Communicator.

225
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,666
They communicate with
each other by making shapes

226
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,875
with their hands just like this.
But I'm just making it up.

227
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,708
It's a language that
only they can understand.

228
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,875
In short, the Haibane-Renmei
serves as an intermediary

229
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,208
for the trade between
the Toga and the town.

230
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,041
Part of the profit pays for
things such as the utilities

231
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,666
for Old Home and helps
support for the Young Feathers.

232
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,625
Oh, I didn't know about that.

233
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,750
Thank you very mu--

234
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,916
Idiot!

235
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,666
Let's go. We'll get
into trouble if we stay

236
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,500
close to the wall too long.

237
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:29,250
Ah, a crow.
You dirty little scavenger!

238
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,166
Look at those pitch-black
wings flying away!

239
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,041
You don't know if that's the one
who's been scavenging our trash.

240
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,833
I hate crows!

241
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,250
Rakka!

242
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,958
I can see the wall over there.

243
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,291
Yes, you can. This town
is surrounded by walls.

244
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,708
So what's beyond the walls?

245
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:08,875
Nobody knows. I've read every
last one of the library books,

246
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,791
and there's nothing about it.

247
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,625
Maybe you thought
you were reading,

248
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,666
but really just snoozing.

249
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,500
You want to read them
yourself instead?

250
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,500
Ah, I'm suddenly
attacked by drowsiness.

251
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,041
Beyond thjose walls...
I wonder if the town

252
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,833
I used to live in
is somewhere over there.

253
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,125
Hmm?

254
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,000
Look! Rakka's got a nametag!

255
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,583
The Haibane-Renmei
were already here.

256
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,166
Look at this?

257
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,708
To the newborn Rakka, you are
hereby accepted as a Haibane.

258
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,791
You are expected to be at
the Temple tomorrow morning.

259
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,250
The Haibane-Renmei.

260
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh, I have to go there tomorrow
to return the halo mold.

261
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,458
Why don't we go together?

262
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:57,416
Okay. But... how did they
even know what my name was?

263
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,125
I'll tell you why.

264
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,708
Because the Haibane-Renmei
is the organization that uses

265
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,125
frightening magic!

266
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,625
Knock it off, Kana!

267
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,375
Re... Really?

268
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,375
You wrote your name down
when we went clothes shopping.

269
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,750
Huh? Oh, yeah.

270
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,208
All right now,

271
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,875
Rakka's so quiet I was
just trying to cheer her up.

272
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,416
Oh come on.

273
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,458
You're exactly like Reki used
to be, acting just like her.

274
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,083
Oh, rats.

275
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,375
Kana's just trying to make you

276
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,541
feel welcomed in her own way.

277
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,041
Oh, look, the lights
are off in the guestroom.

278
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,875
I wonder if Reki's
finished moving out.

279
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,416
So should we all say
goodnight right here?

280
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,083
Hikari and I live over
there in the East Tower.

281
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,000
Bye.

282
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,500
Well, see you tomorrow.

283
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,625
Okay, see you.

284
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,041
Bye.

285
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,750
Rakka, I'll come
to get you tomorrow.

286
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,208
Until tomorrow.

287
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,625
I wonder if Reki's in her room.

288
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:12,208
Oh, Rakka, so,
how was going to town?

289
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,416
I had a lot of fun being there.
I also got this today.

290
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,625
Really.

291
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,041
Did you eat?

292
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,291
We all ate at a café
on the way back.

293
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,666
Oh, I see.

294
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,125
Oh, I'm sorry,
were you waiting for me?

295
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,958
Hmm? Oh, don't worry about it.
I don't feel much like eating

296
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,666
after inhaling all that dust
from cleaning the rooms.

297
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,208
I'll make you some tea.

298
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,958
Oh, thank you.

299
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,958
Rakka?!

300
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,458
Well, uh...

301
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,333
It's OK. Just rest.
Sorry, I should've known.

302
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:07,333
It's strange. Until
a minute ago, I was just...

303
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,333
Too much emotional strain. 

304
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,666
Are you alright, can you walk?

305
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,958
Yes. 

306
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,500
Ouch!

307
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,083
Try lying on
your side for a while.

308
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,750
It takes some getting used to.

309
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,750
Huh?

310
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,541
 Is it staying?

311
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,208
Ah-ha

312
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:48,041
You haven't slept? Reki,
I'm fine so please go to bed.

313
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,250
I will when you're sleep.

314
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,083
I already am.

315
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,583
Good night, Rakka.

316
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,708
Good night, Reki.
