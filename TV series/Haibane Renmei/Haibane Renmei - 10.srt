1
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,208
I'm so glad
that you've recovered.

2
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,250
My name is Kuramori.

3
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,166
Come on Nemu, say hello.

4
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,750
Nemu!

5
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,916
We can go to town later.

6
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,708
Sure.

7
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,583
Do you remember
your cocoon dream?

8
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,958
I will permit you to speak.

9
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:38,333
Now tell me, what did you see
while dreaming in the cocoon?

10
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,916
All I remember,
was I was walking,

11
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,958
and the path I was
walking was rocky.

12
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,875
It was pitch-black.

13
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,750
Is that all?

14
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,541
Is there a cure?

15
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,250
I will show you how
to create a medicine.

16
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:10,000
From now on,
you are to be called Reki.

17
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,500
It means small stones.

18
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,833
Reki.

19
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm by your side.

20
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:44,166
I'll always,
always be by your side.

21
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,333
She said she'd go get
medicine for my feathers.

22
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,666
Kuramori's health is delicate.

23
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,250
It's too much for her to go
into the woods by herself.

24
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,625
If she dies then it's
going to be all your fault.

25
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,625
Um, I went to go
buy some food.

26
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,958
I thought maybe you
might be getting hungry.

27
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,416
Let's cook together.

28
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,041
Sorry about before.

29
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,583
Oh, thank goodness.

30
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,333
There.

31
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,791
Everything is clean now.

32
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:10,875
I don't know, I think
it might be too big for me.

33
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:14,375
Well then, why don't
we make this a guest room?

34
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:19,291
You can live here and take
care of the newborn Haibane.

35
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,416
That can be your new job.

36
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,541
Really?

37
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,166
That sounds great.

38
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,666
And you can take care of the
kids when you have free time.

39
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,458
I swear I'll do my best!

40
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,291
Now you're a
full-fledged Haibane.

41
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,583
Kuramori...

42
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,083
Please don't go.

43
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:58,208
You said you'd be by my side.

44
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,458
You promised me.

45
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,083
Damn it!

46
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:32,750
How is she?

47
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,083
I'm glad you're here.

48
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,416
I was debating if I should
go wake you up or not.

49
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,875
Medicine working?

50
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,458
I gave her some,
but her fever won't come down.

51
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,166
I was going to take her over
the doctor in the morning.

52
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:49,708
Where are you going?

53
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,125
I'll be right back!

54
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,666
Go ahead.

55
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,250
How could you leave
her alone like that?

56
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,333
You knew that she touched the
wall she will develop a fever?!

57
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,375
Because you're in Old Home.

58
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,625
I suspected that, should
something ever happen to her,

59
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,750
you would come here,
as you had for Hyohko.

60
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,625
We're not talking about Hyoko!

61
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,541
You have to cure Rakka!

62
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:42,208
It's not like she was climbing
the walls, why do this to her...

63
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,125
The walls are absolute.

64
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,000
There is nothing within
my power to do for her.

65
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,250
The walls are supposed to
protect good Haibane,

66
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,541
aren't they?

67
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,708
And Rakka isn't Sin-Bound
any more, is she?

68
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,166
Even a good Haibane must

69
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,208
be punished if she
touches the wall.

70
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,500
Rakka did overcome
her ordeal, however...

71
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,625
So it's true,
she really did it.

72
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,541
She had a bird help her.

73
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,666
And there was no question that
eventually she will find a way

74
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,750
to break out of
the Circle of the Sin.

75
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,916
Then you mean, you gave
Rakka and I the same riddle?

76
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,875
So then...

77
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,541
did she find an answer?

78
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,083
I know not.

79
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,875
However, the bird
gave her forgiveness,

80
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,625
and therefore she is
no longer Sin-Bound.

81
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,791
Oh.

82
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:46,666
Only little time remains for
you to stay here as a Haibane.

83
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,416
You need to prepare
yourself mentally.

84
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,625
The Day of Flight never
comes to the Sin-Bound, right?

85
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,458
I'm fine staying here.

86
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,958
Besides, I need to stay
and watch the kids.

87
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,083
That is not for you to decide.

88
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,250
You know what becomes of
a Haibane whose time expires

89
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:07,041
before she becomes
ready to take the Flight.

90
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:11,625
You have no choice but to
prevail against your own ordeal.

91
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,125
As you well know,

92
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,291
The Day of Flight comes
equally to all good Haibane.

93
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,833
What do you mean "equally"?

94
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,333
Kuu was the youngest of us all.

95
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,458
And yet, she was not
afraid of the walls.

96
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,333
She believed that...

97
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,958
if she went beyond the walls,

98
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,333
the rest of you
would soon follow.

99
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:32,416
It was Kuu's dream to become
a role model to all of you.

100
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,291
How do you know that?

101
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,250
I know nothing.

102
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,458
I am merely giving voice
to the thoughts

103
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,291
that you have deep in your mind.

104
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,166
How about Nemu?

105
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,500
She's always
being a good Haibane.

106
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,875
Nemu deserves to take the Day
of Flight with your blessings.

107
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,750
Nemu wishes to see you
take the Flight first.

108
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,166
She never voices it,

109
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,208
but she is more concerned
for you than for herself.

110
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,500
She is?

111
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,083
Then you're saying
I'm a burden on her?

112
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:03,958
No.

113
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,750
That's not true.

114
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,375
Nemu's issues are not
your responsibility.

115
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,833
That is simply
how it is for her.

116
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,208
Now go.

117
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,291
Rakka is awaiting you.

118
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,791
Help yourself and pick
the medicinal herbs you need.

119
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,833
I trust you know which ones.

120
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,916
You have always
been there for Rakka.

121
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,666
You always do the right thing.

122
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,041
And now, you must not be envious
of Rakka for moving forward.

123
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,125
Be envious?

124
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,416
Me envious?

125
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,583
You must be out of your mind!

126
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,750
The water's boiling.

127
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,375
Eww.

128
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,708
What's that smell?

129
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,458
Is it really going to work?

130
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:10,833
Be careful.

131
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,166
It's very hot.

132
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,916
It's bitter.

133
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,125
It's medicine.

134
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,625
You just have to take it.

135
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,291
One more mouthful.

136
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,041
Thanks Reki.

137
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,000
I hope you get well soon.

138
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,541
Reki!

139
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,875
On the bulletin board!

140
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,375
From the Renmei!

141
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,041
Haibane Rakka, you are
ordered to appear at the Temple

142
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,875
of the Haibane Renmei
before the end of the day.

143
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,125
Once there, you are to be
punished for committing a crime

144
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,166
of touching the wall.

145
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,458
What'll we do?

146
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,041
We'll just ignore it!

147
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,083
I'll take full responsibility!

148
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,541
They don't have
the right to punish Rakka!

149
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:07,833
Reki.

150
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,333
Rakka, you shouldn't
be out of bed!

151
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,458
I promised them that
I'm going to return the cane.

152
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,625
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

153
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,250
The fever's gone,

154
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,583
and my wings feel lot
better than they used to.

155
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,458
Your medicine
made me feel better.

156
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,791
Thank you so much.

157
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,833
And I'm sorry for making
everyone worry about me.

158
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,166
It's okay.

159
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,250
Take care.

160
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,541
Reki.

161
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,458
Descend.

162
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,041
Put this on.

163
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,500
This way.

164
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:48,041
You may use your voice
here if you wish.

165
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,416
Does this mean
I'm gonna be put in prison?

166
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,750
Prison?

167
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,166
Because I...

168
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,458
Where are we?

169
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,083
Inside the wall.

170
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,958
The wall?

171
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,708
Look over here.

172
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,875
These are called light leaves.

173
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,541
These are what
your halos are made of.

174
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,000
You are to circle this
corridor and gather the leaves.

175
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,125
You must also purify
the rusted tags.

176
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,916
That will be
your job in this town.

177
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,416
It is an important task.

178
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,041
Can you do it?

179
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,000
You mean, by myself?

180
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,375
Are you frightened?

181
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,083
I'll do it.

182
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,625
I will come
to collect you later.

183
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:21,500
And remember, you must
never take off your robe.

184
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:25,250
Do not be frightened of
anything you may see or hear.

185
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,500
Regardless of what it is,

186
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:31,041
it cannot touch one
who is wearing the robe.

187
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,750
Are you saying
something lives here?

188
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,958
These are...

189
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,916
Like I said.

190
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,375
Why do I have to do
something like this?

191
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,083
There's no choice!

192
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,833
I'm not allowed
to enter the South District.

193
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,625
Then why are you
coming with me?

194
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,541
I just bet you're hoping that
we're gonna run into Reki,

195
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,583
aren't you?

196
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,958
Right.

197
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,625
Jeez, and I'm the one
who made all these for you!

198
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,125
Why can't you do
anything by yourself!

199
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:44,833
What?

200
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,125
When did I...?

201
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,041
There's a girl in your place
with funny hair that sticks up,

202
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,000
right?

203
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,458
You mean Rakka?

204
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,250
Hyohko wants to give her this.

205
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,583
Hmm, What is it?

206
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,291
No, don't open it!

207
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,166
Just promise us that
you'll give it to her, OK?

208
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,708
Midori?

209
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,666
Here, you'll catch a cold.

210
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,875
You should really
stop smoking, Reki.

211
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,708
You look stupid.

212
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,583
We're going home!

213
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,708
Don't order me around!

214
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,833
You jerk!

215
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,250
What are you doing?

216
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,833
Oh- nothing, nothing at all.

217
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,500
Sorry.

218
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,541
I was going to come get you,
but an idiot held me up.

219
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,708
Oh, and the idiot asked me
to pass this bag on to you.

220
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,416
Anyway, what was
your punishment?

221
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,166
It wasn't too
horrible was it??

222
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,750
Well it was...

223
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,875
cleaning the Temple.

224
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,666
They told me
that's my job now.

225
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,916
Cleaning?

226
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,416
This world is
filled with idiots.

227
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,250
Wow!

228
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,708
One, two, three...

229
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,375
There's enough here
for the housemother

230
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,291
and all the kids as well.

231
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,500
How polite.

232
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,208
I'll have to think
better of them now.

233
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,333
What is that?

234
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,791
Oh, check it out!

235
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,208
What a crappy handwriting.

236
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,916
We should really give them
something in return.

237
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,375
Shouldn't have to.

238
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,250
The note says it's an apology.

239
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,041
But we still should.

240
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,875
What do you think Reki?

241
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,750
I really have no idea
what we should do.

242
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,833
Anyway, Dai would be going back
to Abandoned Factory very soon.

243
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,208
Shouldn't we pay a visit
to them prior to that?

244
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,208
What do you mean?

245
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,916
They can't take care
of the young feathers

246
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,666
at the Abandoned Factory,
so we've been fostering them.

247
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,041
They get to go back there
a few times a year.

248
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,583
Oh, I see.

249
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,291
If it's the
Abandoned Factory, then I...

250
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,291
I know.

251
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,541
Someone else
will host the visit.

252
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,458
Oh, I want to go.

253
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,666
But I have to warn you,

254
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,458
the boys in the factory
can be pretty rowdy.

255
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:27,500
No kidding.

256
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,250
I would like to go.

257
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,708
Well then,
I'll make some treats.

258
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,416
Is that okay?

259
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,833
It's up to you.

260
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,416
Good night.

261
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,083
 'Night.

262
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,458
Good night.

263
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:50,541
Nemu.

264
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,125
Yeah?

265
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,166
I want you to know something.

266
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,750
Stop worrying about me.

267
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,541
I'm perfectly fine on my own.

268
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:00,416
Your what?

269
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,833
What are you saying?

270
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:05,791
I'm saying I don't want
to be a burden to you anymore.

271
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,833
Reki, what's wrong?

272
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,250
Reki?
