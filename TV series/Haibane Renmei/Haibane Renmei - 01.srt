1
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,375
Where am I?

2
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:08,458
It feels... like I'm...
falling from the sky.

3
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:12,625
It's strange. Why am I
not feeling scared now?

4
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,208
Are you worried about me? 

5
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,250
Where am I? What is this?

6
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,500
Everything here
feel so soft and warm.

7
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,875
But I'm anxious inside. 

8
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:30,333
I'm not afraid...
but my heart feels cold.

9
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:41,500
I know you can't.
But thank you anyway.

10
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,166
Hmm?

11
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,166
This is... Oh my.

12
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,000
This is big.

13
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,458
Almost there, a little more.

14
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,333
Wow, everybody's here already.

15
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,375
This is way too far from town. 

16
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,083
Not mention Reki's
scooter is a single-seater.

17
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,791
Hah?

18
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,208
Isn't that gonna just
provoke them even more?

19
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,541
Come on, you saw
the sign to stay out.

20
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,125
Why can't you listen?

21
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,750
We wanna see!

22
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,125
I already said, no.

23
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:50,916
Why not?!

24
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,708
Yeah, why not? Let us see!

25
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,583
I knew it would happen.

26
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,416
Hey! If you brats
don't get out here,

27
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,333
I'm gonna give you a beating!

28
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,833
See, ya Reki you're
too easy on those kids.

29
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:09,041
So, think you can take
some time off from work?

30
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,333
Of course! 

31
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:13,000
This is a big event
for all of us Haibane.

32
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,875
We can't miss it.

33
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:18,333
I can probably get time off,
too. But three days at the most,

34
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,208
starting tomorrow.
So, tell me.

35
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,375
Where's the big star of
this moment of occasion, huh?

36
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,250
Wow! It's huge! 

37
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,708
Wow. Now that is
something really big.

38
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,208
You're late.

39
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,708
Oh, come on. I didn't
get the word in time.

40
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,916
And do you know how hard it is
for me to leave work early.

41
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,958
It started out about as big
as a dandelion puff, right?

42
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:56,083
I wish I could've seen it grow.
From now on, we should all make

43
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,916
the rounds more often. If Reki
hadn't accidentally found it,

44
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,875
it would've hatched without
any of us even knowing.

45
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,250
Come on, there's no way
the five of us can cover

46
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,916
this ridiculously huge building.
Anyway, it would be hard

47
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,750
to miss something this big.

48
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,500
I guess.

49
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,083
The surface color
is turning charcoal gray.

50
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,333
It might be hatching very soon.

51
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,625
At any rate, why don't we at
least try to clean up the room?

52
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,875
Anybody who was born in a room
full of junk like this...

53
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,458
I'd feel sorry for.

54
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,625
Is there really someone
inside of the cocoon, Reki?

55
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,833
That's right. All the Haibane
are born in this manner,

56
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,916
just like you
and I were, Kuu.

57
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,458
Wow,

58
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,625
It's a huge monster-egg!

59
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,041
A monster!

60
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,708
Wha..? You're still here!

61
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,333
A monster! 

62
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,916
This room is absolutely
off limits, you hear!

63
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,583
What is it with
those curious brats.

64
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,458
She's the one who's been
acting up over this the most.

65
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,250
She's just happy about it. 

66
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,833
I'm excited too about
having a new Feather!

67
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:06,625
I'm excited, too! I hope it'll
be like getting a little sister.

68
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:11,125
Well, this cocoon is way
bigger than yours was, Kuu.

69
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,458
What?

70
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,375
Come on, time
to clean the room.

71
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,916
You're mean!

72
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,583
Is this...

73
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,083
a dream?

74
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,333
I can breathe. But how?

75
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,458
I think I'm still in a dream.

76
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,166
Huh.

77
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,625
I can hear some voices.

78
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,375
Uh, Let's quit.
This is clean enough.

79
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,750
There must be people outside.

80
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,541
It's all clean now.

81
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,375
I'm so tired!

82
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,916
There.

83
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,333
OK then, we'll draw straws to
see who takes the first watch?

84
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,291
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

85
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,666
Uh, what a drag.

86
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,833
So, why don't we just
crack it open with a hammer?

87
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,666
I'm sure there's
one lying around here.

88
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,333
How can you say that?!

89
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,333
We can't do that. It's against
tradition. If you can't

90
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,125
crack the shell by yourself,
then you won't grow strong.

91
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,416
Hum, so now you think
we're baby chicks?

92
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,625
Well, why don't you just
sleep during you're watch.

93
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,250
That defeats the purpose
of having a watch!

94
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,583
Hey, I just heard
make a "blub" sound.

95
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,750
Huh?

96
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,458
See?

97
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,750
More Clouds?

98
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,000
I must be still in
that strange dream.

99
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:31,833
What?

100
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,250
Where am I?

101
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:04,791
It feels rough. But everything
felt so soft in that dream.

102
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,000
And it smells like nuts.

103
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,583
Ow!

104
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,166
Oh, so you're awake.

105
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,666
Sorry, we had to do
some quick shopping.

106
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,916
You've been asleep
for the whole day.

107
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,458
It was amazing.

108
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,791
Uh...

109
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,500
See, I should've stayed here,
just like I said.

110
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,708
But you wanted
to be the ring person.

111
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,833
Well, uh, uhm...

112
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:36,666
How do you feel?

113
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,750
Are you hungry?

114
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,000
Do you want us to go get
something from the store?

115
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,208
We were wondering
when you'd wake up.

116
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:47,208
Hey everybody, try
to talk one at a time.

117
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,625
You're all going to confuse her.

118
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,833
OK.

119
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,666
I'm sorry for
all the commotion.

120
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,041
My name is Reki. You're
in my room but it doubles as

121
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,958
a guestroom, so don't worry
about it. You can use it freely.

122
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:04,416
You turned this guestroom into
your room to be more precise.

123
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,291
That's why I'm moving my
stuff out. Well then, let me try

124
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,791
to explain everything
to you from the beginning.

125
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,208
Is it OK if I smoke?

126
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,000
Ah ah, sure.

127
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,416
First of all, can you
tell us about your dream?

128
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,833
My dream?

129
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,083
Yes, you had one didn't you? 

130
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,625
During the time that you
were sleeping in the cocoon.

131
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,708
Well, Uh...

132
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,041
Oh, sorry. Did you
have a scary dream?

133
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:03,125
No, don't worry. It's OK. Let's
see, umm, I had a dream that

134
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,625
I was falling down from
somewhere very high up

135
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:06,791
in the sky.

136
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,833
Wow! It's a dream
just like mine.

137
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,833
What should we do?
It'll overlap.

138
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,208
My dream is about
floating around in the air.

139
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,250
That's why my name
is Kuu, because my name

140
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,791
is supposed to mean "air."

141
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,500
Each Haibane is named after
the dream she had in the cocoon.

142
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,500
I had a dream being
surrounded by a sparkling light.

143
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,375
So I'm Hikari meaning "light."

144
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,000
In the dream I had, I was
drifting in a river just like

145
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:35,625
a fish. So my name is Kana,
which stands for "river fish".

146
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,583
This sleepy head here is
a Nemu, which means "sleep,"

147
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,833
because she was sleeping
even in her dream.

148
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,541
Do you want to get hit?

149
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,333
What else?
Did you see anything?

150
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,375
I think I might
have saw something,

151
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,125
but I can't remember.

152
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,208
Hmm.

153
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,208
Falling... Falling... 

154
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,000
I believe Rakka is
in other words for falling.

155
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:15,041
So, your name will be... Rakka.

156
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,500
But my name...

157
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,791
I don't remember my name.

158
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,458
There's nobody here
who knows who you were

159
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,291
before you ever appeared.

160
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,250
Including yourself, of course.

161
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,125
Hikari.

162
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,875
Feather Rakka.
To help guide your future

163
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,083
as a fellow Haibane,
I give you this halo.

164
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,125
Ah.

165
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,208
Ah... Ah...

166
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,291
A Haibane?

167
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,916
Oh, be careful,
it's still hot.

168
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,791
Oh no.

169
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,708
Well, looks good.

170
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:33,791
Don't worry it'll
stick in a few days.

171
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,833
Oh no, lunch break is over.

172
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:44,125
Oh man. This is bad.
I've got to get back to work.

173
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,750
I guess today
is just introductions.

174
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,125
We'll come back tomorrow
when your wings have grown,

175
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,291
so we can talk a lot more then.

176
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,958
Reki, you can take it from here.

177
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,166
Rakka, see you later.

178
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,416
Bye.

179
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,291
See you tomorrow.

180
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,666
Hurry up!

181
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,291
Peace and quiet finally.

182
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,750
It's hard to explain
things smoothly

183
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,208
with a lot of people around.

184
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,458
Well let's see, where do you
think we should begin?

185
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:19,458
Well, uh, can you
tell me where I am?

186
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,833
And what's Haibane...?

187
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,666
Are those real?

188
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,000
Your wings will grow soon.

189
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,916
Feeling any back pain?

190
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,291
A little.

191
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,583
I thought it was just
sore from sleeping funny.

192
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,833
Let me see.

193
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,375
I'll go get some ice.

194
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,833
Hah?

195
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:57,125
Stay right here. I'm just
going to get ready for it.

196
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,791
I'm sorry.
The wings seem to be

197
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,666
coming in faster
than I had expected.

198
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,500
I was hoping to
explain everything to you

199
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,916
before the fever broke out.

200
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,583
But, there wasn't any time 

201
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,916
Does it hurt?

202
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,875
Not exactly, but it
feels like being pulled.

203
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,041
Like I'm going to get a cramp.

204
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,583
I understand. It will sting
a bit when the wing tips

205
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,166
break the skin, then
you'll run a high fever.

206
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,916
But I promises you
it'll be gone by tomorrow.

207
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,500
Mirror.

208
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,375
You'd better not. 

209
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,875
It'll hurt more if you see it.

210
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,583
I see.

211
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:48,916
We're not human, are we?!

212
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,083
Nobody knows exactly what
we are, if we're human or not.

213
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,958
We call ourselves the Haibane,
which means Charcoal Feathers.

214
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:01,250
I wanna go home.

215
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,250
The Haibane are not allowed
to go outside of town.

216
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:09,583
It is our most sacred law.
Besides, even if your family

217
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,166
were somewhere in this world,
they wouldn't recognize you,

218
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,833
if they saw you now.

219
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,833
Why?

220
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,916
Just as you cannot remember the
world that you used to be in.

221
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,583
There is nobody in this
world who can remember you.

222
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,250
It's the world...
that we live in.

223
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,250
But why am I here? Why me?

224
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,333
I'm just an ordinary girl!

225
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,208
I'm sure that
I was nothing special.

226
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,750
We're all asking why.

227
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,833
But nobody remembers anything.

228
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,750
It's started. 

229
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,041
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! 

230
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,875
Bite on this! So you
won't bite your tongue!

231
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:47,166
My limbs are cold and heavy.
The wings on my back twitch

232
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,250
every time I feel pain shooting
through my shoulders and sides.

233
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,000
With every second I feel
the wings becoming more

234
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,750
a part of my body.
I'm afraid that my body

235
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:02,541
is being changed
into something else.

236
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:07,333
Sweat's stinging my eyes.
I can't see anything.

237
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,375
Reki, are you there?

238
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,041
Um?

239
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,458
What are you doing?

240
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,416
I have to brush your wings
to make them clean.

241
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,875
Have you done it...
for a while?

242
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,125
It takes time. They'll get
stained unless you get them

243
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,958
completely free
of blood and grease.

244
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,916
Is your hand alright?

245
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,333
Oh, this? It's nothing.

246
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,458
You should just be thinking
about yourself right now.

247
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:47,875
Mmm. My head is hot.

248
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,916
You'll feel better by tomorrow.

249
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,375
Just like magic,
you'll be fine.

250
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,916
Mmm.

251
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,833
Pretty wings.
Not white, not black,

252
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,833
but beautiful
charcoal gray feathers.

253
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,791
Oh... 

254
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,333
What is this?

255
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,291
What's happening to me?

256
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,875
Huh? Don't laugh!

257
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,541
Do you attract static?

258
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,916
I don't know! I can't remember.

259
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,291
Something's wrong with this
ring. Is this permanent?

260
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,666
It's nothing.

261
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,625
They are real.

262
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,333
Reki, did you keep cleaning
my wings all this time

263
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,291
even after I fell asleep?

264
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,458
Huh? Oh, of course.
They're clean now, aren't they?

265
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,041
Thank you very much.

266
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,708
You're very welcome.

267
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:55,958
And on behalf of Haibane,
welcome to Old Home.
