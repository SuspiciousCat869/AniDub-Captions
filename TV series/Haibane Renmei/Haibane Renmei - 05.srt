1
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,541
Two-thousand-two-hundred
and eleven, twelve, thirteen,

2
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:58,666
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,
seventeen, eighteen...

3
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,125
...nineteen, twenty.

4
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,666
Sumika?

5
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,000
You got me.

6
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,416
How did you know it was me?

7
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,583
Your shoes.

8
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,708
Oh?

9
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,708
Stop wearing heels.
You'll fall down.

10
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,250
Damn, you sound
just like my mother.

11
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,541
So, how much longer
can you work?

12
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,208
Just till the end
of this month.

13
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,291
Huh? Four more days.

14
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,541
That's not very long.

15
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,666
That's just for
the official record.

16
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,208
I'll help as long as I can.
But I can't do heavy lifting.

17
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:36,916
Don't work too hard.
So, are you all prepared?

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,708
There's so much left to do.

19
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,041
Handing over my work to others
and submitting paperwork.

20
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,375
Oh, speaking of which,
is the Director here?

21
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,625
Downstairs I think.

22
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,125
I guess I'll take care
of the hard part first.

23
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,166
You're a friend of Nemu's?

24
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,125
Yes, my name is Rakka.

25
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:16,083
Nemu's letting me visit
here since I'm a newborn.

26
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,750
I'm Sumika, a librarian here.
Nice to meet you.

27
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,666
But I don't know how much
longer I'll be here though.

28
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,583
Say, let me help you.

29
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,458
No it's OK, I'll be fine.

30
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,750
It's too heavy
for just one. Come on.

31
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,625
Thank you.

32
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,833
Newborn means you just
came into this world, right?

33
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,500
But you don't
look like a baby to me.

34
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,500
What did it feel like
when you were being born?

35
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,458
Were you scared?

36
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:52,291
Not much, I can't remember
very well, but in my dream

37
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:55,875
I think that I remember that
someone was protecting me.

38
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,250
Really.

39
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,333
Oh!

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,083
Thank you very much.

41
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,291
Not at all,
thank you for the advice.

42
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,041
Huh?

43
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,625
On how a parent
should frame her mind.

44
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,916
Did you bring them up
all by yourself?

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,458
A nice lady named Sumika
was helping me.

46
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,500
Oh, Sumika is the
senior librarian.

47
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,416
Actually, I meant
she used to be.

48
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,333
All the books here,
we acquired them through trade

49
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,166
with the Toga, so we never
know what kind of books

50
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,458
will arrive or when.

51
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,750
So it's very hard to keep
them organized, and...

52
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,833
Then all of these library books
were written by somebody

53
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,833
in the outside world.

54
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:02,166
And they're very old,
so you should be careful.

55
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,125
Only 20 minutes left.

56
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,125
I'll go bring these
to the book book binder.

57
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,708
Rakka, can you help me
by doing the labeling?

58
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,541
Uh...uh huh.

59
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,208
Nemu?

60
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,666
Ah.

61
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,750
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,958
Thank you for helping me again.

63
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,333
Oh, it's supposed to be
my job to begin with.

64
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,416
But what were you reading that
held your interest so much?

65
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,166
Oh it was nothing very special.

66
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,458
I just wondered if I could find
a book that could tell me

67
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,750
what's outside this town.

68
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,458
Ah, I know what you mean.
I looked everywhere

69
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,541
for a book like that
a long time ago.

70
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,916
Really? Did you find it?

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,916
No, not at all.

72
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,750
I guess that's to be expected.

73
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,625
I guess I could tell you,

74
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:26,708
I once thought about
going out beyond the walls.

75
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,500
I wanted to find the
beginning of the world.

76
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,208
The beginning of the world?

77
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,583
The way that this town exists
as it is now, is because

78
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:39,583
someone first began by building
it. So along the same line,

79
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,875
no matter how wide
the world is, I think there's

80
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:46,250
a beginning to it somewhere.
I wanted to find it...

81
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,750
Of course I couldn't go.
Because my life here

82
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,583
is so much happier
than chasing that dream.

83
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,500
Well, a dream is only beautiful
because it remains a dream.

84
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,500
But still I wonder
about it once in a while.

85
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,291
Ahh, that's why
life is so difficult.

86
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,916
Oh. No!

87
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,791
Sumika is really
something else.

88
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,208
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,250
You don't have to be.
This is your first time here.

90
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,791
But Sumika is a senior
librarian. She should...

91
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,250
She should what?

92
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:27,250
...set a good example for
everyone else. You're right.

93
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,708
So I'll take over here for now.

94
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,000
It's time for Storybook Lady.

95
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:38,541
And so, the evil wizard was
transformed into an ugly frog.

96
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,833
In order to rescue all
the little children,

97
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:45,625
the young man climbed up
the stairs in the high tower.

98
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,833
He planted the seed that
the old lady had given him,

99
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,708
and vines grew out of it
instantly, allowing the

100
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,458
young man and all the
children to come home safely.

101
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,625
And peace was once again
restored to the village.

102
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,166
The end.

103
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,833
Yay!

104
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,916
Stop it, it's embarrassing.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,791
Now, did you say "thank you"
to the Storybook Lady?

106
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,875
Thank you!

107
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:18,041
This place sure has changed a
lot. Whenever I used to visit,

108
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,333
it had an air of
"scholars-only."

109
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,625
I know, we've put a lot of
effort into changing this place.

110
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,833
Oh I forgot, I have to go
pick up some things.

111
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,166
Hikari, do you think
you can take the kids home?

112
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,583
Sure, that's fine,
Kuu can help.

113
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,833
Eh?

114
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,250
Kuu, do you want to be
a substitute teacher?

115
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,416
A teacher? All right!

116
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,583
Thanks.

117
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,791
See ya.

118
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,708
Ah, I'm all worn out. How can
Reki deal with the children

119
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,166
so easily day in and day out?

120
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,416
But you seemed like you were
having a good time with them.

121
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,250
It's only once in a while.

122
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,291
I couldn't possibly
do it every day.

123
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,625
Sorry. The meeting for
tomorrow's assignments

124
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,916
dragged a bit.

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,291
It's okay. I'm sorry
I wasn't much help today.

126
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:25,416
Oh, you did great.
But, only four more days.

127
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Huh?

128
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,916
I meant Sumika.
I was making her a gift,

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,625
but there's no time
to finish it.

130
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,791
What is it?
Knitting something?

131
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,291
It's a secret.

132
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,291
I can help if you
tell me what it is.

133
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:43,416
It's somewhat embarrassing.
Well uhm, here's a hint,

134
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,916
the beginning of the world.

135
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Huh?

136
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,958
There was a book with that title
in the library a long time ago.

137
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,583
But it's discarded now.

138
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,833
An old and crumbling book
only the first few pages

139
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,666
were legible. Sumika and
I racked our brains to come up

140
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,291
with the rest of the story.

141
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,625
And then?

142
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,958
That's the only hint.

143
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,291
What?

144
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,416
Reki.

145
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,958
Reki!

146
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,375
Where's she...?

147
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,625
Um.

148
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,208
She's going in
the opposite direction.

149
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,375
Oh, she just needed
some gas for her scooter.

150
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,416
See. I told you.
It's just Reki.

151
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,041
What are you doing here?!

152
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:05,333
Hyohko!

153
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,875
Whoo hoo!

154
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,625
This is gonna be classic!

155
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,375
What was that for!?

156
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,208
Quit smoking you stupid girl!
And stop riding that bike!

157
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,583
You're the one who's stupid!
I have permission from town;

158
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,958
it's perfectly legal
for me to ride it!

159
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:28,958
Jerk.

160
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,666
Too bad, Hyoko You lose.

161
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,583
Come on, let's leave now
before we get caught.

162
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,500
Uhm...okay.

163
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,791
There's a place called Abandoned
Factory in the East District.

164
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,208
It's also a nest for the
Haibane, and lucky for them,

165
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,083
it's coed.

166
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,000
Really?

167
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,250
That boy with the cap

168
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,625
is one of the Haibane
from Abandoned Factory?

169
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,625
Yes, and one thing led
to another with those two.

170
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,500
What kind of things?

171
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,458
Back then in Old Home there were
only Reki, the children, and me.

172
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:12,708
And Reki was, well, troubled
and bit more rebellious.

173
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,916
Things led to a big fight
between us, and Reki ran away.

174
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,541
Later on I'd heard that
she had actually run away

175
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,541
with that boy we saw.

176
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,875
Oh, wow! That's sounds so cool.

177
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,083
Don't you follow
in her footsteps.

178
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,625
Because of what they did,
neither one is allowed to go

179
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,625
into each other's district.

180
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,291
I don't think having boys
around would be too bad,

181
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,916
but I don't like the ones
in Abandoned Factory.

182
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,708
They're so rowdy.

183
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,416
In my memories there exists
another version of myself.

184
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,250
Nemu and others said it isn't
so, but I can't quite shake off

185
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,333
the feeling from my mind that
maybe my parents and the town

186
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:11,333
I used to live in still exist
somewhere. I wonder if this

187
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,916
sense of confusion will
disappear when my wings have

188
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,833
completely become
a part of my body.

189
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:21,291
Here, everyone, even someone
as little as Kuu, has a job

190
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,958
and has become a self
sufficient part of this world.

191
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,000
Yet, the truth is that everybody
is mutually supporting

192
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,458
each other in ways that
are not apparent to the eyes.

193
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:36,166
It's a perfectly natural, but
I didn't realized it until now.

194
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,750
I wonder if I deserve...
to be as happy as I am.

195
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,333
Good morning.

196
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,833
Is it okay if I help?

197
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,625
Well sure I'd love your help,

198
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,375
but I won't be
leaving till late.

199
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, I'll do some
research until then.

200
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,291
What are you researching?

201
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,125
The beginning of the world.

202
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,583
So what's she
studying so intently?

203
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,333
It's a secret.
Just leave her alone for now.

204
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,666
Oh.

205
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,750
When I think about it,
you were acting just like her

206
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,750
when you first
started working here.

207
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,166
Was I?

208
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,750
In the beginning of the world,

209
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:49,791
there was nothing but a dark
mist called the Nothingness.

210
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:57,916
And then God appeared. By merely
being there, He brought, umm...

211
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,166
let me see, light into
the Nothingness.

212
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:19,583
When God... something...
glowing over His head...

213
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,416
It... Er... Er...
it became the sun.

214
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,750
It's hopeless, this book
is too damaged to read.

215
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,625
Oh, well! We'll
just have to come up

216
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,000
with the rest by ourselves.

217
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,291
Oh, you should wake me
instead of watching me.

218
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:59,333
But you looked so happy
sleeping like that...

219
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,583
How did your research go?

220
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,208
Fine. The beginning of
the world is very interesting.

221
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,000
I found some different
references to it in many books,

222
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:12,041
but they all have
some common similarities.

223
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,791
And, what's the answer?

224
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:17,958
Nemu, why should I tell?
If you just gave me a hint.

225
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,708
Alright, then.
Don't laugh when you see it.

226
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:31,541
Wow, this is great!
How did you do this?

227
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,041
I asked the man who
repairs our books to do it.

228
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,166
It was a lot of work.

229
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,708
Can I read it?

230
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,125
You won't laugh?

231
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,750
I won't.

232
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,291
Ahh.

233
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,750
Oh, is this all?

234
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:12,083
Well, I can't decide on how to
write the ending. Got any ideas?

235
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,416
You won't laugh, right?

236
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,916
I promise.

237
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,625
You're laughing! You promised!

238
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,333
You gotta be joking.

239
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,125
I'm not joking.

240
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,250
I was thinking something
like that a minute ago,

241
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,541
when I was looking
at your sleeping face.

242
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,041
That's not funny! Be serious!

243
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,875
This is a story about
a great and powerful being.

244
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:52,125
But it's a book written by you,
so I think it should remind

245
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,625
the reader of the author,
don't you?

246
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,583
But I don't have such bad
manners. How can you even think

247
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:03,125
like that? I should inspire
ideas with a lot more dignity.

248
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,166
Well, I've got to work
overtime to finish this.

249
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,291
I'm so glad you picked me up.
Overtime is exhausting.

250
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,083
Where's Nemu?

251
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,250
She's got double overtime.

252
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,625
Huh?

253
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,000
She had to stay late to
talk to the book repairman.

254
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,583
I learned a lot from working
with her. Even though

255
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,166
she appears sleepy,
Nemu is a hard worker.

256
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,250
Of course she is. Nobody
gets mad at her for her naps

257
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,291
because she always
gets the job done.

258
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,500
I understand.

259
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,250
But it's still hard to believe.

260
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,125
Here you go.

261
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,250
Thanks a lot.

262
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,958
Yeah, see you later.

263
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,125
Hmm, oh yeah.

264
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,791
Goodbye

265
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,375
Alright. You take it easy, boy.

266
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,250
Here you go.

267
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,708
Bye-bye.

268
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:16,583
Kuu!

269
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,750
Oh, Rakka.

270
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,250
What are you doing?

271
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,000
Hmm?

272
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,625
Just saying goodbye.

273
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,416
Saying goodbye?

274
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,375
I said no!

275
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,791
Come on, it's OK.

276
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,125
No way!

277
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,416
Morning.

278
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,583
Hey, where's Nemu?

279
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,000
She's still in bed.

280
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,583
What now?

281
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,750
I thought that she was trying
to get up early for a change.

282
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,750
But she was at the library
very late last night.

283
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,958
What? For work?

284
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,250
Uhh, it's something
private but it's also

285
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,791
a very important thing,
I guess.

286
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,083
Huh?

287
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,625
Whatever it is...

288
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,958
she'll probably be sleeping up
until the very last minute.

289
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,291
Rakka.

290
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,083
Look. It's supposed
to be a triangle.

291
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,750
Oh.

292
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,791
Oh, no!

293
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,125
Rakka! Forget about breakfast!

294
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,625
Oh.

295
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,166
Right on time.

296
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,125
I really hope that
Sumika will like it.

297
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,750
Mmm... If she
thinks it's stupid,

298
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,416
it's gonna
be all your fault.

299
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,000
What, why?

300
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,833
Well, because
I collaborated with you.

301
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:58,083
Your name is now
on the cover, too.

302
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,541
Huh?!

303
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,000
It's too late for that.

304
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,375
No! It's not that.
But is it OK?

305
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:08,541
Well, you're jointly
responsible. Better be prepared.

306
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,833
Nemu, I'm very happy.

307
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,208
I hope Sumika will be, too.

308
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,916
How can she not be?

309
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:26,833
When God...something...
glowing over His head...

310
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:31,166
When God took into his hand
the halo glowing over His head

311
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:37,291
and held it high, it became
the sun. God waved His staff,

312
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:41,541
and the Nothingness was ripped
into two, one part forming

313
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:46,041
the sky and the other
the land. However,

314
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,208
his hand was not straight,
thus creating mountains

315
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:56,041
and valleys. God said "It was a
mistake, but it's just as well."

316
00:21:56,125 --> 00:22:00,333
When God drew pictures on
the land, grass and trees grew,

317
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:05,083
and birds and animals came
to life. God then envisioned

318
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,208
creatures that looked
almost like Himself.

319
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,125
But these creatures were
too similar to himself

320
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,333
and that gave him concern.

321
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,208
So he colored their
wings charcoal-gray,

322
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:21,041
and made holes on their halos
and named them Haibane.

323
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:25,333
Then he tucked them away
in the back of his mind.

324
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:29,416
After that, God started over
and created human beings

325
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,291
that did not have wings
or halos. And this time,

326
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:38,291
he was satisfied with his
creation. Completely content,

327
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,333
God...

328
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:46,250
God, despite his omnipotence,
fell asleep. The Haibane,

329
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,541
who were destined to be
erased, were able to escape

330
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:54,500
from his mind. When God awoke,
the Haibane were already

331
00:22:54,583 --> 00:23:00,083
floating in the sky. However,
ever tolerant of mistakes,

332
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:04,416
even his own, God decided
to let the Charcoal Feathers

333
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,875
and their tiny world be.

334
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,500
So, that is why
the town of Guri is still

335
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,833
floating somewhere today.

336
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:19,125
Somewhere that is neither
on the land nor the sea.
