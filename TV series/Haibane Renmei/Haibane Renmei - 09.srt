1
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,333
Rakka!

2
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,291
Rakka!

3
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,958
Hey!

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,625
Found her?

5
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,125
I hope the storms are not
going to get any worse.

6
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,916
Don't worry, I'm sure
it'll let up any minute now.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,333
Please...

8
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,125
Who are you?

9
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,375
I just wish we can
talk with the crows?

10
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:31,375
The Haibane believe that
they carry our lost items.

11
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,416
What did you feel like
when you were being born?

12
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,083
That in my dream I think
that I remember that someone

13
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,083
was protecting me.

14
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,875
Someone who protected me.

15
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,541
Mom...

16
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,958
Dad...

17
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,625
I don't know.

18
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,041
Hello!

19
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,916
Excuse me, I need a help.

20
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,250
The ladder is broken,
and I can't get out.

21
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,416
My name is Rakka, and
I'm a Haibane who lives

22
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,541
in the Old Home on
the outskirts of town.

23
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,333
Can you hear me?

24
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:40,958
No, wait!

25
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:41,916
I can't get out!

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,166
Please help me!

27
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,333
Please help me!

28
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,000
Excuse me.

29
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,166
Thank you so much
for rescuing me.

30
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,625
You save my life.

31
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,208
No wait!

32
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:10,500
A young Haibane girl name Kuu
went beyond the walls recently!

33
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,958
She's my friend.

34
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,500
Do you know
what happened to her?

35
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm really sorry.

36
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,375
I know that I'm not
allowed to speak to you.

37
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,541
But Kuu is my friend and
I'm really concerned about her

38
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,166
because I don't know anything
at all about what goes on

39
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,333
the outside of the town walls.

40
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,916
Is Kuu doing all right?

41
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,500
If you can't speak,
could you please at least

42
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,583
nod if you've seen Kuu!

43
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,625
Tell me something!

44
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,625
Anything!

45
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,333
The wall...

46
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,250
Kuu!

47
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,250
Kuu!

48
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,583
It's cold!

49
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,708
What are you doing?

50
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,208
You must not touch the wall.

51
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,541
You were told to
stay out of the Woods?

52
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,458
Did you sprain your ankle?

53
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,000
Use this.

54
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,708
You are a Haibane
from Old Home, correct?

55
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,375
Your name is...

56
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,083
Rakka.

57
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,166
Yes.

58
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,166
You may explain
your situation later.

59
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,416
Stay here if you cannot walk.

60
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,125
I will get someone.

61
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,541
I'm alright.

62
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,583
Your rescue from
the well was inevitable,

63
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,208
but you must not
communicate with the Toga.

64
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,875
Only official Communicators
are permitted to do so.

65
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,250
My friend!

66
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,166
She went beyond the walls,
so I thought that may be

67
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,833
the Toga might know
something about it.

68
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,000
One more thing!

69
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,750
I heard my friend Kuu's voice.

70
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,583
From inside the walls.

71
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,666
You only imagine that
you heard what you did.

72
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,708
It was nothing but the wall
echoing your inner desire for

73
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,416
a friend who had
taken the day of Flight.

74
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,791
Only those whom
the walls recognized as ready

75
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,666
to live outside may go beyond.

76
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,500
Therefore, you have
no need to worry.

77
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,833
Why did you want
to go down to the well?

78
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,375
I saw that there was a dead
bird at the bottom of the well.

79
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,291
And that is what you
risk to your life for?

80
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,125
It was just that...

81
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,833
Since the day I came to this
town, I've been feeling like

82
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,333
that bird was
calling out to me.

83
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,625
I don't know how to
explain it right,

84
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:13,208
but I feel like I was
responsible for it dying.

85
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,666
Birds are the only
creatures allowed to go

86
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,166
beyond the walls in this world.

87
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,500
Because of this allowance,

88
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,750
they're said to carry
that which is lost.

89
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,875
Did you feel afraid
when you saw its corpse?

90
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,583
No.

91
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,166
In that case, finding
the dead bird is proof

92
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,833
that you now know
what you are supposed to.

93
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,541
The bird was proud that
it completed its task

94
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,708
and showed you a sign
that its work is over.

95
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,250
You have no need to grieve.

96
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,041
The bird let me understand
the true meaning of the dream

97
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,833
I had in the cocoon.

98
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,750
I had another dream
at the bottom of the well.

99
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,375
It's because of the bird!

100
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,041
Bird was someone
I used to know.

101
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,208
It was someone
who cared for me.

102
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,625
I didn't even try
to understand.

103
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,000
Why do you feel so much grieve

104
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,000
for someone you cannot
even remember?

105
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,541
I don't know.

106
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,625
But I know I hurt them.

107
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,041
Please sit down.

108
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,250
Tell me what happened
and take your time.

109
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,291
For what you just said
is very important.

110
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:45,750
Somewhere, it's not here,
in a place I can't remember,

111
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:49,250
I was obsessed with the
idea that I was all alone.

112
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:53,041
I thought that nobody would care
or even miss me if I vanished

113
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,000
from the face of earth.

114
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,583
I wanted to disappear.

115
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:01,333
Then, I had a dream
about falling from the sky.

116
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,458
I just remembered that the
bird was in the dream with me.

117
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,375
And that the bird was
someone in the form of the bird,

118
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,958
trying to call me back.

119
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:13,291
I now know that
I was never alone.

120
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,791
But I...

121
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,458
You should not
think of it in such a way.

122
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,208
Your wings and halo are
proof that you have no sin

123
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,166
to be atoned for in this world.

124
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,333
But, you don't understand...

125
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,250
My feathers are...

126
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,250
So, you are Sin-Bound hiding
the signs of sin by dying

127
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,375
your feathers with medicine.

128
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,250
Who showed you how?

129
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,541
I see.

130
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,625
What do you mean by Sin-Bound?

131
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,625
Are you saying I'm a sinner?

132
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:46,833
And then does that mean that
the dream I had was real?

133
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,166
There is no way to be certain.

134
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,875
Whatever you lost
dreaming inside the cocoon

135
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,958
can never be retrieved.

136
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,791
Even if you did hurt someone,

137
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,958
you will never see
that person again.

138
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,708
What should I do?

139
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,791
So if I really am a sinner and
I'm not supposed to be here,

140
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:16,750
then please, take me back to the
place where I'm supposed to be.

141
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:17,833
This place...

142
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,291
this town is too good to me.

143
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:24,041
Everyone is so caring
and treats me so kindly.

144
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,833
I feel so guilty.

145
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,041
If the dream I had is real,
I want to go back.

146
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,666
I have to go back.

147
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,291
I have to apologize.

148
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,541
To recognize one's own sin,
it's to have no sin.

149
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,708
Huh?

150
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,208
It is a riddle of
the Circle of the Sin.

151
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,625
Think about it - to
recognizes one's own sin,

152
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,875
it's to have no sin.

153
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,208
Now I ask you,
are you a sinner?

154
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,375
Am I a sinner?

155
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,250
If the dream I had
in a cocoon was for real,

156
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,250
then I think I am a sinner.

157
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:07,416
Then do you
recognize your own sin?

158
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,166
If I do, does that mean
my sin will be erased?

159
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,500
Think about it.

160
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,625
"To recognizes one's own
sin, it's to have no sin."

161
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,916
So, are you a sinner?"

162
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,625
Ah, but if I think I have no
sin, then I become a sinner.

163
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,666
Perhaps this is what
it means to be bound by sin.

164
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,458
To spin in the same circle
looking for where the sin lies,

165
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,000
and at some point losing
the sight of the way out.

166
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,833
What is the right answer that?

167
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,416
Think about it.

168
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,250
You must search for and
find the answer yourself.

169
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,000
Now, come along.

170
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,250
This is where I must leave you.

171
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,458
Take my cane and
have a safe walk home.

172
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,916
Can I see you again?

173
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,166
It will be necessary
for you to return the cane.

174
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,166
Thank you for everything.

175
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:27,750
Rakka!

176
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,875
Reki?

177
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,708
Rakka, you're OK.

178
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,541
Ouch, Reki, that hurts.

179
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,666
Sorry.

180
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,333
You're covered in mud.

181
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,666
Where are your shoes?

182
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,125
What happened?

183
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,333
I fell in to the well
in the Western Woods.

184
00:15:59,416 --> 00:15:59,916
Huh...?

185
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,416
Hey!

186
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,625
Don't run off
by yourself like that!

187
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,333
You found her?

188
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,875
Over here.

189
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,958
Hi!

190
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,875
We're over here!

191
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,291
That cane...

192
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,875
Oh, the old Communicator
let me borrow it for a while.

193
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,500
I know it he seemed scary,
but he's really nice.

194
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,041
If he was a truly nice man,

195
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,708
he would not have left an
injured girl all by herself.

196
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,333
Oh no, look at your hands.

197
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,750
They are cold.

198
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,541
This could mean that
you are really sick.

199
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,875
You feel like ice.

200
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,041
That's strange, I don't
feel like anything wrong.

201
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,666
Hey, my ankle
doesn't hurt any more.

202
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,958
It hasn't got better.

203
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,166
You've got numb.

204
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,875
Can you walk?

205
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,291
While you are out there,
did you touch the wall?

206
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,958
Ah, yeah.

207
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,416
What's wrong?

208
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,708
You look so pale.

209
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,875
I have to take Rakka
home right now, let's go.

210
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:55,750
Oh...

211
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,791
hey wait.

212
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,250
She said she touched the wall.

213
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,291
What?!

214
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,166
Rakka, get on.

215
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,250
Hey, what happened?

216
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,166
Reki, tell me what happened?

217
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,583
Wait...

218
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,958
Hikari, we all
have to hurry back now.

219
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,958
My body feels like
it's getting lighter.

220
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,833
Try not to talk
and get some sleep.

221
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:30,833
I can't.

222
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,791
I'm afraid to close my eyes.

223
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,833
I feel like I'm just
going to disappear

224
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,583
if I fall asleep like this.

225
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,958
The walls are
extremely dangerous.

226
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,666
Especially near the
Western Woods and the pond.

227
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,791
Didn't I tell you
that several times?

228
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,541
Mm, I'm very sorry.

229
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,458
It was the bird
that called me.

230
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,875
The bird?

231
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,791
While I was in the well,
the dream I couldn't remember

232
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,916
when I was in
a cocoon came back to me.

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Your dreams...

234
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,458
that means...

235
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,041
The spots are all gone.

236
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,000
But, it couldn't
be the medicine.

237
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,375
Hmm?

238
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,416
Will she be alright?

239
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,208
Is she asleep?

240
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,333
Kana, sorry,
but could you go to town

241
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,166
and get some fever medicine?

242
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,750
What?!

243
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,750
Why didn't you ask me
when we were out?

244
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,375
Come on, I even let
you take my scooter.

245
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,375
Fine.

246
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,666
But is the store
still open though?

247
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,250
Make them open it for you.

248
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,375
And don't say anything
about the walls.

249
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,958
Yeah, I know.

250
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,000
Keys?

251
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,958
Oh, I left them
in the ignition.

252
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,583
Why do you always
have to do that?

253
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,125
Reki, I don't
think she has a fever.

254
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,708
In fact, she feels cold.

255
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,916
The fever won't start
until after midnight.

256
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,583
Reki, how do you know so much?

257
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,791
Reki, have you let
the housemother know that

258
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:19,833
you found her yet?

259
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,541
Ah, No, I haven't.

260
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,041
Hikari, we have to go
tell the house mother

261
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,875
and check on the kids.

262
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,250
Thanks a lot for the help.

263
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,875
I'm always good
at putting them to sleep.

264
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,250
Better not fall asleep
before they do.

265
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,708
Sorry, that hurt?

266
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,791
No.

267
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,833
It almost feels
like my body isn't here.

268
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,916
Well, just looking at you hurts.

269
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,583
It's like the night
my wings came out.

270
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,166
Yeah, I guess so.

271
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,458
You know Reki, you are
always taking care of me.

272
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,666
I'm a busybody.

273
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,916
It's just in my nature.

274
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,750
Your hands, they are so warm.

275
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,458
That's because
your hands are so cold.

276
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,083
They're just like ice.

277
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,625
Reki, I feel like
my body is getting lighter.

278
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,208
Tell me am I still here?

279
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,958
Don't worry,
you are still here.

280
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,375
Reki, I don't want to go

281
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,666
You are not going anywhere,
don't worry about it.

282
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,250
I want to stay here.

283
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,416
I don't want
to go anywhere else.

284
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,291
That's okay, isn't it?

285
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,541
Of course.

286
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,125
You can stay here
as long as you like.

287
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,416
After all, you are
a blessed Haibane.

288
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,791
Reki...

289
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,500
You've always
being helping me...

290
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,166
You are free...

291
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,375
And now I'm alone...

292
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,083
How is she?

293
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,708
She just fell asleep.

294
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,500
Hopefully the medicine will get
her before the fever kicks in.

295
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,916
Is it something
medicine can cure?

296
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,833
I'm not really sure.

297
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,166
If a fever hasn't
broke in by the morning,

298
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,583
I'll take her to the Renmei.

299
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,291
I will tell them
what happened, and...

300
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,541
Reki!

301
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,083
I know you know a lot,

302
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,583
and I know that you can
handle anything by yourself.

303
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,833
But...

304
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,541
You don't have to
shoulder everything alone.

305
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,333
Tell us if there's
something we can do to help.

306
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,875
We are all friends.

307
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,208
I'm sorry.

308
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,791
Let's take turns watching her.

309
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,708
So can you take
the first shift?

310
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,875
Of course.

311
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,125
Thanks a lot.

312
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,458
I'm going to take a nap.

313
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,333
You can call me if you need me.

314
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:31,500
You know, Rakka doesn't
really need my help either.

315
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,750
There's no need to be depressed.

316
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,958
I should be happy.

317
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,291
Rakka isn't Sin-Bound anymore.

318
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,416
I've got used to
being abandoned.

319
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,000
I mean after all,
it's happened so many times

320
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,291
over the past seven years.
