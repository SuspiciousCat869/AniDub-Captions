[CHIKA] Whoa, have you
lost weight, Ayako?

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:24.232 position:50% align:center
Way to go! Your tummy's
definitely more flat!

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
Then I guess my diet
really is working, after all!

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.409 position:50% align:center
Listen, Watanabe, I--

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:39.664 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sawa, what's with that
new pose you're doing?

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? It's the Winter
Troupe's signature pose!

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
Don't you know that?

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
Seriously, every Kouka
fan knows that!

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.214 position:50% align:center
Miss Watanabe, I've been
meaning to ask you this

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:49.799 position:50% align:center
for quite a while now.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.551 position:50% align:center
Do you like any
other shows besides

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.261 position:50% align:center
the Rose of Versailles?

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:56.514 position:50% align:center
Well, I-- It's just that
I don't actually know

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.266 position:50% align:center
any other shows.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.394 position:50% align:center
Look what you've done! You've
traumatized our poor class rep!

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.772 position:50% align:center
For your information, Sugimoto
loves the Winter Troupe

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.065 position:50% align:center
most of all!

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.692 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Uh, Sugimoogy?

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.277 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
It's fine.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.529 position:50% align:center
No, it's wonderful!

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:14.074 position:50% align:center
Because, guess who's going
to see a Winter Troupe

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:15.784 position:50% align:center
performance this afternoon?

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.244 position:50% align:center
They're doing Romeo
and Juliet right now.

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:19.788 position:50% align:center
This will be the perfect
opportunity for you

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.206 position:50% align:center
to fall in love.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.250 position:50% align:center
I mean, with a show that
isn't Rose of Versailles!

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.835 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
We really get to go?

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.213 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO] Yes, we'll see
a few shows every year!

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:30.799 position:50% align:center
It's an important part
of our Kouka education.

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:32.384 position:50% align:center
Prepare to be amazed.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.935 position:50% align:center
[SARASA gasps]

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.146 position:50% align:center
It's just like the theater
I went to in Tokyo

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:09.356 position:50% align:center
when I was little!

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center
The same kind of fancy!

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.193 position:50% align:center
Shh! Zip your lip,
Miss Watanabe!

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry!

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
Um, Watanabe, I feel--

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.991 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hey, you're from JPX.

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.079 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Sei, don't make a scene!

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.247 position:50% align:center
Oh, Sorry 'bout that.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO, SUGIMOTO]
Good afternoon, ma'am!

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50% align:center
[RURI] Are you in the hundredth
class? You're all so cute.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
How's the Phantom doing?

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.008 position:50% align:center
Mr. Andou is well, thank you!

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.219 position:50% align:center
You know he's
an ex-actor, right?

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
So, he's always had a
pretty hard time fitting in

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
with the other teachers.

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:44.933 position:50% align:center
Try to go easy on him, okay?

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
Wowzers, who was
that beautiful lady?

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
You really don't know?

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
That's Sei Satomi,
number two star of

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.027 position:50% align:center
the Winter Troupe!

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, she isn't gonna
perform in today's show.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
I would've given anything
to see her Tybalt.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
Tybalt is double-cast
in this production.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
I forgot, this will be
the final performance

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:10.417 position:50% align:center
of the Winter Troupe's
top star Sou Kazahana.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.002 position:50% align:center
And if Sei isn't
going to play Tybalt

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.712 position:50% align:center
for the remainder
of the show's run,

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
maybe that's because she's
playing somebody else.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center
Which would mean...

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
...Sei is the next top star!

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.428 position:50% align:center
And we just got to see
her right here, in person!

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
Did you just get a nosebleed?

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
Hold on, are you
telling me that I was in

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
the presence of the next top
star of the Winter Troupe?

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.685 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
We were breathing the
same air as an actual star!

[AI] Taichi, what am
I supposed to do?

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:39.362 position:50% align:center
I said something
mean to Watanabe.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.740 position:50% align:center
And I feel awful about it.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
It's all new.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.951 position:50% align:center
I've never been close
enough to a friend

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.786 position:50% align:center
to have a fight before.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.788 position:50% align:center

make up with someone!

They have made
worms' meat of me.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:05:01.676 position:50% align:center

your houses!

Here's to my love!

Then I'll be brief.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center
O happy dagger!

[YAMADA] Ah!
That was so wonderful!

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
I can't stop thinking about
how we'll get to stand

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50% align:center
on that stage in just two years!

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:59.192 position:50% align:center
I know, I'm so freakin' excited!

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:03.697 position:50% align:center
With love's light wings did
I o'er-perch these walls,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.824 position:50% align:center
for stony limits
cannot hold love out,

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.660 position:50% align:center
and what love can do
that dares love attempt.

[SUGIMOTO] Hold on,
those are Romeo's lines.

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI] She hasn't seen
any other show besides

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
Rose of Versailles, right?

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.837 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] She memorized
Romeo after hearing it once?

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] Alack, there lies
more peril in thine eye

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
than 20 of their swords:
look thou but sweet,

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:26.052 position:50% align:center
and I am proof
against their enmity.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
I have night's cloak to
hide me from their sight,

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:31.266 position:50% align:center
and but thou love me,
let them find me here!

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.812 position:50% align:center
[AI] Everyone must have
noticed it in that moment.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.023 position:50% align:center
Without thinking,
they looked up to the sky

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.191 position:50% align:center
and saw themselves there.

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
But did they see what I saw?

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
That amongst the sea
of glimmering stars,

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:46.031 position:50% align:center
one stood out,
shining more brightly

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
than all others?

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
Twinkling high in the sky,
its glow dwarfing the others.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
That star was Sarasa Watanabe.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.547 position:50% align:center
That was where she belonged.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.507 position:50% align:center
And I belonged beside her.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
I want to see the world from
up there with you, please!

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.894 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] Don't spend time
obsessing over what she thinks

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:17.145 position:50% align:center
of you.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50% align:center
Trust me here.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
Instead, face your feelings
so that you can speak them,

openly and honestly,
with words of love.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:26.571 position:50% align:center
I, um, I was hoping...

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
I really do want to be
friends with you, Watanabe!

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Thank goodness.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
You know, I was starting to
worry that this relationship

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.465 position:50% align:center
would be one-sided forever!

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.634 position:50% align:center
But ever since we met,
I knew I wanted

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
nothing more than
to be friends with you!

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.304 position:50% align:center
And now, you've made
me the happiest girl

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:52.597 position:50% align:center
in the universe!

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.353 position:50% align:center

[YAMADA whimpers]

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
Seriously?
Why are you crying, Ayako?

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
I dunno.
I guess... I'm relieved!

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center

or you'll wash us all away.

July arrived.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.868 position:50% align:center
We donned our summer uniforms,

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
and our relationships
changed with them.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
More and more often
we called each other

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.624 position:50% align:center
by first names or nicknames.

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
My personal goal today
is to get over myself

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
and call Sarasa Watanabe
by her first name

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.380 position:50% align:center
like everyone else.

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately for me, that
was easier said than done.

Sa-- Sa--

Oh, hey, what's shakin', Ai?

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
Just wanted you to
know that I'm heading

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
to the bathroom.

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
Sounds good!
Try not to fall in!

[AI]
That's weird.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.898 position:50% align:center
I thought girls always went
to the bathroom together.

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
Isn't that a thing?

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, actually, hold up!

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
--Yes? You're coming with?
--[SARASA] Nah, I'm good!

in the hallway earlier.

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
Wanna go check em out
together when you're done?

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:58.997 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] Sawa's top of
the class, as usual.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.628 position:50% align:center

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
That's why it hurts like that.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
Because your esophagus
goes right up the middle

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:56.081 position:50% align:center
of your back.

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so what?

00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:00.418 position:50% align:center
Losing weight that way won't
make you any prettier, Ayako.

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:04.214 position:50% align:center
Don't say that.

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna hear it.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.883 position:50% align:center
Especially not from
someone who's been pretty

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.259 position:50% align:center
her whole life!

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
I'm sorry!

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
I want my sister.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:30.532 position:50% align:center
[ONODERA] Today, I thought we
would spend our entire class

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:33.952 position:50% align:center
time listening to solos from
every member of the group!

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.662 position:50% align:center
It's always fun to
mix things up a bit,

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:36.913 position:50% align:center
don't you agree?

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:40.875 position:50% align:center
Pick the song you like
best out of the three

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.460 position:50% align:center
I've given you.

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center
Why don't you start
us off, Miss Yamada?

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.468 position:50% align:center
[ONODERA]
Which song will you be singing?

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:59.310 position:50% align:center
Miss Yamada? Are you okay?

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Whoa, Aya!

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Aya, what's wrong?

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.361 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Maybe shake her a little!

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:11.614 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A]
Run of the mill pharyngitis.

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
Your immune system's strong,
responding with a fever.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:17.245 position:50% align:center
You'll need to take it
easy for a few days

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:19.122 position:50% align:center
and get plenty of rest.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
Yes, but, I, um...

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A] Hm.
Hard to talk, too, huh?

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:25.337 position:50% align:center
Rest your voice as
much as you can.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
But I'm a student at Kouka.

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A] Wow! Gonna be
a big star someday, huh?

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:34.846 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] Well, my grades suck,
and I'm this close to failing.

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
I don't want to
miss class. I can't.

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:41.227 position:50% align:center
Don't you understand, sir?
I'll get left behind.

00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
Can't you just give me something
to bring down the fever?

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, no.

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:48.651 position:50% align:center
Can't recommend that.

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
We don't want to make
your throat swell.

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
You won't be able to breathe.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
For now, you just need
to take things easy

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:55.784 position:50% align:center
for a little while.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
[ONODERA]
You go and rest up.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
Focus on getting better, okay?

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
My back really hurts.

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:08.755 position:50% align:center
[phone chimes]

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
[SEIKO] Ayako, I don't
have any special skills,

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
so I can't say I
understand your world.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:51.214 position:50% align:center
But if you're suffering,
or in pain,

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:53.008 position:50% align:center
you can always come home.

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
Seiko.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.477 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] I should go back
to the life I had before.

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.521 position:50% align:center
I knew I was chasing after
dreams that would never

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:07.897 position:50% align:center
come true.

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
But it was nice to get
a little closer to a world

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
where they did.

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
[ONODERA] Miss Yamada?
You're in there, right?

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.366 position:50% align:center
Come out here, I have
to tell you something!

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
What do you think you're
doing, Mr. Onodera?

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
You know only students are
allowed to be in the dorms!

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
It's an emergency--
pretend I'm not here!

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
But men are strictly
forbidden from--

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.670 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm a Kouka girl
on the inside!

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
Listen to me, Miss Yamada.

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
You're a very sweet
and sensitive girl,

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
and I know you're dealing
with a whole lot

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:37.510 position:50% align:center
of pain at the moment!

00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center
But you're still young!

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center
You have so much time
to decide what you want!

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:44.684 position:50% align:center
It's totally normal to lose
faith or struggle sometimes!

00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center
You might be at the bottom
of the class right now,

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
but think about it,
you're still miles ahead

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
of the other 1,095 girls
who didn't get in at all

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.651 position:50% align:center
and would give
anything to be here!

00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
The Kouka Troupe
only opens its doors

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center
to its chosen maidens!

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:59.240 position:50% align:center
And those doors only
open up for them once!

00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:01.117 position:50% align:center
So don't waste this chance.

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
If you walk out now,
you can never go back,

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.996 position:50% align:center
do you hear me?

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.624 position:50% align:center
I don't want you to just quit!
Not yet!

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:12.462 position:50% align:center
Also, I think you're forgetting
something very important.

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:16.549 position:50% align:center
Girls who have nothing to offer
do not get into Kouka!

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.093 position:50% align:center
So, remember for me.

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
What got you in here?

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
What is your gift?

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:23.223 position:50% align:center
My... voice?

00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
You're darn tootin', your voice!

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
You know what I
thought the first time

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
I heard you singing?

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
I thought, for sure
this girl's going to be

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
the next great etoile
of our time!

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:34.109 position:50% align:center
Imagine yourself on stage
during the grand finale

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
of a Kouka show, in the
center of those big stairs,

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
singing acapella and
stunning the entire world!

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
That's you!

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.330 position:50% align:center
Okay then, girls!

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
Today, we're going to
work on our sight--

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:50.333 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I'm so late!

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.627 position:50% align:center
Ah, Miss Yamada,
cleared to sing again?

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:56.047 position:50% align:center
My doctor also gave me
permission to come to class,

00:20:56.131 --> 00:20:57.882 position:50% align:center
so I'm ready to dive in!

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:06.683 position:50% align:center
Well then, why don't
we pick back up

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
where we left off
last you were here?

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:10.353 position:50% align:center
It's solo time!

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
And let's start with
you, Miss Yamada,

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
since you're feeling better!

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
Huh? Oh.

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:16.818 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't sweat it!

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
You can just use mine, Aya!

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:20.488 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Sarasa, I appreciate it!

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:25.452 position:50% align:center
This is the song I sang for
my entrance audition.

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
All right, Miss Yamada,
please step forward.

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50% align:center
[piano playing]

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:37.339 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
If I don't give up,

00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center
will it be like
Mr. Onodera says?

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:41.718 position:50% align:center
Will I stand
centerstage one day,

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center
basking in a huge round of
applause meant just for me?

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:46.514 position:50% align:center
Is that really possible?

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
Nobody can ever
say for sure, but...

00:21:50.852 --> 00:21:52.937 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA singing]

00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:54.397 position:50% align:center
[singing continues]

00:21:57.776 --> 00:21:59.986 position:50% align:center
I didn't know Aya
could sing like this!

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.780 position:50% align:center
Her voice is amazing.

00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:04.824 position:50% align:center
She sounds so pure,
like an angel!

00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:06.409 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
No surprise here.

00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:09.704 position:50% align:center
I knew because we were in
the same group for auditions.

00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:12.165 position:50% align:center
The moment she opened
her mouth to sing,

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:14.292 position:50% align:center
it was like the teachers
snapped out of their dazes

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:15.627 position:50% align:center
to listen.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.253 position:50% align:center
It always annoyed me
how she never appeared

00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:19.881 position:50% align:center
to put forth an effort in class.

00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:22.717 position:50% align:center
[AYAKO singing]

00:22:23.677 --> 00:22:26.304 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] There's one thing I
can say for sure at this point.

00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:31.768 position:50% align:center
If I quit now, that
really will be the end.

00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:38.024 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
Hey, wait up a second!

00:22:39.818 --> 00:22:41.820 position:50% align:center
You were genuinely
worried for me, Ai,

00:22:41.903 --> 00:22:44.364 position:50% align:center
and instead of being grateful,
I snapped at you.

00:22:44.447 --> 00:22:46.074 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:22:46.157 --> 00:22:47.742 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:22:47.826 --> 00:22:49.703 position:50% align:center
The thing is,
I haven't spent much time

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:53.957 position:50% align:center
with other people before,
so I was probably too blunt.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.583 position:50% align:center
They say that I'm a robot,

00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:57.419 position:50% align:center
as if I have no feelings
since they don't show

00:22:57.502 --> 00:22:58.461 position:50% align:center
on my face.

00:22:58.545 --> 00:23:00.130 position:50% align:center
But I don't think
that at all, Ai!

00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:01.423 position:50% align:center
Not you.

00:23:01.506 --> 00:23:04.134 position:50% align:center
I meant basically
everyone else in the world.

00:23:04.217 --> 00:23:05.802 position:50% align:center
But I can't stay like this.

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:07.846 position:50% align:center
Not if I ever want to act.

00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:10.890 position:50% align:center
It does help knowing that
even you worry sometimes.

00:23:10.974 --> 00:23:12.684 position:50% align:center
Which sounds
awful but it's true.

00:23:15.437 --> 00:23:17.605 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, was that rude?

00:23:17.689 --> 00:23:18.982 position:50% align:center
You're good.

00:23:19.065 --> 00:23:21.026 position:50% align:center
Gotta say, I still can't get
over what a beautiful

00:23:21.109 --> 00:23:22.444 position:50% align:center
singing voice you have, Aya!

00:23:22.527 --> 00:23:23.653 position:50% align:center
I sure would love
to be able to sing

00:23:23.737 --> 00:23:26.156 position:50% align:center
super high like that,
but since Lady Oscar

00:23:26.239 --> 00:23:29.200 position:50% align:center
is an otoko-yaku role,
soprano's out for me.

00:23:29.284 --> 00:23:32.495 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] Have you always wanted
to play Lady Oscar, Sarasa?

00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:34.539 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, ever
since I was a kid!

00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:36.249 position:50% align:center
Oh, although,

00:23:36.332 --> 00:23:37.751 position:50% align:center
