Ah!

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
The dorm mother's box lunches
always look super yummy!

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.021 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:24.024 position:50% align:center
That's weird, 'cause it looks
depressingly average to me.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
I'm with you.
I mean, it's mostly brown.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.402 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
I wish it had some
cute stuff in it, at least.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:32.282 position:50% align:center
Food just tastes better
when it's made

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center
especially for you! Right?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.246 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO] Huh. I guess Miss
Narata isn't here, either.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Ai-Ai? Where'd she go?

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:23.893 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Hey there.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.521 position:50% align:center
Be careful not to let the
second-years see you out here,

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.690 position:50% align:center
they'll give you grief
for eating alone.

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:31.901 position:50% align:center
I don't like eating in there,
that tiny locker room.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.529 position:50% align:center
And making small talk with
everyone is like torture.

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:36.322 position:50% align:center
And what about your
roommate, Sarasa?

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:37.949 position:50% align:center
She seems pretty cool.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:39.909 position:50% align:center
I mean, she seems fun, at least.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.620 position:50% align:center
No way. She's not "fun" at all!

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:45.582 position:50% align:center
She's loud, she doesn't listen,
and she couldn't read a room

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.792 position:50% align:center
if her life depended on it.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:48.960 position:50% align:center
Rolls off the bed.

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
Has never gotten up on time.

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.006 position:50% align:center
God, I wish I
could switch rooms.

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.090 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.927 position:50% align:center
I think you're changing
a bit for the better!

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:01.264 position:50% align:center
Since when do you notice
so many little details?

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.433 position:50% align:center
I'm not doing it on purpose!

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.934 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50% align:center
She just keeps forcing her
weird self all up in my life.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:08.772 position:50% align:center
It's annoying.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.148 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.275 position:50% align:center
To tell you the truth,
it kinda seems like you can't

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
take your mind off of her.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:16.613 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Ha!

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center
You don't get it, Taichi.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.870 position:50% align:center
You just have no idea how
annoying she can be!

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:26.498 position:50% align:center
Doesn't seem like she's
a bad person, though.

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.957 position:50% align:center
I hope you two can be friends.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.670 position:50% align:center
Why? I don't need friends.

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.797 position:50% align:center
If I want to talk,
I'll talk to you.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50% align:center
There's no way I could
ever be friends with her.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.260 position:50% align:center
Oh, Ai, there you are!

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
Where'd you disappear to, huh?

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.180 position:50% align:center
Nowhere.

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] I thought you
were in the bathroom,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center
but you were gone so long!

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.643 position:50% align:center
Uh, what's going on,
are you okay?

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait!
Have you had lunch yet?

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
Yes, I ate.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] I'm always worried
about you not eating enough!

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
It's a real thing with you.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Keep your worry to yourself.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
Well, don't say that!

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.613 position:50% align:center
I mean, come on,
we're friends, aren't we?

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
I am not your friend.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
[KITAOUJI] If I wait here a
while, maybe I'll see her.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50% align:center
But you can't mean that
'cause we're roommates

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
and roommates are tight!

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
I want to be your friend!
It's important to me!

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
Listen, I don't really want
to be friends with anyone.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
I learned this the
hard way early on.

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:40.238 position:50% align:center
Dealing with people is annoying
and a waste of my time.

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:41.281 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
But wait!

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
Quiet, girls!

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.367 position:50% align:center
Please keep it
down in the halls.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:47.370 position:50% align:center
Are you coming?

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I don't need friends.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:53.084 position:50% align:center
That's not why I'm here.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to be as far away
as possible from the world

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
of men.

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.256 position:50% align:center
That's all I need.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
I grew up assuming phrases
like "well, aren't you pretty!"

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
and "what a cutie!" were just
another way of saying "hello."

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
Well!

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
You just keep getting prettier
all the time, don't you, dear?

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:14.606 position:50% align:center
Isn't that the truth!

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
You're like a
perfect little doll!

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
[AUNT A]
And what a big teddy bear!

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.236 position:50% align:center
Yes, my daddy bought it for me!

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.614 position:50% align:center
[AUNT B]
Oh, did he, now?

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
[AI]
No.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.784 position:50% align:center
That's just what Mom said
when she gave it to me.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50% align:center
So it's probably a lie.

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
So, who is your daddy, my dear?

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea?

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:32.374 position:50% align:center
No, I don't.

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:34.668 position:50% align:center
[AI]
That part's true.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
My mom is the famous film
actress Kimiko Narata.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
Look at them fawning
over your little munchkin.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.051 position:50% align:center
[AI] My uncle Taichi
is a ballet dancer.

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:44.552 position:50% align:center
It's not her.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
They're just putting on an
act so they can figure out

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
who her father is,
the damn vultures.

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
Can't say I don't
wonder the same.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center
You know the old
man in Hachioji?

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.109 position:50% align:center
According to him,
"the Narata Siblings are sluts

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
that have probably slept
with every man in the city."

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do think he's the
best bear I've ever seen

[BOY A]
Hey, Ai!

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.576 position:50% align:center
Wanna guess what?

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.413 position:50% align:center
I saw your mom's titties
on TV last night!

[GIRL A] You better start
being nice to Ai, you guys!

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.424 position:50% align:center
It's fine. I don't care.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
I really don't.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:26.928 position:50% align:center
I know that my mom
works super hard.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
I'm not ashamed of her at all
because she makes me feel

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.557 position:50% align:center
so proud.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Another lie.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
I've never even seen
any of my mom's movies.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
But she did make
two things very clear.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.901 position:50% align:center
That I'm the reason
she worked so hard,

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:44.779 position:50% align:center
and that sometimes cute
girls have to tough it out.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.199 position:50% align:center
It happened after I'd
already gotten way bigger

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.534 position:50% align:center
than Papa Bear.

Here, Seiji.

This is my daughter.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.917 position:50% align:center
Ai, Seiji might be your
new daddy someday!

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.671 position:50% align:center
Well, hey there, little one.

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.089 position:50% align:center
Real nice to meet you.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
It's very nice to meet you, too.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
Seiji is such a nice guy.

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
You'll see for yourself, honey.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.810 position:50% align:center
He's gonna live with
us from now on!

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
[AI]
And that was it.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.274 position:50% align:center
My mom never told me
where she met him,

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:25.987 position:50% align:center
or what he did for a living,
or anything else about him.

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50% align:center
But that was
nothing new, really.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
She always kept me in the dark.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.251 position:50% align:center
Almost got it.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.837 position:50% align:center
There!

I can see your undies, you know.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
Such a cutie, sweet little Ai.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
[AI] His smile made my stomach
turn, but I wasn't sure why.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.939 position:50% align:center
It had to be my imagination.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
I mean, my mom picked him
out, so he couldn't be bad.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.404 position:50% align:center
And he never yelled,
or even got mad at me.

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:12.409 position:50% align:center
So, when he waited outside the
door as I got out of the bath,

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
or stopped in front of my
bedroom when he walked

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:17.664 position:50% align:center
down the hall, it had
to be a coincidence.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50% align:center
My mom's smart.

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
All grown-ups are.

Adults know everything, right?

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:28.758 position:50% align:center

Ai!

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.019 position:50% align:center

Well, I'll see you two a week!

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50% align:center
Shooting on location.

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:42.772 position:50% align:center
Be a good girl for Seiji, okay?

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.399 position:50% align:center
I will.
Have a good shoot, Mom.

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
And, uh, come home as
soon as you can, 'kay?

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.530 position:50% align:center
Oh, c'mon!

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
You're too old for
this baby nonsense, Ai,

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
you know better than that.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
Now I want you to promise
you'll be good for Seiji.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.247 position:50% align:center
Yes. But Mom...

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center
[KIMIKO]
Please, Ai, that's enough.

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
You do know I'm working myself
