[AI] The Kouka School's Culture
Festival is less of a festival

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.312 position:50% align:center
and more of a graduation show.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.232 position:50% align:center
Its purpose is to give the
second-years an opportunity

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.192 position:50% align:center
to show off everything they've
learned during the time

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.737 position:50% align:center
they've spent at Kouka.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.988 position:50% align:center
Or so I'm told.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.240 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Did you hear the latest?

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
Apparently, the first-years
are going to be given

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
some extra time during our show!

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
Right. I heard they're actually
gonna act out a whole scene.

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:42.167 position:50% align:center
Seriously?
Who'd you hear that from?

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.543 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI]
Well, you know what I think?

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
Their silly little skit
shouldn't be allowed

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.463 position:50% align:center
to ruin our night.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.215 position:50% align:center
So, I would suggest you
tell the teachers just that.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.967 position:50% align:center
It's only a rumor at this point.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:55.889 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
Don't look at me like that.

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:58.767 position:50% align:center
Please open your
books to page 58.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.018 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS groan]

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.313 position:50% align:center
Okay. I guess you win.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.731 position:50% align:center
Yes, the rumors are true.

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:06.608 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS cheer]

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.902 position:50% align:center
First day of the festival,
the first-year class

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:11.321 position:50% align:center
will have 15 minutes
of stage time:

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:14.282 position:50% align:center
a 10-minute scene, and a
five-minute choral performance.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.285 position:50% align:center
But as I'm sure
you've figured out,

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.412 position:50% align:center
not everyone gets
to participate.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.998 position:50% align:center
Ten minutes simply
doesn't give us enough time.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.460 position:50% align:center
So, what we'll do is
choose four students

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.504 position:50% align:center
out of the 40 of you.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.130 position:50% align:center
The scene will be from
the show we studied

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:31.758 position:50% align:center
over summer, Romeo and Juliet.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:35.804 position:50% align:center
Same roles: Romeo, Juliet,
Tybalt, and Juliet's Nurse.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.889 position:50% align:center
Will you be the one who
will select the performers

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:39.349 position:50% align:center
for this, Mr. Andou?

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.478 position:50% align:center
We'll be holding auditions.

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:47.565 position:50% align:center
You have one week to decide
who you want to audition for.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.235 position:50% align:center
Then, you'll prepare
for it on your own.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.237 position:50% align:center
Auditions are in two weeks.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.073 position:50% align:center
Casting will be up to you,
with roles determined

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:57.158 position:50% align:center
by a class vote.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.952 position:50% align:center
You can vote for whoever
you think is best,

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:00.495 position:50% align:center
as long as it's not yourself.

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:03.456 position:50% align:center
And no hard feelings since
you're all getting a say.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.624 position:50% align:center
Now then!

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:06.167 position:50% align:center
Open your textbooks!

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] So, are you guys all
gonna do the same roles

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
as before?

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center
Not me! I'm gonna go
for Juliet this time!

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.642 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] I assume you'll
want Romeo, Sawa?

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
Well... I mean, yes,
I played it before,

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.273 position:50% align:center
but Sei Satomi's Tybalt makes
me want to try that role, so...

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
Wow.
And you're not sweating.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.027 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
I am, actually!

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center
Well, I know that I'm going
for Romeo again.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50% align:center
This audition could be a real
foot in the door for me.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
Really? You think?

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
Sure do.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.579 position:50% align:center
After this, every future casting
decision will be made

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
for us by the higher-ups.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.166 position:50% align:center
So, I'm planning to give
the performance of my life

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.420 position:50% align:center
so nobody watching that
day will ever forget me.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:14.671 position:50% align:center
I'm aiming for the top,

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.298 position:50% align:center
and the quicker I can
get there, the better.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
I have no desire to be part
of the stupid ensemble!

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna make it!

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.640 position:50% align:center
Good for you. I'm not that great
at anything other than singing.

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
Aya! Thoughts like that
are exactly why

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50% align:center
timid actresses like
you don't succeed!

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.522 position:50% align:center
That was way harsh, Kaoru.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
It really was!

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center
Not everyone feels the need to
aim for top billing, you know!

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.362 position:50% align:center
Yeah, not everyone
is just like you!

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.239 position:50% align:center
But we'll never be
at the bottom either!

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:45.285 position:50% align:center
Thanks for assuming I didn't
wanna aim for the top, guys!

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you getting
out already, Sarasa?

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Yeah.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:52.459 position:50% align:center
Let's be real, my goal is to
play Lady Oscar someday.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
I don't have time to be
lounging around in the bath

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.338 position:50% align:center
with you plebeians.

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.797 position:50% align:center
Later, nerds.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
I talked a big game back there.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:05.972 position:50% align:center
But I still don't know which
role I wanna audition for.

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.183 position:50% align:center
Should I go for Romeo or Tybalt?

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
I'd be surprised if everyone
didn't already have

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
a negative opinion of my
Tybalt after what Mr. Andou

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:15.940 position:50% align:center
said about it.

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
And I guess my brain
likes to torture me,

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center
'cause Sei Satomi's Tybalt is
still the one stuck in my head.

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:22.572 position:50% align:center
It's like I can't escape it.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.282 position:50% align:center
But I don't think I
should go after a role

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:27.452 position:50% align:center
just 'cause it's what I'm
likely to get, you know?

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50% align:center
Honestly, this summer, when
I watched you rehearsing,

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
I thought that you should
be playing Romeo.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Hm? You thought that?

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.045 position:50% align:center
Are you surprised?

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.464 position:50% align:center
Romeo is all warmth and
brightness, like the sun.

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:42.300 position:50% align:center
It's clear everything he does
is out of love for Juliet.

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
He's a straightforward
kind of guy.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.889 position:50% align:center
And then, on the other hand,

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
Tybalt is this complex,
twisted-up character.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
He hides his feelings.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.145 position:50% align:center
And keeps them all locked away.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.855 position:50% align:center
Wait. Does that mean...

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50% align:center
You're saying that I'm
simple or something?

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.360 position:50% align:center
Forget about that for a sec.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.195 position:50% align:center
Hoshino was right, you know.

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:05.156 position:50% align:center
This could be your
foot in the door.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
Not to mention...

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50% align:center
Selfishly, I really just want
to see your Romeo.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Did I creep her out?

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.755 position:50% align:center
You always know
just what to say, Ai!

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.096 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI] So then, if the
rumor is true, tell me.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50% align:center
Well? Are you going for
Juliet or aren't you?

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:32.559 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.769 position:50% align:center
I have a hard time
smiling, so...

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
Maybe the nurse. We'll see.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI] What the hell?
Are you stupid or what?

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:40.984 position:50% align:center
I mean, c'mon!

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
Out of all the randos
in the hundredth class,

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
of course the girl the
audience is dying to see

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50% align:center
is the one and only
Ai Narata from JPX.

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
And you want to play the nurse?

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
Are you actually trying to
give them an aneurysm?

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.625 position:50% align:center
Unacceptable.
You will read for Juliet.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
Okay, but it's not like I've
done anything to earn it.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, you can
develop the talent

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.925 position:50% align:center
to "earn" it later on.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
But the fact is,
you were born pretty,

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
and that gives you an advantage.

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
So, even if you don't have
the talent to deserve it,

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
you're still starting closer
to the finish line

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:18.480 position:50% align:center
than anyone else who's
currently in the running.

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
You just need to run
as fast as you can

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.858 position:50% align:center
and you'll finish in first.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
Oh, and you missed a spot.

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.448 position:50% align:center
My word!

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:29.866 position:50% align:center
These first-years
are more stressed out

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.993 position:50% align:center
than I've ever seen them,
and you know that's saying

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.536 position:50% align:center
an awful lot!

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.206 position:50% align:center
Poor kids, they must have
serious audition jitters.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50% align:center
There's a time and
place for teamwork,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.002 position:50% align:center
but it's good to stoke
those competitive flames

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
once in a while.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
You'd best keep an eye
on those girls, though.

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:45.674 position:50% align:center
When they get all worked up,

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.634 position:50% align:center
they can be
ruthless competitors.

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.219 position:50% align:center
They can also get
caught up in the mire

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.637 position:50% align:center
of their own jealousy.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
Be careful of that, too.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.391 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:57.852 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
'Kay, I gotta ask.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.313 position:50% align:center
Do you know which role
you're gonna go for yet?

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Not yet.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzing]

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:09.364 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, Akiya!
What's up with you?

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA]
Well, I saw your tweet.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
You sounded pretty stressed
out about your audition.

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:15.662 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Yeah.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.248 position:50% align:center
I just can't figure out if I
should pick Romeo or Tybalt.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
You should audition for
whichever role you would

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.960 position:50% align:center
regret not trying out for later.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.671 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] Then I guess I
should probably do Romeo.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
Wait. Lemme say
that a different way.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:30.093 position:50% align:center
You should prep for the role
you want to play, Sarasa.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
Aww, c'mon!

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
That's not helpful--
that's the whole reason

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
I'm struggling here!

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
Just think about it.

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
Someone says you should do
Romeo and you're still not sure.

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
Doesn't that mean that
what you actually want

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
is the other role?

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI] Even if you don't have
the talent to deserve it,

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center
you just need to run
as fast as you can

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
and you'll finish in first.

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:13.178 position:50% align:center
[AI] When Hijiri told me to
"run fast and finish first,"

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
I know what she meant.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
"If you want to be a top star,

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center
you need to work
as hard as you can."

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.616 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.206 position:50% align:center
Tackling him again!

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
Here's to us both
breaking a leg.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.213 position:50% align:center
No handshakes.

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
One of the most beautiful
things about Kouka

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
is the team spirit that
each troupe embodies.

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.805 position:50% align:center
That being the case,
as our class representative,

00:09:56.888 --> 00:10:00.141 position:50% align:center
I always strive to remain calm,
supportive, and impartial.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
But we're talking
about auditions now,

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.145 position:50% align:center
and you are my rival.

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
So there will be no handshake.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
Wow. Sawa isn't messing around.

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:11.027 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] Cool, then I'm gonna
come at you with everything

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
I got!

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50% align:center
What did I literally just
say about handshakes?

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.283 position:50% align:center
[AI] After that, my first order
of business was to add

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
the kanji readings for
everything in the script.

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
You. Romeo. Hey, Romeo.

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
What's happening with your eyes?

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.084 position:50% align:center
[SARASA sighs]
I don't know.

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
I thought it'd help me
get into character.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center
How do you feel?

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50% align:center
Think you'll do him justice?

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
I dunno, maybe if you could
listen to what I'm thinking

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center
so far, that would help,
'cause I have no idea.

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Sure, go ahead.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] Romeo, the hate
I bear thee can afford.

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:49.566 position:50% align:center
No better term than this--
thou art a villain.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
That's my Basic Tybalt.

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.361 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Mm-- Mm-hmm.

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:55.947 position:50% align:center
What? In my palm,
is this a rose?

00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center
By god, I daresay 'tis
the red of lifeblood spilt

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
from my chest!

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
With that, a curse
upon you, Montague!

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.957 position:50% align:center
And that would be
my Egotistical Tybalt.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.169 position:50% align:center
Oh, Juliet!

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
The star that shines so bright
in my dark sky, forever more!

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
For no matter how far I may fly,

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:17.677 position:50% align:center
I will never reach the
comfort of your side!

00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
So, yeah, that's Smart Tybalt.

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
Let's see, what else--

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
I don't think you're allowed
to make up lines, though.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:26.019 position:50% align:center
But it seems like,
if I want to be original,

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50% align:center
I have to tweak them
at least a little bit!

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but if you make
it too different,

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
it'll just be overkill.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:37.822 position:50% align:center
What matters is losing
yourself in the role.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
Relax.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
Who you are makes
it plenty unique.

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
Ah!
A golden nugget of wisdom!

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:47.207 position:50% align:center
[AI] I can't take credit.
I got it from someone else.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
Oh, my gosh, what the heck
is with this actress?

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:50.919 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:52.796 position:50% align:center
She's all "look at me,
look at me!"

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
with no actual investment
in the character.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
First, you have to understand
the role you're playing

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.302 position:50% align:center
and then you have to
figure out how to let your

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:01.388 position:50% align:center
authentic self loose inside it.

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
Really? Wow, Mommy.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.016 position:50% align:center
You'd better believe it, Ai.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.936 position:50% align:center
Actors like her don't last
long in our line of work.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50% align:center
So, here's a question.

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
A typical morning.

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.778 position:50% align:center
What does that
look like for him?

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:19.030 position:50% align:center
If you can mine the script for
clues as to what his day

00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:22.826 position:50% align:center
is like, that'll give you
an idea who he is.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
You know, now that you say that,

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50% align:center
I seem to remember Mr. Andou
mentioning something like that

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.957 position:50% align:center
in class once before.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.917 position:50% align:center
--[AI] Here's another question.
--Okay!

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.919 position:50% align:center
[AI] What do you imagine
Tybalt might think about

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:34.462 position:50% align:center
when he's dying?

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
That's the sort of thing that
shows them your unique take

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
on Tybalt, if you can express
that without changing any

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:40.760 position:50% align:center
of his lines.

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
Sounds like I have some
things to think over.

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
Awesome.
Thanks so much for the tips, Ai!

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
So, where'd you learn
all this stuff, anyway?

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.357 position:50% align:center
Was it from someone in JPX?

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
From an actress.

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:03.533 position:50% align:center
Romeo and Juliet, written
more than 400 years ago

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.827 position:50% align:center
by William Shakespeare,
is without a doubt

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center
one of the most famous
tragedies of all time.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.416 position:50% align:center
The story takes place
in 14th century Italy,

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:13.335 position:50% align:center
in the town of Verona.

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.587 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] The Montague
family's only son, Romeo,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
falls in love with the only
daughter of the Capulet family,

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
Juliet.

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
They secretly marry, and
though they try to evade

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.429 position:50% align:center
the forces pulling them apart...

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
...their tragic tale ends
with them bound together

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.934 position:50% align:center
only in death, their lives
cut far too short.

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center
Tybalt harbors an unrequited
love for his young cousin,

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
fair Juliet.

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
When he kills Romeo's friend
Mercutio in the town square,

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:40.987 position:50% align:center
Romeo murders him in a rage.

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
Thou wretched boy, Romeo!

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
The pain, and stuff.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.830 position:50% align:center
I'm like, dying now.

00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:52.540 position:50% align:center
Hey! Are you okay?

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:55.794 position:50% align:center
Oh, my gosh! Low blood sugar?

00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:58.004 position:50% align:center
What hurts? Can you breathe?

00:13:58.088 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] The sky Tybalt
saw in his final moments,

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
it was so beautiful.

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
What sky?

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
In a world that's filled
with this much beauty,

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
why was Tybalt so obsessed
with his anger and hatred?

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
I still can't figure that out.

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:12.519 position:50% align:center
Stop messing around and clean!

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
Sorry!

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] Yay! Our big
auditions are tomorrow!

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.278 position:50% align:center
Somebody talk to me!

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Maybe you were right.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
It probably would have been
easier if I'd just gone

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:28.868 position:50% align:center
with Romeo.

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
The auditions are tomorrow,
and I still don't feel

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
like I've gotten any
closer to understanding

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
what might be going
through Tybalt's mind

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
when he dies.

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:38.211 position:50% align:center
In fact, come to think of it,
I've never really hated

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
anyone for real, or had a big
grudge against anyone, either.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.717 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.926 position:50% align:center
Great question.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
My mother's the one who
opened the door for me

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.763 position:50% align:center
to enter the kabuki
world, actually.

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:49.806 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.307 position:50% align:center
Shirakawa.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
...so there were plenty of times
I didn't want to be there,

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.812 position:50% align:center
but now it's my whole life.

[clock chimes]

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:04.154 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA]
I better get going.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:06.239 position:50% align:center
Is it another kabuki lesson?

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.991 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA]
Yeah. See you later!

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:11.995 position:50% align:center
It's not fair, Grandpa Ken.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
Akiya went to class
and left me here.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:16.041 position:50% align:center
That right?

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:19.419 position:50% align:center
I hope Akiya falls and gets
hurt, 'cause he deserves it.

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:20.879 position:50% align:center
No, Sarasa!

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center
I know you're disappointed,
but do not say that, ever!

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.051 position:50% align:center
If that's the kind of nastiness
you wish on others,

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:27.927 position:50% align:center
it'll come right back to you!

00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:30.305 position:50% align:center
But I didn't mean it!

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:31.848 position:50% align:center
I promise I didn't!

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.309 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean it for real!

[crying]

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
I remember now.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
I was so jealous of Akiya
because he got to be

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
what I couldn't, and that seemed
so monstrously unfair.

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:47.572 position:50% align:center
So, for a split-second,
I hoped he'd get hurt

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:50.700 position:50% align:center
so he'd never be able
to do kabuki again.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
I wanted something
I could never have.

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
And then Romeo took it
without a second thought.

00:15:58.375 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Good morning!

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
Thank you for having us!

00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:04.756 position:50% align:center
Good morning!
Welcome in, first-years.

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:10.595 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] Wait, other teachers
are going to be judging us, too?

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:12.555 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] It's so mean
that he didn't tell us.

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
All right, come up
when I call your name.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.062 position:50% align:center
The four of you will then
go through the scene.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:20.689 position:50% align:center
Once you've done that,
we'll have each of you sing

00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:22.023 position:50% align:center
a verse of the song.

00:16:22.107 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center
And if you weren't aware,
the rest of us each

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:26.361 position:50% align:center
get a vote, too.
So, break a leg!

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
All righty, then,
how 'bout we get started?

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:34.160 position:50% align:center
First group. Romeo, Manami Ueda.

00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
Uh, here!

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:37.205 position:50% align:center
Juliet, Ai Narata.

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:38.498 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:41.334 position:50% align:center
Don't worry! You've got this!

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:43.712 position:50% align:center
[UEDA] Two of the fairest
stars in all the heaven,

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.338 position:50% align:center
having some business,

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
do entreat her eyes
to shine, to uh--

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
To twinkle--

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:55.849 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry, can I please
try that one more time?

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
Go ahead. Just take it
from the top, please.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
This pressure is bananas.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Ai seems completely unaffected.

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
Guess I'm not surprised.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
[AI] It's not that this comes
easy to me or anything.

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.030 position:50% align:center
I've just had practice.

00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:12.240 position:50% align:center
When I was an idol,
I learned to ignore being

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.242 position:50% align:center
the center of attention.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.536 position:50% align:center
But even despite
that, sometimes,

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.705 position:50% align:center
when I was on bigger stages,

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:21.916 position:50% align:center
the nerves and pressure
really did start to get to me.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.545 position:50% align:center
And let's be real, they're
getting to me now, too.

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
Because I still have no
freaking idea what love

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:29.716 position:50% align:center
is supposed to feel like.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.885 position:50% align:center
You have to understand
the role you're playing

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
and be able to lose
yourself in that role.

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
I went and said that to
Sarasa with a straight face

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:40.393 position:50% align:center
and now it's coming back
to bite me in the butt.

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
I don't see myself
anywhere in this role.

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center
Two of the fairest stars
in all the heaven,

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
having some business,
do entreat her eyes to twinkle

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:50.862 position:50% align:center
in their spheres
till they return.

[AI]
After Romeo's soliloquy ends,

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
it's Juliet's turn to speak.

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.118 position:50% align:center
Love. What is love?

00:17:57.202 --> 00:18:00.288 position:50% align:center
Is it just me or are her
eyes totally glazing over?

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:01.998 position:50% align:center
Look, she's not even blinking.

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:04.542 position:50% align:center
You think? She looks the same
as she always does to me.

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:05.919 position:50% align:center
She's not.

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
Ai-Ai might be kinda bad
at expressing her feelings

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
on the outside,
but on the inside,

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
I think they're always running
at least 100 miles an hour.

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
[AI]
So, one day, out of nowhere,

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
Juliet fell head
over heels in love.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:20.100 position:50% align:center
It was love at
first sight, right?

00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
Does that mean she fell in love
with him 'cause he was hot?

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
I mean, is that how it works?

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
Can people be soulmates
based on that?

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50% align:center
It couldn't have just
been his looks.

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:31.820 position:50% align:center
There's gotta be
a better reason.

00:18:31.903 --> 00:18:33.154 position:50% align:center
A good vibe?

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
Like Romeo's aura or something?

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.200 position:50% align:center
Can you see someone's
aura if you love them?

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
Did she have ESP?

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.578 position:50% align:center
Is love science fiction?

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
I have to think fast!

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
At the very least,
I need to say the lines.

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:50.547 position:50% align:center
No, I can't give up now!

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
If I stumble here, I won't be
able to climb up to the top.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
[UEDA]
O, speak again, bright angel!

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center
For thou art as
glorious to this night--

00:18:57.178 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
[AI] And Romeo's soliloquy
is almost over!

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:01.558 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
She really was here!

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
Found you!

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:06.855 position:50% align:center
But I'll still help you out, Ai.

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
Just this once.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
I think even if you can't forget
something that happened,

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
you can make new
memories by having fun.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
And being passionate about
the things you love, I guess.

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
Just keep overwriting the bad
memories with good ones,

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
and eventually,
the bad will fade away.

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
At least, you would hope.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.377 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] I have night's cloak
to hide me from their sight!

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center
And but thou love me,
let them find me here!

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
I really do want to be
friends with you, Watanabe!

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.559 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
But ever since we met, I knew
I wanted nothing more

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
than to be friends with you!

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:51.649 position:50% align:center
And now, you've made me the
happiest girl in the universe!

00:19:57.489 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
Romeo! Wherefore art
thou, Romeo?

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:04.579 position:50% align:center
Deny thy father and
refuse thy name,

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
and I'll no longer be a Capulet.

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
I still don't know what love is.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
Maybe one day, I will.

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
I might lack confidence
in myself right now.

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:21.262 position:50% align:center
But one thing I know.

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:23.431 position:50% align:center
The moment we met
in the fluttering petals

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
beneath the cherry tree is
something I'll never forget.

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
It will guide me like
a beacon in the dark.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.567 position:50% align:center
Until together,
we cross the silver bridge.

00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
And if I want to do that,
I can't give up.

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
Not now, not ever.

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:42.784 position:50% align:center
That which we call a rose
by any other name

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.828 position:50% align:center
would smell as sweet.

00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:46.579 position:50% align:center
Romeo.

00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
Retain that dear perfection
without that title.

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50% align:center
Doff thy name,
and take all myself.

00:20:57.674 --> 00:20:59.259 position:50% align:center
Thanks, everyone.

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
Let's break for five
minutes before we start

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:02.429 position:50% align:center
with our next group.

00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
You were so good, Naracchi!

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.058 position:50% align:center
You totally gave me goosebumps.
I'm not even kidding!

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
That was incredible!

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.439 position:50% align:center
I mean, I don't know
what you did to shed

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:13.690 position:50% align:center
those beautiful tears,

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center
but are you freakin'
kidding me with that?!

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:17.777 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
Hi there! Welcome back!

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
Thanks. Glad to be back.

00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:28.371 position:50% align:center
This is bad.

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
The first Juliet did
such an amazing job.

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:34.627 position:50% align:center
Maybe... I'm not cut
out for Juliet after all.

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:38.423 position:50% align:center
You're really still
doing that, Aya?

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:40.800 position:50% align:center
You have got to stop whining.

00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:42.218 position:50% align:center
Believe me, this late
in the game,

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
we're all thinking it.

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:47.098 position:50% align:center
It's just that the
others won't say it!

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
But that's fine, if they
wanna leave it to me,

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:51.102 position:50% align:center
I'll happily oblige.

00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:53.188 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Kaoru.

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:54.898 position:50% align:center
Okay, next group.

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
Romeo, Hitomi Konno.

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:58.234 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:00.236 position:50% align:center

Juliet, Ayako Yamada.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.696 position:50% align:center

[ANDOU]
Tybalt, Sawa Sugimoto.

00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:04.783 position:50% align:center
Here!

[ANDOU]
Juliet's Nurse, Keito Mochida.

00:22:06.785 --> 00:22:07.952 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:14.751 position:50% align:center
All right, you two.

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:16.878 position:50% align:center
Break a leg. You've got this.
