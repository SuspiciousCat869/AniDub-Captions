WEBVTT

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.375
You got this.

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:24.417
[YAMADA] I didn't think I could
pull off the Nurse because of

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.583
the amount of lines
she has in this scene.

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:29.625
And everyone was
auditioning for Juliet,

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:33.083
so I figured I could kind
of get lost in the crowd.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.959
Turns out, that's not
how it works.

00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:13.750
Juliet's the popular girl, so
the complete opposite of me.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:16.083
Plus, I've been in love
lots of times before,

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.083
whereas this is her first.

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:23.166
My first crush was on
an anime character.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.500
The next one took it
from 2-D to 2.5-D.

00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:28.667
Then finally...

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.125
...I graduated to 3-D.

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.375
[HIRAYAMA]
Morning, Ayako!

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:38.000
[YAMADA]
Good morning, Hirayama.

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.875
Oh, wow, something
smells good in there.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.959
[YAMADA]
Yeah, that's right! Here.

00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:44.500
You're always gushing
about how much you love

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:46.667
my family's bakery,
so Mom said I should

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.875
bring you a few treats.
Please enjoy!

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.083
Awesome! You're the best!

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:52.750
Fresh from the oven!

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:54.291
Can I have one right now?

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:55.333
Sure.

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:02.667
[FRIEND A] You know what?
If I were a guy,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.166
I'd totally wanna go out with
a sweet girl like you, Ayako.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.166
Thanks for that?

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.709
Oh, my gosh, check it out.

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:13.750
[FRIEND B] Wow, Asuka Yano's
got another new boyfriend?

00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:15.375
[YAMADA] I thought she was
dating that second-year

00:03:15.458 --> 00:03:17.041
in the school rock band.

00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:19.250
Apparently, the band
broke up after Asuka

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:21.625
managed to date
every single guy in it.

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.000
Yeah?

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:24.917
I don't get why guys
like her so much.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.750
She's not even that hot.

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:28.875
[FRIEND C] Maybe 'cause she's
thin and has huge tits?

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.750
[FRIEND A] Or 'cause she'll
date anyone with a pulse?

00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:31.834
[YAMADA]
Cut it out, you guys!

00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:33.166
Come on, she might hear you!

00:03:34.917 --> 00:03:36.917
[FRIEND C] Hey, Ayako,
earlier, were you hanging out

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.417
with Hirayama again?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.792
[YAMADA]
Oh, yeah.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:42.500
Wow, you two sure have
gotten close, haven't you?

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:45.959
Listen, he's even talking
about you right now.

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:48.834
Seriously, Ayako's
bakery is amazing.

00:03:48.917 --> 00:03:51.792
[YAMADA] No, he's just talking
about my family's bakery.

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:55.083
Gimme a break.
He's totally into you.

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:56.417
[YAMADA]
C'mon, no way.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.208
Aw, you guys would make
the perfect couple!

00:03:58.291 --> 00:03:59.792
You're both super nice!

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:02.458
[YAMADA laughs]
Oh, stop it, don't be silly!

00:04:05.417 --> 00:04:08.375
[STUDENT A] Dude, he asked
Asuka Yano out and she said no!

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:10.792
[STUDENT C]
Hirayama did? That's so random!

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.208
[STUDENT D] And Asuka
dates literally anyone.

00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:15.000
[STUDENT B] Yikes.
What's his deal if even Asuka

00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:16.458
turns him down?

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.375
Rain was in the forecast,
so I came prepared.

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:32.709
Let's go.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.792
Asuka always looked
so cool and aloof.

00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:40.417
I figured I'd never know what
was going on in her head.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.875
I was convinced.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:45.583
But then, one day, I saw her
smiling down at her phone,

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:48.417
and when I looked
at it, turns out,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.041
she was watching
cute animal videos.

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:55.959
I was like, "Wow, she's such a
sweet girl on the inside."

00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:57.959
It kinda made me
want to protect her.

00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:02.542
It's fine;
I'm an idiot, aren't I?

00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:04.041
[YAMADA]
No, I get it.

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:06.667
Being turned down has to hurt.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.083
[HIRAYAMA]
Man, Ayako.

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:09.750
You're so nice.

00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:11.542
I feel better just
being around you.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.000
Hey, do you think...

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.583
I mean, could we be...

00:05:22.542 --> 00:05:23.834
...friends forever?

00:05:25.834 --> 00:05:27.125
[YAMADA]
I should have known.

00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:30.417
Reality will never exceed
my expectations.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.917
That's just my life.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:35.417
Romeo and Juliet get together
because they fall in love

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.041
at first sight.

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:39.417
The question is,
how can someone like me

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.917
act that out convincingly?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.750
Hey, Sawa, I was thinking,
we may end up

00:05:44.834 --> 00:05:46.875
in the same group
for auditions, and um...

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.792
I'd like to apologize in
advance if I mess it up.

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:53.000
So I'd better go warn
everyone else, too.

00:05:53.083 --> 00:05:54.375
[SUGIMOTO]
They don't need your warning.

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:56.709
Why do that?

00:05:56.792 --> 00:05:58.125
You're trying to
cover your bases,

00:05:58.208 --> 00:06:00.792
but I don't get who
you're doing it for.

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:03.458
For them, this is
a group audition.

00:06:03.542 --> 00:06:04.542
That means if I mess up,

00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:07.041
then it's going
to affect everyone.

00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:09.083
It's just I've never been
someone who's able

00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:11.041
to surpass my own hopes.

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:14.500
So now, since I miraculously
got accepted here,

00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:17.375
it's like I'm always just
barely scraping by.

00:06:17.458 --> 00:06:20.875
Also, no one's ever even
told me they liked me.

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:23.583
How am I supposed
to relate to Juliet?

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:26.250
Well, you know what, Aya?

00:06:26.333 --> 00:06:29.083
It might surprise you, but I've
never killed anybody before.

00:06:29.166 --> 00:06:31.583
Uh, 'kay, that's good to know,
I would hope not!

00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:32.875
[SUGIMOTO]
Tybalt has, though.

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:34.083
That's the point.

00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:35.500
We're in the same boat.

00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:37.208
You've never been
in a relationship,

00:06:37.291 --> 00:06:39.041
and I've never committed murder.

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:41.291
We're both lacking the
real-world experiences

00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:43.291
of our characters.

00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:44.959
I'm gonna fall for my cousin,

00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:48.375
then I'll kill a sworn enemy,
and then I'll get killed myself.

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:51.542
That's the man I'm going to
become on stage today.

00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:53.917
If you're focused on your
fear of messing it up,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.125
it's a lot more likely you will.

00:06:56.208 --> 00:06:58.625
And the same thing goes if
all you really care about

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:00.583
is out-shining someone else.

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:03.959
So then, what should
my focus be?

00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:06.875
[SUGIMOTO]
It's simple, but difficult:

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:10.208
Just get up there and
do the very best you can.

00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:12.208
Do exactly what you rehearsed.

00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:15.208
If you can manage that,
then you're all good.

00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:16.917
No one could get angry at you.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.750
You're the type of musume-yaku
everyone loves.

00:07:19.834 --> 00:07:21.834
So, chin up! And have faith!

00:07:21.917 --> 00:07:24.667
'Cause you're cute and talented!

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.709
Come on.

00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:30.834
Wait a minute. I have a feeling.

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:33.291
I'm getting this
overwhelming sense of...

00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:37.208
Go, Sawa! Aya!
Break legs, you guys!

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:38.375
Right.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.125
[ANDOU]
Okay, let's begin!

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:42.583
[YAMADA]
...deja vu.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.542
[YAMADA]
Hirayama's really nice.

00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:48.083
I mean, I don't get it,
why'd you turn him down?

00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:50.458
Huh? Why do you think?

00:07:50.542 --> 00:07:53.041
You have a giant crush
on Hirayama, don't you?

00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:54.667
What? No, of course not!

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.750
[ASUKA laughs]

00:07:55.834 --> 00:07:57.875
That's not what
your face is saying.

00:07:57.959 --> 00:07:59.125
Here's the deal.

00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:01.041
I'm, like, so bad with girls.

00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:02.875
You're my only friend
who is one, you know?

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:05.458
And, well, you're
always super nice, so...

00:08:05.542 --> 00:08:07.000
Of course, I wasn't
gonna do anything

00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:09.500
to make you hate me.
I mean, jeez.

00:08:09.583 --> 00:08:10.750
So it's my fault?

00:08:10.834 --> 00:08:13.041
What? Don't be silly!

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:16.250
Wait, hold on,
maybe it is? No idea.

00:08:17.834 --> 00:08:18.792
Great.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:24.083
So you know Hirayama's gotta be
totally heartbroken right now.

00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:26.041
I bet if you asked him out,
he'd say yes!

00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:27.333
No way!

00:08:27.417 --> 00:08:28.542
I can't take advantage of
someone when they're

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:30.000
vulnerable like that!

00:08:30.083 --> 00:08:31.500
[ASUKA]
Why not?

00:08:31.583 --> 00:08:34.458
Who cares, as long as you get
your happy ending, right?

00:08:34.542 --> 00:08:37.667
[YAMADA] I guess, but he said he
wants to be "friends forever."

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.417
[ASUKA giggles]
Koko, you're so cute!

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.583
[YAMADA]
No, I am not.

00:08:41.667 --> 00:08:44.125
Nobody's ever even
said that to me before.

00:08:44.208 --> 00:08:46.834
[ASUKA] Well, I'm telling
you, you are, okay?

00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:48.000
Everyone likes you.

00:08:48.083 --> 00:08:50.125
You've got a warm
aura or whatever.

00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:52.959
I know you're totally gonna
get into Kouka, no doubt!

00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:54.083
You think?

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:55.709
[ASUKA]
I just said, I know!

00:08:55.792 --> 00:08:58.959
Hell, if I were a guy, I'd
definitely go out with you.

00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:01.667
I mean, if I'm honest,
I'd go out with you right now,

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.125
if you ever wanted to.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.917
Oh, wow, really?
Well, thanks.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.458
[ASUKA laughs]

00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:14.041
[YAMADA]
Hey, what're you laughing about?

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:16.375
You're so cute,
I can't even help it!

00:09:16.458 --> 00:09:19.125
I wanna be friends with
you forever, too, Koko!

00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:21.291
I just love you so much!

00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:23.208
I feel like I'm about to cry.

00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:27.041
[KONNO]
O, speak again, bright angel!

00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:28.917
For thou art as
glorious to this night,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.542
being o'er my head as is a
winged messenger of heaven.

00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:35.250
[YAMADA]
Wait, no way, was she into me?

00:09:37.792 --> 00:09:40.709
[ONODERA] Miss Yamada's cheeks
are bright red all of a sudden.

00:09:40.792 --> 00:09:43.375
Oh, dear, I certainly
hope she's okay!

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:44.709
I'm sorry, girls.

00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:46.458
I fully recognize
that as a teacher,

00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:48.458
I'm not supposed
to have favorites.

00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:51.792
It's a matter of principle,
and I completely understand why.

00:09:51.875 --> 00:09:54.166
But darn it, teachers
are human beings, too,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.792
and I can't help but root
for the girl I discovered!

00:09:57.875 --> 00:09:59.750
Musical theater is
the mixed martial arts

00:09:59.834 --> 00:10:01.083
of the theater world.

00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:02.917
If you can perfect
your signature move,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.375
you can turn the
tables on any rival!

00:10:05.458 --> 00:10:06.542
Miss Yamada!

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:08.792
Don't forget to use
your secret weapon!

00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:11.583
[YAMADA]
O Romeo!

00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:14.208
Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?

00:10:14.291 --> 00:10:16.792
Deny thy father and
refuse thy name.

00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:18.917
Or if thou wilt not...

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.208
[YAMADA]
Weird.

00:10:20.291 --> 00:10:22.542
It's like a curse
has been lifted.

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:25.166
Someone out there is looking
at me like I'm special

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.417
without my even knowing it.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.875
I'll never be like
Naracchi, but...

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:32.250
[ONODERA]
You can do it!

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:35.208
[YAMADA] When I stand on that
stage, maybe someone in

00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:38.583
the audience will see the same
thing, and I want to give them

00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:40.750
that chance.

00:10:40.834 --> 00:10:43.333
I know that now, so here goes.

00:10:43.417 --> 00:10:45.583
Nervous or not, I have to try.

00:10:45.667 --> 00:10:47.542
I have to give it my best shot!

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:50.041
I know thou wilt say "Ay,"

00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:53.041
and I will take thee
at thy word, Romeo.

00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:56.542
If thou dost love me,
pronounce it faithfully.

00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:58.625
And I'll believe thee!

00:10:58.709 --> 00:11:00.709
[YAMADA]
I did it!

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:01.917
[ANDOU]
Excellent.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.083
Now, let's see our
top student's Tybalt.

00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:13.375
What blood?
'Tis my blood?

00:11:13.458 --> 00:11:15.333
Thou, wretched boy.

00:11:15.417 --> 00:11:16.875
What hast thou done to me?

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.834
No, this can't be! I yet live!

00:11:21.917 --> 00:11:25.000
My end cannot be
so nigh as it appears!

00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:28.417
[OOKI] Such expression, down to
the movement of her fingers.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.917
The hallmark of someone
trained to be a prima ballerina.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.417
[SUGIMOTO] Fairest Juliet,
o bright star in darkest sky,

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.291
my hand will never
know your soft glow.

00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:41.792
Your sweet touch.

00:11:41.875 --> 00:11:43.208
[TAKAGI]
My goodness.

00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:45.625
Her Tybalt is full of bitter
rage for one so young.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:50.500
Romeo!

00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:55.250
And thus I am slain by Romeo.

00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:57.917
The true villain.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.083
Tybalt is gone,
and Romeo banished,

00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:02.375
Romeo that kill'd him!

00:12:02.458 --> 00:12:03.834
[ONODERA]
Come on, Miss Yamada!

00:12:03.917 --> 00:12:06.625
It's all you!

[ONODERA] She took a deliberate
pause before she started

00:13:19.834 --> 00:13:23.333
to sing. Then she started
in pianissimo, soft,

00:13:23.417 --> 00:13:25.792
as if beginning to tell a story.

00:13:37.959 --> 00:13:39.291
[ANDOU]
Thank you, group two.

00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:40.542
Good work.

[HOSHINO]
Aya! Wow, you're such a natural!

00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:45.291
Your voice sounded incredible!

00:13:48.875 --> 00:13:50.875
[YAMADA]
What's that look for?

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:53.000
You're a very worthy rival.

Huh? But I--

00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:57.458
Hey, Sawa!
Your Tybalt was so powerful!

00:13:57.542 --> 00:13:59.709
And maybe this is weird,
but I felt like you kept

00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:01.709
looking right at me
the whole time!

00:14:01.792 --> 00:14:04.875
You know, I don't have much
experience hating people.

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:06.583
[SARASA]
Yeah, me either!

00:14:06.667 --> 00:14:09.083
[SUGIMOTO] So I chose someone
to hate in my head.

00:14:09.166 --> 00:14:11.792
And it only made sense
to pick my biggest rival.

00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:13.083
Oh, who's that?

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.917
Not telling.

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:18.583
[HOSHINO]
Look!

00:14:18.667 --> 00:14:20.917
I have night's cloak to
hide me from their sight,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.792
and but thou love me,
let them find me here!

00:14:23.875 --> 00:14:27.709
O Romeo! Romeo, wherefore
art thou Romeo?

00:14:27.792 --> 00:14:30.583
Swear not by the moon.
the inconstant moon,

00:14:30.667 --> 00:14:32.583
lest that thy love
prove likewise.

00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:35.792
Oh, to be young again, right?

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.667
Those girls are all so bright
and innocent and adorable;

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.333
they're well-nigh perfect!

00:14:40.417 --> 00:14:42.125
You're right, it's the
rare kind of beauty

00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:44.458
you can only find in
diamonds in the rough.

00:14:44.542 --> 00:14:46.333
They've got a long way
to go before they're ready

00:14:46.417 --> 00:14:49.333
for an audience,
but they were all fresh!

00:14:49.417 --> 00:14:50.625
You know what they say.

00:14:50.709 --> 00:14:53.250
Success is about hard
work and perseverance,

00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:54.959
but then, every once in a while,

00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:57.750
an exceptional talent comes
along and they outperform

00:14:57.834 --> 00:15:00.083
our expectations
without even trying.

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:02.208
Hard not to get excited
when that happens,

00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:04.375
both for them and for
the future of the school.

00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:08.959
[STUDENT A]
My audition's right after lunch!

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:10.417
I'm too nervous to eat.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.000
[STUDENT B]
Come on, you've got to!

00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:14.000
You don't want your stomach
grumbling while you're up there.

00:15:14.083 --> 00:15:15.458
Let's go.

00:15:15.542 --> 00:15:17.250
I'm so glad I'm already done.

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:18.166
[SUGIMOTO]
No kidding.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.792
Waiting to perform is torture.

00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:21.875
And now we get to enjoy
our food without nerves

00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:23.083
getting in our way!

00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:24.792
Never been so glad
to have gone early!

00:15:24.875 --> 00:15:26.750
That's right!
The only thing left to do

00:15:26.834 --> 00:15:28.709
is figure out who to vote for.

00:15:28.792 --> 00:15:29.917
[AI]
We're not done.

00:15:32.291 --> 00:15:33.709
Sarasa hasn't gone.

00:15:33.792 --> 00:15:35.458
Well, that explains
the peace and quiet.

00:15:35.542 --> 00:15:37.375
Guess I should've
questioned that right away.

00:15:37.458 --> 00:15:39.625
So, where'd she run off to?
The bathroom?

00:15:56.917 --> 00:15:59.333
My, Sarasa, you look happy!

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:02.041
I am! You know how Akiya
wasn't able to come out

00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:03.500
to the party yesterday?

00:16:03.583 --> 00:16:06.208
To make it up to me, he's
taking me to the aquarium

00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:07.417
later on!

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.792
[KEN]
Yeah?

00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:10.166
Well now, look at him, pullin'
out the smooth moves

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.250
with you!

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:12.875
Hard to believe it
wasn't so long ago

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:15.291
that he was right here,
cryin' like a baby!

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:16.709
[SARASA]
But I'm so excited to see him,

00:16:16.792 --> 00:16:19.125
my heart's going a
million miles a minute.

00:16:19.208 --> 00:16:22.083
and now I have all this time
to kill before he comes.

00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:23.166
I know!

00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:28.917
Instead of waiting here,
I'll meet him at his house!

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.750
All right, be back by seven!

00:16:30.834 --> 00:16:31.917
[SARASA]
I will!

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.125
[SARASA]
Akiya! It's happening!

00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:44.041
I've finally made it
to the starting block!

00:16:44.125 --> 00:16:46.750
I'm about to find myself
on stage again!

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.083
[AKIYA]
So?

00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:07.291
Why did you want to talk
to me, Kouzaburou?

00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:09.417
[KOUZABUROU] A little birdy told
me that Sarasa got accepted

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.000
into the Kouka School.

00:17:11.083 --> 00:17:12.083
Is that true?

00:17:12.166 --> 00:17:14.542
[AKIYA]
Dunno how you heard, but yeah.

00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:16.542
Only one in 25
applicants make it.

00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:19.000
It's pretty crazy that
she got in on her first try.

00:17:19.083 --> 00:17:20.792
I expected no less of her.

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:25.208
They'd have to be idiots
to not admit her.

00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:27.375
Still, that tracks for
the Kouka School.

00:17:27.458 --> 00:17:29.709
It's how they've stuck
around for a century.

00:17:29.792 --> 00:17:31.333
Good thing you're not
competing for roles,

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:33.041
'cause you'd have
a real problem.

00:17:33.125 --> 00:17:35.667
Okay, that was uncalled for.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.458
[KOUZABUROU]
The school's in Kobe, right?

00:17:37.542 --> 00:17:40.333
It'll be hard to keep track of
what she's up to down there.

00:17:40.417 --> 00:17:42.000
I'll miss her.

00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:43.291
[AKIYA]
For sure.

00:17:43.375 --> 00:17:45.959
What's that mean?
You going to miss her, too?

00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:48.500
Well, yeah, we've been
friends for forever.

00:17:48.583 --> 00:17:50.125
[KOUZABUROU] Why don't you
go out with her, then?

00:17:51.125 --> 00:17:52.041
[AKIYA]
What the--?

00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:54.375
Where the heck did
that come from?

00:17:54.458 --> 00:17:55.542
[KOUZABUROU]
What a stupid question.

00:17:55.625 --> 00:17:57.125
Where do you think?

00:17:57.208 --> 00:17:59.959
I want Sarasa to live out her
teenage years to the fullest.

00:18:00.041 --> 00:18:02.208
Old friends might drift
apart due to distance,

00:18:02.291 --> 00:18:05.041
but if you were dating,
you'd put in the work, yeah?

00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:07.500
[AKIYA]
Have you totally lost your mind?

00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:09.875
Akiya, be smart.

00:18:09.959 --> 00:18:11.417
You should give it some thought.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.417
And don't start acting as if
you're the 16th Kaou already.

00:18:19.208 --> 00:18:21.750
Kaou is devoted to the craft.

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:25.041
If he sees someone else with
the talent he's looking for,

00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:28.333
he won't hesitate to choose
them to be his apprentice

00:18:28.417 --> 00:18:30.291
and therefore inherit his title.

00:18:32.208 --> 00:18:33.250
Don't worry.

00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:34.792
Luckily for you,
Kaou trusts me enough

00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:36.834
to give me a pretty healthy
measure of influence

00:18:36.917 --> 00:18:39.041
on decisions like these.

00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:41.000
Do you catch my drift?

00:18:41.083 --> 00:18:42.542
[AKIYA]
Are you threatening me?

00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:43.875
[KOUZABUROU]
No. Not at all.

00:18:43.959 --> 00:18:46.166
It's just an idea.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.083
You do have a crush
on Sarasa, don't you?

00:18:50.667 --> 00:18:53.583
Well, yeah, but that
doesn't mean that she--

00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:55.750
It's perfect. Think it over.

00:18:58.917 --> 00:19:00.625
A pat? Really?

00:19:00.709 --> 00:19:02.166
You don't even care about
what you're putting me

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.875
through with this, do you,
Kouzaburou?

00:19:04.959 --> 00:19:08.291
I can't bring myself to hate
you doing this to me.

00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:10.041
But now I have to deal
with your words echoing

00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:12.750
in my head no matter
what I do next.

00:19:12.834 --> 00:19:14.041
You're such a jerk.

00:19:32.583 --> 00:19:33.750
Beautiful, huh?

00:19:33.834 --> 00:19:34.959
Yeah.

00:19:35.041 --> 00:19:37.917
Reminds me of the Kouka
Troupe's grand parade.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.333
Those shiny little fish you
see swimming all over

00:19:40.417 --> 00:19:42.208
the tank are like the ensemble.

00:19:42.291 --> 00:19:44.917
And the biggest, slowest
fish represent the stars,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.375
owning the space
in their leading roles.

00:19:47.458 --> 00:19:48.917
[AKIYA]
Who's the top star?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.125
[SARASA]
Oh, definitely the stingray.

00:19:51.208 --> 00:19:53.208
Its big, fluttering fins
remind me

00:19:53.291 --> 00:19:55.291
of the feathers top stars wear.

00:19:57.959 --> 00:20:00.417
Sarasa, listen, I...

00:20:02.917 --> 00:20:03.959
Forget it.

00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:06.000
Would you come see
me in Shinbashi?

00:20:06.083 --> 00:20:07.417
Before you go?

00:20:11.959 --> 00:20:14.250
[SARASA]
Sorry, I can't do that.

00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:16.041
Grandpa says no kabuki.

00:20:16.125 --> 00:20:18.875
[AKIYA]
Oh. That's right.

00:20:18.959 --> 00:20:21.500
[SARASA] Hey, do you think
when I'm off at school

00:20:21.583 --> 00:20:24.041
you could come by my
house every now and then?

00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:26.041
Just so my grandpa
won't get lonely.

00:20:27.542 --> 00:20:30.041
I'm not a grown-up yet,
and I'm fine with that,

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:32.709
but I'm not a kid, either,
and right now,

00:20:32.792 --> 00:20:35.000
I think that I've finally
figured out how someone else

00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:38.417
has been feeling for
a really long time.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.834
Two years after
I start at Kouka,

00:20:40.917 --> 00:20:44.500
I'll get to be one of those
little fish in the big tank.

00:20:44.583 --> 00:20:47.291
Then one day,
I'll be a stingray,

00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:50.166
and I'll play Lady Oscar.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.125
It's time for me to let go.

00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:56.250
I'm finally gonna
leave kabuki behind.

00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:58.625
I can't be Sukeroku,
so I guess that means

00:20:58.709 --> 00:21:00.166
he's all yours, Akiya!

00:21:01.792 --> 00:21:03.458
[SARASA]
Oh, one more thing?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.834
I want you to be my boyfriend.

00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:17.917
[SARASA] Akiya, Grandpa Ken,
how are you guys today?

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.542
I've got my audition
coming up soon!

00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:23.250
I'm gonna give it my best shot.

00:21:23.333 --> 00:21:25.083
I'll let you know if
I get the part!

00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:30.625
[AI]
There you are!

00:21:30.709 --> 00:21:32.166
I couldn't find you.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.625
[SARASA] I've been
working on my audition.

00:21:34.709 --> 00:21:36.792
--[AI] Where?
--[SARASA] Outside.

00:21:36.875 --> 00:21:37.959
[AI]
Did you eat?

00:21:38.041 --> 00:21:39.792
[SARASA]
Yep!

00:21:39.875 --> 00:21:41.000
You feel okay?

00:21:42.458 --> 00:21:44.250
Huh? I'm excellent.

00:21:44.333 --> 00:21:46.834
This time, I'll show everyone
my take on Tybalt!

00:21:50.125 --> 00:21:52.166
Good, go break a leg.

00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:55.875
[ANDOU] Now, let's start with
our remaining hopefuls.

00:21:55.959 --> 00:21:57.834
[STUDENTS]
Good luck, all!

00:21:57.917 --> 00:22:01.125
All right, I want you to come
up when your name is called.

00:22:01.208 --> 00:22:03.333
Tybalt, Sarasa Watanabe.

00:22:03.417 --> 00:22:04.959
Here!

00:22:05.041 --> 00:22:07.333
[SUGIMOTO]
Wait, he's starting with Tybalt?

00:22:07.417 --> 00:22:08.917
[HOSHINO]
Why, suddenly?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.208
On Juliet, Akina Horiguchi.

00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:12.333
[HORIGUCHI]
Yes, sir!

00:22:12.417 --> 00:22:14.333
The nurse, Emiri Sunouchi.

00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:15.458
[SUNOUCHI]
Yes, sir.

00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:16.709
And our Romeo...

00:22:17.917 --> 00:22:18.959
...will be me.
