[SARASA]
Ta-dah!

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:19.310 position:50% align:center
Look, Ai! Isn't it great?

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:20.437 position:50% align:center
I love it!

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:22.772 position:50% align:center
Come on, check it out!

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
This is the Kouka uniform!

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.068 position:50% align:center
I know.
I've got one, too, you know.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:30.238 position:50% align:center
Guidance Week is done,
the ceremony's behind us,

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:33.283 position:50% align:center
and tomorrow,
we finally start classes!

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.494 position:50% align:center
She was so excited last night
that it was almost disturbing.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.876 position:50% align:center
Guess I could at least try.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
Though waking her up
doesn't seem easy.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:46.880 position:50% align:center
Hey, wake up.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:49.758 position:50% align:center
Wake up.

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.477 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Well, it didn't work.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.686 position:50% align:center
I did my best.

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:04.439 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Good morning, Miss Narata.

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:06.691 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Sugimoto.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:09.110 position:50% align:center
Our troublesome Miss
Watanabe isn't with you?

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:10.320 position:50% align:center
I couldn't wake her up.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:13.823 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, I need to
get into your room!

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.283 position:50% align:center
C'mon, wake up!

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.410 position:50% align:center
Miss Watanabe!
Get up right now!

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.290 position:50% align:center
Sarasa Watanabe!

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.711 position:50% align:center
Get your ass out of bed!

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.506 position:50% align:center
You cannot show up late
on your very first day!

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.883 position:50% align:center
Get yourself ready and
get to the auditorium!

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.343 position:50% align:center
Right, okay.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.388 position:50% align:center
Uh... Wait, it's only 5:30.

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:39.265 position:50% align:center
So, exercises with
the JSDF again?

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:40.642 position:50% align:center
'Fraid not.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.936 position:50% align:center
The people we're meeting are
much scarier than that.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.613 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Good morning!

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
I am the first-year student
representative, Sawa Sugimoto.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.409 position:50% align:center
We're very sorry we're late!

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry,
you're not late yet!

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.789 position:50% align:center
It's only five minutes till six.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
Our centennial class is on it!

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.959 position:50% align:center
Wow. Who are these ladies?

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.253 position:50% align:center
Those would be the
second-year students,

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.547 position:50% align:center
the 99th Kouka Class.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:35.674 position:50% align:center
Now, shut up.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Sawa Sugimoto.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.845 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes. I'm not
a bit surprised.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
Of course you'd be the one
to represent your class.

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Thank you.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.893 position:50% align:center
The faculty told me that
the highest exam scorer

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center
earns that privilege.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
It's my honor to hold
this esteemed position.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center
I will do so with pride.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.777 position:50% align:center
Good morning, first-years.
Welcome to your new home.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center
I am the second-year
representative, Tomomi Takei.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center
Today, in accordance
with school tradition,

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
we will be showing you how to
properly perform your duties

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:05.912 position:50% align:center
during your morning cleaning.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:07.414 position:50% align:center
We thank you for your time.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.374 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS] Thank you
for your valuable time!

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.217 position:50% align:center
I'll fight my way
straight up to the top.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:21.594 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
It's our pleasure.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
Each first-year has been
assigned their own

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.849 position:50% align:center
second-year student advisor.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.851 position:50% align:center
Make good use of
them during this year.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.769 position:50% align:center
They will be the ones
to support you and offer

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:32.147 position:50% align:center
valuable advice as you
learn your way around.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me who my
big sister's gonna be?

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:37.902 position:50% align:center
There she goes,
right on schedule.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
Your second-year advisor
can make school life

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
heaven or a living hell.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.659 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI]
Jeez, Risa, scary much?

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Right.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
So, when your name is
called, come forward.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.248 position:50% align:center
You'll meet your advisor
and head to the location

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.250 position:50% align:center
you'll be cleaning.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI] It looks like
I'll be your advisor!

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
I'm Hijiri Nojima,
VP of the second-years.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
Good to meet you!

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you, too.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI]
Your eyelashes are so long,

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
and your skin is
seriously like porcelain!

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
No wonder you got to be in JPX!

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.184 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Thanks.

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50% align:center
You know, everyone was
fighting over who was gonna

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
get to be your big sister.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50% align:center
We did a rock-paper-scissors
tournament for it, and I won!

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
I felt like I'd been chosen to
be the center for JPX myself!

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI]
Heh... Not a morning person?

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.950 position:50% align:center
Or do you have, like,
low blood pressure?

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
No.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI] Well, anyway, for the
record, I'm a huge JPX fan.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't gotten into Kouka, I
would've auditioned for them!

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
I mean, everyone in JPX just
seems so cute and full of life

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.799 position:50% align:center
with their big,
sparkling smiles!

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:43.468 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm so honored
to be your big sister.

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
And I can promise you that
for the next year, I--

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:48.014 position:50% align:center
You're a fan, but obviously
not one of mine.

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.099 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI]
Uh--

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
When you sweep, start from
one side of the room, 'kay?

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:00.527 position:50% align:center
And don't whack
it on the ground.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.029 position:50% align:center
Oh. I've never cleaned
a room before.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.781 position:50% align:center
I can tell.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
So, what is it that makes
you so sure I wasn't

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.285 position:50% align:center
one of your fans, huh?

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
Because I'm not
what you described.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
I'm not known for
my sparkling smile.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.542 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess,

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
I'd say you're probably
a fan of Momo Kozono.

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI]
Well, I liked you, too, though!

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
Your whole not smiling thing
made you this cool-headed,

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
untouchable beauty, you know?

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
Don't worry,
you haven't offended me.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.934 position:50% align:center
So! Do you want to play
women as a musume-yaku?

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:34.185 position:50% align:center
I don't care.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
Really? You don't?

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
Any role would be fine.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.942 position:50% align:center
Fascinating!

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway, I think you'll
end up being glad you got me

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
as a big sister this year
and not someone else.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
There are always some
second-year students

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
who insist on being mean
to their poor first-years.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.287 position:50% align:center
What I'm trying to say is,
the competition starts

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
long before you get
into the Troupe.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:56.708 position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact, it started
the moment you got into

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
this school.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
Although...

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
I don't think you'll have
to worry about it much, Ai.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
Now, c'mon, silly!

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.468 position:50% align:center
Let me show you
how to use a broom.

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.595 position:50% align:center
You should leave some
space between your hands,

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
and place your
dominant hand here.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.644 position:50% align:center
[RISA] My name is Risa Nakayama,
I'll be your advisor.

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center
It's like I won the jackpot!

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
My advisor's a Latin beauty
with a totally rockin' bod!

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
And I hate it when
people point that out.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
Now, before class starts, clean
the traditional dance room.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.324 position:50% align:center
You've got exactly
two hours to do it.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center
First, you need
to sweep the floor.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
Then, use a hairpin to get
the gunk out of the cracks

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
and wipe down the floorboards.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
Then dust the grooves in the
window with these brushes,

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
and polish the mirror
until it's totally spotless.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
Two hours to do
this all by myself?

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:43.880 position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.131 position:50% align:center
Then I'm on it!

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Ugh! This is taking forever.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.556 position:50% align:center
Well, I certainly
hope it doesn't.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.725 position:50% align:center
It'd be a real shame if
you were late to class.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.102 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
That's a big no!

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
So, exactly how tall are you?

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:04.109 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
I'm just about five foot ten!

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
And how old?

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
Fifteen years old!

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:11.032 position:50% align:center
Huh. I got accepted when I was
in the 12th grade, so I'm 19.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
I'll be 20 next year.

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:13.952 position:50% align:center
Freakin' sucks.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.495 position:50% align:center
Uh, why would you say that?

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
You've got such
confident-lady-boss energy!

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:19.457 position:50% align:center
Okay cut the chatter.

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:20.709 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that,
I guess I just really like

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
talking with you, Risa!

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.673 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that feeling
is not mutual.

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
Well, then I'll find something
you like talking about!

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:30.260 position:50% align:center
Don't even bother.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center
Figured!

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
I'd better focus on this
cleaning, anyway,

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50% align:center
or it will take forever!

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.183 position:50% align:center
So, um...

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.102 position:50% align:center
Are you really wanting
to play Oscar?

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.730 position:50% align:center
Yes! I came to this school
specifically so I could learn

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
how to play Lady Osc--

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
Well, get over it.

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:48.486 position:50% align:center
Because you'll never play Oscar.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.904 position:50% align:center
You might as well give it up.

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER A]
It will never happen! Not ever!

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.584 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter how good
you are, or how smart,

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50% align:center
or how much natural talent
you might think you possess!

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
Playing Sukeroku is just never
going to happen for you!

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Uh... Is there a problem?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
Sarasa, you okay?

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center
Hey, c'mon, say something!

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
Why, though?
Why can't I be Lady Oscar

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
when it's all I've ever
wanted in my whole life

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
and I finally made it here?

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.650 position:50% align:center
Look, you gotta stop crying!

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.361 position:50% align:center
They're gonna think I'm
in here beating you up

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:32.364 position:50% align:center
or bullying you or something.

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:33.656 position:50% align:center
There's no way.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
She's too tall to be
cast as Lady Oscar.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
The actress playing André would
have to be taller than her,

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
and that's definitely
not happening.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
Look, none of us wanted
to be your advisor.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
You're not going to
have an easy time.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
Sticking out like a sore thumb
here can be a death sentence.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:53.593 position:50% align:center
What would happen if
I actually told her that?

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:55.011 position:50% align:center
How badly would she react?

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.348 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI]
Wow!

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:01.518 position:50% align:center
So, you want to be a top
musume-yaku too, Risa?

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.729 position:50% align:center
Shh! Yes, but don't
tell anyone yet, okay?

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
I'm still kinda shy about it.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50% align:center
They're all gonna say
it doesn't suit me, Hijiri.

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
I don't think
that's true at all!

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.529 position:50% align:center
I mean, look at yourself,
you're gorgeous!

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.531 position:50% align:center
Not to mention you're one of
the best singers and dancers

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:15.657 position:50% align:center
we have.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. You think so?

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
It's just your voice
and look don't fit the type

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
of a musume-yaku.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:24.457 position:50% align:center
You know, you'd be way better
off playing older women

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.793 position:50% align:center
as an onna-yaku!

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
It's cause you're
just so mature!

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
But you're not like,
"dainty" or "cute,"

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
you know what I mean?

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.969 position:50% align:center
You'd be perfect in a role
like Carlotta, or Kurotokage!

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
Any of those villainess roles
would be excellent for you.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.683 position:50% align:center
Man, though, if you were
just a little taller,

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
you might've been able to
make it as a top otoko-yaku!

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
[RISA] That was the day
I learned that only girls

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:51.276 position:50% align:center
like Hijiri had a chance of
becoming a top musume-yaku.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.571 position:50% align:center
Girls with angelic faces
and a mean streak to boot.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
I still don't get it!
Why can't I play Lady Oscar?

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait, I know!

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
Before the welcome ceremony,

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.957 position:50% align:center
you stood under the
cherry tree, didn't you?

00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.627 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
That explains it, then.

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
No one who's stood underneath
the cherry tree before

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
starting school here has ever
become one of Kouka's top stars.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
It's well known
the tree is cursed.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:20.513 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
So, that's it?

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
'Fraid so.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
I know what to do.

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
I'll have to prove
that curse is fake!

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center
You know, I couldn't even
be here if I was a guy.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:33.985 position:50% align:center
I was born as a girl instead,
and then I got chosen

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
to be a part of this.

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.406 position:50% align:center
But I don't believe there
should be such a thing

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.118 position:50% align:center
as absolutes when it
comes to can or can't.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
It isn't right.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:47.082 position:50% align:center
So there's no way I'm gonna
let that curse hold me back!

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
Well, then.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
I guess no one knows what you're
capable of but you, right?

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.425 position:50% align:center
Give it a shot.

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
I will!

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
I will, too.

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
It's almost time
for class. C'mon.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
I'll help you out so we can
finish up a little bit quicker.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.605 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Huh?

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
Big Sis!

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:15.068 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Heh! Cleaning complete!

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
Good, there you are!

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.530 position:50% align:center
I was starting to get
a little worried!

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.490 position:50% align:center
And here I thought
you'd messed up again.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
You were worried about me?

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
No. Not you.

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.495 position:50% align:center
If one of us first-years messes
up, the second-years

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:28.123 position:50% align:center
will yell at all of us
as if we'd all done it.

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:30.291 position:50% align:center
Your advisor seemed kinda
strict, so hopefully you

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:31.209 position:50% align:center
did okay.

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:32.627 position:50% align:center
Prove me right, please.

00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:33.878 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
Risa certainly doesn't
mince words or anything,

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
but I think she's really nice!

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
She definitely messed up!

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:42.595 position:50% align:center
Yeah, our advisors were
pretty scary, too, right?

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.764 position:50% align:center
I'll say they were!
Mine stared daggers at me

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
when I accidentally
fumbled the broom!

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
Kouka is just so
competitive and intense.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.312 position:50% align:center
But your advisor
seemed really sweet, Ai!

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.732 position:50% align:center
I think you might've won
the lottery on that, huh?

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:57.110 position:50% align:center
I doubt it.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.613 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
So? How was our Lady Oscar?

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50% align:center
Nothing special.
She's still just a child.

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:06.745 position:50% align:center
Hang on, what's happening, Risa?

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
You actually look happy!

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.331 position:50% align:center
Must be rough on you, Hijiri.

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
People seem to think
Naracchi could be a top

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
musume-yaku one day.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center
I'm not quite sure where
you got that idea,

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
but you are mistaken.

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
No motivation.

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:22.761 position:50% align:center
That's Naracchi's thing.

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Well, it'll be
interesting to see how it goes.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:27.599 position:50% align:center
Who knows what wind
might lift her sails?

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
After all, the future's
wide open.

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
Hey! What the--?

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
What do you want, Kouzaburou?

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
Aren't those Sarasa's tweets?

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.079 position:50% align:center
Lemme see.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
What? It's super important. I
need to make sure you and Sarasa

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.500 position:50% align:center
are keeping it all
wholesome and above board.

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:55.460 position:50% align:center
As if that's any
of your business!

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:57.712 position:50% align:center
Akiya, do me a little favor.

00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.547 position:50% align:center
remind me who bought
that tablet for you.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.051 position:50% align:center
[KOUZABUROU]
Hmm.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
So, she learned how to
clean a classroom today.

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.889 position:50% align:center
Under the tutelage of
a cool Latin beauty.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
I didn't know that, I guess
I haven't read that far.

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
[KOUZABUROU] Come on,
wipe that look off your face.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.979 position:50% align:center
It does you no good.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:17.565 position:50% align:center
Your most dedicated fans
are older women.

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
Watch the attitude or
you'll lose them all.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.571 position:50% align:center
Sarasa's turned 15, now, huh?

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:25.448 position:50% align:center
Wow, she must be getting big.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.950 position:50% align:center
She definitely is.

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
And she's already taller than
me, if you can believe it.

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:31.079 position:50% align:center
Amazing.

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
She was so tiny back in
the day, when you two

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.209 position:50% align:center
were both taking
dance lessons here.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
I kinda wish that we
could've kept her around.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
So, Kobe, huh?

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.216 position:50% align:center
maybe I'll go sneak a peek
at her one of these days.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
That's creepy-stalker territory.
Don't be weird.

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.429 position:50% align:center
By the way, Akiya.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:48.972 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
Coming to you for this every
time is getting really annoying.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.018 position:50% align:center
So, if you wouldn't mind,

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center
could you gimme the
password for this account?

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:03.278 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
I'm Mr. Andou. I teach acting.

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:04.738 position:50% align:center
So, then...

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.990 position:50% align:center
I'd planned to do a short intro
to Shakespearean dramas,

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.617 position:50% align:center
but now I've changed my mind.

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
Let's do a round of
introductions instead.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:14.956 position:50% align:center
Mister Andou, forgive me
for saying this

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center
and speaking out of turn
on the first day of class,

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
but should we really be
wasting time on that?

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:20.754 position:50% align:center
I wanna!

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.505 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to volunteer
and start us off!

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:24.257 position:50% align:center
Wait. Slow it down.

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
This is no normal school,
as you all are well aware.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:28.845 position:50% align:center
'Cause there,
you've got choices.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.431 position:50% align:center
When you graduate from there,
you can go on to college,

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:34.392 position:50% align:center
or find a job, take an
apprenticeship, get married,

00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
move away, et cetera.

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
But here, you've only
got two options:

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.024 position:50% align:center
To sink or swim.

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center
To stay with Kouka
or to give up.

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
Once you graduate
from this program,

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:47.113 position:50% align:center
you'll be joining
the Kouka Troupe.

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:48.406 position:50% align:center
Know what that means?

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.034 position:50% align:center
You're basically
stuck together forever.

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.869 position:50% align:center
So, I think it'd be a good
idea for you to learn more

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.705 position:50% align:center
about each other and
start getting along,

00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
a little earlier in your tenure.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.417 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you agree?

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:00.877 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Very well, Mister Andou.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
Then, as our class
representative,

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:04.255 position:50% align:center
I'll start with
my introduction.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:06.216 position:50% align:center
Do it, Miss Priss.

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
Sawa Sugimoto, 16.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.471 position:50% align:center
My family runs a well-known
ballet studio in Tokyo,

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:14.265 position:50% align:center
where I studied dance
rigorously from a young age.

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:16.518 position:50% align:center
They'd considered sending
me abroad for ballet,

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
but, as my life's goal is to
perform musical theater,

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:23.441 position:50% align:center
I applied to attend the Kouka
school instead of going away.

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:25.402 position:50% align:center
I'm very honored to be here.

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:26.653 position:50% align:center
[SARASA laughs]

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:30.281 position:50% align:center
Kaoru Hoshino. I'm 18.

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:33.576 position:50% align:center
In my family, musume-yaku
is a tradition.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.036 position:50% align:center
But because I've been
blessed with height,

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center
I'm going to play male roles
as the first otoko-yaku.

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
I'd like to add that I also
want to be an otoko-yaku!

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.627 position:50% align:center
All right, let's calm down.

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
I'm Chiaki Sawada!

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:46.214 position:50% align:center
I'm Chika Sawada!

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:49.009 position:50% align:center
Chika got in last year,
but I wasn't quite as lucky

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
and we couldn't be apart.

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
I decided to wait a year, hoping
that we could get in together,

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.348 position:50% align:center
and it worked out perfectly.

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
Uh, my name is Ayako Yamada.

00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
I've loved Kouka ever
since I was really small.

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.690 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I can't believe
I actually got in.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:06.568 position:50% align:center
So, I'm going to give
Kouka my all!

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
I'm Sarasa Watanabe, I'm 15!

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:12.574 position:50% align:center
I've dreamed of playing Lady
Oscar ever since I can remember.

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:15.368 position:50% align:center
Yes, we know, and you're
going to be a top star, too.

00:17:15.452 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
Right! I love anime, and manga,
and period pieces,

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
and I live in Asakusa
with my Grandpa Ken!

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:23.168 position:50% align:center
He makes tatami mats.
And he's done it forever!

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.337 position:50% align:center
Oh, and we have a little
cat named Nono!

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.505 position:50% align:center
She's super cute, and her
nose is always twitching--

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
You can tell us more
about your cat later.

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
All right, last one.

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
Ai Narata. I'm 16.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
I've done ballet
since I was young.

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:40.352 position:50% align:center
I was taught by my uncle,
Taichi Narata.

00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:42.771 position:50% align:center
He works here as
a ballet teacher.

00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:44.731 position:50% align:center
That's all.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
Seriously? That's so not all.

00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
My mother is Kimiko Narata.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center
I was formerly in JPX48.

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
I was voted 13th.

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
And then, I quit.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.874 position:50% align:center
No, they made me quit,
so I came here.

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:04.125 position:50% align:center
That's all.

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
Whoa, hold the phone,
were you really a JPX idol?

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
I had no idea. That's so cool!

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:13.718 position:50% align:center
Well, that's that. Now,
let's head out for our tour

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:15.887 position:50% align:center
of the Kouka Theatre's
backstage, yeah?

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS gasp]

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:18.515 position:50% align:center
Backstage?

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
Yep, you're in luck.

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
I got special permission to
take you all on a tour today.

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:25.105 position:50% align:center
You'll soon see that the
stage doesn't just belong

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
to its actresses.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center
Isn't this the best
surprise, Ai-Ai?

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] Here's our first stop,
the costumers.

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] The embellishments
are all hand-sewn!

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:41.037 position:50% align:center
My gosh! Those huge feathers!
I'd know them anywhere.

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center
They're worn by the top
otoko-yaku of the Winter Troupe,

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:45.458 position:50% align:center
Sou Kazahana!

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
[gasps] They're too incredible.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.755 position:50% align:center
I can't even look!

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
Ah! It's the bunny girl costume!

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
Wow! Would you check out this
mountain of dresses, you guys?

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.724 position:50% align:center
Mon dieu!
Does Rose Bertin work here?

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:02.976 position:50% align:center
Because I feel just
like Rosalie!

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree, Ai?

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
Right, let's move on.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:07.897 position:50% align:center
What do we say, people?

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
It's been a pleasure!

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:10.900 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for having us!

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, it's Naracchi!

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she sure does
stand out, doesn't she?

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:17.991 position:50% align:center
I'll have to brag
to my daughter.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
Did you get a look at that
other stand-out, though?

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
The one with the sparkling eyes,
towering over all the others.

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] This is where
the set gets built.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:30.045 position:50% align:center
Scenery does their work
here, right backstage.

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:32.088 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
That sure is a long brush!

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] Yeah, I've
never seen one like that.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.217 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Whoa, it's all Styrofoam!

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
But it looks so real!

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's good to hear.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Miss Watanabe,
don't get in their way.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
[SET BOSS A]
It's all good, Mamoru.

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
Gettin' praised by future
actresses helps us all

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:48.730 position:50% align:center
feel motivated to work
a bit harder, you know?

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:51.399 position:50% align:center
Great! I'm gonna be
a top star one day!

00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
When I get there, I hope you'll
make me an awesome set!

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:55.779 position:50% align:center
There she goes again.

00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
[laughing]
Well, all right!

00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center
There ain't no goin' back on
a bold statement like that,

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:01.743 position:50% align:center
is there?

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
We'll be waitin' for ya!
You better believe it!

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
Yay! We got ourselves a deal!

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:07.957 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for your time!

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:28.269 position:50% align:center
What're you doing?! Watanabe!
Don't go through there!

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:31.106 position:50% align:center
Not one more step!

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:32.524 position:50% align:center
That's the stage door!

00:20:58.758 --> 00:20:59.843 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
Miss Watanabe!

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:01.594 position:50% align:center
Get back here, right now!

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:05.015 position:50% align:center
And don't you dare attempt to
walk out on the silver bridge!

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
The bit out front.

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:10.103 position:50% align:center
The part of the apron that's
separated from the stage.

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:12.772 position:50% align:center
Only Kouka's most prestigious
stars are ever allowed

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:15.108 position:50% align:center
to cross that bridge.

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] Yeah, only the top
otoko-yaku and musume-yaku

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
and a handful of others
get to experience that.

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:23.074 position:50% align:center
So, it's this huge honor.

00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
Our goal.

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:27.287 position:50% align:center
We all want to
stand there one day.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:28.747 position:50% align:center
The silver bridge.

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
[LIGHTING A]
Huh. Someone's out on stage.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.672 position:50% align:center
[LIGHTING B] Judging from the
height, it's probably Yama.

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:39.424 position:50% align:center
Pop a light on him
and let's see.

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:51.186 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] If you want to become
one of Kouka's top stars,

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:54.856 position:50% align:center
it'll take hard work, talent,
lots of star quality,

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:58.234 position:50% align:center
and, of course, enough luck to
be given the right chance.

00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:03.615 position:50% align:center
[AI] Sarasa Watanabe's
stage presence.

00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:04.991 position:50% align:center
It was dazzling.

00:22:14.751 --> 00:22:17.629 position:50% align:center
[KITAOUJI]
I made it. Kobe.
