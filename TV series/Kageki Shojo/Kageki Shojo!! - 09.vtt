[AI]
With summer vacation behind us,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.728 position:50% align:center
we prepared to start
the new semester.

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.980 position:50% align:center
As you may know,
this year marks our troupe's

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:23.815 position:50% align:center
centennial anniversary.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:26.276 position:50% align:center
The Kouka Grand Sports
Festival will also be held

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.777 position:50% align:center
this year.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:31.031 position:50% align:center
It's a huge fan event that only
happens once every decade.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
The actresses of the
troupe are, of course,

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
the main focus of
the entire thing.

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:38.830 position:50% align:center
Our role is to assist with small
odd jobs wherever needed

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:41.124 position:50% align:center
and set up props and equipment.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
In addition to all of that,
we'll also be performing

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:44.794 position:50% align:center
in the halftime show.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
And we're gonna be teamed
up with the superiors,

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center
so try not to insult them, okay?

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.094 position:50% align:center
Superiors? Please explain!

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, you really
don't know, Ai?

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.848 position:50% align:center
The superiors are
the pros of the pros

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.392 position:50% align:center
within the troupes,
they're the ol--[grunts]

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.019 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare use
that three-letter word

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:03.104 position:50% align:center
that starts with "o"
and ends with "-ld"!

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.732 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] I won't! I was
gonna say O-mazing!

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:06.775 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, right!

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:09.444 position:50% align:center
You forgot the sacred
Kouka code!

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:10.987 position:50% align:center
[AI]
What "Kouka code"?

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.323 position:50% align:center
It's this unspoken rule that
we should never mention

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.450 position:50% align:center
the actresses'
real names or ages.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.243 position:50% align:center
Like, they're just
these lovely fairies

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:18.995 position:50% align:center
that take us to other worlds.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.955 position:50% align:center
Right, but even
more importantly,

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.958 position:50% align:center
the superiors are all veteran
performers, and as such,

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.503 position:50% align:center
they're not exclusively
affiliated with any one troupe.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.421 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
True, but when they come back,

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.757 position:50% align:center
they're widely considered
to be the unsung heroes

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.258 position:50% align:center
of Kouka.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:35.970 position:50% align:center
They rank above everyone,
even top stars and troupe leads.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.890 position:50% align:center
If we make a mistake, it
reflects badly on them, too,

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.226 position:50% align:center
so we need to be
particularly careful.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:42.477 position:50% align:center
You got that?

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.480 position:50% align:center
Fine, it can't be helped.

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:48.108 position:50% align:center
You can use my personal
library to study up.

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.442 position:50% align:center
Dunno why I'm shocked!

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.237 position:50% align:center
No one loves Kouka like you do!

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.863 position:50% align:center
Why's that in your locker?

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.824 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
All of them are spectacular,

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:57.409 position:50% align:center
but if you only watch one,

00:01:57.492 --> 00:02:00.662 position:50% align:center
I'd highly recommend the most
recent Grand Sports Festival.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:01.913 position:50% align:center
I'm so hyped for this!

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:02.997 position:50% align:center
Aren't you Ai?

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.375 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Bring on the sports.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.221 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJOU]
Hello! It's great to meet you.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
I'm one of the Superiors
you're teamed up with.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50% align:center
My name is Akiha Ichijou.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
Are you guys ready to work hard

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.270 position:50% align:center
and put on a killer
show together?

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.107 position:50% align:center
That's Ichijou!

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.859 position:50% align:center
Even the top stars regard her
with the utmost of respect!

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
She's got such a regal energy!

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJOU] We're going to be
forming up into a marching band

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
during the cheerleading
portion of the event.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.910 position:50% align:center
We'll play our school anthem,

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
"Amongst the Cherry
Blossoms in the Wind."

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:08.790 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
You know what this
makes me want to play?

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.878 position:50% align:center
The old-school
Grilled Potatoes song!

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.463 position:50% align:center
Oh, do you not know it?

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:18.216 position:50% align:center
The vendors sang it all the time
back in Asakusa, so it's--

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
I remember that song.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
You don't see many of those
traveling vendors these days.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
Not anymore.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50% align:center
Yeah! That's right, ma'am!

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:28.268 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, you don't have
to be so formal with me!

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center
Just try to relax, dear, okay?

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center
She's lovely as a spring breeze!

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
Mirei Nohara.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
Both she and Ichijou are
on the Board of Directors

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50% align:center
for the Kouka troupe.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:40.363 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's her, right?

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:41.948 position:50% align:center
Sure is!

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
What a relief it is that all the
superiors are so nice, you know?

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
Totally!

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50% align:center
With a group like this, I don't
think we'll have anything

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:49.456 position:50% align:center
to worry about!

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Hey, everyone?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.668 position:50% align:center
Apparently, we need
to redo these.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:55.337 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Aww...

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
Second-years said so.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.841 position:50% align:center
They claimed we cut
the tape too thin.

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] They could've told
us what they wanted

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center
before we made them!

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
I guess we should've been
a little more worried

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
about those second-years!

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
Stop grumbling and
let's just get it done.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50% align:center
My eyes! I can't!

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
Forgive us, we're so
sorry for interrupting!

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
Not a problem.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.706 position:50% align:center
We're the ones who snagged
your room without asking

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50% align:center
for permission.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.168 position:50% align:center
You need to get some
work done, right?

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:36.127 position:50% align:center
Come on in.

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.962 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Thanks so much!

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
We've got all four top
stars in one room?

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.220 position:50% align:center
Must be some kind of meeting
for the sports festival!

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
I've been blinded
by their beauty,

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
and I shan't ever recover!

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.266 position:50% align:center
I'm actually pretty
amazed you were able

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
to keep your cool, Sawa.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:54.729 position:50% align:center
What? I'm good.

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.314 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] Do you need
a tissue or something?

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:01.111 position:50% align:center
Hey, check it out,
Sei totally recognizes us!

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
I can't believe that
she's so nice!

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
I think that should do it
for the torch lighting

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
and the combatant pledge.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.035 position:50% align:center
Remind me of who exactly
won it last time?

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
Summer!

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.747 position:50% align:center
And I can promise you we'll
win it again this time, too!

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
We're going for
a two-win streak.

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.625 position:50% align:center
Spring's in it to win it!

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50% align:center
Don't count us out yet
'cause we happen to have

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.171 position:50% align:center
a secret weapon from
the JSDF helping us train!

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] Wait, you're
bringing in Captain Anai?

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
Hello, Sachie?

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.597 position:50% align:center
It's Keito. So nice
to hear your voice.

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:30.974 position:50% align:center
Could I get you to help
me with something

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.351 position:50% align:center
for the sports festival?

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.979 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Thank you so much!

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
I'll hook you up with
some great seats.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.192 position:50% align:center
Keito, what's up?
Who was that?

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50% align:center
Oh, that... No one. No big deal.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
Just talking to everyone's
favorite sumo instructor.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.700 position:50% align:center
Sumo instructor?

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50% align:center
Guess what, Ruri?

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:52.370 position:50% align:center
The other troupes
are really going all-out.

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:53.830 position:50% align:center
Wait, for real?

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.415 position:50% align:center
Um, yes please!

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
Turns out the Winter Troupe
has three members

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
who competed at Track Nationals!

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.296 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
National athletes?

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.214 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] They're taking
this seriously, huh.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Oh, shoot!

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
I forgot to bring any
scissors with me!

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
No prob!

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:12.098 position:50% align:center
I'll borrow a pair
from the faculty room!

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.562 position:50% align:center
Did any of you notice that girl?

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
Yeah, her legs are
so long and slender!

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
Probably why her
walk is so elegant.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.612 position:50% align:center
Watanabe. Are you
doing all right?

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:27.197 position:50% align:center
Sure, why do you ask?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
Well, you had been pretty down,

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
after your presentation,
before break.

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
I guess it felt like
everything I knew

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.622 position:50% align:center
got thrown out the window,

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
so I was a little lost
for a while, yeah.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
But I'm okay now!

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
Back in the saddle
and ready for anything!

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50% align:center
That so?

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
Well, good for you,
I'm glad to hear it.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
Thank you, again!

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Huh! So you can be nice!

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. Satomi.

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.312 position:50% align:center
Look at you, acting like
an actual teacher.

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
I mean, a student
from my first class

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
is the top star
of her troupe now.

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center
So, I'd say I'm pretty legit.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, you know,
you could've been

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
that nice to me back then, too.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
I actually know that girl.

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.535 position:50% align:center
You're the one who pushed
for her to get admitted

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
in the first place, aren't you?

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
She your favorite?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.040 position:50% align:center
Don't be ridiculous.

00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
But favorite or not,
you have to admit

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
she's pretty interesting.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:23.461 position:50% align:center
Whaddya think?

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50% align:center
She a contender for top star?

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
We'll have to see.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:32.804 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMI] Today, we'll be
rehearsing our halftime

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
show performance.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.016 position:50% align:center
Miss Ichijou has
a Winter show today,

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
so we'll have to
make do without her!

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Yes, ma'am!

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
[MIREI]
One, two three, four!

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.023 position:50% align:center
Dun, dun, dun, dun!

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:45.942 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMI] Left, right,
really hit that turn!

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.777 position:50% align:center
Keep the timing tight!

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.404 position:50% align:center
You, stay on beat!

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI gasps]

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50% align:center
So pretty.

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.539 position:50% align:center
The way she moves
her hands, so elegant!

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
She's really amazing!

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMI]
Let's take a 15-minute break!

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.172 position:50% align:center
You look kinda worn out.
You okay?

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
Really? Yeah, I'm fine.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna hit the bathroom.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:20.143 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
Excuse me, you dropped this!

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
Oh, how'd I manage that?

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.438 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.774 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what's your name, hon?

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50% align:center
I'm Chiaki Sawada!

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
Um, I just have to say,

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.030 position:50% align:center
I absolutely loved your
performance as Juliet

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
way back when!

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:34.366 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.076 position:50% align:center
I'm stunned someone
your age has seen it!

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.327 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
I have!

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.662 position:50% align:center
And, uh, we just did a
scene from that show,

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
and I actually got
to play Juliet!

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.042 position:50% align:center
And the whole time,
all I could think about

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.503 position:50% align:center
was how I wanted to be
as lovely as you were!

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.921 position:50% align:center
You inspired me!

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
[MIREI]
Thank you! I'm so glad.

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
Now, let's both give it our
all at the Sports Festival.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am!

00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
Chika! Did you see?

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.352 position:50% align:center
Stop blabbing. The second
years will yell at us again.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:03.895 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's right!

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.900 position:50% align:center
Would you look at how young
and energetic they are?

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:10.902 position:50% align:center
Come on, you're
young, too, Kiyomi!

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
You could be in high school.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.948 position:50% align:center
Yeah? You think I could
rock a sailor uniform?

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
Oh, shoot!

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
I forgot that Akiha told me
I should let everyone know

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:23.123 position:50% align:center
we'll be practicing
our march next time.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
And now, most of the
students have already left.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:28.837 position:50% align:center
All except one.

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:31.965 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know her!

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
That's Juliet!

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:36.803 position:50% align:center
Miss First-year Juliet!

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
Could I possibly get your
help with something?

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:49.024 position:50% align:center
Wasn't that...

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
It was Chika, right?

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
But I heard Mirei say "Juliet."

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
I guess she must've
thought she was Chiaki.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
My bet is...

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
...Mirei doesn't know
there are two of them.

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
Mirei is so pretty!

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:05.832 position:50% align:center
She's a goddess come to Earth,
and Mommy's favorite!

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
I like her too!

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.376 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me too!

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:13.173 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] When we got older, we
planned to be Kouka actresses.

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
That was all we ever dreamed of.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
But then, the first
time we auditioned...

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
No! How could this happen?

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
Why did Chika
get in and I didn't?

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI'S DAD] I assume Chiaki
is still up in her room?

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:29.606 position:50% align:center
That's right, and she hasn't
eaten for three days, either.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:32.734 position:50% align:center
I went to check on her, but
she still won't open the door.

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.319 position:50% align:center
I don't know what to do.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Chiaki, open up.

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
Listen, I think...

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
I think I'm gonna turn down
my admissions offer.

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:46.623 position:50% align:center
So next year,
we can both try again.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
We can do this.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:56.132 position:50% align:center
We'll work hard
and get in together.

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI] I'm sorry, but I'm a
little confused right now.

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.432 position:50% align:center
I called out to you.

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:06.017 position:50% align:center
I asked for your help,
but you ignored me

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
and walked away!

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:09.229 position:50% align:center
I swear, I didn't.

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:11.356 position:50% align:center
[MIREI]
You looked right at me!

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
I've done nothing wrong.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
After all, it's not like I'm
the one who played Juliet.

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
For the members of our troupe,

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
good manners are valued
more than any stage skill.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
We believe you can't put on
a truly lovely performance

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
if you're not lovely
on the inside.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.957 position:50% align:center
A good person speaks
when they're spoken to.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.333 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
We're not interchangeable.

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
I'm not Chiaki.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:33.378 position:50% align:center
All right, girls, let's move on.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
It's time that we
begin our rehearsal--

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
S'cuse me!

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
I think there's been a mistake!

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] There was one show
in particular I remember

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
going to when we were kids.

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
During the revue, two cute
bunny rabbits came out.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
Oh, my gosh,
look at the bunnies!

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center
They're so cute!

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
And it looks like they're twins!

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:56.526 position:50% align:center
Which means
they're exactly like us!

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
We walked at the same pace
with the same footsteps.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.406 position:50% align:center
We lived our lives
in perfect symmetry

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
from the day we were born.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.618 position:50% align:center
And even if we'd never
end up front and center,

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.538 position:50% align:center
I knew we could always
stand on opposite sides,

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
framing any performance
beautifully, as only we could.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.877 position:50% align:center
I never thought it would change.

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:16.796 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI] Miss Watanabe was
able to explain the mix-up

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.214 position:50% align:center
to the Superiors.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:21.634 position:50% align:center
As such, the first-year students
will not be penalized.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJOU] One, two, three!
One, two, three!

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center
And finish it strong!

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Right!

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
Only three rehearsals left.

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:33.897 position:50% align:center
You know what that means.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
Practice on your own
if you feel you need it.

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Yes, ma'am!

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
Mirei hates me.

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:46.242 position:50% align:center
I mean, she wouldn't
even look at me today.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:49.329 position:50% align:center
And come to think of it,
Superior Ichijou didn't, either.

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
If they weren't talking to you,
it only means that.

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:52.999 position:50% align:center
It's not about you.

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding?

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:57.003 position:50% align:center
Would it kill you to be
supportive for once?

00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:59.547 position:50% align:center
I'm always supporting
you, Chiaki.

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.510 position:50% align:center
If you can call resenting
me "supporting."

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.053 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:06.554 position:50% align:center
Why're you always like this?

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:08.431 position:50% align:center
You always make me the bad guy!

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:09.933 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, maybe that's
because you're always

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.476 position:50% align:center
being the bad guy!

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.812 position:50% align:center
--[CHIKA] No, I am not!
--[CHIAKI] You are too!

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.897 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] I'm always the
one who gives in to you!

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? Is that
how you actually feel?

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.318 position:50% align:center
That's right!
I was a complete idiot

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
to turn down my
first admission offer!

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:27.242 position:50% align:center
Because there was no guarantee
that you'd ever get in!

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:28.451 position:50% align:center
That's pretty harsh.

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
Fine.

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
I'm running away, then!

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
--Take my bed!
--[SARASA] Huh?!

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
So, looks like I'll be
swapping rooms with Chiaki

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.256 position:50% align:center
for a bit.

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:44.217 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.719 position:50% align:center
It's so cute!

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.013 position:50% align:center
And how cool that you
get to room together!

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
Good thing you like
the same stuff, huh?

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.933 position:50% align:center
They said that we
should stick together

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:54.394 position:50% align:center
in case one of us had
an issue or anything.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:55.854 position:50% align:center
It would be easier to call home.

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
I love how close you guys are!

00:14:58.148 --> 00:14:59.190 position:50% align:center
I'm totally jealous.

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
Growing up, it was
always just me.

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout before.

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:06.364 position:50% align:center
Hey! No worries at all!

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:07.991 position:50% align:center
I think I'm a horrible person.

00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:12.328 position:50% align:center
We've never had
a fight like that before,

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:14.039 position:50% align:center
nothing even close.

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
We were always on the same page,

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.292 position:50% align:center
knowing how the other felt
without ever having

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:18.585 position:50% align:center
to say a word.

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
Or maybe I only thought we did.

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:24.549 position:50% align:center
I guess I was wrong.

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:33.725 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJOU]
Are you sure?

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
You're positive you don't want
to say anything to them yet?

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm-- Yes, I'm positive.

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
I feel terrible for them,
but I have my reasons.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.573 position:50% align:center
What's the tea?

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.533 position:50% align:center
Are the twins still
fighting or what?

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
Since I'm still stuck
in their dorm room,

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.870 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go with "yes."

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:55.246 position:50% align:center
The festival is almost here.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
Are they gonna be ready?

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:58.958 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJOU] Oh, wow, you're
all still here working?

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:00.335 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Superior Ichijou!

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:01.336 position:50% align:center
Good afternoon!

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:02.420 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJOU]
Aww, what's this?

00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
You're making pom-poms?

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.549 position:50% align:center
I got admitted to Kouka
after I graduated

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
from middle school.

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.594 position:50% align:center
I remember what this is like.

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
They held a festival
my first year, too.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.348 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50% align:center
It's kind of hard to believe
that this is my fourth one!

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:18.812 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sawa, our lovely
fairy is sharing stats

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:20.897 position:50% align:center
that give away her age!

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.857 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJOU]
Oh, hey, Pigtails.

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.067 position:50% align:center
The other day...

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center
I was impressed when
you spoke up like that.

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
I love that you have
courage to stand up

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
for your friends even
when it's not easy.

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:32.867 position:50% align:center
You truly embody
the Kouka spirit!

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:34.202 position:50% align:center
I have that?

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center
Kouka spirit?

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
Great, cue freakout.

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:40.959 position:50% align:center
So, why don't you take turns
sharing your dream roles?

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.043 position:50% align:center
Ooh!

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
I've always wanted
to be Lady Oscar!

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:46.131 position:50% align:center
I got to see the live
show ten years ago.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.550 position:50% align:center
My grandma took me
and it was incredible!

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.010 position:50% align:center
Ten years ago, huh?

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Yeah!

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.762 position:50% align:center
We were up on the second floor,

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
but I could still see
the real-life Oscar,

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:58.268 position:50% align:center
and she was literally
the coolest person ever!

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?
RoV is such a popular show.

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
How about you girls?

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:05.692 position:50% align:center
I've always wanted the role
of Death in Elizabeth!

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
I don't care about dream roles--

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy in whatever
part I'm offered!

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
I think what I'd love
most in the world

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
is to sing as an Etoile!

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.912 position:50% align:center
I want to be...

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:19.205 position:50% align:center
What do I want?

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.416 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
A bunny girl.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:25.587 position:50% align:center
I saw these bunny girls
at the revue once.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.172 position:50% align:center
They were really cute.

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
That's what I've always wanted.

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.134 position:50% align:center
To be a dancing twin bunny.

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
I think I always knew.

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
I knew that Chiaki regretted
what I did for her.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
Probably right after I did it.

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
When admits were finally
announced after our second time

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
through the process, she
looked for my number first.

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:49.652 position:50% align:center
It's there! You're up there!

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center
You made it in again, sis!

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.784 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] I'd never seen
her cry like that.

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:58.161 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
We did it! We both got in!

00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:07.921 position:50% align:center
Oh, good, there you are.

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting
for you for a bit.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.092 position:50% align:center
You're the one who looked at
me and then walked away

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
when I called, isn't that right?

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:19.891 position:50% align:center
I'd like to know why
you didn't say anything.

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
'Cause... she was Juliet
when I couldn't be.

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
I've always loved your
performance in that role too,

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
just like she did.

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:31.528 position:50% align:center
But I didn't have the courage
to say I wanted the part.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
I watched my sister get
to play Juliet in her group

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:35.699 position:50% align:center
and be praised for it.

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
Then, when she was having
so much fun with you

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
when I was as big of a fan...

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
Guess I started to feel
a little jealous.

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:45.959 position:50% align:center
Then I realized, even though
we did everything together,

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
I was always the one who
got the short end of the stick.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:53.008 position:50% align:center
Those thoughts kept
on coming, and my heart,

00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:54.426 position:50% align:center
it just got colder.

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:58.972 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry I let this happen.

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
Yes, so am I.

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:04.602 position:50% align:center
Everybody gets jealous
sometimes, you know.

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
Especially in Kouka,
where the hierarchy

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.815 position:50% align:center
can be hard to get used to.

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center
But try not to let those
negative emotions control you.

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
Turn that jealousy into
ambition if you can.

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
It's challenging, but I
know you'll be okay.

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
You didn't let your
jealousy control you.

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
You came here to
apologize instead.

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
If you ask me, that speaks
volumes about you.

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center
Trust that this experience will
only make you stronger.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA crying]

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
You've worked so hard.

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] Ah! You guys aren't
fighting anymore!

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
That's so great!

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
I guess that means I get
to go back home now!

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
Welcome back.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center
You know what?

00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:46.853 position:50% align:center
We didn't get to hear what role
you wanted to play, Chika!

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.980 position:50% align:center
Is it your dream to be
a twin bunny, too?

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
It's so cute that you guys
are already twins,

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
but you wanna be
twins on stage, too!

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.909 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
She sure figured us out.

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sarasa, of all people.

00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50% align:center
So weird.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.874 position:50% align:center
I know something now,
and I've known it ever since

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.293 position:50% align:center
I didn't get in last year.

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Chika.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me too.

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
We aren't exactly
the same anymore.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:20.428 position:50% align:center
We've come upon our
first fork in the road.

00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:23.348 position:50% align:center
It showed up earlier
than we expected, but...

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.768 position:50% align:center
Do I know any roles for twins?

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.436 position:50% align:center
Well, that's kinda tough.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
Sisters typically get sent
to different Kouka troupes,

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
you see.

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
But you know, if you
strategize and work hard

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:38.029 position:50% align:center
to earn yourselves
some fans of your own

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
in the coming years, then,
at the next Sports Festival,

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:43.618 position:50% align:center
you could walk out together,
and the crowd would go crazy!

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
She's right.

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:49.749 position:50% align:center
Our paths will merge
together again one day.

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
They look happy now,
don't you think?

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.673 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] I loved all my
school sports festivals!

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.800 position:50% align:center
My grandpa and neighbors
would make tons of bentos

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
for everyone to eat, and
we would stuff our faces.

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:04.931 position:50% align:center
I was just happy that so many
people were rooting for us!

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:07.100 position:50% align:center
Though it was kind
of embarrassing.

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
Did you have fun at your
school festivals, Ai-Ai?

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
Lemme think.

00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure the last one I went
to was in the fourth grade.

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:16.609 position:50% align:center
Taichi ordered these
huge bentos that had

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:18.194 position:50% align:center
way too much food.

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:19.738 position:50% align:center
It stressed me out.

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:21.489 position:50% align:center
I don't remember it being fun.

00:21:21.573 --> 00:21:24.242 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, that's a shame.

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I totally ruined the moment!

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:28.204 position:50% align:center
We'll have to make sure
this sports festival

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:30.582 position:50% align:center
is the funnest one ever! Right?

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.712 position:50% align:center
[CAMERAMAN]
Okay, stand by!

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:36.921 position:50% align:center
We're rolling!

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center
We are the combined
Superior Student team,

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:42.218 position:50% align:center
and we're gonna crush
the competition!

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:43.470 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.182 position:50% align:center
[REO]
Hey, Akiha, what's up?

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
Hard at work, I see.

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
Oh, Reo!

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center
We have a little problem.
You have a sec?

00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:54.898 position:50% align:center
As luck would have it,
one of our runners

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:57.359 position:50% align:center
for the relay race just
sprained her ankle,

00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:59.152 position:50% align:center
so we need an alternate plan.

00:21:59.235 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!
Is she gonna be all right?

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:02.739 position:50% align:center
[REO]
Yeah, she's fine.

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:05.825 position:50% align:center
But what management suggests
is that we try to find someone

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:08.328 position:50% align:center
from the Superior
team to sub in.

00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:11.081 position:50% align:center
I see. Let me think.

00:22:11.164 --> 00:22:12.082 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:14.125 position:50% align:center
Since we're in our
centennial year,

00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:16.294 position:50% align:center
let's have one of our
centennial students sub in

00:22:16.378 --> 00:22:17.754 position:50% align:center
for her instead!
