who were said to be more
gentlemanly than 'real' men,

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.920 position:50% align:center
and earned the troupe
huge swaths of female fans.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.049 position:50% align:center

to train the troupe's next big stars,

Oh, you took my picture
with the cherry tree!

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:25.037 position:50% align:center
The cherry tree?

00:12:25.037 --> 00:12:27.289 position:50% align:center
So you made it in, too!

00:12:27.289 --> 00:12:31.460 position:50% align:center
She didn't recognize Naracchi?
Here I thought everyone knew the JPX48.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.755 position:50% align:center
Maybe she doesn't have a TV.

00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:35.756 position:50% align:center
Or maybe...

00:12:35.756 --> 00:12:37.424 position:50% align:center
She's doing it on purpose!

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:39.134 position:50% align:center
She's gonna hear you!

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:43.305 position:50% align:center
I totally forgot to
ask your name back then!

00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:45.224 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:12:45.224 --> 00:12:47.893 position:50% align:center
--I hope we can be friends!
--Excuse me, you two, please be quiet.

00:12:47.893 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
<i>You two?!</i>

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:52.064 position:50% align:center
How the hell did <i>she </i>get in?

00:12:52.064 --> 00:12:56.485 position:50% align:center
First off, you're <i>not </i>rotten, Ai.

00:12:56.485 --> 00:12:59.738 position:50% align:center
And this is interesting. You usually don't
take this much interest in others.

00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
I'm <i>not </i>interested in her.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.536 position:50% align:center
Sarasa Watanabe was admitted on
the recommendations of two teachers:

00:13:05.536 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
Andou-<i>sensei</i>, the acting teacher;
and Ohki-<i>sensei</i>, the history teacher.

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:14.378 position:50% align:center
She's not what we'd usually admit, sure.
But this is our centennial year!

00:13:14.378 --> 00:13:17.589 position:50% align:center
Let's get creative, be a little daring!

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:21.885 position:50% align:center
She barely knows any ballet, and her
singing voice is hardly Kouka material,

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:25.222 position:50% align:center
but between her incredible height
and her utter fearlessness,

00:13:25.222 --> 00:13:27.516 position:50% align:center
we might be able to make her into a star!

00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
Number 0251, Sarasa Watanabe!

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:33.564 position:50% align:center
Thanks for having me today!

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:36.942 position:50% align:center
Her fearlessness?

00:13:36.942 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
You "got creative" and
"want to make her a star"?

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:42.281 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't play with your food.

00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
She's from Asakusa and
lives with her grandfather.

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:48.078 position:50% align:center
She wasn't born in the lap of luxury.

00:13:54.168 --> 00:13:57.880 position:50% align:center line:10%
"SUBJ: I'm in Kobe"
"Hey, mom, I know you probably
don't care, but I got into Kouka."

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.922 position:50% align:center line:10%
"SUBJ: I'm in Kobe"
"Hey, mom"                                
She went on about how she "had to get
back to Asakusa," but kept stopping...

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:04.261 position:50% align:center line:10%
   
    
She went on about how she "had to get
back to Asakusa," but kept stopping...

00:14:07.598 --> 00:14:10.184 position:50% align:center
Oh, I gotta text Keiko!

00:14:10.184 --> 00:14:14.313 position:50% align:center
"I got into Kouka!"

00:14:14.313 --> 00:14:19.318 position:50% align:center
"Headed home on the Shinkansen soon!"

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.906 position:50% align:center
Ooh, Sho-<i>chan</i>!

00:14:23.906 --> 00:14:27.868 position:50% align:center
"I got into Kouka!"

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:32.080 position:50% align:center
"Headed home on the Shinkansen soon!"

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.707 position:50% align:center
And sent!

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:37.503 position:50% align:center
Wait, I forgot Takubo!

00:14:37.503 --> 00:14:40.797 position:50% align:center
"I got into Kouka!"

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:42.716 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait...

00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:46.303 position:50% align:center
What a moron.

00:14:48.222 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
Why didn't she just send a group text?

00:14:56.313 --> 00:14:58.232 position:50% align:center line:10%
"SUBJ: I'm in Kobe"
"Hey, mom"                                

00:14:58.232 --> 00:14:58.649 position:50% align:center line:10%
"SUBJ: I'm in Kobe"

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.903 position:50% align:center
Welcome. What's your name?

00:15:02.903 --> 00:15:04.279 position:50% align:center
Ai Narata.

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:08.033 position:50% align:center
Oh, I think I saw you on TV--

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:10.869 position:50% align:center
Right, I shouldn't mention
any of that. Sorry, honey.

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:14.748 position:50% align:center
First-year students are on the third
and fourth floors of Dorm #2.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center
You'll be in a double in room 302.

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.670 position:50% align:center
Thank you, ma'am.

00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:24.883 position:50% align:center
There's no stench of men. I love it.

00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:28.804 position:50% align:center
Today I begin my nice, relaxing life.

00:15:34.685 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
Oh! You're that girl!

00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center line:10%
"Ai Narata"
"Sarasa Watanabe"

00:15:43.527 --> 00:15:45.070 position:50% align:center
Can I change rooms?

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:50.409 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but no, Narata-<i>san</i>.
Nobody gets special treatment here.

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:56.498 position:50% align:center
I totally thought they'd
separate us 'cause we're twins.

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
Isn't this awesome, Chiaki?!

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:02.671 position:50% align:center
We're gonna be together
forever and ever, Chika!

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:05.841 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Together forever, Chiaki!

00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
Wow. So even though your mom
and grandma were <i>musume-yaku</i>,

00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
you want to be an <i>otoko-yaku</i>, Hoshino-<i>san</i>?

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:16.602 position:50% align:center
You also want to be an <i>otoko-yaku</i>,
right, Sugimoto-<i>san</i>?

00:16:16.602 --> 00:16:19.938 position:50% align:center
That's right. The biggest Kouka stars
are their top <i>otoko-yaku </i>actresses.

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:22.232 position:50% align:center
We might end up as rivals someday.

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:26.445 position:50% align:center
Just so you know,
I'll do whatever it takes to win.

00:16:26.445 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
I'll keep that in mind.

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:30.032 position:50% align:center
They're scary...

00:16:31.575 --> 00:16:34.036 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're back!

00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:35.913 position:50% align:center
What's all that?

00:16:35.913 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
I went to the hardware store.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
I just <i>really </i>need my privacy.

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:46.965 position:50% align:center
Wow, you're so handy, Ai-<i>chan</i>!

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
<i>Ai-chan?</i>

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:51.512 position:50% align:center
I read your name off the card
on the door! Ai Narata, right?

00:16:51.512 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
Can I call you Ai-<i>chan</i>?

00:16:57.476 --> 00:16:58.977 position:50% align:center
Don't violate my border!

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:00.896 position:50% align:center
Violate your what?

00:17:00.896 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
Stay on your side!

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
I can't help it! I'm too tall
to stretch out on my side!

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:07.778 position:50% align:center
Then don't stretch out on the floor!

00:17:07.778 --> 00:17:10.364 position:50% align:center
I just vacuumed it, so it's all clean!

00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
You should come lay down
with me! It feels really nice!

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
H-Hey!

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:25.546 position:50% align:center
The next day, we started our preliminary
week of classes: Guidance Week.

00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:33.554 position:50% align:center
On the final day, disaster struck.

00:17:33.554 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center
What? But I'm here at the usual time!

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
We told you that we'd be meeting
a half hour early today.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
Come now, fall in line.

00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:47.109 position:50% align:center
What a mean trick to pull on the last day!

00:17:47.109 --> 00:17:50.028 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you wake me up, Ai-<i>chan</i>?!

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:57.578 position:50% align:center
I'm Captain Anai from
the Itami Military Base Security Force.

00:17:57.578 --> 00:18:00.831 position:50% align:center
Ballet, modern dance, music,
traditional dance, classical theater.

00:18:00.831 --> 00:18:03.333 position:50% align:center
You've spent this Guidance Week
practicing artistic disciplines.

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
Today, however, I'll be teaching you
how to move and act in synchrony.

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:11.967 position:50% align:center
Wow, the JSDF is here?

00:18:11.967 --> 00:18:13.886 position:50% align:center
What's he mean by "synchrony"?

00:18:13.886 --> 00:18:17.222 position:50% align:center
In theater terms, we'd say
stage awareness, or moving in sync.

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:19.308 position:50% align:center
You girls! No chit-chat!

00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:23.270 position:50% align:center
Form four groups of ten!

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.564 position:50% align:center
We're going to practice marching
and standing at attention!

00:18:25.564 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
Line up!

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
One! Two! One! Two!

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.740 position:50% align:center
One! Two! One! Two!

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.452 position:50% align:center
I love having Captain Anai every year.
He's such a character.

00:18:38.452 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
I love him, too.

00:18:40.412 --> 00:18:43.540 position:50% align:center
He's getting quite passionate
about this group of girls.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center
Usually he leaves at lunch,
but he's still here.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:50.339 position:50% align:center
Likely because there's that one group
that can't seem to get it right.

00:18:50.339 --> 00:18:55.886 position:50% align:center
And our first-year student policy is
if one group stays, everyone stays.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.269 position:50% align:center
Oh, there's Naracchi! She's so cute!

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:07.523 position:50% align:center
You sure love your JPX, huh, Hijiri?

00:19:07.523 --> 00:19:11.652 position:50% align:center
What're you guys doing here?
Scoping out the first years for later?

00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:14.238 position:50% align:center
--No, we're here to
cheer them on, Andou-<i>sensei</i>!

00:19:14.238 --> 00:19:16.698 position:50% align:center
--Halt!
--No, we're here to
cheer them on, Andou-<i>sensei</i>!

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:20.410 position:50% align:center
One more time! Forward march!

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.454 position:50% align:center
Left, right, one, two!

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:24.498 position:50% align:center
One, two! One, two!

00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
One, two! One, two! One, two!

00:19:28.126 --> 00:19:29.962 position:50% align:center
Halt!

00:19:30.963 --> 00:19:34.925 position:50% align:center
Something's just not right.

00:19:34.925 --> 00:19:37.511 position:50% align:center
You, you,

00:19:37.511 --> 00:19:39.555 position:50% align:center
you, and you.

00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:42.099 position:50% align:center
Line up and give it a go.

00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
Salute!

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:48.939 position:50% align:center
At ease!

00:19:48.939 --> 00:19:50.774 position:50% align:center
Attention!

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.819 position:50% align:center
Arm right, and out!

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
You.

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
Y-Yes, sir!

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
You're trying too hard to follow everyone.
You're always a second off.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:10.544 position:50% align:center
Focus on getting the timing right
and trust your group.

00:20:10.544 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:12.713 position:50% align:center
You.

00:20:12.713 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:17.885 position:50% align:center
You're a bit fast. Don't try to stand out.

00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:21.138 position:50% align:center
Learn to adjust to move with the group.

00:20:21.138 --> 00:20:23.056 position:50% align:center
But I was...

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.559 position:50% align:center
Now, you.

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:28.020 position:50% align:center
Your core's weak and
your posture's not straight.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:33.108 position:50% align:center
I know you're coming from the idol world,
but here's not the place to be cutesy.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:34.776 position:50% align:center
Give it your all!

00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:40.532 position:50% align:center
I don't like being touched, sir.

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:46.455 position:50% align:center
I just don't get girls your age.
My daughter won't even let me hug her.

00:20:46.455 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
But that's the world we live in now,
where everything's "sexual harassment."

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:52.044 position:50% align:center
Exhausting, but us guys
gotta watch ourselves, too.

00:20:52.044 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
Right then, you're last.

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
Hot <i>damn</i>, you're tall.

00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:58.592 position:50% align:center
And that's sexual harassment, sir!

00:20:58.592 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center
It is? My apologies, then.

00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:06.350 position:50% align:center
Right, then, you're <i>tall</i>. Your arms and
legs are long. You've got a big wingspan.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
So you need to consider your surroundings
a second earlier than the rest.

00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
Other than that, you're good!

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
Really? Yay, I got a perfect score!

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
Would it be all right if I
gave your shoulder a shove?

00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:21.198 position:50% align:center
Sure, go ahead!

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:30.207 position:50% align:center
You've got strong legs and a good core,
just as I expected. I'm impressed!

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.336 position:50% align:center
--Now, let's put that critique
to work and try that again!

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
--Hold on, sir!
--Now, let's put that critique
to work and try that again!

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:37.840 position:50% align:center
That wasn't fair. I wasn't ready!

00:21:45.222 --> 00:21:48.433 position:50% align:center
I won't move an inch from this spot!

00:21:56.275 --> 00:21:58.151 position:50% align:center
Incredible!

00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:00.529 position:50% align:center
Would you like to join the JSDF, miss?

00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:02.239 position:50% align:center
He's "miss"-ing her now?!

00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:07.744 position:50% align:center
Nope! I'm gonna join the Kouka Revue
and play Lady Oscar!

00:22:07.744 --> 00:22:09.329 position:50% align:center
Did you hear that?

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:10.914 position:50% align:center
Sure did.

00:22:13.542 --> 00:22:16.295 position:50% align:center
W-Well, this is scary...

00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:22.718 position:50% align:center
Hey, Watanabe! You know
what that means, right?

00:22:22.718 --> 00:22:26.638 position:50% align:center
It means you're aspiring to be
one of the Kouka Revue's top stars!

00:22:31.852 --> 00:22:38.358 position:50% align:center
Really? Then sure, I'll do that!
I'll be a top star!

00:22:38.358 --> 00:22:42.529 position:50% align:center
There are four troupes:
Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.

00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:47.242 position:50% align:center
Out of 320 actresses, only one from
each troupe gets to be its top star.

00:22:47.242 --> 00:22:51.079 position:50% align:center
Only four actresses earn that honor.

00:22:51.079 --> 00:22:52.789 position:50% align:center
Well, all right.

00:22:54.124 --> 00:22:55.751 position:50% align:center
Doesn't bother me.

00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:58.629 position:50% align:center
I don't care about all that.

00:22:58.629 --> 00:23:01.048 position:50% align:center
Ai-<i>chan</i>! Where are you?

00:23:01.048 --> 00:23:04.551 position:50% align:center
Ai-<i>chan</i>! Let's walk back
to the dorm together!

00:23:04.551 --> 00:23:06.345 position:50% align:center
Ai-<i>chan</i>?

00:23:07.095 --> 00:23:09.431 position:50% align:center
She's not here, either...

00:23:13.268 --> 00:23:15.437 position:50% align:center
What is this, a horror movie?

00:23:15.437 --> 00:23:19.107 position:50% align:center
What was that weird pose
Watanabe did back there?

00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:20.692 position:50% align:center
A kickboxing move?

00:23:20.692 --> 00:23:23.028 position:50% align:center
I thought it was capoeira,
or some kind of martial art move.

00:23:23.028 --> 00:23:25.155 position:50% align:center
It was a <i>fumidashi</i>.

00:23:25.155 --> 00:23:28.909 position:50% align:center
Wait, Kirishima-<i>sensei</i>,
you mean like in sumo wrestling?

00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:33.789 position:50% align:center
No. It's a special move that Sukeroku
does in his <i>deha </i>entrance.

00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:36.166 position:50% align:center
His <i>deha </i>what?

00:23:36.166 --> 00:23:38.126 position:50% align:center
It's from a kabuki play.

00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:40.629 position:50% align:center
Kabuki?

"Ex-JPX star Ai Narata
accepted to Kouka School!"
I finally found you...

00:24:08.782 --> 00:24:12.995 position:50% align:center
I finally found you, Ai-<i>chan</i>!

00:24:12.995 --> 00:24:15.122 position:50% align:center
Let's walk back together!

00:24:15.122 --> 00:24:19.585 position:50% align:center
Sheesh, where were you?
I was looking all over for you!
