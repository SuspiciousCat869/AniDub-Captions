--[AI] Sarasa.
--Huh?

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
You're sad.
I can read your mind.

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
I have superpowers, you know.

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.532 position:50% align:center
So, what can I do?

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.409 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Uh...

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:38.663 position:50% align:center
You can't walk down the
hanamichi anymore, but soon,

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:41.291 position:50% align:center
we'll walk the Kouka
silver bridge together.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:20.932 position:50% align:center
[AI] Refreshed from
their summer vacation,

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:23.935 position:50% align:center
the students of the Kouka School
of Musical and Theatrical Arts

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.980 position:50% align:center
returned to campus, focused
on readying themselves

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:29.649 position:50% align:center
for the demands
of a new semester.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.609 position:50% align:center
I forgot how much
hotter it gets here!

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.611 position:50% align:center
You guys went up north
to Hokkaido, right?

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.989 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and it's super cool
there in the summertime.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.575 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO] I got to see two of
the Spring Troupe's shows!

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:41.202 position:50% align:center
I have to say, Ryuu
Asahina's performance?

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:43.079 position:50% align:center
Transcendent!

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.082 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! Kaoru!

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.211 position:50% align:center
You totally cut your hair!

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.671 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it was too hot.

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:53.214 position:50% align:center
It looks amazing!

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:56.051 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] Your hair's so pretty;
you can pull off any length!

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.553 position:50% align:center
Well, I do want to
be an otoko-yaku,

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:01.264 position:50% align:center
so I figured now's the time to
just bite the bullet and cut it.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:02.974 position:50% align:center
You look crazy handsome!

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:04.517 position:50% align:center
How're you so cool?

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.395 position:50% align:center
C'mon, literally everyone who
wants this cuts their hair!

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
She's bashful.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.357 position:50% align:center
Kaoru's actually embarrassed.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.941 position:50% align:center
Aw, you totally are!

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.401 position:50% align:center
Would you get over it?

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
What the hell is wrong with
you and Naracchi, anyway?

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
I mean, how many
times have I told you

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.033 position:50% align:center
that you need to act like pros?

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
News flash: pros would
never let themselves

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
get a freakin' suntan!

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Really dumb move.

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center
And don't pretend like you're
not in trouble too, Ai!

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
I didn't know.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.089 position:50% align:center
I was having so much
fun I didn't realize.

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
And I'd never even
thought about that.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.677 position:50% align:center
Of course you didn't,
and that's the problem!

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.473 position:50% align:center
Real Kouka actors would
never be so careless.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
So harsh!

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO] Kaoru's sure
not one to hold back.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A] Hey, why does
Kaoru always walk around

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:54.984 position:50% align:center
with an umbrella?

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
Who knows?

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A] A teacher
told her to lose it once,

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
but she argued that there's
no school rule against them,

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.409 position:50% align:center
so there wasn't much
they could do about it!

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] Apparently, she
plans on being an actress

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
or something, so she wants
to keep her skin flawless.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS laugh]

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT D] So, yeah, after
that, I decided to post it!

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
Just to see what would happen!

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.047 position:50% align:center
No! You're so bad!

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
Hey, look.
Do you see that guy?

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
Yeah, him.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
He's on our baseball team.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.515 position:50% align:center
--[STUDENT C] Is he?
--[STUDENT D] C'mon, you know!

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
He's related to that
hot major leaguer.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
Ah! Interesting.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.855 position:50% align:center
Too bad he's not hot, though.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C]
What do you think?

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
Are they finally gonna be able
to take us to Koshien this year?

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.863 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Would you look at her?

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.781 position:50% align:center
Always carrying that
fancy umbrella.

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.241 position:50% align:center
Who does she think she is?

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:44.743 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C] Oh, yeah,
she actually went to my

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
middle school.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.495 position:50% align:center
Apparently, her goal
is to be accepted

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
at the Kouka theater school,

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
but she still hasn't
managed to get in yet.

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
My family lives near the ocean,

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.057 position:50% align:center
where the sun is
always beating down.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
It's hard to avoid it,
especially during these

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.643 position:50% align:center
hot summer months.

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:12.854 position:50% align:center
I do what I can to keep
my skin protected,

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:14.981 position:50% align:center
but there's not much
I can do about the heat.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
[FAN A]
Thank the stars above.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're
feeling better, Mari!

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:25.784 position:50% align:center
[FAN B] I was so scared when I
heard you were in the hospital!

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:28.370 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
Yes, come on in!

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
Hi, Grandma.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.082 position:50% align:center
How're you feeling today?

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50% align:center
Oh, my dear Kaoru!

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.169 position:50% align:center
It's so nice of you to visit.

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] My grandmother
was a top musume-yaku

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
of the Kouka Acting Troupe.

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center
They called her "Spring's
Lovely Snow White."

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:47.097 position:50% align:center
Even now, she's constantly
surrounded by fans.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness!
Is this really her?

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
That's right! My granddaughter.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
Hello, dear.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure to meet you!

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
[MARI] She's already
a senior in high school!

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.899 position:50% align:center
[FAN A]
Is she?

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
That means I guess she must
be breaking from tradition

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.612 position:50% align:center
and won't be joining the
Kouka troupe, then, huh?

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.074 position:50% align:center
Actually, this is her
last year to apply,

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:08.743 position:50% align:center
so she's been buckling down
and giving it all she's got.

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.745 position:50% align:center
Oh, how inspiring, such drive!

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.747 position:50% align:center
We'll certainly be
rooting for you, hon!

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:13.998 position:50% align:center
Break a leg!

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.254 position:50% align:center
Your kidney stone surgery
must have been so scary.

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
Though with the way you sparkle,

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they found
a diamond in there!

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.635 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] Everyone must
be so disappointed.

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
After all, I hardly
look the part.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C]
Semester's finally over!

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
We should hit karaoke
on the way home!

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.520 position:50% align:center
Can't. Got plans
with the boyfriend.

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50% align:center
You in, Kaoru?

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.024 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] Nope. I've got
lessons every day from now on.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT E]
Seriously?

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.318 position:50% align:center
Man, Kaoru's gotten
even more weird.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.364 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] All I want in the
world is to be an otoko-yaku!

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.370 position:50% align:center
One of the fearless
actresses who play male roles!

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.005 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I was in the
middle of class.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's fine, but could
you stop by the hospital

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center
on your way home?

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50% align:center
Grandma mentioned a
book she'd like picked up.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.804 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Yeah, sure.

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.473 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Thanks! I appreciate it.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.861 position:50% align:center
[TSUJI]
Uh, hey.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
Those girls the other day,
they said you were trying out

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.160 position:50% align:center
for some acting troupe.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:35.372 position:50% align:center
Turns out, my grandma is
a big fan of their shows,

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.541 position:50% align:center
so she gave me some
questions to ask if I saw you.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center
'Kay, like what?

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.711 position:50% align:center
Like first, what's your name?

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.007 position:50% align:center
That was a dumb way to ask, huh.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A]
Excuse me!

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:51.388 position:50% align:center
You're Tsuji from
South High, aren't you?

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.640 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, that's right.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A] I just wanted to say
good luck in the Koshien

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:58.478 position:50% align:center
prelims.
Also, take this letter.

00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
And could you do me
a favor and give it to

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
your brother Kaito
as soon as possible?

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center
It's just I really,
really like him.

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
Whenever I'm feeling down,
I watch him play

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.366 position:50% align:center
and it makes me feel better.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.493 position:50% align:center
I know he's headed off
to the major leagues,

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.954 position:50% align:center
and he's engaged
to that model, Seira,

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:18.415 position:50% align:center
but I'd really appreciate it if
you'd give him my letter!

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center
[TSUJI]
I want no part in that.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50% align:center
I'm not my brother's keeper.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
But, I just--

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center
[TSUJI] The school and my
brother really discourage this.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.683 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A crying]
I'm sorry!

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.145 position:50% align:center
[GIRL B]
You okay?

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:43.273 position:50% align:center
[TSUJI]
Always the worst.

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50% align:center
It's Kaoru.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
That's my name.
Kaoru Hoshino.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
And what's yours?

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.952 position:50% align:center
[TSUJI]
Rikuto Tsuji.

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:01.916 position:50% align:center
So, you're gonna go
to the Kouka School?

Hold on!

[BOY A]
No, we're gonna miss it!

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
Shall we?

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
Sounds good.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:48.258 position:50% align:center
Are you hungry?
Hot okonomiyaki!

00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
So, you've been winning
all your games!

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
[TSUJI]
Oh, mm-hmm.

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Four so far, right?

00:16:58.268 --> 00:16:59.269 position:50% align:center
[TSUJI]
Yeah.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Wow.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.445 position:50% align:center
And it's cool to hang out
instead of practicing?

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:16.077 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's the matter
with you today?

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.791 position:50% align:center
[TSUJI] I feel like I've been
doing well recently,

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:25.587 position:50% align:center
but I still haven't gotten a
chance to play in a game.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
Makes me wonder why
I'm trying so hard.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
I grew up playing baseball
with my older brother.

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:34.429 position:50% align:center
And since he's so talented,
everyone expected me

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:35.805 position:50% align:center
to be good at it, too.

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:40.060 position:50% align:center
I figured I needed
to live up to that,

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:43.146 position:50% align:center
so I joined the team
without a second thought.

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.148 position:50% align:center
But I keep wondering
if I'm wasting my time

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:48.193 position:50% align:center
forcing myself to do this.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.862 position:50% align:center
I bet you feel
the same. Anyway--

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] Why does everyone
always assume that's how I feel?

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:04.709 position:50% align:center
I don't. I never have.

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
Sure, the pressure
gets to me sometimes,

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center
but this is something
I want to do!

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:12.467 position:50% align:center
I've never had to force myself!

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.511 position:50% align:center
I haven't felt that
for a second!

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.596 position:50% align:center
This is the path I chose!

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
And I'm not giving
up until the very end!

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
I just can't!

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever it takes
to get into that school!

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.900 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
I'm not like you. Goodbye.

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:34.698 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
I'm so stupid.

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:37.575 position:50% align:center
For a split second,
I felt jealous of the typical
