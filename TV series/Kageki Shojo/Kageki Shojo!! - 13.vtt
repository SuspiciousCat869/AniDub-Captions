00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:19.352 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
Right, let's begin.

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:24.399 position:50% align:center
Two of the fairest stars
in all the heaven,

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.860 position:50% align:center
Having some business...
do entreat her eyes

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
to twinkle in their
spheres till they return.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.907 position:50% align:center
[AI] From his first breath,
he made the auditorium his own,

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:35.869 position:50% align:center
his magnetism drawing
the audience in.

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:38.663 position:50% align:center
This is what a real actor
is capable of...

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:39.998 position:50% align:center
[OIZUMI]
Such commitment.

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:41.624 position:50% align:center
[TAKAGI]
Not going easy on 'em.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.752 position:50% align:center
[ONODERA]
He is so dreamy!

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
His enunciation is perfect.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.797 position:50% align:center
You can hear every
word so clearly.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.674 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI] He's not even
speaking that loud;

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.885 position:50% align:center
his voice just
commands attention!

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:54.596 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] I'm so glad I didn't
have to be in this group!

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.681 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] His pace and
rhythm naturally emphasize

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
the most important
beats in the line.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.769 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
His voice is hot.

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:02.520 position:50% align:center
[TAKAGI] Guess Mamoru's
not the type to hold back

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:05.065 position:50% align:center
just to make his
students feel comfy.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.775 position:50% align:center
[OHGI]
Can't say I'm surprised.

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:09.069 position:50% align:center
He's not exactly
known for being nice.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center
For thou art as glorious
to this night...

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.325 position:50% align:center
Being o'er my head as is a
winged messenger of heaven.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
Dear lady...

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.248 position:50% align:center
Let me swear my love by
yonder blessed moon.

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:23.708 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS gasp]

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:27.879 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Juliet!

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:29.005 position:50% align:center
[HORIGUCHI gasps]

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.382 position:50% align:center
O Romeo!

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.843 position:50% align:center
Romeo! Romeo!

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.054 position:50% align:center
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:37.764 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
Why is she screaming?

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.849 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO] It's like Mr. Andou's
performance spooked her

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.351 position:50% align:center
and made her think she
needed to go bigger

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.894 position:50% align:center
to meet his energy.

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:46.231 position:50% align:center
Look at that, he's tripped
them up completely.

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:48.775 position:50% align:center
What terrible luck to be
placed in this group.

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:50.318 position:50% align:center
I feel bad for them.

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:51.820 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't. I don't.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.780 position:50% align:center
Rolling with the punches
is its own skill.

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:56.783 position:50% align:center
Just wait...
It's not over yet.

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.786 position:50% align:center
We won't know how they did till
we see who got the roles.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.204 position:50% align:center
How's Sarasa?

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.793 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.921 position:50% align:center
Okay, none of those
faces bode well.

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.217 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Ms. Tomoe!

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:17.012 position:50% align:center
Ms. Tomoe!

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.305 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, Sarasa?
What is it, dear?

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.932 position:50% align:center
Guess what?

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:22.934 position:50% align:center
Dai- <i>sensei</i> pinky-promised me
he'd come play kabuki

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:24.185 position:50% align:center
with me today!

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.937 position:50% align:center
Kouzaburou did?

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:28.648 position:50% align:center
He sure did!
Can I wait for him in that room?

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:31.568 position:50% align:center
Go right ahead,
just mind your manners.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:32.527 position:50% align:center
You promise?

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.695 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.665 position:50% align:center
Why is he so frickin' late?!

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50% align:center
Whomst calls me brother?

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50% align:center
Surely, you jest!

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.757 position:50% align:center
Dost thou truly not
know who I am?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.133 position:50% align:center
For I am--

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.885 position:50% align:center
[KAOU]
...not know who I am?

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
For I am the very embodiment
of chivalry and goodness,

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.014 position:50% align:center
the great Sukeroku!

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:02.349 position:50% align:center
What folly is this!

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center
What man would dare
be bold enough

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center
to declare himself my brother?

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.192 position:50% align:center
Here! This man, O brother!

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
[KAOU laughs]

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:15.820 position:50% align:center
You have a very powerful voice!

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.323 position:50% align:center
But remember, it's not
all about being loud;

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:20.867 position:50% align:center
there's actually a lot more to
a good performance than that.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
"Voice first, face second, and
everything else comes third."

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:25.955 position:50% align:center
That means the first thing
you should work on

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
is your delivery.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
How do I do that?

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.377 position:50% align:center
[KAOU]
Speak from your diaphragm.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center
Pull air into your tummy,
open your throat,

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center
and then try delivering the
lines from that place,

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
deep down in your gut.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:41.012 position:50% align:center
[TOMOE] Really? All she
wanted was to play pretend!

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
[KAOU] We may pretend on stage,
but don't mistake it.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
Acting is certainly
not child's play!

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50% align:center
It should be respected
as a craft.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.482 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you agree with
that, Kouzaburou?

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center
It's no wonder they call
you a living treasure.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
While I'm here, think I could
get some lessons, as well?

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
I swear...

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:01.157 position:50% align:center
Come here! And crawl!

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
[KAOU chuckles]

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
What a pitiful samurai you are!

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.873 position:50% align:center
We'll have to work
on that, won't we?

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:11.042 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Sir, yes sir!

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center
[KAOU] Acting is certainly
not child's play!

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
[SUNOUCHI] How could I
deny my sweet Juliet?

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center
You know very well
I never could!

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
Ask anything of
your nurse, dear girl!

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
I am here to do your bidding!

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.809 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Here it comes.

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.147 position:50% align:center
Sarasa Watanabe's...

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
...Tybalt!

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
[SARASA gasps]

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
What blood? 'Tis... my blood?

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
[TAKAGI] Tybalt sees the blood
on his hands and realizes

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
he's been stabbed.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.664 position:50% align:center
[OHGI] The actress will
typically raise her hands

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:53.209 position:50% align:center
and reveal to the audience an
expression of deep despair.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50% align:center
[OIZUMI]
And then, they're hooked.

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.298 position:50% align:center
Thou wretched boy!
What hast thou done to me?!

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
[ONODERA] Ah! So in her version,
Romeo is on stage right.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
No! This can't be!

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
I yet live, my end cannot
be so nigh as it appears.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
[KAOU]
You know why we have mie?

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
It has a very specific purpose,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50% align:center
and that is to focus the
audience on the most beautiful

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.525 position:50% align:center
parts of our performance.

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
"Look at me!
Look how incredibly cool I am!

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.489 position:50% align:center
How interesting! How nuanced!

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
Live with me in this moment!"

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
It's a tool we use to draw
their attention and hold it.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.801 position:50% align:center
Fairest Juliet,
O bright star in darkest sky.

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50% align:center
My hand will never
know your soft glow...

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
Your sweet touch.

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:50.767 position:50% align:center
[OHGI] Her expression softens
as she thinks of Juliet. Lovely.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.936 position:50% align:center
[TAKAGI] She's even making sure
to address the audience

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
up in the balcony seats.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] Shock, hatred, love,
sadness, and finally...

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
The emotion Miss Watanabe's
Tybalt feels

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
in his final moments:

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
<i>Iie, iie,</i>
<i>watashi tachi de wa...</i>

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.709 position:50% align:center
Wow! He's good!

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center
That's Akiya's
performance, isn't it?

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.546 position:50% align:center
He's got some skills!
Don't you think so?

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.721 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] It's just that
I know I'm better.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:37.814 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA] Sarasa, no matter what
might stand in my way,

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:38.982 position:50% align:center
I promise you.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
One day soon...
I'll be Sukeroku.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
And thus I am slain by Romeo,
the true villain.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
I'm a bit surprised.

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.380 position:50% align:center
Thought we'd see more of
a split, but I guess not.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
Well, it's a good thing that
the students can objectively

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
assess who's at what
level amongst them!

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
The kids get to judge purely
on performance, too,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
instead of grades.

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:11.806 position:50% align:center
They're all fired up!

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.142 position:50% align:center
I hope this will inspire
them in their studies!

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.894 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
Now, what's left?

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:17.729 position:50% align:center
We need to figure out Tybalt.

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
The Renaissance period
was also when we saw

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
advents in other areas
like set and theater design.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A] It's been three
days since auditions.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.282 position:50% align:center
When will we know who's cast?

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] Why are they
making us wait like this?

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI] I can barely
focus on our lecture!

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] That's all for today.
You're dismissed.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
Now, all rise!

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
One last thing.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.254 position:50% align:center
Your wait is over.

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50% align:center
Cast list will be in
the first-floor hallway

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
this afternoon.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
If you've got questions
about the results

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.470 position:50% align:center
or your personal performance,
please feel free

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.305 position:50% align:center
to come by the faculty office.

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:55.392 position:50% align:center
That's all!

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Bow!

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Thank you, sir!

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.398 position:50% align:center
[AI]
This is weird.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
I wasn't nervous about
the JPX48 election

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.028 position:50% align:center
or even about the Kouka
admission results.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
But right now,
I'm feeling more nervous

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:12.283 position:50% align:center
than I ever have about
anything before. Why?

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:14.119 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Hey, Ai!

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
Let's go see the cast
list together!

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.082 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI]
Oh, Miss Watanabe!

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.292 position:50% align:center
What excellent timing!

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:24.254 position:50% align:center
So you know how Risa was
out sick with a cold today?

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.297 position:50% align:center
Well, I just went down to
the room you cleaned earlier

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
to check it for her so she
could continue resting up,

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
and boy, that floor's
still filthy,

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
and I found some cracks
in the wood, too.

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't want anyone
to step on a splinter

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.808 position:50% align:center
and hurt their feet, would we?

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
You'll need to clean that
room again right now.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, could you maybe
gimme just a sec?

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:42.981 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. It can't wait.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
All right, I'm heading out.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.361 position:50% align:center
Hey. You still sticking
around, Mamoru?

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:51.656 position:50% align:center
Yeah, unfortunately,
I've still got more to do.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
--Excuse me, sir!
--Ah.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
But please, can you just explain
to me why I didn't get picked

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:57.746 position:50% align:center
to play Juliet?!

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center
Well, here comes the first wave.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Heh. Good luck.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
It's snowing.

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.427 position:50% align:center
Ai.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.803 position:50% align:center
Did you see the cast list?

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
Feel like going to get
something to eat?

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center
Ow! What the--?!

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
That kinda hurts, Ai.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I'm so sad.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.491 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] The teachers loved
your Juliet, really...

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
They did.

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
But the thing is, Shakespeare's
Juliet is a wide-eyed,

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
innocent 14-year-old girl
whose inexperience

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
leads her to obsess over the
first man she's ever fallen for.

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] Your Juliet was
a bit too mature.

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:50.465 position:50% align:center
That's all.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:56.179 position:50% align:center
Well, it sucks, so I've
gotta get even better.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
And work so much harder.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.851 position:50% align:center
I mean, that's all I can do.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.186 position:50% align:center
That's a good plan.

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.315 position:50% align:center
What do you want to eat?
Yakiniku?

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
--[AI] I can't go.
--Huh?

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:12.987 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but I'm
waiting for Sarasa.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:14.823 position:50% align:center
Friends should try to
be there for each other

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.157 position:50% align:center
at times like these.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:20.203 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.872 position:50% align:center
What? No way!

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
This isn't happening!
Could it be?!

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh...

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C] So Aya got
Juliet after all, huh?

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT D] Isn't she at
the bottom of the class?

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
What'd she do, get her folks
to pull some strings?

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
All right, who the
hell said that?

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
You're ignorant!

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.523 position:50% align:center
Aya's family happens to
run a freaking bakery!

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50% align:center
If her parents had any say,
that just means

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.985 position:50% align:center
you lost the part to some bread!

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
Also, believe me,
if family meant anything,

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.115 position:50% align:center
then I'd be playing Romeo.

00:10:57.198 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50% align:center
Aya got cast as Juliet
because she deserves it!

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
Kaoru!

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:03.663 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO crying]

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center
Oh, my gosh, thank you so much!

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center
But you don't have
to cry for me!

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.669 position:50% align:center
I'm crying for myself,
not for you!

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to play
Romeo so badly!

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
But congrats, Aya!

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
[crying]

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
Oh, Miss Watanabe, by the way,
have you seen the cast list yet?

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.850 position:50% align:center
What's that look for?

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
Then I know something
you don't know!

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
Want me to tell you?

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
[SARASA gasps]

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:32.317 position:50% align:center
Just kidding!
I haven't seen it yet, either.

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
But man, you first-years
sure are lucky.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
You guys get to do
everything early.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.825 position:50% align:center
Now that I think of it, what
will you be performing

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:42.869 position:50% align:center
at the culture festival, Hijiri?

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI]
Oh, me?

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
I'm in our "Gone With the Wind"
musical number segment.

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50% align:center
That's right, you're looking
at none other than

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center
Scarlett O'Hara.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:51.503 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be perfect!

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI] Probably.
Why'd you stop cleaning?

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] And right after
the culture festival,

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
you have your big debut!

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:00.679 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
I tell you what,

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to get
on stage myself!

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.605 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
I'm exhausted.

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:12.899 position:50% align:center
And my throat's sore
from all this talking.

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:14.150 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.404 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Pardon me, sir.

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50% align:center
Ah, there you are.

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
Might I please have
a moment of your time?

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:24.744 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Sarasa sure is late.

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:27.622 position:50% align:center
Is she still cleaning?
Or did she go home?

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:28.832 position:50% align:center
No, she wouldn't.

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:37.799 position:50% align:center
I bet she'll react the exact
same way she did

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
when she got in, all loud and
excited and crazy extra.

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
But this time, I'll get to tell
her I'm happy for her, too.

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
I was wrong.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:56.818 position:50% align:center
She stared at it reverently,
focused on her own name,

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.903 position:50% align:center
as if willing herself
to believe it.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO] I'm not here
to dispute the casting.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:05.744 position:50% align:center
It's just...

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.162 position:50% align:center
I'd really like to know
what my performance

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
was lacking.

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
You wanna know what
you were lacking?

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.543 position:50% align:center
I guess we're doing this.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
Look, you don't have
experience yet,

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.630 position:50% align:center
so you're lacking
in all sorts of skills.

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
And it's not just you.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
That's everyone in your class.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.722 position:50% align:center
Tell me, are you familiar with
the musical Amadeus, sir?

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.599 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you mean
the Broadway show?

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:30.060 position:50% align:center
I actually thought the movie
was pretty excellent.

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
It's about Mozart and Salieri.

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:34.689 position:50% align:center
It's kind of a study of
genius versus hard work.

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
A tale of rivals with all
the tension you'd expect.

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:38.943 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
The truth is, sir...

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.195 position:50% align:center
I hate that play.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center
When I saw it as a child,
I identified with Salieri,

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:48.203 position:50% align:center
and the thought of that
absolutely terrified me.

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
I can't help but feel that
no matter how skilled I am,

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
or even how much praise I earn,

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:57.170 position:50% align:center
I'll never hold a candle to
prodigies like Sarasa Watanabe.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:14:00.006 position:50% align:center
That no matter how hard I work,
or how long I study,

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50% align:center
I'll never be able
to outmatch her.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:05.011 position:50% align:center
Not in a million years.

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:06.888 position:50% align:center
And while part of me
admires her talent,

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.682 position:50% align:center
I also know that if
she wasn't here,

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't feel so defeated.

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.310 position:50% align:center
That if she hadn't
gone for Tybalt,

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center
it could have been me.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:17.107 position:50% align:center
My name on that cast
list instead of hers.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
I can't help thinking
these things,

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
and I totally hate
myself for it.

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:22.612 position:50% align:center
Anyway...

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
I guess at this point I'm
just ranting for no reason.

00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:27.909 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sir!

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
Sorry to disturb you.

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:31.204 position:50% align:center
No, you're fine, don't worry.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:33.832 position:50% align:center
I mean, that was way better
than sitting there and sobbing.

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:36.251 position:50% align:center
People really just
sit here and cry?

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
More than you'd think.

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:39.671 position:50% align:center
But does it change anything?

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:41.006 position:50% align:center
Bawling like that.

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:43.341 position:50% align:center
Well, sure, it might
make you feel better.

00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
But I'd prefer you didn't 'cause
I'm not the best with tears.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
I'm not gonna cry.

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
I suspected. So look.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
The first thing that you need to
know is most talented people

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:55.562 position:50% align:center
in the world are like Salieri.

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
Acting, specifically,
is all about teamwork,

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.608 position:50% align:center
and the Kouka troupe
values individuality,

00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
so we would never actually
want a whole group

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
full of Mozarts.

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.364 position:50% align:center
Just think about that
for a second...

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
If everyone here was
the same kind of prodigy,

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
how could we distinguish
between them?

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:13.997 position:50% align:center
But you should know,
you and Miss Watanabe

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
received equal votes
from your classmates.

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:19.586 position:50% align:center
The teachers even took
a tie breaking vote,

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
but we were still completely
divided on you two.

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:24.716 position:50% align:center
Ms. Ohgi showed up late,
so once she arrived,

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:27.218 position:50% align:center
we decided to have her
cast the final tiebreaker.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
Very well, I can do that. So...

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center
Tybalt should be played
by Sarasa Watanabe.

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:40.607 position:50% align:center
It really could've
gone either way.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.776 position:50% align:center
So yes, you might've
missed out on this one,

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:45.820 position:50% align:center
but don't let yourself
dwell on that too much.

00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
Yes, you're absolutely right.

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
I won't. Not this time.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:52.869 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, sir.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
Even though I say that,
I still hurt...

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
Who would've known that
a single sheet of paper

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
could cut so deep?

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:06.299 position:50% align:center
Now, then. You'll be
rehearsing on your own.

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:07.634 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yes, sir!

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
Oh, and uh, I'll be there
to observe three times

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:11.680 position:50% align:center
before your dress rehearsal.

00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Only three?

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center
I'm working with
the second-years.

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
They're the stars
of the festival.

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
You guys are like
a fun cherry on top.

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:21.606 position:50% align:center
Plus, you're mostly
doing soliloquies,

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
so you don't even
have to interact.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
As long as you can say your
lines without flubbing them,

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
you're good.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50% align:center
Okay, break a leg!

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
Well now this doesn't seem
like that big of a deal.

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI] All right, there are
two months left until

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.122 position:50% align:center
the Culture Festival.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
Classes are currently
on hold for second-years.

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:40.959 position:50% align:center
Just up until
the festival starts.

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
Instead, we're going to
be spending all of our

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.671 position:50% align:center
time rehearsing.

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:47.340 position:50% align:center
As such, we'll really be
counting on your class

00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
to help us out over these next
crazy couple of months.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.095 position:50% align:center
Honestly, the best thing
you can do for us

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.389 position:50% align:center
is just try not to trip us up.

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
Especially considering you
guys get to crash our show

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
with your little skit!

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
So you're going to be playing
Romeo, Miss Shirota?

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:02.439 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am!
And I'll do everything I can

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
not to trip you up!

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
And Miss Watanabe,
you'll be playing Tybalt.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
Think you're gonna be okay?

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
Aw, that's super sweet!

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.533 position:50% align:center
You're so nice to
worry for me, Risa!

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
Oh, we're all worried about you,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
especially after you fell
at the Sports Festival.

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
[SARASA laughs]

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Also, you don't seem
to fit a dark character

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
like Tybalt.

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
Listen, Sarasa's Tybalt...

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
It was incredible.

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Oh, no.

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
So much for not
dwelling on it, huh?

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Morning.

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:43.563 position:50% align:center
Hi, Tomomi.
Good morning to you, too.

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, this?
It came from a fan.

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.819 position:50% align:center
They stopped me on the way here.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
You're just that cool.

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'm the class rep.

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
And I was at the
Sports Festival.

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:58.203 position:50% align:center
People see me around
a lot, that's all.

00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:00.246 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry you didn't
get the role, Sawa.

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
Being the perfect student is
super boring, don't you think?

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.296 position:50% align:center
Everyone expects you
to be 100% at all times.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
If you mess up, they won't
ever let you forget it.

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
And when you're the class rep,
it's like all eyes are on you,

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
so you always have to be
on your best behavior.

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
You can't help but feel
jealous of the prodigies

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
or strong personalities.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.356 position:50% align:center
You mean you feel that way
too sometimes, Tomomi?

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
Oh, for sure!

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
I mean, look at
my assistant rep.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
Way more of a character than me!

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:35.573 position:50% align:center
But it works well because
she says the things I can't,

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
which is a huge help.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
And to die-hard
fans of the troupe,

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.454 position:50% align:center
we'll always be
our class reps.

00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
That's just how it works.

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
Like it or not, to some, this is
our identity now and forever.

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
It's a lot of pressure,
not gonna lie.

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.173 position:50% align:center
but all those skills you've
worked so hard to cultivate?

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
Trust them, because they're
never gonna fail you.

00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:58.763 position:50% align:center
Sure, it's nerve-wracking,
but I'll finally be able

00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:01.016 position:50% align:center
to stand on the stage I've
dreamed of the whole time

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:02.267 position:50% align:center
I've been here!

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
It's pretty thrilling.

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:07.355 position:50% align:center
That's what these two years
have been all about, after all.

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're gonna feel the
same way in a year's time.

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.737 position:50% align:center
I've been so grateful
that you were the one

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
elected class rep
for the first-years.

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.158 position:50% align:center
You've kept your class
organized and in line,

00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:20.577 position:50% align:center
and that's made things
way easier on me.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.786 position:50% align:center
So thanks for that.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.331 position:50% align:center
Really? Oh, geez!

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI chuckles]
Oh, no, don't cry now!

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
Save that for graduation!

00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:33.298 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO] I hate crying
in front of other people!

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
I'm so embarrassed...

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
I feel ya.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
Totally humiliating, huh?

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
I was right. We're a lot alike.

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:55.236 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
That's why you're here?

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.116 position:50% align:center
You want to know why I chose
Miss Watanabe for Tybalt?

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.117 position:50% align:center
Correct.

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:02.869 position:50% align:center
Forgive me for
asking so bluntly,

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
but I was hoping to learn
something from this

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.998 position:50% align:center
for next time.

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
[OHGI]
I see. Very well, then.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
I can tell you the reason
I chose Miss Watanabe's

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
performance over yours.

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:17.092 position:50% align:center
For me it came down
to one factor.

00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
Her Tybalt's Audience Appeal
Level was just a bit higher

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:20.679 position:50% align:center
than yours.

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
It was difficult to
discern which of the two

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.059 position:50% align:center
would rate higher,
but it becomes easier

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:28.561 position:50% align:center
when you consider our
audience demographic.

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
80% of them are women,
so they'll likely see the show

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.400 position:50% align:center
through Juliet's eyes
as they watch.

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:34.901 position:50% align:center
That being the case,
we must consider

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
what our audiences will
want from their Tybalt.

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:40.949 position:50% align:center
Your Tybalt, shattered
by his own love,

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
was wonderful indeed,
but in my opinion,

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
Miss Watanabe's Tybalt, who
opened up about his feelings

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
at the very end in the
most vulnerable way,

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
would resonate more
strongly with our audience.

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
So I suppose, to put
it more concisely,

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
Miss Watanabe's Tybalt
had something we need:

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
incredible fangirl potential!

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:02.178 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Fangirl?!

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO] Oh, my gosh...
the fangirls! That's it!

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:11.604 position:50% align:center
That one word has made
everything come together!

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:13.106 position:50% align:center
I see now.

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
Ms. Ohgi is truly the most
die-hard Kouka fangirl herself.

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:21.614 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] Whoa, Sawa,
you're just coming in?

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:24.117 position:50% align:center
You're usually the first to
arrive anywhere, every time.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.285 position:50% align:center
I've been busy.

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
Sarasa, I'm very sorry.

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:29.664 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
Should've said this sooner.
Congratulations.

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:44.971 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO] Today, we'll be
attending a photo shoot.

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:47.140 position:50% align:center
It'll be for a poster
advertising school admissions

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:48.808 position:50% align:center
for next year.

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
Therefore, we'll need to
assemble in the auditorium

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:52.771 position:50% align:center
this afternoon.

00:21:52.854 --> 00:21:54.481 position:50% align:center
Hold on, does that mean...
