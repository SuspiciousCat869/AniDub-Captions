In no time, it was summer break.

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:21.187 position:50% align:center
Most students went home
to their families.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.356 position:50% align:center
When I said I wouldn't
be leaving the dorm,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.401 position:50% align:center
Sarasa invited me to come
stay with her instead.

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it.

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.946 position:50% align:center
I'm spending my summer
break with a friend.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.407 position:50% align:center
Could that mean...
we're best friends?

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:08.670 position:50% align:center
What can I do to cheer her up?

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:09.754 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.131 position:50% align:center
She has a boyfriend.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:14.134 position:50% align:center
So talking about him should
make her happy, right?

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:16.761 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's your boyfriend
like, Sarasa?

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
Well, his name is Akiya,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.559 position:50% align:center
and he's training to
be a kabuki actor.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.935 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's cool.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.020 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Yeah.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.064 position:50% align:center
[AI]
That obviously didn't work.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.320 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] If you don't change,
you'll never be a top star

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
of the Kouka Revue.

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:39.200 position:50% align:center
You weren't playing Tybalt.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.120 position:50% align:center
You were playing Sei
Satomi's version of Tybalt.

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:44.330 position:50% align:center
It was a perfect copy
of her performance.

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:46.249 position:50% align:center
That's why it seemed so good.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center
Thing is, being a mimic
won't earn you any success

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.504 position:50% align:center
as a star in the Kouka revue.

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.089 position:50% align:center
Everything on that
stage is built to make

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.258 position:50% align:center
their top stars shine.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.302 position:50% align:center
No two stars should be the same.

00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:59.846 position:50% align:center
So you can't just
copy whatever she did.

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.390 position:50% align:center
Every performance
should be unique.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:04.893 position:50% align:center
They want you, Sarasa Watanabe.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.186 position:50% align:center
And from what I could see,

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.605 position:50% align:center
there wasn't a bit of you
in that Tybalt at all.

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:11.399 position:50% align:center
Sarasa?

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.026 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
Oops, did you say something, Ai?

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking, and I kinda
tune out the world, sorry.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.200 position:50% align:center
Are you thinking about
what Mr. Andou said?

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:21.326 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.203 position:50% align:center
It's hard to think
about anything else.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50% align:center
For a guy who looks like
he doesn't brush his hair,

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:26.539 position:50% align:center
he sure is savage.

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:29.876 position:50% align:center
[RURI laughs] C'mon, don't
make fun of his hair!

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.047 position:50% align:center
He's pretty sensitive
about those curls.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
Wait, aren't you--

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.592 position:50% align:center
The Winter Troupe stars!

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:40.136 position:50% align:center
I always wanted to
be a musume-yaku,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.846 position:50% align:center
but then, during my first year,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
I grew almost three inches.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
It's true, she even
threatened to drop out

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:46.935 position:50% align:center
if she couldn't play
women's roles.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
[AI, SARASA]
Huh?

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.938 position:50% align:center
But the Phantom
encouraged me to stay,

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
so I agreed to play
otoko-yaku roles.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
You headed to Tokyo, too?

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.444 position:50% align:center
Yeah, summer break.

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
Nice! We're all business.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
Meeting to discuss my
debut as the top star.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
In The Phantom of the Opera.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.
Hey, here's a random question--

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
why do we call Mr. Andou
the Phantom?

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.041 position:50% align:center
Wait, you don't know?

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.377 position:50% align:center
Mr. Andou was a popular
actor in the Japanese

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
musical troupe "Sou,"
and he was best known

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
for his portrayal of
the title character

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
in The Phantom of the Opera!

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.677 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, I was a super fan
of his back in the day.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
Even had a huge crush on him.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50% align:center
Sadly, he fell into an orchestra
pit and was badly injured,

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
so he had to retire.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
It broke his spirit.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.106 position:50% align:center
He lives and breathes acting.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
I think that's why he
came to teach at Kouka.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
He's just doing whatever
he can to stay connected

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.529 position:50% align:center
to the theater world.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
Hey, look, it's Daidai!
So cool!

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:08.224 position:50% align:center
Sarasa. That's Kaou,
but he's not the real Kaou.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
He looks the same, though, huh?

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
Huh? Really? Are you sure?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
Dai- <i>sensei</i> , is that true?

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
Yep, sure is.

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
That's the point.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
Kabuki actors are dedicated
to the art of preservation.

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.155 position:50% align:center
They're trained to mimic
the previous generation's

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
performance, and in doing so,
bring them back to life.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.970 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Akiya Shirakawa.

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:47.722 position:50% align:center

Oh, my goodness, how very
kind of you, my dear.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.045 position:50% align:center
But come now, no need
to be so formal.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center

I have to make a
good impression!

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
So, Sarasa.

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:26.594 position:50% align:center
There might be a little
surprise for you up--

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
Would you look at this!
How've you been, Sarasa?

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi, welcome back!

Sorry about that, Ai.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
You must feel totally neglected!

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
Except the part where I
can't feel my legs anymore.

I'm back in Asakusa

you should go upstairs

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.897 position:50% align:center

You're that frog-bot who's
courting Sarasa, right?

Have we met before and I'm
just losing my mind, here?

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.389 position:50% align:center
'Cause that's not really a
normal thing to lead with!

It's called manners!

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.102 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.603 position:50% align:center
I'm not very good with people,

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50% align:center
but I guess that's
probably obvious.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:05.402 position:50% align:center
I've never even had a real
friend before Sarasa.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
So I'm still
learning this stuff.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:55.410 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
I'm here!

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
Hi, Ms. Tomoe!

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.414 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA] Sarasa was two
years younger than me.

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.041 position:50% align:center
Her family ran a tatami shop,

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.917 position:50% align:center
and she was always
bright and cheerful.

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.419 position:50% align:center
Whenever she came
for her lesson...

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
[KOUZABUROU] Is class about
to start? Mind if I watch?

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:11.134 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA] ...Kouzaburou always
came to see her for some reason.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
--Hey, careful, now!
--I might mind.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center
We're right in the middle
of Akiya's lesson.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA] Kouzaburou is married
to the only daughter

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.811 position:50% align:center
of Kaou Shirakawa,
15th of his name,

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
national treasure and
head of the Misato troupe.

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.151 position:50% align:center
Ms. Tomoe is Kaou's
younger sister,

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
and my father is Kaou's cousin.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
He used to be a kabuki
actor years ago,

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
but he gave it up when it was
still early in his career.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.995 position:50% align:center
I was born into this
big kabuki family.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.705 position:50% align:center
So, what are you
learning, Akiya?

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
Working on anything
special today?

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA]
Yakko.

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:46.628 position:50% align:center
Ooh, that makes me
wanna do Yakko, too!

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
Can I join in on the
lesson please?

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.256 position:50% align:center
I suppose so.

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA]
Kaou?

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.971 position:50% align:center
[SARASA gasps]
Daidai is here, too!

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:58.848 position:50% align:center
Think I could watch
you two dance?

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:08.358 position:50% align:center
I started training to
perform kabuki that year,

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
when I was eight.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.363 position:50% align:center
The kabuki world
values bloodlines,

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
which meant that I was
the most likely person

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:17.409 position:50% align:center
to become the 16th
Kaou Shirakawa.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.452 position:50% align:center
However...

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
Akiya! Are you okay?

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
Oh, goodness, you hit your head?

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh, I did.

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
But I'm okay.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Are you all right, Akiya?

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sorry for messing up--

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:51.026 position:50% align:center
You could always balance,
but my word. I had no idea.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA'S MOM] So, a little bird
told me that Kaou came

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
to your lesson to watch
you dance today.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
Just you? Or was the girl there?

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.120 position:50% align:center
You mean Sarasa, Mom?

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:05.999 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she was and you know,
I like her a whole lot.

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:07.334 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA'S MOM]
Oh, yeah?

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
She's really good.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
She's an awesome dancer
and she's super strong.

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:13.548 position:50% align:center
Great balance, too.
And you know what--

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
That's fine, but she's a girl.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA] My mom had noticed it,
too, the way things were.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50% align:center
But I pretended I didn't.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:23.141 position:50% align:center
I had to.

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:24.267 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:25.810 position:50% align:center
You know the truth:
a newbie like you

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:28.146 position:50% align:center
only gets to be here 'cause
you're kinda related to Kaou.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
You're nothing special!

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
[BOY C] If Kouzaburou has
a boy, they'll throw you

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
right into the trash!

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.111 position:50% align:center
What would be the point
of keeping you around?

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.410 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA] Huh?
What do you mean?

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
I'm the only kid who
can perform today?

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:45.705 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.916 position:50% align:center
All the others came
down with a bad flu.

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
It appears you're the
only one who didn't.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
You're saying I have to
go out there by myself?

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:56.424 position:50% align:center
You're going to be just fine.

00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:57.884 position:50% align:center
Calm down.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much
for inviting us

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
to come and watch
the performance today.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.474 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
Hey, why are you
sitting in the corner?

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:09.062 position:50% align:center
It's just...
I have a lot of lines.

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:12.023 position:50% align:center
If I'm alone, then it won't
be like we practiced.

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
What if I mess up?

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
Akiya, you need to find a way
to have more confidence.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
Try to remember,
the acting world

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
will chew you up
even if you're a kid.

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:25.620 position:50% align:center
But, I--!

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
It's okay, Akiya! I'm here now!

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center
Don't you remember playing
pretend kabuki with me?

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:35.755 position:50% align:center
You never messed up!
Not even once!

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:42.679 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
The procession is
going to look off.

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.141 position:50% align:center
We're really not going to
be able to get away

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.435 position:50% align:center
with just one kamuro
for Agemaki.

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
So I'd like to propose
having Sarasa stand in.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.107 position:50% align:center
She's prepared for the role.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.942 position:50% align:center
We've watched the
Sukeroku DVD together

00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
plenty of times before.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
And she knows every
line in the show

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
like the back of her hand.

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:04.200 position:50% align:center
Very well, then. Come here.

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
Look, Akiya, we match!

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
[SARASA'S GRANDMOTHER]
Here, I've got just the thing.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.137 position:50% align:center
If you feel nervous,
just take a sniff of this.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
It smells lovely and should
calm you right down.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
Uh, thank you.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.185 position:50% align:center
We'll tuck it in here,
like a lucky charm.

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:32.354 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center
Sarasa thinks it's cool.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:35.857 position:50% align:center
The fact that a kid your
age gets to perform

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.735 position:50% align:center
in kabuki shows if they
keep working hard enough.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center
I don't know if you've realized,
but she's so very proud of you.

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
Look, we'll be making our
entrance from right over there.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
Do whatever Akiya does
and you'll be fine.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.245 position:50% align:center
But eyes straight ahead.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
Might wanna close your mouth.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.555 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA] No one had ever
taught her how to steel 

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
her gaze like that.

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:13.436 position:50% align:center
But when she turned
to face the audience,

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
it was as if doing so
came as naturally to her

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:17.482 position:50% align:center
as breathing.

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.442 position:50% align:center
As if she was born
with something I simply

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:20.819 position:50% align:center
didn't have.

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:23.822 position:50% align:center
[ACTOR B]
Did you see that girl?

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:25.365 position:50% align:center
She was something else!

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.242 position:50% align:center
You know what they say,
though, right?

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
That she's Kouzaburou's
illegitimate daughter?

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.871 position:50% align:center
[ACTOR C]
Bad luck for her.

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:33.665 position:50% align:center
If she'd been born a boy,
she could've been next

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
in line for the Kaou name.

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.753 position:50% align:center
But as it is, that's out
of the question.

00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA] Hold on, she's
Kouzaburou's daughter?

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:44.134 position:50% align:center
And if she'd been born
a boy, then she...

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.385 position:50% align:center
Then, I...

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:47.637 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER A]
Akiya?

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hello there, ma'am.

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:50.640 position:50% align:center
How're you?

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
I'm very well, thank you.

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
I just heard that you
made quite the effort

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.270 position:50% align:center
at the last performance.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:56.771 position:50% align:center
Kaou was very proud.

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:57.897 position:50% align:center
Was he really?

00:14:57.981 --> 00:14:59.315 position:50% align:center
Hey, Akiya!

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.985 position:50% align:center
It looks like I had my lesson
before you again today!

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.570 position:50% align:center
Hey. That's cool.

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:04.738 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Guess what, guess what?

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.322 position:50% align:center
You'll never guess
so I'll tell you!

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go see a movie
with Grandpa Ken today!

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.951 position:50% align:center
See you later!

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
Do you know what happened?

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:15.081 position:50% align:center
Sarasa got to perform with me.

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:18.710 position:50% align:center
Really? You mean that second
kamuro was played by her?

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and she did really
good even though

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
it was her first time.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
I overheard someone
saying that if she'd been

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:26.968 position:50% align:center
born a boy, she could've
easily been the next Kaou.

00:15:27.052 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
That's how good she was.

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:31.181 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA] I knew I
shouldn't have said it.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center
I knew exactly what I was doing.

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
But I was still a child.

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:38.646 position:50% align:center
I had no idea that throwing
a pebble in the pond

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.940 position:50% align:center
would send ripples
out quite that far.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER A]
It will never happen! Not ever!

00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter
how good you are,

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:46.654 position:50% align:center
or how smart, or how
much natural talent

00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center
you might think you possess!

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
Playing Sukeroku is just never
going to happen for you!

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:04.756 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA] After that, Sarasa
stopped coming to dance class.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.299 position:50% align:center
Then...

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
[KEN]
Cut the crap!

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.678 position:50% align:center
We didn't bring Sarasa here
so she could be yelled at

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:10.970 position:50% align:center
and traumatized!

00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:13.390 position:50% align:center
It's unacceptable!

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
She will have nothing to do
with you from here on out!

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
She's our little girl,
do you understand?

who's friends with
Sarasa, aren't you?

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:36.496 position:50% align:center
I apologize.
That was a lot of yelling.

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:37.997 position:50% align:center
Hope it didn't scare ya.

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
Sarasa won't be coming
here anymore, I'm afraid.

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
But I'm only cutting her off
from kabuki, not people.

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.258 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll keep
being friends with her.

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:49.509 position:50% align:center
She'd like that.

Near the end of summer,

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:58.268 position:50% align:center
Sarasa's grandmother
suddenly passed away.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.941 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA] We weren't allowed
to attend the funeral,

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.694 position:50% align:center
but Kaou insisted we pay our
respects from a distance.

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:15.618 position:50% align:center
There's Sarasa.

I'm so sorry, Kaou, it's just...

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.251 position:50% align:center
This happened because of me!

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.544 position:50% align:center
Now, now, don't say that.

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:25.879 position:50% align:center
But remember this feeling.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
It'll make you a better actor.

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA]
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

[AKIYA] It's a little late,
but here you go.

I'm playing Taura Tomimatsu.

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
Kouzaburou is playing
Fukuyama Katsugi.

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
And as you would expect,
Kaou is playing Sukeroku.

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
Thank you, but I'm not allowed
to see kabuki shows.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center
I asked Grandpa Ken
and he said it's fine.

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
I have two tickets, so you can
bring your friend along, too.

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
Also, Sarasa, you know
that thing you asked

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
for advice about?

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
Oh! Of course.

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
It isn't black and white.

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:26.815 position:50% align:center
Kabuki does involve
replicating performances,

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
but that's not all it is.

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Huh?

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
Well, for instance,

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
Sukeroku's a superhero story,
built around a cool guy

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.657 position:50% align:center
getting his just revenge.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.325 position:50% align:center
But there's a lot more
to him than that,

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center
so you get to see him
feeling helpless

00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
and showing compassion
to those around him.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
That was all new
in the Edo period,

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.750 position:50% align:center
and they ate it up back then.

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:49.045 position:50% align:center
And they're still trying new
things in kabuki today.

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:50.964 position:50% align:center
Unfinished plays by
famous playwrights

00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
are being adapted into shows.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center
I stopped all involvement with
kabuki when I was six,

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
so I had no idea.

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
We're always
progressing forward,

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
but we need to maintain
our old traditions,

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:03.935 position:50% align:center
all while entertaining,
of course,

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:05.228 position:50% align:center
as we have for centuries.

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
Which means we actors
must be dedicated

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
to fulfilling all
those expectations.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
I really hope
I can prove my dedication.

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.450 position:50% align:center
You will. I'm sure.

to all this kabuki stuff?

Oh.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.469 position:50% align:center
Back when I was six,
I got to perform

00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
in a production of Sukeroku
once, as a fluke.

Even though you're a girl?

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center
Actually, little girls are
allowed to perform in kabuki.

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
And I got to walk across
the hanamichi with Akiya.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:49.731 position:50% align:center
[AI]
What do you remember about it?

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center
It was really quiet and I could
feel the audience's gaze

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
like heat on my skin.

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
We may have been
in the same room,

00:19:57.197 --> 00:20:00.867 position:50% align:center
but on stage,
it's a different world.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.702 position:50% align:center
It felt like some kind of magic.

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
Like I had transformed
into another person,

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
but I don't know,
I think I'm still just...

go see the play.
