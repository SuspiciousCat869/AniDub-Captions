00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.101 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJOU] Since they're down a
runner, Summer's asked us

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.436 position:50% align:center
to pick a sub.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
We gave it careful thought,
and ultimately decided

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.857 position:50% align:center
on one of the first-years.

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:26.776 position:50% align:center
But why one of them, ma'am?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.862 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it's disappointing
for you second-years,

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center
but this is our centennial,
so we went with someone

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.741 position:50% align:center
from the 100th class.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.409 position:50% align:center
I hope you understand.

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
We could have picked the
top student, but instead,

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:40.540 position:50% align:center
we chose to go in
a different direction.

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50% align:center
And so Sarasa Watanabe,
we'll be counting on you!

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:50.091 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:52.052 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
[AI] Sarasa was chosen,
and the other girls

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:58.892 position:50% align:center
weren't exactly thrilled.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.156 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
I mean, I'm cool with it, but...

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.824 position:50% align:center
Why is Sarasa always
the one getting

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:40.076 position:50% align:center
these awesome opportunities?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.661 position:50% align:center
Normally they would've
gone by grades,

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:43.705 position:50% align:center
which should've made
you their pick.

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:45.957 position:50% align:center
The Superiors chose
who they chose.

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.793 position:50% align:center
And remember, there's no such
thing as normal in our world.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
The second-years have already
been going hard on us.

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:53.131 position:50% align:center
I hope this doesn't
make it worse.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:00.221 position:50% align:center
If it isn't the chosen one.

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
Good morning!

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.351 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be too busy
with the festival to clean.

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center
Glad I was wrong.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.021 position:50% align:center
Good morning!
Of course, I'm happy to help!

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.565 position:50% align:center
And I guess you're
on cleaning duty, too?

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:11.941 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure am.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.985 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI] Boy, the hundredth
class is just so lucky,

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.153 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:16.780 position:50% align:center
Have you met up with
the representatives

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
from the Summer Troupe yet?

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.991 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.577 position:50% align:center
Everyone who's participating in
the relay race got together.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
Their top star, Reo Shiina,
was there,

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.247 position:50% align:center
and so was Aika Shion.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.333 position:50% align:center
Oh, and Jou Kisaragi, too.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.918 position:50% align:center
They say anything to you?

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.212 position:50% align:center
Well, uh... "You're tall!"

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
That was about
everything, though.

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
Always getting noticed for
your above-average height,

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
aren't you, Miss Watanabe?

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.178 position:50% align:center
Kind of like a tree that
people only think is special

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:41.846 position:50% align:center
because it's so tall.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
Now, personally, I would
have picked Miss Narata,

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.559 position:50% align:center
since people would love
seeing her out on stage.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.521 position:50% align:center
Although maybe that's why
they decided on you, instead.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
After all, we students can't
go around outshining

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.692 position:50% align:center
the stars at such
a special event.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:55.902 position:50% align:center
So do your best not
to stand out, 'kay?

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50% align:center
Right! I'll try
super-duper hard!

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy.
You totally missed the point.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
[SARASA yelps]

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.788 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI] The idea is not to try
hard. Or even try at all.

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
Get it?

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:08.915 position:50% align:center
The only people who
should stand out

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
are the actual troupe members.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
You can't help your height,

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:14.462 position:50% align:center
but turn that big
personality down to zero.

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
Nobody is there to see you!

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
Become nothingness!

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.429 position:50% align:center
[AI] I'm not sure if
anyone else noticed,

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.515 position:50% align:center
but I could tell Sarasa
had taken those words

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.392 position:50% align:center
far too literally.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
Become nothingness.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
A very wise person once said,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
"Don't think, feel."
I can do that, right?

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
Hey, back during your JPX days,

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50% align:center
did you ever get nervous
when you were out on stage?

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
Are you nervous?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.993 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Whoa.

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.873 position:50% align:center
The thing is, I got used
to people staring at me

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
from an early age.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
When I started
disliking the attention,

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
I just sorta learned
how to filter it out.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
If I work at it, maybe
I can develop a filter

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
of my own before
the Sports Festival.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
Honestly, Sarasa, I don't think
that's the best approach.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
I realized something,
back when we were doing

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.312 position:50% align:center
Romeo and Juliet.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.856 position:50% align:center
Mr. Andou's reaction
gave it away.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
Pretend that you're paying
attention to the audience,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.236 position:50% align:center
and they'll see
right through it.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.489 position:50% align:center
Ignoring them won't
really work, either.

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:25.909 position:50% align:center
You're up there to create a
connection, not distance.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
You have to consider
what they're looking for,

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
what it is they want to see
and remain conscious of that

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center
while you're up on stage.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.837 position:50% align:center
Consider what the
audience wants to see?

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
I don't think anyone wants
to see me out there!

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.217 position:50% align:center
What am I gonna do?

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
[whines]

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
[AI] Why am I so bad at
this "cheering up" stuff?

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
[AI] Soon, the day of
the Festival arrived.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.604 position:50% align:center
The Spring Troupe is
raring and ready to go!

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
Summer for win two!

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center
The Autumn Troupe
is going for the gold!

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.235 position:50% align:center
Winter's gonna give it our all!

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:03.863 position:50% align:center
Let's do this! The
Superior-Student team is here!

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
[AI] Elegance and restraint,
Kouka fans demonstrate both,

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:11.037 position:50% align:center
even at their most passionate,
but once every ten years,

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
that changes here at the
Kouka Grand Sports Festival.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
Well, folks, it's here:

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
the moment that we've
spent a decade waiting for.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
Introducing this
year's combatants!

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.757 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:26.052 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] From the
Spring Troupe, Ryuu Asahina!

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] From the
Summer Troupe, Reo Shiina!

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] From the Autumn
Troupe, Keito Mitsuki!

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:35.895 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] From the Winter
Troupe, Sei Satomi!

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
Last but not least,

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
the Superior-Student team!

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
Now, our Troupe
representatives will lead

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
the combatants in
the honor pledge!

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
On this day, we give our pledge.

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
To uphold the true Kouka spirit!

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.205 position:50% align:center
To compete gallantly,
fairly, and beautifully!

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
To represent our troupes
with our whole hearts!

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.002 position:50% align:center
We offer you our solemn vow.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] Our first festival
entrance ceremony.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:05.675 position:50% align:center
Wasn't it awesome?

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.218 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
Mm-hmm.

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50% align:center
And it sounded like everybody
really liked our dance, too!

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
That was better than all our
rehearsals, don't you think?

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.017 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI] Miss Watanabe, you were
looking a little bit sloppy

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.771 position:50% align:center
during the second
verse's choreo.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.189 position:50% align:center
Whoops, sorry!

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
We need someone
to prep the flags.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
Think you can help me?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.902 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.320 position:50% align:center
Hey, it'll go faster with two--

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.738 position:50% align:center
No thank you!

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.281 position:50% align:center
She asked me specifically
because only second-years

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.283 position:50% align:center
are supposed to
help with events.

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:31.451 position:50% align:center
And of those second-years,

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.078 position:50% align:center
only those who are
considered most capable

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
get the honor.

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
As determined by their grades.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
And as I recall,
yours aren't the best.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:40.377 position:50% align:center
[SUPERIOR A]
Hijiri!

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.920 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI]
Well, I'd better go!

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
This has gone far enough.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center
You seriously need to stop
messing with that girl.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center
You're going to stunt
her growth as a student.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.264 position:50% align:center
I'm not messing with her.

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.684 position:50% align:center
Just working out a little
jealousy, that's all.

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:56.935 position:50% align:center
You're jealous of her?

00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:00.188 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI] She always stands out,
and everyone expects

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
great things from her.

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.192 position:50% align:center
And then there's the fact
that she's best friends

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:06.986 position:50% align:center
with my darling Naracchi,
which is so unfair.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.987 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:10.031 position:50% align:center
My God, Hijiri, you are such a--

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:11.866 position:50% align:center
A bitch, Risa?

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.410 position:50% align:center
Well, sure.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center
But only by accident, so it
doesn't really count, does it?

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:17.706 position:50% align:center
You should go.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:19.958 position:50% align:center
Why waste time here when
Miss Watanabe needs you?

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
She seemed so upset.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] No matter
who you're rooting for,

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
I think we all agree that
our troupes look lovely

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.175 position:50% align:center
taking the field.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:31.553 position:50% align:center
Now, the Giant Ball Roll!

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] Their path will lead
them down the silver bridge

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
to the finish line,
in the fast and furious

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
75-meter race!

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
Look at that kick line go.

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:42.397 position:50% align:center
They've really caught
the spirit of the day.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.690 position:50% align:center
[whistle]

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
Now: The Dancing Ball Toss!

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.112 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] You won't find
events like these anywhere

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.364 position:50% align:center
but with the Kouka troupe!

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:52.907 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] Let's see what
the scoreboard looks like

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.242 position:50% align:center
at halftime:

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50% align:center
In first place, the Summer
Troupe, with 83 points!

00:08:57.454 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
Behind them in second
is Spring with 67 points!

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50% align:center
And next we have the cheer-off!

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50% align:center
First up, let's see what the
Superior-Student team

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
will be performing.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
We'll play "Amongst the
Cherry Blossoms in the Wind,"

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50% align:center
our beloved school song. Ready?

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
[music continues]

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
[KOUZABUROU]
Wonderful!

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.152 position:50% align:center
What a charming performance.

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
Though I wonder why she's
not her usual, energetic self.

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI]
Huh. I don't see Tomomi.

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess I have no choice.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
Miss Narata, will you
come help me, please?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.667 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.293 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE E]
Look, it's Naracchi!

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.462 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE F]
She's so cute!

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE G] The second-year
with her is pretty adorable too!

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:35.260 position:50% align:center
Not just a bitch, but a
conniving little rat, too.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
Naracchi doesn't seem
nervous out there at all.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center
Are you okay, Sarasa?

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:40.932 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, you didn't mess up!

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.392 position:50% align:center
You're good!

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:47.480 position:50% align:center
I think I actually did something
worse than messing up.

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:52.318 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassing, but I was so
scared of messing up that I--

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.946 position:50% align:center
I didn't even play my recorder!

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.449 position:50% align:center
Superior Ichijou,
we've got a problem!

00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
Miss Watanabe just admitted
she's been feeling

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:00.410 position:50% align:center
a little bit off.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center
Oh! Do you think a break
would help her out?

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center
Yes, I think that it would.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, ma'am.

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
We'll be back in ten, then.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Okay, what's up?

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.546 position:50% align:center
You've been acting
weird this whole time!

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center
I don't know, it's like...

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
I'm nervous and putting
so much pressure on myself

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
that I can't get outta my head.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:18.887 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Really? You are?

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.599 position:50% align:center
Okay, well, what's
got you nervous?

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
It's just...

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'm totally
fine playing a role

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50% align:center
like Lady Oscar in front of
other people, but today...

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:31.232 position:50% align:center
Today I'm supposed
to be myself up there

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:32.776 position:50% align:center
and that's hard!

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.277 position:50% align:center
It feels like I'm about
to go on stage

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
butt-naked or something!

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
I've never known how to
not stand out in a crowd,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.369 position:50% align:center
so I'm scared I might steal
focus from the top stars.

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
I can't stop thinking
how Ai-Ai or Hijiri

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.748 position:50% align:center
would've been
way better choices.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:47.874 position:50% align:center
Or you, Risa!

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
You're pretty and
have a great figure.

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:50.919 position:50% align:center
You'd make a far better sub--

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:52.379 position:50% align:center
Get it together!

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.089 position:50% align:center
The Superiors chose you!

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
Remember what you
said to me before?

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
You were lucky enough
to get in here,

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
so you aren't gonna give up!

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.971 position:50% align:center
You're gonna play Lady Oscar!

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.099 position:50% align:center
But first, you were
chosen for this, and sure,

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
that might piss some people off!

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:07.477 position:50% align:center
If you give up now, though,

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.270 position:50% align:center
it'll only piss them off more!

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.106 position:50% align:center
I hate to tell you,
but that's just what it means

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
to put yourself out there!

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
So you can't get out of this.

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to see
it through to the end!

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
She's right.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
And if you're scared of putting
your real self out there,

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center
here's a tip.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center
Play the tallest girl
at the Kouka school.

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
The one who has
been asked to sub in

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.710 position:50% align:center
for the Sports Festival relay
race and save the day

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
for her team.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
That's how we do it,
didn't you know that?

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
We're all playing a role,
even off stage.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.468 position:50% align:center
The role of each troupe's
"top star" is the one

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:43.471 position:50% align:center
that we must play.

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:45.598 position:50% align:center
Oh, right! I almost forgot.

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:47.350 position:50% align:center
Someone just randomly
shoved this bouquet

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
into my hand out there.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
He was quite specific
that I should give it to

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center
"the tall first-year
with pigtails."

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.943 position:50% align:center
I didn't want to give them
to you here, obviously.

00:12:57.027 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
And I have no clue
how he got in.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.781 position:50% align:center
Only staff are allowed
in the back hallways.

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
But he told me to tell you
"Good luck in the race,

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center
from your fan of the red rose."

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.747 position:50% align:center
Kinda freaked me out, honestly.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
I mean, what a weirdo.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.668 position:50% align:center
I should be getting back.

00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:14.878 position:50% align:center
But thank you.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:15.879 position:50% align:center
You too, Risa!

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
Thank you both so much!

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:23.428 position:50% align:center
Hey, you a second-year?

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:24.512 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yes!

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:26.181 position:50% align:center
And your name?

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
Risa Nakayama!

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.267 position:50% align:center
Good to know!

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
Okay. You should go, too.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am!

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center
[KOUZABUROU]
Aww, what a shame.

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:37.484 position:50% align:center
And here I was hoping I'd
be able to catch Sarasa's

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
relay race, at least.

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:40.487 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.489 position:50% align:center
I cannot believe you snooped
through my phone again!

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
Well, too bad for you.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.201 position:50% align:center
We have to get back
to Minami-za.

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center
You always go overboard.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
It's almost like a
sickness or something.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
Could you please not
embarrass me for once?

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.668 position:50% align:center
But a real actor knows no shame.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.337 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't worry too much,
you'll get there one day!

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.546 position:50% align:center
Kid.

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:12.894 position:50% align:center
Sarasa, you were talking with
Nakayama, weren't you?

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
Everything okay?

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:15.355 position:50% align:center
Yep! I'm fine.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
She gave me a pep talk.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
Not the scary kind, I hope.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.193 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, not at all!

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.987 position:50% align:center
Actually, she gave me
some great advice.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.073 position:50% align:center
Leadership picked me,

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
so there's no running
away from it now.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
That's just what it means
to put yourself out there.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
Also, our stage is wherever
other people can see us,

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
so we have to be aware
and play the part accordingly.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:38.837 position:50% align:center
Though, I have to admit,

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
I'm still kinda struggling
to wrap my head around

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
what it means to play
the role of myself out there.

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.760 position:50% align:center
I mean, what the heck?

00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:48.596 position:50% align:center
I'm already me, so wouldn't
playing the role of me

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.348 position:50% align:center
just mean being myself?

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:51.683 position:50% align:center
Because, like...

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
That would mean I'm not
acting; I'm just being me.

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
Way to overthink it, girl.

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:59.649 position:50% align:center
Well, it doesn't have to be the
same "you" you are now.

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:01.234 position:50% align:center
You could play the
person you want people

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.569 position:50% align:center
to think you are.

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:04.904 position:50% align:center
Like the ideal self
you have in your head;

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
who you've always wanted to be.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center
I could play my ideal self.

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
You know, what I've always
wanted are double Ds!

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:19.919 position:50% align:center
Uh... Say what?

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:21.129 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Double Ds!

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
No, I definitely heard
that the first time!

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:24.507 position:50% align:center
'Cause I've always
thought it would be, like,

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.509 position:50% align:center
the coolest thing ever
to put on one of those

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:29.095 position:50% align:center
super-tight anime battle-suits!

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
The problem is, I know it
wouldn't look good on me

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:34.642 position:50% align:center
unless my boobs were actually
big enough to fill it out.

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:36.227 position:50% align:center
Sure, do that,
sounds like a plan.

00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
Wait, seriously?

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
How do you think
a girl with Double Ds

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:41.316 position:50% align:center
might feel at a sports festival?

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
Well, if I was the shy type
who tried to hide my chest,

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
it'd be a lot harder to do
that in a gym uniform.

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
They'd be heavy when I ran,
so it'd be harder to run fast.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't want people
gawking at them, either.

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
But you see tons of busty girls
in anime jumping around

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
and fighting like it's no prob,
so then why not at least

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:03.046 position:50% align:center
give it my best shot, right?

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:06.299 position:50% align:center
'Cause that's just who Double-D
Sarasa Watanabe is!

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:08.551 position:50% align:center
Her boobs inspire
her not to give up!

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
It's time for our final event!

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.014 position:50% align:center
Which troupe will
clinch victory,

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:15.100 position:50% align:center
and which will taste defeat?

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:18.019 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] That's right, it's
the long-anticipated relay race!

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
Here come your runners!

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] For Spring Troupe,
Maki Shishido, Fuuta Shiranui,

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:27.612 position:50% align:center
Airi Mashu, Anna Aki,
and Robin Raikou!

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:30.448 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] For Summer Troupe,
Reo Shiina, Aika Shion,

00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
Jou Kisaragi, Rin Enami,
Mei Sakura.

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:36.329 position:50% align:center
As well as a special sub-in.

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:41.251 position:50% align:center
Introducing first-year student,
Sarasa Watanabe!

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:42.419 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE H]
A first-year?

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE I]
She's so tall!

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:46.256 position:50% align:center
Does she look... normal to you?

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.924 position:50% align:center
No, her posture's weird.

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:50.051 position:50% align:center
She's squeezing her
arms into her chest!

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's like she's
trying to hide...

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
...her fake big boobs!

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
Hey, we're both running seventh.

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:57.350 position:50% align:center
Fancy that!

00:16:57.434 --> 00:16:58.977 position:50% align:center
Go easy on me, okay?

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.353 position:50% align:center
Oh! Sure!

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
Cut that out, Sei!

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:04.274 position:50% align:center
Don't mess with our sub;
she has enough to think about!

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
Oopsie. You caught me.

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:09.237 position:50% align:center
We're not gonna let
Winter win this thing!

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.240 position:50% align:center
Ready on your marks, get set...

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:13.450 position:50% align:center
[gunshot]

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
And with that, they're off!

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:17.037 position:50% align:center
The first troupe to take
the lead is Autumn!

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
Looking good out there!

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:21.458 position:50% align:center
Boy, is she fast!

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:24.419 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Uh-oh! Here comes
Winter, close on her tail!

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Autumn takes a
tumble-- no, she's back up!

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.842 position:50% align:center
What a recovery!
She should be proud.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
The Kouka spirit
clearly drives her!

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
This is stupid.

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
I can't be so hung-up
on my boobs.

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center
It's a waste of time!

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
I've gotta run as fast as I can!

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:45.106 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
Summer's fast! Crazy fast!

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
Look at that,
she's overtaking Winter!

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
We're in first?!

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
Only for now.

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.698 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] Summer and Winter
are now neck and neck!

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:54.783 position:50% align:center
Here you go!

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:55.909 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.535 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I don't know
how she got ahead!

00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:58.661 position:50% align:center
It'll be okay!

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:13.259 position:50% align:center
Oh, geez.

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:14.552 position:50% align:center
It wasn't her fault.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
Sei crashed into her,
what could she do?

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] I cannot believe
this is happening.

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:23.895 position:50% align:center
What should I do now?

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
I have no clue!

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
I mean, should I just stand
up and keep running

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.442 position:50% align:center
to help Summer win?

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center
Or should I apologize
and give Sei a hand?

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Two very different options.

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:36.032 position:50% align:center
Which is best?

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
I gotta think.

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.160 position:50% align:center
Come on, think!

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
Ignoring them won't
really work, either.

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:47.335 position:50% align:center
You're out there to create
a connection, not distance.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:49.504 position:50% align:center
You have to consider
what they're looking for,

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:52.382 position:50% align:center
what it is they want to see,
and remain conscious

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.342 position:50% align:center
of that while you're
up on stage.

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:57.554 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] Consider what the
audience wants to see.

00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:58.638 position:50% align:center
And that's...

00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
Man, that hurts.

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:03.059 position:50% align:center
But hey, at least I didn't
twist it or anything--

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:20.118 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
You okay?

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
Here, let me help you.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
Well, c'mon!

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
Let's run!

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:32.714 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Yeah!

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] After being
left in the dust, both Winter

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:38.803 position:50% align:center
and Summer are now
passing their batons off

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
at the same time!

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:42.891 position:50% align:center
Spring takes the win,
then Autumn!

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
The Superior-Student
team takes third!

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
And Summer and Winter's
anchors come across

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
the finish line holding hands!

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
Very well done.

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Yep, she really
is an interesting one.

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
You were right.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
Hey, did you see?

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
[AI] Are you okay?
Did you get hurt?

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
No, your advice
totally saved me!

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
I swear, I wouldn't have gotten
through this without it!

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not sure I get why,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.052 position:50% align:center
but if you say so,
then glad I could help.

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
[MIREI]
What a memorable centennial.

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
I'd go so far as to bet
this year's festival

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
was the most fun it's ever been.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and if we're lucky,
it'll continue.

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.607 position:50% align:center
Decade after decade.

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:34.776 position:50% align:center
With a new group of
promising young students

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
passing the baton every time.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
By the way, why'd you
pick that girl to sub?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
Oh, not for any major reason.

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50% align:center
It was a reward.

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
I figured she deserved it for
standing up for her friend.

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:48.832 position:50% align:center
--Well...
--Huh?

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
Also, she may have gushed
about my performance

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
as Oscar ten years ago,
without knowing it was me.

00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:56.756 position:50% align:center
I guess I couldn't really
help myself.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.841 position:50% align:center
A-ha!

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] And now, we can
present the final results!

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
That's right!

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:05.598 position:50% align:center
Without further ado, the winners
of the Grand Sports Festival

00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
for this very special
Centennial year are...

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.687 position:50% align:center
...The Spring Troupe!

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
[RYUU]
Yes!

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] With all the grace
and elegance of a cherry blossom

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:18.778 position:50% align:center
tree in bloom, The Spring
Troupe and their illustrious

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:21.990 position:50% align:center
Ryuu Asahina
have grasped victory!

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
Thank you all.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.493 position:50% align:center
The festival is over,
but we hold the Kouka spirit

00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
in our hearts, now and forever.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.957 position:50% align:center
We hope you thoroughly
enjoyed the show.

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
We're grateful that
you're all here.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.964 position:50% align:center
and for the chance to put our
awesome teamwork on display,

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:40.592 position:50% align:center
making this Sports Festival
one truly worthy

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:42.677 position:50% align:center
of this momentous year.

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:45.722 position:50% align:center
And from all of us who are
members of the Kouka troupe,

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.767 position:50% align:center
thank you for your
continued support!

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.435 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCERS]
One last round of applause!

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:52.520 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.487 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI] Everything went
off without a hitch.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
I was so nervous!

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.990 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, I was too,

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:05.950 position:50% align:center
but we all got to
have so much fun,

00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:07.869 position:50% align:center
and I learned so many
important new things

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:09.871 position:50% align:center
that'll keep helping
me on my way.

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:12.624 position:50% align:center
If the next Sports Festival
is in ten years,

00:22:12.707 --> 00:22:14.459 position:50% align:center
then, you know what?

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:17.837 position:50% align:center
We'll be the ones up there,
gracefully leading our teams!

00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:18.963 position:50% align:center
Think about that!
