00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:19.519 position:50% align:center
Since day one, it's been
"basics, basics, basics"!

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
That's seriously all we've
done in every single class

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:23.273 position:50% align:center
since we've started!

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.775 position:50% align:center
She's right, and the Phantom's
class is worst of all!

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.319 position:50% align:center
Maybe we can do
something about that.

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:29.738 position:50% align:center
Let's ask Mr. Andou!

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:04.249 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] Today, we'll begin
delving into the Stanislavski

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:07.961 position:50% align:center
technique and how it can
be utilized while on sta--

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:11.548 position:50% align:center
Okay, would anyone care
to explain why you all

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.717 position:50% align:center
look like zombies?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.678 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] Mr. Andou!
Can I make a suggestion?

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:17.679 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
It's happening.

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:19.973 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
She's actually asking.

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.642 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] Great, what are
you girls plotting now?

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.310 position:50% align:center
Please do, Miss Watanabe.

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:25.729 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.772 position:50% align:center
So, here's the thing, the other
teachers have mentioned

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:31.151 position:50% align:center
this one skill that they
consider crucial for performers.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.695 position:50% align:center
And that skill is "expression!"

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:36.281 position:50% align:center
You need expression.

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.450 position:50% align:center
Why, "expression," of course!

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.827 position:50% align:center
[AI] She's good. I knew
exactly who she meant

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.746 position:50% align:center
without her giving any names.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.289 position:50% align:center
And?

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50% align:center
And if any class is gonna teach
us how to express ourselves,

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:50.253 position:50% align:center
this is the one where it's
most likely to happen.

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.297 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe, but we've
been Kouka students

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.715 position:50% align:center
for four whole months now,

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:55.717 position:50% align:center
so we think it might
be nice if we got a few

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
opportunities to actually act!

00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.554 position:50% align:center
Or something like that!

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.061 position:50% align:center
That's your suggestion, huh?

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.562 position:50% align:center
Well, I've gotta say.

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:09.522 position:50% align:center
I've been here for eight years,
and in all that time,

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center
the first-year curriculum hasn't
changed even a little bit.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.362 position:50% align:center
First-year students are
expected to sit politely

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50% align:center
and learn the basics of acting.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
That's how it's been done
at the Kouka School

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.076 position:50% align:center
for a century now.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.786 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna regret this.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.288 position:50% align:center
Miss Watanabe! Do that again.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.456 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Huh?

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.665 position:50% align:center
Why don't you show me
what I sound like

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.584 position:50% align:center
when I say "expression."

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:32.587 position:50% align:center
If I think it's any good,
I'll consider your proposal.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:33.630 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Oh!

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
Okay, the stakes
just got crazy high.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50% align:center
I'm not overwhelmed
by pressure at all.

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
Not a bit. Let's do this.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
Wait, "expression?" What's that?
A hot new band?

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
All right, everyone,
open up your textbooks.

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.273 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Well, there you go.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.359 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
So much for that.

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:57.028 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] Sorry I wasn't
good enough to help.

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
But Sara-- um...

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.951 position:50% align:center
Watanabe, your impression was
actually really good, though.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
It so was!

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO] Maybe it was too
good, if you know what I mean.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.042 position:50% align:center
Oh, Miss Watanabe!

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.795 position:50% align:center
One minute, I've got a
package for you back here.

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:16.840 position:50% align:center
[SARASA laughs]

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
[AI]
13, 14, 15, and 16.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
Is that... Are you 16 today?

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.055 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
Today, I celebrate
my 16th birthday!

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:27.809 position:50% align:center
--What?
--Huh?

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:29.728 position:50% align:center
Hold on, your birthday's today?

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you tell us, Sarasa?

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
Have a wonderful sweet 16!

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:36.359 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Aww, thanks a lot, you guys!

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.695 position:50% align:center
[AI] My first friend's
birthday is today.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
What do I do?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.116 position:50% align:center
Just out of curiosity, who gave
you the big rose bouquet?

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.993 position:50% align:center
Yeah, tell us! Is it a guy?

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.578 position:50% align:center
Stop! Your boyfriend?

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.996 position:50% align:center
Maybe!

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
He lives in Tokyo, so we're
long-distance right now,

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
but it could definitely be him!

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:57.964 position:50% align:center
--And he's a real, live person?
--Not some anime guy?

00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
Oh, now I see!

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
I bet he's the one you're
always messaging, isn't he?

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
"Fan of the red rose"?

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.934 position:50% align:center
Ew, I award that one yike.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
Sara-- I mean, Watanabe,

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
is this something you
think he would do?

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.231 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Hmm...

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.317 position:50% align:center
I don't know, it's hard to say.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA]
Wow.

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
Looks like someone's
in a good mood.

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center
Well, yes, of course I am.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
It's a good day.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
My dear little Sarasa
is turning 16 today.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait, you knew that, right?

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA]
Of course, I did!

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50% align:center
Great!

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
I assume you sent her
a present, then?

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.671 position:50% align:center
You are her boyfriend
after all, aren't you?

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna give it to her when
she comes home this summer.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.133 position:50% align:center
It can wait for in-person.

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
C'mon, kid,
where's your passion?

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.428 position:50% align:center
But never fear!

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
She's all set,
'cause I sent her 16 roses.

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:51.643 position:50% align:center
She's someone who's incredibly
special to you, I know.

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50% align:center
So her special day deserves
special acknowledgement.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
Hang on, you what?

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center
[KOUZABUROU] Don't worry,
I didn't send the delivery

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.694 position:50% align:center
as if it was from me.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
Instead, I signed it,
"from your fan of the red rose."

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center
[AKIYA] Am I supposed
to know what that means?

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
Forget waiting for
summer vacation.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.038 position:50% align:center
Why not send her something right
now and surprise her, huh?

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50% align:center
I'll text her about the gift.

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.125 position:50% align:center
She should understand.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna stop by her
grandpa's place again tonight?

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.839 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. That's the plan.

[AI] Her boyfriend's a frog
and a bot account?

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.768 position:50% align:center
Why even bother having
a bot account on private?

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.315 position:50% align:center
I will conquer that frog.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
I need to give Watanabe
something she'll love

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
even more than those roses.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.948 position:50% align:center
After all, she's the first
friend I've ever made.

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:48.992 position:50% align:center
And her birthday seems
like the perfect opportunity

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:51.036 position:50% align:center
to finally call her by her name.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.289 position:50% align:center
Should I shorten it,
like a nickname?

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
Sara? Saracchi? No.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.711 position:50% align:center
Do I keep it simple
with "Sarasa?"

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
Kill me!

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.925 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Seriously?

Oh, my gosh,
you got this for me, Ai?

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
You're totally the best!

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:24.319 position:50% align:center
I tried four times to win it
and I only got hand towels!

You're always going on
and on about Floor Kings,

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center
so I gave it a go and I guess
I must've won the top prize.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50% align:center
Eh? So you did it in one try?

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center
To Sarasa!"

Okay, listen, Sara--
I mean Watanabe.

Come on, you can call me Sarasa!

Oh, Taku!

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.722 position:50% align:center
Each group of four
will be given two weeks

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:35.598 position:50% align:center
to prepare their scene
on their own.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:36.599 position:50% align:center
Happy now?

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:37.934 position:50% align:center
Wait, on our own?

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:40.979 position:50% align:center
Mr. Andou, what do you
mean prepare "on our own"?

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
It's a class activity, right?

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
I think we've been had.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.650 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Some teacher he is.

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
Hey, now.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
To be fair, I did have to fight
pretty hard for you guys

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
in that faculty meeting.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50% align:center
They let us do this
under the assumption

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.160 position:50% align:center
that it would be treated
as an experiment.

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
Trust me here.

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:58.329 position:50% align:center
I want to see where
your instincts take you,

00:08:58.413 --> 00:08:59.831 position:50% align:center
without interference.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
So, you and your scene partners
will spend those two weeks

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
rehearsing together,
and then we'll devote

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center
an entire class period to
presenting your work.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.674 position:50% align:center
That's when I'll
give my feedback.

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.426 position:50% align:center
My thorough critiques.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:15.764 position:50% align:center
Also, assuming everything
goes off without a hitch,

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
you won't mind if we
reuse your idea, right?

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:19.642 position:50% align:center
For next year's class?

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
Crafty bastard.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.063 position:50% align:center
Of course, we
don't have to do this.

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Yes, we do!

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
[AI] So, we decided to draw
lots to determine who'd be

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
in each of the five groups.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
[AI]
E.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Guess we're with you, Sarasa.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.661 position:50% align:center
Yep! Group E's
the best, let's go!

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.414 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
How do we wanna pick roles?

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
Sarasa and I both want
to play otoko-yaku,

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.752 position:50% align:center
so we'll do Romeo and Tybalt.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.420 position:50% align:center
Rock-paper-scissors?

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
Cool! Then that leaves Ai and me
to play the female parts!

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
Wanna do rock-paper-scissors
to decide on that, too?

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.594 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:55.970 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO, SARASA]
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] Sweet! Looks like I'm
gonna be our Romeo!

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess that makes
me our resident Tybalt.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
And, next!

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.395 position:50% align:center
One, two, three!

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:04.729 position:50% align:center
One, two, three!

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.112 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll play...

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
Ju... liet's nurse!

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.658 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's what
I wanted to play!

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
I think a comic role will
end up being the perfect

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.203 position:50% align:center
challenge for me!

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
You'll make a better Juliet,
anyway, Naracchi.

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
Really?

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:26.084 position:50% align:center
No way, do I seriously
get to play Juliet?

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.002 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C]
Of course!

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.253 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI squeals]

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
I've always loved the
Kouka version of Juliet!

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.381 position:50% align:center
Hey! It's fine, really!

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:34.092 position:50% align:center
Like I just said, I wanted
to play the nurse, anyway!

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50% align:center
Cool. Then I guess
Ai will step into Juliet.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] Let's start
with a quick readthrough.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
[AI] If I'm honest, I think
Sarasa would be better suited

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:52.485 position:50% align:center
to the romantic Romeo
than the darker Tybalt.

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:54.779 position:50% align:center
Especially after that evening
when we were walking

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center
back from the theater,
and out of nowhere,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
she recited Romeo's
lines perfectly.

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
Okay, you start, Chika.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center
Here goes.

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:09.169 position:50% align:center
Madam, your lady mother
craves a word with you.

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
Do make haste to her side.

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:12.005 position:50% align:center
Good woman!

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.882 position:50% align:center
Pray tell me,
what is her mother?

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:15.550 position:50% align:center
Why marry, bachelor.

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
Her mother is the lady
of the house, a good lady,

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
wise and virtuous.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.430 position:50% align:center
Is she a Capulet?

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.766 position:50% align:center
O dear account!
My life is my foe's debt.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
--[AI] She's next.
--[HOSHINO] Come on.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.312 position:50% align:center
Show me you've got the
passion to become a top star.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.980 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
You got this, go for it!

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
[SARASA] This, by his voice
should be a Montague.

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
Fetch me my rapier, boy.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
What dares the slave.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.577 position:50% align:center
Come hi-hither--

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.120 position:50% align:center
How are you this bad?!

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
I'm so sorry!

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.874 position:50% align:center
Stop messing around
and get serious, here!

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
Um... I wasn't, though,
messing around, I mean.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.171 position:50% align:center
Whatever! We don't have time
for this crap, and Juliet,

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:54.381 position:50% align:center
you're on deck!

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
Go-- Go. Be, uh...

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.515 position:50% align:center
Look at her!

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:04.516 position:50% align:center
She's been completely
traumatized by your

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
terrible reading!

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:06.851 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI]
Oh, my!

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
Hi, everyone, whatcha up to?

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
Nothing! Good morning!

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
[HIJIRI] What is this?
Some secret meeting?

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:14.943 position:50% align:center
Just kidding, of course!

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
Mr. Andou already filled
us all in on your little

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.405 position:50% align:center
scene exercise.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:21.324 position:50% align:center
How you're trying to change
the curriculum and such.

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:24.119 position:50% align:center
So, you lucky newbs are
already getting to act, huh?

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
And you're doing
Romeo and Juliet?

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:27.914 position:50% align:center
Love that for you!

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
One thing, you really can't
use this room to rehearse

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
your stuff, m'kay?

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:35.338 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
That was rough.

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
Hijiri was super mad.

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.300 position:50% align:center
Huh? How do you figure?
She was all smiles!

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:41.136 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] That's how you
can tell when she's angry.

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
The smiles!

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50% align:center
I guess we can't use
that room anymore.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.558 position:50% align:center
Where do you think
we should practice

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
from now on, then, Kaoru?

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.562 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] I know Group A's
already using the lecture hall,

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center
but they might let us
share it if we ask.

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:54.774 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:57.068 position:50% align:center
Is it okay if we use half
of the lecture hall?

00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
Can they?

00:12:58.445 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
--[STUDENT D] Sure.
--[STUDENT B] That works.

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
We can't do that!

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:01.906 position:50% align:center
Why can't we?

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center
Well, we're all doing
the same scene,

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
so we'll throw each other off!

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:06.411 position:50% align:center
I don't like it.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.163 position:50% align:center
I'm not willing
to share a space!

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.873 position:50% align:center
It won't work!

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.583 position:50% align:center
Then where do you suggest we go?

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
All the other practice rooms
have already been claimed

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center
by other groups.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.547 position:50% align:center
We could keep it simple and
practice out on the sidewalk.

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
That's your idea?

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
Are you literally insane?

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.179 position:50% align:center
Listen up, we are the
students of the 100th class

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
of the esteemed Kouka School!

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:28.808 position:50% align:center
We can't possibly
perform on a sidewalk!

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
What a way to ruin
Kouka for everyone!

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.021 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO] We're students now,
but we're destined to be

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:35.565 position:50% align:center
true professionals
of this craft! The elite!

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.442 position:50% align:center
Get that through
your thick skull!

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
I need a minute.

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:47.369 position:50% align:center
That was scary.

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.371 position:50% align:center
Who was stupid enough
to piss her off?

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:50.955 position:50% align:center
We all know she's
got a short fuse.

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
Actually, I wouldn't say that.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
Her mom was a Kouka actress,

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
and her grandma was
a top musume-yaku.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine what kind of
pressure that puts on her.

00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Hoshino.

00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:08.098 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Yeah, I know, I know.

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:09.349 position:50% align:center
That was mean.

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
I know and I'm sorry.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:12.602 position:50% align:center
I knew a girl like you once.

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:14.854 position:50% align:center
Our JPX48 group leader.

00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
She was always angry,
the same as you are now.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:18.942 position:50% align:center
Great.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.569 position:50% align:center
Did you come all the way out
here just to rub it in, or what?

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
Here's the thing.

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:26.324 position:50% align:center
My schooling was weird, as in
I didn't have very much at all.

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
It wasn't Sarasa's
fault this morning.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
When I got tripped up
on Juliet's lines,

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50% align:center
it's 'cause I...

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
I, uh, never learned
to read kanji.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:40.380 position:50% align:center
[AI] Back in JPX,
I was used to my manager

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.507 position:50% align:center
writing down anything
I needed for me.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.134 position:50% align:center
That's just how it was.

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
This morning was the
first time I realized

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:48.221 position:50% align:center
how screwed I actually am.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.515 position:50% align:center
I mean, none of us
have any experience,

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
so your instinct to push
us is right, otherwise,

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.311 position:50% align:center
we'll only end up
holding you back.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
That is so not fair.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
What if I don't want to do that?

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:00.900 position:50% align:center
Be the bad guy?

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:05.196 position:50% align:center
Then Group E fails together.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
Is that some kinda threat?

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:09.951 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Ta-dah!

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:11.870 position:50% align:center
Well? It's perfect,
don't you think?

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:13.913 position:50% align:center
It's not the sidewalk,
that's for sure!

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:16.249 position:50% align:center
Chika and I looked all over
the place for a good spot

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:17.417 position:50% align:center
to practice!

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
What do you say?
Will it work?

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:21.629 position:50% align:center
Not like we have much choice.

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:23.923 position:50% align:center
Now, we've got two weeks
to prep this scene,

00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:26.760 position:50% align:center
and our teacher's left us hung
out to dry, so whatever.

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50% align:center
Group E!

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.555 position:50% align:center
Let's do this thing!

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Oh, my gosh, are you serious?

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.768 position:50% align:center
You're lending me your
copy of the Winter Troupe's

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
Romeo and Juliet?

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:38.146 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, Kaoru asked me to.

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:40.023 position:50% align:center
She said that if Group E
doesn't level up,

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
and super quickly,

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center
then "they'll drag the entire
class down with them

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
into their shame."

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.529 position:50% align:center
Sounds like our Kaoru!

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.907 position:50% align:center
Not a fan of
sugarcoating, is she?

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ai!

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:53.828 position:50% align:center
Check it out, Sawa lent me her
copy of Romeo and Juliet!

00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:55.246 position:50% align:center
You wanna watch it with me?

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.082 position:50% align:center
I gotta spend the night
writing kanji readings

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
onto our script, so...

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
Okay, well, is it cool if I
borrow your DVD player

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:03.171 position:50% align:center
and headphones to
watch it with, then?

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
You'll see, I'm gonna
study so hard,

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
I'll knock Kaoru's
socks clean off!

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
Here's to us doing an
awesome job tomorrow!

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.057 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
[AI] I wonder where the Sarasa
I saw that day after the play

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.229 position:50% align:center
has disappeared to.

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:23.024 position:50% align:center
Uncle, this is a Montague.

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:26.236 position:50% align:center
A villain that is hither
come in spite.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
Cover'd with an antic face,

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
to fleer and scorn
at our solemnity?

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
Now, by the stock and
honour of my kin,

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.493 position:50% align:center
to strike him dead.

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
To strike him dead.

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.329 position:50% align:center
I hold it not a sin.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:42.043 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO] So, How has Group E
been coming along, Kaoru?

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
I mean, how's Sarasa?

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
I'm not really sure.

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.966 position:50% align:center
Like, it's kind of creepy.

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Creepy how?

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
You know how most people usually
improve little by little?

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
Sarasa, she's different.

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.106 position:50% align:center
I'm so nervous.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
That's okay.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
It's not like it matters.

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center
Mr. Andou isn't expecting
anything of us.

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
Okay, if that's true,
then why did the Phantom

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:12.115 position:50% align:center
even want us to do this
in the first place?

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.784 position:50% align:center
Maybe he wanted to see all
the fun we'd have doing it.

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
Or maybe he was testing
to see how much we'd bond

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
with each other by the end?

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:21.708 position:50% align:center
Think about it, isn't playing
pretend way more fun

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.585 position:50% align:center
when you've got
friends with you?

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
We only had two weeks to
put this whole thing together,

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
but I'm sure that even when I
finally get up on that stage

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:30.633 position:50% align:center
to play Lady Oscar,
I'll still remember

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:33.178 position:50% align:center
the very first scene we
did together in the park.

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
Jeez, enough about Oscar.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
It was really fun, though.

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50% align:center
Mistakes are okay.

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.976 position:50% align:center
it doesn't have to be perfect
as long as we keep going

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.436 position:50% align:center
until the end.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.813 position:50% align:center
Let's make a promise that
we're gonna give it our all.

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
Sure! 100% till the end!

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
Each group will get 15 minutes.

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
You'll see I've marked out
the playing area with tape,

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
so use that as a guide.

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
Group A goes first
most of the time.

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.120 position:50% align:center
But today, we'll start with E.

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
[HOSHINO]
Great, now we have to go first?

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center
Something else we
didn't consider.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
The size of the stage.

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.252 position:50% align:center
Well then, let's imagine it now!

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
There's a balcony up above,
and a grand ballroom, center.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
The light through the window
is tinged with blue,

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
and there's a crescent
moon shining overhead.

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
It seems she hangs
upon the cheek of night.

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:22.143 position:50% align:center
Like a rich jewel,
in an Ethiope's ear,

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear!

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
And, touching hers,
make blessed my rude hand.

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
Did my heart love till now?

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:32.153 position:50% align:center
For I ne'er saw true
beauty till this night.

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:35.073 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] C'mon, now. Stop
trying to gauge my reaction.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
If you're looking at me,
you're not in the scene.

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:38.785 position:50% align:center
Good woman!

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
Pray tell me,
what is her mother?

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.955 position:50% align:center
Why marry, bachelor.

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:44.207 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] She sure is spry
for an old lady.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.459 position:50% align:center
...a good lady,
wise and virtuous.

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
I nursed her daughter,
that you talk'd withal,

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
I tell you, he that can
lay hold of her...

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
How fortunate I am to
have served as nurse

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:53.758 position:50% align:center
to such a maiden.

00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
And her mother is
the lady of the house,

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.554 position:50% align:center
a good lady, wise
and virtuous, and...

00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
That's the wrong line!

00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I'm gonna cry!

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
Mistakes are okay.

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.982 position:50% align:center
It doesn't have to be perfect
as long as we keep going.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
Oh, forgive me!

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
I felt those qualities
of such importance,

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:14.738 position:50% align:center
I said them twice!

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
Nice save.

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
[AI]
O! Honey nurse, what news?

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
Hast thou met with him?

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:24.122 position:50% align:center
Come hither, nurse.
What is yond gentleman?

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] I can tell she's had
experience performing

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
on a big stage before.

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:31.046 position:50% align:center
But boy, this Juliet...

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
She is so not in love.

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
Still, I've noticed
she keeps looking at me.

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:40.972 position:50% align:center
And not the same
way Hoshino was.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
My only love sprung
from my only hate!

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
Hold on, Miss Narata.

00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:48.438 position:50% align:center
Are you performing for
an audience of one?

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
Next up, our Kouka misfit,
Sarasa Watanabe.

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center
[SARASA]
Uncle, this is a Montague.

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
A villain that is hither
come in spite.

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.658 position:50% align:center
What dares the
slave come hither,

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
cover'd with an antic face.

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:04.496 position:50% align:center
To fleer and scorn
at our solemnity?

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:06.831 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] She's focused on the
balcony and keeping her eyes

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:09.876 position:50% align:center
at a 45 degree angle
to catch the lights.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
Impressive.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
Fetch me my rapier.

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:14.214 position:50% align:center
Now, by the stock
and honour of my kin.

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
To strike him dead,
I hold it not a sin.

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
[AI] Sarasa Watanabe
was reborn overnight.

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
And today, now that
she has an audience,

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:31.231 position:50% align:center
somehow, she's even more...

00:20:31.314 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
Okay! Good job.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:35.068 position:50% align:center
Now, Group E, listen up.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
I have a little
question for you.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:39.280 position:50% align:center
Who did you imagine
as your audience?

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
The people in this room now.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.702 position:50% align:center
Um, I didn't actually
think about it, sir.

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:45.954 position:50% align:center
A full house with balcony seats!

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
One person.

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
And is that why you were
staring at me the entire time?

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Yes. That was my JPX training.

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:54.963 position:50% align:center
We were taught to always
connect with the audience.

00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
'Cause even an audience of just
one deserves our attention

00:20:58.174 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
as well as our respect.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's a very
good point, but think,

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
the Kouka theater holds
2,500 and always sells out.

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.184 position:50% align:center
Which means, when you're acting,

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:11.312 position:50% align:center
you should be performing
for every one of those 2,500

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
people, all the way
to the back wall.

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Got it!

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:16.359 position:50% align:center
And if you really want
to play a musume-yaku,

00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:17.986 position:50% align:center
we need sweetness.

00:21:18.069 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center
I've never seen a Juliet
before that didn't smile.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:22.949 position:50% align:center
Next, Miss Sawada!

00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] That was a great
recovery after you flubbed

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.912 position:50% align:center
your line, there.

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:30.498 position:50% align:center
But hunching over the tiniest
bit doesn't automatically

00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
turn you into an old woman.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
Use that imagination of yours.

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU]
Now, Miss Hoshino.

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:37.756 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] Careful not to let
your mind wander when

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:40.008 position:50% align:center
you're performing.

00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:42.969 position:50% align:center
It's crucial for you to
be present. Okay, next!

00:21:43.053 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center
That's it? That's all
you have for me?

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:47.349 position:50% align:center
Yeah, at least for the moment.

00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:49.893 position:50% align:center
I know you haven't mastered
any new skills yet,

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:53.563 position:50% align:center
so I'd prefer you do whatever
feels best to you right now.

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:56.149 position:50% align:center
Don't get too hung up on my
critique or anyone else's,

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:57.359 position:50% align:center
for that matter.

00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:59.319 position:50% align:center
Right, last up, Miss Watanabe.

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:00.862 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:03.406 position:50% align:center
[ANDOU] Your impression
was pretty uncanny.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.700 position:50% align:center
I admit, I was shocked.

00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:08.036 position:50% align:center
But I'm sorry, Miss Watanabe.

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:11.331 position:50% align:center
Fact is, you don't
have what it takes.

00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:17.587 position:50% align:center
If you don't change,
you'll never be a top star

00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:19.047 position:50% align:center
of the Kouka Revue.
