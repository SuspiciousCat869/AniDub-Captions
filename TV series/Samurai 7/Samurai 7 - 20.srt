know about it either.

161
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,250
[PRIME MINISTER]
I am humbled, my lord.

162
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,750
Thanks to your actions,

163
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,541
my position as an Imperial
Advisor is once again secure.

164
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,750
I hope I--

165
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,083
[AYAMARO] Unhand me!
I haven't done anything!

166
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,458
Father!

167
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,041
My lord... you
shouldn't eavesdrop.

168
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,500
I swear, I didn't hear a word.

169
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,875
Was there something you wanted?

170
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,083
[AYAMARO] I came to see
how you were doing.

171
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,083
Oh, I'm fabulous.

172
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,875
An ex-farmer becomes Emperor?

173
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,708
It's quite a change, isn't it?

174
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,375
It's a change other
people are starting

175
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,708
to take note of, my son. 
One that can be frightening...

176
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,500
What will they say,
do you think...

177
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,250
when they find out
your secret...

178
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:07,041
You were the one who killed
the Imperial Envoy, weren't you?

179
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,750
So you were listening...!

180
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,083
Technically... He drove
in the blade, though.

181
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,166
See, this poor man
needed my help...

182
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,583
He knew the Envoy wanted his
position, and I... wanted yours.

183
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,291
So? What do we do with him?

184
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,500
Let me think...

185
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,791
Young Master, we'll be docking
at Kougakyo any moment.

186
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,083
Oh, is it that time already?

187
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,791
Ukyo!

188
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,375
[UKYO]
Unlike those filthy Bandits,

189
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,916
I have the capacity
for true compassion.

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,833
I wish to show my gratitude
for all you have taught me.

191
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,583
From now on, Father...

192
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,333
...you will be my
Warehouse Manager.

193
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,958
Go greet the Shikimoribito.

194
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,833
I see you're getting some
use outta this baby.

195
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,666
[MASAMUNE] Well, that makes
sense-- you are a samurai now.

196
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,416
But this thing is useless.

197
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,458
I'll have to
re-forge it for you.

198
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,583
[KIKUCHIYO] We'll just borrow
these until you're done... Here.

199
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:27,916
Easy.

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,250
We're going
to the Capital.

201
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh...? And what do you
think that'll accomplish?

202
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,083
[KIKUCHIYO]
Savin' everyone, of course!

203
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,708
We can't just
leave them to die.

204
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:36,875
Maybe we should wait.

205
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,458
What?!

206
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,541
Kambei isn't the type of man who
would let himself be executed

207
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,958
without putting up a fight.

208
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,291
Yes, but how...?

209
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,083
How can he rescue anybody
from his jail cell?

210
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,250
I don't know...

211
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,166
But still...

212
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,291
I don't think we
should interfere

213
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,958
with whatever plan
he might have.

214
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,541
So you think we
should do nothing?

215
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,125
[KIRARA]
For now.

216
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,125
For a samurai, the failure to
act is a path of eternal shame.

217
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,708
[KIRARA] But won't it
be shaming Kambei

218
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,625
if we refuse to trust him now?

219
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,208
[KIKUCHIYO] 
When a samurai makes a mistake,

220
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,166
he pays for it with his life...

221
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,041
Katsu and I aren't gonna
let that happen to Kambei...

222
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:11,250
We're gonna save him and
show him what samurai can do.

223
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,875
Whoa... It's HUGE!

224
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,875
Your final meal...
Great Samurai.

225
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,958
Don't cry.

226
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,166
I can't help it. If you
won't cry for yourself,

227
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,750
then I'll cry for you.

228
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,208
I just wish you would
let me bring you

229
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,541
something other than a
riceball for your final meal.

230
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,458
No... After all, it was rice
like this that hired me...

231
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:25,166
I will not eat anything else
until that job is complete.

232
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,083
But you can't save any
of us if you're dead.

233
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,958
You think not?

234
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,500
[UKYO]
Oh, dear...

235
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,708
That look is no good for you.

236
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,291
You know, I don't hate you.

237
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,916
I thought I would,
but it's because of you

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,416
that I've become what I have,

239
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,250
so I wanted to come down
here and bid you farewell.

240
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,916
I'm sorry you won't be
afforded a samurai death.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,041
You must feel shame, being
unable to commit hara kiri.

242
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,875
What would you
warriors call that?

243
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,416
A losing battle?

244
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,041
I'd suggest you be careful

245
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,000
until you actually
cut my head off.

246
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,333
That is adorable!
You're still going!

247
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:24,208
You will be dead soon, Kambei,
then Kanna Village is next.

248
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,333
Look! It's Kambei!

249
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,375
So... That's the assassin.

250
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,833
Sensei.

251
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,375
[KIKUCHIYO] They got him
chained up like a dog.

252
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,416
What do you think
he's gonna do?

253
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,833
This may be the one
he doesn't walk away from.

254
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,416
[KIKUCHIYO] You know,
if we're going to save Kambei,

255
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,083
now's the time.

256
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,333
If we save only Sensei,
then we will not have made

257
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,083
enough of a difference
here today...

258
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,791
We need to find a way to
rescue all the women as well.

259
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,291
[KIKUCHIYO] Oooohh...!

260
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,125
We're gonna have him foaming
at the mouth with jealousy.

261
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,208
I know what
you're going to say.

262
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,791
However, this is
something we must do.

263
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,041
You understand, don't you?

264
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,333
I understand.

265
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,666
Kikuchiyo-dono...

266
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,916
I need you to help me find
a way into the Capital.

267
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,000
[KOMACHI] Hey,
check it out: Guardians!

268
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,166
[KATSUSHIRO]
Wait! Please stop for a moment!

269
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,916
Shikimoribito, where, may I
ask, are you taking your cargo?

270
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,625
[SHIKIMORIBITO]
Ah... You're one of the guests

271
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,625
we had a short time ago.

272
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,666
[KATSUSHIRO] I am. My name
is Okamoto Katsushiro.

273
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,375
[SHIKIMORIBITO] We are
on our way to the Capital.

274
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,250
To honor the ascension
of the new Emperor,

275
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,208
we bring a gift
of energy cells.

276
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,666
I was hoping you'd say that.

277
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,375
Well... Bet they didn't
see that one comin'!

278
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,375
Forgive me... My friends...

279
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,916
If anyone finds you, tell them
you were ambushed by Bandits.

280
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,250
[KIKUCHIYO] 
Well?

281
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,125
[KOMACHI] I'm not
so sure about that.

282
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,083
Maybe you should just pose

283
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,583
as the Guardian's
samurai bodyguard, huh?

284
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,333
I dunno, Katsu said
we'd be less suspicious

285
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,708
if we dressed as Guardians.

286
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,958
Wow, Katsu, that's
a clever plan for you.

287
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,166
I suppose I should take
that as a compliment.

288
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,250
[KOMACHI] Seems more
like something

289
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,125
Kambei would come up with.

290
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,166
I don't know about that.

291
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,333
Sister! What do you
think you're doing?

292
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,750
I'm going with them.

293
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,250
Do you think we're not
capable on our own?

294
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,833
No, its...

295
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,083
Neither of you knows what Sanae
looks like so you'll need me...

296
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,000
I am going to go with you.

297
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,375
[KIKUCHIYO]
I think someone's startin'

298
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,625
to like the smell of battle.

299
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,791
Oh... Now you look scary, too.

300
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,333
[KATSUSHIRO]
You two stay quiet.

301
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,916
I'll do all the talking.

302
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,208
[KIKUCHIYO] I know, I know,
you've told us, damn it.

303
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,083
When we get inside,
you're saving Kambei,

304
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,375
and we'll go after the women.

305
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,083
Stop right there.

306
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,583
[KATSUSHIRO] We come here today
bearing gifts of energy cells

307
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,708
to celebrate the ascension
of the new Amanushi.

308
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,750
Let's be sure... Check 'em out.

309
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,916
[KATSUSHIRO] Stay back!

310
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,375
Why do you think
we're dressed like this?

311
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,416
We are transporting
energy cells!

312
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,750
Come any closer, and
risk life-long contamination!

313
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,625
It's all right,
we're expecting you.

314
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,500

[AYAMARO]
Welcome to the Capital.

317
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,166
It's your old friend, Ayamaro.

318
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,375
I have been assigned to the
post of Warehouse Manager.

319
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:36,000
It is my job to assess the
trade value of your gifts...

320
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,291
In bales of rice.

321
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,291
[KIKUCHIYO] Do you Capital-types
really eat this much rice?

322
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,916
An odd question...

323
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,166
You are a Guardian,

324
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,500
I would expect you would
know the answer to that.

00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,291
[KIKUCHIYO]
This is just wrong!

What makes all this rice
so damn important?

[AYAMARO]
Who are you people?!

332
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,041
[KIKUCHIYO]
I'll ask the questions!

333
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,833
You've been taking
this rice for a long time.

334
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,083
Have you even eaten any of it?

335
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,000
No... please, of course not!

336
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,416
It's all used to purchase
energy cells, to... trade.

337
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,791
[KIKUCHIYO] What?

338
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,583
[AYAMARO] The Nobuseri take
rice from the farmers,

339
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,125
we then trade that rice
to the Shikimoribito

340
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,166
in exchange for energy cells.

341
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,500
That is the arrangement
devised by the Capital

342
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,125
to ensure its prosperity.

343

[KIKUCHIYO]
That's not the only way!

345
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,166
You could grow your
own damn rice,

346
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,291
or give the farmers
what they deserve!

347
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,583
They're all breaking
their backs, suffering,

while you sit
around getting fat!

349

to witness the execution
of Kambei Shimada,

an Imperial Envoy

of the former Amanushi...

The only reason
I know all this stuff

is because the Capital came down
to Kougakyo, and Kiku and Katsu
