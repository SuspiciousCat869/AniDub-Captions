I wonder how that could be.

317
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:53,583
Maybe we'll see with
the next secret plan of his

318
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,208
if he's not so
perfect after all...

319
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,875
I mean, Kirara did tell him
he was wrong in the forest,

320
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,875
when she was
sticking up for Katsu.

321
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,666
You have one heck
of an older sister,

322
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,208
don't you, Komachi?

323
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:05,416
She's not scared of anything.

324
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,875
They say the samurai came
here because of the rice,

325
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:10,291
but I think they came for her.

326
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,708
Well, the Bandits are
really angry right now,

327
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,458
and they're bound
to want revenge.

328
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,708
I wouldn't be surprised if this

329
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,458
is the last one of these
messages we get to make!
