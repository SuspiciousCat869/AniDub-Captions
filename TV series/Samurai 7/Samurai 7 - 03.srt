00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,958
for a fascinating
game of chance!

A samurai's life
is on the line!

Oh, wow!

[MAN IN CROWD]
This guy for real?

163

Alright, boy, it's up
to you to make this fun.

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,083
You know your target.

165
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,041
Here you go...
Does this help?

166
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,083
This is stupid...

167
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,291
A samurai should
not put his life

168
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,625
on the line for entertainment.

169
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,958
It's dishonorable.

170
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,083
What's the matter, boy?
You nervous?

171
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,458
Shut up! Don't mock me!

172
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:18,208
Fine... Why don't I move
closer, make it easier... 

173
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,291
You can aim, right?

174
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,625
[GOROBEI] Do it!

[CROWD YELLS IN AMAZEMENT]

176
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,625
[KIKUCHIYO]
He actually did it.

177
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,041
He's good.

[KIKUCHIYO]
He's nuts.

180
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,416
Haven't I always said
samurai are strange?

181
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,791
[AYAMARO]
You showed good sense

182
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,791
bringing Ukyo here
before he was hurt.

183
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,541
I hate to think of the fortune
I invested in raising him

184
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,833
going to waste
if he were killed.

185
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:15,666
[TESSAI] Yes.

186
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,416
This is a
merchant city.

187
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,791
The new class of rulers
cannot let these warrior relics

188

destroy it
with swords.

This machine samurai...

190
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,500
Tell me, is it the
same as the No-Buseri?

191
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,916
[TESSAI] No. It's a type
I've never seen before...

192
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,333
A non-standard
model, I believe.

193
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,291
[AYAMARO] Hmm. I heard he was
working with someone else.

194
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,875
[TESSAI]
A young man.

[AYAMARO] Kill him, too.
And the peasants.

196
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:41,000
[TESSAI] The young master would
like to keep the girl, sir.

197
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,958
[AYAMARO] The young master

Of course.

my humble thanks.

[KATSUSHIRO] For failing in
my duty to protect you...

220
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,416
I told you not to
let go of my hand...

221
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,875
but I let go of yours...

222

It was Kikuchiyo who defeated
those guardsmen, not I...

I was disarmed soon
after the fight broke out...

It's shameful.
I call myself a samurai,

to make sure you have it...?!

They feed you all
the rice you can eat,

The bluffs will be
difficult to protect.

269

Sensei, perhaps we could find
a way to obtain some weapons,

270
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,416
then teach the farmers
themselves how to fight.

This is
a war, boy...

It's not
just a game...

more daunting

That's right! Keep sucking up!

they can't keep
fighting like this.

[KIKUCHIYO]
I'm going to sleep!

293
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,833
You said there
are about 40 units

294
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,458
in the Bandit's
main force.

295
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,250
Yes, that sounds
about right.

Both Beni-gumo
and Raiden models...

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,875
We badly need to
strengthen our forces...

298
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:45,750
Only experienced warriors will
be able to stand up to them...

299
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:49,541
I'll need seven samurai,
including myself.

300
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,041
[KIRARA]
Seven...

301
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,250
But the Elder only gave
us permission for four.

302
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,875
Are you sure
Kiku won't do?

303
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,833
[RIKICHI] The Great Samurai
has told us his decision.

304
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,833
We will trust in Kambei's
wisdom no matter what, sister.

305
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,875
Then it's decided. We should
start searching the city now.

306
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,125
Six more samurai
won't be easy to find.

00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,875
[RIKICHI] Priestess, I
wish you would stay here.

308
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:13,791
Why?

309
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,125
It's too dangerous.

310
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,958
What if those guardsmen
are still looking for you?

311
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,833
We can't risk
your life.

312
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,416

That's right...!

The city's way more dangerous

Hide yourself near the entrance

Why, sensei?
