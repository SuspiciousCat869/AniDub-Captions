I took his life,
so I should give mine.

It's not a matter of who dies...
But who dies first.

319

I need you to keep
living Katsushiro...

How did you get here?

322
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,625
Heihachi came and got me.

323
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,708
And where's
Heihachi now?

324
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,541
He didn't make it...

325
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,750
He went down with
the main engines.

[KIKUCHIYO] What do you
mean he didn't make it?!

You mean he's dead too?!

This is war.

to live to see the sunset...

Hey Okara, it's me!

334
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,875
Well, like always, I've got a
whole lot of stuff to tell you.

335
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,875
It mostly has to do with Sister.

336
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:30,083
She's having all
kinds of trouble!

337
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,708
First she tried tell
Kambei something important,

338
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,916
because I think she likes
him as more than a friend,

339
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,416
if you know what I mean...

340
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,166
but I'm not sure why since
he's old enough to be our dad,

341
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,916
and I think that's
kind of gross,

342
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,500
but who knows what
she's thinking...

343
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,708
Anyway, I guess he told her
he didn't like her back,

344
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,333
and I don't think
she liked hearing that

345
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:49,208
because she started to cry...

346
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,708
But that's just part of it...

347
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,416
I think she and Katsu might
still like each other, too!

348
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,625
Because before they got
all mad at each other,

349
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:58,375
he was always looking for
an excuse to talk to her,

350
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,125
and when she'd catch
him staring at her,

351
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:02,083
he'd always turn bright red...

352
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,916
He used to not
smell like battle,

353
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,291
but he seems pretty
different now,

354
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:07,083
so I'm not sure
what she'll think...

355
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,083
You never can tell
with this group...

356
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:11,250
Hmm.... It's too bad
everyone can't have

357
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,458
a perfect future
husband like Kiku!

358
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:16,333
Oh well, I guess we'll find out
how everything ends real soon!

359
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:17,958
Bye bye!
