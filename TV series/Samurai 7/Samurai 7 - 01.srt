He's the samurai who's
going to save our village!

[KOMACHI] Dear Okara.
Hey, it's me, Komachi!

315
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:27,541
Everything okay?

316
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:31,458
I promised I'd write once
we got in, so here it is!

317
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:33,750
The trip out of the
village was pretty.

318
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,500
The city's name is Kogakyo,

319
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,666
and it's way different
from the country.

320
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,375
It's big and noisy and full of
people, and kind of smelly, too.

321
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,541
This one guy was even
selling cooked frogs!

322
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,416
I asked sister why the Bandits
have to steal our rice,

323
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,666
if there's so much food here.

324
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,083
But maybe it's like you said--
the Bandits are so big,

325
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:58,083
they just have to eat and
eat until all the rice is gone!

326
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:01,500
Sister says during the
Great War, we fed samurai,

327
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,583
so we've always been
giving food to someone.

328
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:08,791
But if we grow it all,
how come we have to go hungry?

329
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,375
Well, I guess that's
why we're hiring samurai.

330
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,000
To drive the Bandits out!

331
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,458
I hope I can tell you
more about it soon...!

332
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,083
Bye-bye!
