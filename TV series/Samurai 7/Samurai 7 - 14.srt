00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:57,875
[OKARA]
Oh, don't worry.

320
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:00,125
She's probably just
trying to help Katsu out.

321
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:02,041
[KOMACHI]
Help him? What do you mean?

322
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:05,500
I thought we were all trying
to help out all the samurai.

323
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:08,291
[OKARA] I'm not talking about
building walls, Komachi.

324
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,458
I'm talking about
grown up emotion stuff.

325
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:11,708
[KOMACHI]
You're so smart.

326
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,958
How do you know so much
about being an adult?

327
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,166
[OKARA] I don't know.
Guess I was born with it... 

328
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,375
Oh, and all the
spying helps, too.

329
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,458
