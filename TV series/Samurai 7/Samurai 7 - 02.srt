End of the road, farm girl.

You'd better come back to safety

Hey, Okara! It's Komachi again!

I couldn't wait to write
you a second time!

Today I'll tell you all about

348
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:31,541
the Great Samurai we've
met so far in the city.

349
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,583
The first was Katsushiro.

350
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,583
He's like this cool
older brother--

351

about the same age as sister.

He takes being a samurai real
serious, and he's nice, too,

but sis doesn't
seem impressed...

354
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,125
Next there was Kambei.

355
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:48,541
He's like someone's old uncle
who doesn't smile very much.

356
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,083
He seems super strong.

357
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:52,625
He gave this big fake name
and saved this baby,

358
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:54,791
and you won't believe
what he did later!

359

He's sister's favorite,
but I don't know--

360
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,333
I think he's kind
of mean and scary.

My favorite has got to be
Kikuchiyo--I just call him Kiku.

He's this big
red machine, Okara!

363
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:07,833
And he's real funny,
and tries to do good things,

364
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:10,666
and screams at the top of
his lungs when he's in a fight.

365
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,708
I think I'm going
to be his sidekick!

00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,416
I'll let you know
how that goes...
