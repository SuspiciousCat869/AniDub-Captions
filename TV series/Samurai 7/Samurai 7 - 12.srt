160
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,708
Or wait. Maybe we should
skip the ceremonies

161
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,666
and chop off his head now.

162
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,666
Save some time!

163
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,583
You know nothing about
farmers, samurai,

164
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,791
so don't think about
handing out verdicts!

165
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,833
And you! You lay
another finger on that man,

166
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,416
you'll be dealing with me!

167
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,583
Oh, really?

168
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,791
[KIKUCHIYO]
You're damn right!

169
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,125
Just ask the farmers--
Take a vote!

170
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,666
They'll never fault
Manzo for what he did.

171
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,875
And neither will you!

172
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,291
[KIKUCHIYO] Do I think
farmers are noble? Humph!

173
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,208
They're foxes!
Treacherous beasts!

174
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,166
They'll stoop to anything
that makes their lives easier.

175
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,833
That's why they hired samurai
to defend Kanna for them!

176
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:53,291
It's your village! Put your own
stinking lives on the line!

177
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,875
But oh, no!
They'd never do that!

178
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,166
Sure, they'd sweat
all day in the fields

179
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,458
for their darling rice!

180
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:03,375
But they won't risk
their blood for it!

181
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:08,166
They say, "We have no
rice, we only eat millet.

182
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,875
We've got nothing!"

183
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,333
But they have everything.

184
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,666
Dig under the floorboards!
Search the barns!

185
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,666
Or those hidden storehouses!
You'll find plenty there!

186
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,416
Rice! Sake! Salt! Meat!

187
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,625
They pose as meek
but are full of lies!

188
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,250
If they smell battle,
they hunt the defeated!

189
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,416
If the winds change,
they betray you!

190
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,125
Farmers are stingy!

191
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:37,500
Foxy! Blubbering! Cowardly!
Cruel! Stupid! Murderous...

192
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,375
Damn it, that's what they are!

193
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,041
But who made them into
these miserable beasts?

194
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:46,041
You did!
You samurai did it to them!

195
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,125
You burn their villages!
Destroy their farms!

196
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,250
Steal their food!
Force them into slave labor!

197
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,625
Take their women!
Kill them if they resist!

198
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,250
So what should 
farmers do? What?!

199
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,791
I can't blame Manzo,
conniving and pathetic as he is!

200
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,916
He just played the odds and
the Bandits won! That's all!

201
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,375
Farmers are corrupt!

202
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:11,208
But Bandits are corrupt!
And Samurai are corrupt!

203
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,916
Why would anyone risk
their lives for anyone?

204
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,958
But I'll fight for them.
I'll kill all the Bandits!

205
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,083
Damn it.

206

[KIKUCHIYO SOBS]

207
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,750
Damn it...

208
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,583
You were born a farmer...
weren't you, Kikuchiyo?

209
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,833
[KIKUCHIYO] Huh...?

210
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,000
[FARMERS] Huh? What?!

211
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,083
Is that true, Kiku--
you're a farmer?

212
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,583
[KIKUCHIYO]
You're disappointed.

213
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,208
Who, me...? No!

214
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,833
That just means you can
help us with the harvest!

215
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:52,916
[KIKUCHIYO] Huh...?

216
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,250
[KAMBEI] Then my
suspicions were correct.

217
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,541
[KIKUCHIYO] You mean
you guessed it before?

218
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,125
From the very
first time I met you.

219
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,250
[KIKUCHIYO]
Okay, I was a farmer, so what?!

220
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,666
I figured if I acted
like samurai,

221
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,250
people would think
of me better!

222
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,291
Then do you now think
better of samurai?

223
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,791
[KIKUCHIYO]
Huh...? No!

224
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,125
Kiku, you can be
my new sidekick!

225
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,458
Excuse me,
he's my sidekick.

226
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,625
At last the seven are complete.

227
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:19,750
[KIKUCHIYO] Wha...?

228
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,000
[KAMBEI] I'd hoped for this.

229
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,958
A fighter with a farmer's
heart may help us.

230
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,166
But for your samurai
spirit to shine through,

231
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,166
you had to understand
who you truly are...

232
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,250
Manzo...

233
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,708
[MANZO]
Ahh! Please! Forgive me!

234
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,416
[SHINO]
Great Samurai, I beg you!

235
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,666
Spare his life! Please!

236
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,166
Manzo, you love your land, yes?

237
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,625
[MANZO] Yes, yes!

238
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,166
But think about it.

239
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,041
Is it really your land right
now, or is it the Nobuseri's?

240
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,750
If you truly love your
land, then fight for it,

241
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,333
and if you love your daughter,
then fight for her--

242
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,958
Do what you must...
Do it for the whole village.

243
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,833
And be honest with yourself.

244
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,458
Selfish deeds are the shortest
path to self-destruction.

245
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,416
Do not forget--this is not
your normal harvest season,

246
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,208
or village politics as usual.

247
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,625
We are waging a war here.

248
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,916
And I no longer think of you
as a mere rice farmer...

249
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,125
You are an honorable
soldier of Kanna Fortress.

250
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,416
And as a soldier,
you understand why,

251
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,833
for the sake of the whole,

252
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,958
the bridge must be destroyed,
and your home abandoned.

253
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,583
Once the Bandits are dealt with,
fallen homes can be rebuilt...

254
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,833
But heed this warning--

255
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:32,208
If you betray us again,
I will kill you myself.

[MANZO]
Of course! Thank you!

257
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,541
So the farmers of Kanna
are soldiers now?

258
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,541
Do you disapprove,

00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,458
No, no...
Sounds good to me.

So this matter
is settled?
