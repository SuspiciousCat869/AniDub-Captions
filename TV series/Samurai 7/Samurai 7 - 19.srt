00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,000
Take up where the ruler
before him left off,

160
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,458
then make subtle changes...

161
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,375
in order to assert his power
without risking upheaval.

162
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,833
[Emperor]
I see.

163
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,041
I brought you your dinner.

164
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,666
Thank you, Mizuki.

165
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,375
By the way...
Uh, Great Kambei...

166
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,416
Do you happen to know
Ukyo from Kougakyo?

167
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,541
[Emperor]
Question 56...

168
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:59,750
What will cause the most
damage to an Emperor's rule?

169
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,541
That would be the
disapproval of his subjects...

170
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,583
If that happens, a ruler
can no longer truly govern.

171
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,750
[Emperor]
Hmmm.

172
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,750
Which is why an Emperor
must be decisive.

173
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:14,916
If his ability to make decisions
weakens, he should step down.

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,583
The other side of
that coin, however...

175
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:20,166
is it's just as dangerous to
incur the anger of the people.

176
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,583
[Emperor] I assume
you have a plan

177
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,625
to avoid incurring this anger?

178
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,208
Simple. The Emperor
will no longer

179
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,958
take anything from
his subjects.

180
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,291
How then, will you
maintain the Capital?

181
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,791
They'll pay a tribute...

182
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,833
...in return for our continued
generosity and protection.

183
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,875
[Emperor]
Just the answer I expected.

184
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,250
Living among peasants
has served you well.

185
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,458
You have shared their lives,
and thus, know their minds.

186
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,875
You are the first of my clones

187
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,041
to have achieved
this insight, Ukyo.

188
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,041
Question 57...

189
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,583
Given the options of a land of
order rife with injustice...

190
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,000
Or a land of justice
which has no order...

191
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,125
It's been two days and
the Emperor has been

192
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,875
without his attendants
since the Test began...

193
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,583
I hope he's not straining
himself too much.

194
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,208
I sympathize, Okata...

195
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,500
But it is law-- no one
may enter the chamber

196
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,791
until the Test is done.

197
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,291
Yes, but...

198
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,083
Please, Okata... Come rest.

199
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,541
Okata!

200
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,041
Thank you so much.
You really saved us.

201
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,708
You keep it. What's a
favor between samurai?

202
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:27,708
[Kikuchiyo]
That's right!

203
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,458
We samurai have
to stick together,

204
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,458
that's what I always say. Heh.

205
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:35,000
[Komachi] Haven't we met you
samurai somewhere before?

206
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,500
In Kougakyo...

207
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,833
We were looking for samurai
to help us in Kanna Village.

208
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,583
Yes, I remember you now...

209
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,250
We've been hearing stories
about what you did in Kanna.

210
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,958
Yeah. Everyone's heard about
the famous Seven Samurai

211
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,083
and what they did...

212
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,458
They're already legend
around Kougakyo.

213
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,041
[Kikuchiyo] Ooooh!
Then you've heard of

214
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,750
Kikuchiyo the Bandit Basher,
mighty machine samurai master!

215
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,666
[Komachi] So, tell me,
where are you guys headed?

216
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,500
We're going to Nodate Village...

217
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,916
Magistrate Ukyo
has given us a mission.

218
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,625
Ukyo, you say?

219
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,458
He's taken over
his father's position...

220
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,291
He's sent all the samurai
on missions of goodwill.

221
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:13,208
[Kikuchiyo] Wait...! What did
you say about that powder face?!

222
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,916
We're following
your good example...

223
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,333
Ukyo says you're right

224
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,583
and the villagers should
be protected from the Bandits...

225
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,583
All samurai have been
released from custody...

226
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,666
He says we should remember
that samurai were given

227
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,291
a responsibility to the people.

228
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,541
To the people?

229
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,375
All of us ronin who were
starving on the streets

230
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,541
have a new mission.

231
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,125
Protect the villages...

232
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,958
I can't tell you how happy
we are to have our jobs back.

233
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,666
And we all owe
our thanks to you.

234
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,708
[Emperor]
Question 108...

235
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:46,166
You are the Emperor and you
must select your advisors...

236
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,500
Who do you choose...?

237
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,541
Former enemies,
or former allies?

238
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,791
Former enemies,
without a doubt.

239
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:56,125
It would be an opportunity
for reconciliation, for one.

240
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,083
Also, it would make the enemy
reluctant to be seen as hostile,

241
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,625
no matter what his politics,

242
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,916
therefore reducing
the risk of war.

243
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,916
[Emperor]
Are you afraid of war?

244
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,541
[Ukyo] No. But only a fool has
his mind set on fighting.

245
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,375
[Emperor]
What you say interests me.

246
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,500
That's good,
then let's continue...

247
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,708
Am I answering the
questions well so far?

248
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,541
[Emperor]
Yes. So far...

249
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,500
Question 109...

250
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,958
As an Emperor who aspires
to accomplish great deeds,

251
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,583
of what must you
always be aware?

252
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,500
[Ukyo]
Two things.

253
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,833
[Emperor]
Continue.

254
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,666
Well first of all...
The times we live in...

255
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,958
In our current world
climate, the wars are over

256
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,083
and the Merchants are
building toward the future...

257
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,416
However... All of those
efforts will be for nothing

258
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
unless the ruling
class can understand

259
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,791
the needs and desires
of the masses.

260
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,750
[Emperor]
And the second...?

261
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,083
The doctor told us
it was fatigue.

262
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,833
Do not be concerned for me.
How is the Amanushi?

263
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,833
Are you still worried about him?

264
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,833
Yes, I've always felt
sympathy for the Emperor...

265
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,833
How can I not when he's
never felt the sun on his face

266
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,291
or the wind in his hair...

267
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,291
He's trapped in that tank,
a prisoner of frailty,

268
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,583
all alone, fulfilling
his duty to us all.

269
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,000
You're trembling.

270
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,583
I'm worried, Mizuki...

271
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,625
That man they call Ukyo...

272
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,041
I'm afraid of the things
I see in his eyes.

273
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,125
The Test will be
over soon, my lady...

274
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,375
Maybe they've found an heir!

275
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,416
But then... what will
happen to this child?

276
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,041
[Emperor] As Emperor,
how will you distribute...

277
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,208
He's lasted far
longer than the others.

278
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,083
Then perhaps he is the one.

279
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,958
There has to be
equilibrium between...

280
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:43,041
[OVERLAPPING DIALOGUE]

281
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:53,041
[OVERLAPPING DIALOGUE]

282
00:16:53,125 --> 00:17:00,208
[OVERLAPPING DIALOGUE]

283
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,125
[Emperor]
I have one final question...

284
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,875
What is the most important
qualification for an Emperor?

285
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,958
Talent, I suppose?

286
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,916
What do studies
matter, after all...

287
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,625
When you are faced with
an immediate decision

288
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,916
and must rely on instinct.

289
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,125
What about virtue?
Honesty, and goodwill?

290
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,208
You've grown up disguised,
your true origins hidden.

291
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,625
Isn't that alone an
affront to the people?

292
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,041
My life in trade has
taught me diplomacy.

293
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,166
Sometimes a lie
can be... prudent.

294
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,583
[Gong]

295
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,041
Hey, there.

296
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,666
He's... alive...

297
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,000
[Emperor] This man is my
true and rightful heir...

298
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,583
He will be the next Amanushi...

299
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,125
He is me... And I am him...

300
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,583
So let it be known.

301
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,125
All true!

302
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,125
[Emperor] How are
you feeling, Sanae...?

303
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,375
Better, I hope.

304
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,833
[Sanae] I am, but you must
be tired, my Lord.

305
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,750
[Emperor] Please, rest,
for the child's sake.

306
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,791
[Emperor] You carry my heir,
the last of my clones...

307
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,291
He, too, will
succeed me someday.

308
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,625
What about the one
called Ukyo, my Lord?

309
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,958
What if he tries
to harm the child?

310
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,833
[Emperor]
Worry not, my dear...

311
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,666
We are one and the same.

312
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,916
Ukyo is me...
As is this child.

313
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:52,708
[Ukyo] So how is Kirara these
days... Kambei Shimada?

314
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,458
I know you didn't kill
the Envoy, by the way...

315
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,958
The Emperor says you did...

316
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:01,458
...but I just can't quite
believe it for some reason.

317
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,708
[Ukyo] So tell me,

318
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,541
what does it feel like
waiting to be executed?

319
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,541
What is it you're
trying to do here?

320
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,458
[Ukyo] Why, conquer
the world, of course!

321
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,291
By the way, the true murderer
is right here in this room.

322
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,291
And why would you
assassinate the Imperial Envoy?

323
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,083
I only did it because
I was asked to...

324
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,208
You see, I was in a position
to do someone a favor...

325
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,375
This is a bad omen.

326
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,166
[Emperor] The ceremony
will take place soon.

327
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,041
For now, you must
become accustomed

328
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,750
to life in the Capital.

329
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,875
[Ukyo] May I ask
you a question now?

330
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,916
Anything you wish.

331
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,541
You see a long time ago...

332
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,541
there was a great
and powerful dragon...

333
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,958
...with two heads...

334
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,583
One said it wanted
to live in the south

335
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,750
and dive for big juicy fish...

336
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,666
But the other one
wanted to live in the North...

337
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,583
and search the skies
for tasty little birds.

338
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,375
And do you know what happened
to that beautiful dragon...?

339
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,708
Starved to death.

340
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,625
Now my question, Emperor...

341
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,666
Do you really think it's wise
for a nation to have two rulers?

342
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,958
It is entirely unnecessary.

343
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,833
I so agree.

344
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,916
Our forebears have
known it for untold years...

345
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,583
Even in the greatest
of civilizations...

346
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,541
crippling imperfections
will appear.

347
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,583
The government must be willing
to change with the times.

348
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,333
And after so much struggle...

349
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,375
Surely you've grown tired.

350
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,958
But don't you worry
about a thing...

351
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,208
I will help ease your burden...

352
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:59,458
After all... I am
you and you are me.

353
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,333
[Ukyo]
Good night, Emperor.

354
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,750
Ah yes, he is me...

355
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,791
But I... am so much more.

356
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,875
[crowd murmurs]

357
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,166
[Sanae]
Amanushi?

358
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,291
[Sanae]
Amanushi!

359
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,250
[UKYO-EMPEROR]
Sanae, is that you?

360
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,833
Then you're all right?

361
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,000
Please... Stay there.

362
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:37,416
My dear, are you familiar
with the term zenjo?

363
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,291
It is when an Emperor of
virtue abdicates his throne

364
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,625
in favor of a new Emperor
of even greater virtue.

365
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,416
I don't understand.

366
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,416
Farewell... dearest Sanae.

367
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,250
I wish that just one time...

368
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,958
we could have run through
the hills and plains together...

369
00:21:56,041 --> 00:22:00,541
But that is not to be.

370
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,375
Amanushi, please...!
Raise up the screen...!

371
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,708
Why will you not
let me approach you?

372
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,500
The rest... I leave in
the hands of my clone...

373
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,625
Ukyo... Step forth and
claim what is yours.

374
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:16,208
Those words were
far too good for him.

375
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,000
Amanushi.

376
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:41,416
Amanushi... Are you
certain about this?

377
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,458
From now on...
I am the Amanushi.

378
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:01,208
His... His Excellency...
The new Amanushi...

379
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,458
All hail the Divine Emperor!

380
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:09,000
Hail! All Hail! All Hail!

381
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:18,416
♪ closing song ♪

382
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,250
[KOMACHI] Shhhhhh. Quiet.

383
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,958
I'm trying to use
the Dowsing Crystal.

384
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,333
You know when sis retires,
I'm the next in line!

385
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:31,166
Well, I'm back
on the road, Okara,

386
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,583
and even though the Bandits
are out of Kanna for now,

387
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,625
it feels like there's a whole
lot more at stake this time.

388
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:39,083
I couldn't believe
the news about Ukyo--

389
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,625
he's the one in the makeup
who tried to kidnap sis,

390
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,458
and then chased us around
and shot Katsu in the leg--

391
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:45,791
I'm sure I told you that.

392
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,458
But now he's in charge,
and he's ordering samurai

393
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:50,125
to go other villages like ours,

394
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:52,041
and protect them
from the Bandits.

395
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:54,250
And I thought he
was the bad guy...

396
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,791
You should have
seen Kiku, though,

397
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,208
when he heard he was famous.

398
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:00,250
He was all, "I'm mighty Kiku!
Defender of the weak!

399
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,958
I have dragon breath
and elephant feet!" Heh...

400
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:05,166
How can I not love the guy?

401
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,291
But seriously,
I'm getting worried.

402
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,708
Is Kanna really safe?

403
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:10,625
Is Rikichi's wife
going to be okay?

404
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,291
It seems like the whole
world is changing,

405
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,125
and I'm not sure that's good.

406
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:17,166
I hope I can see
you soon! Bye-Bye.
