[BOY 3]
Don't ever come back!

162
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,375
[KIKUCHIYO] Please, don't!
Samurai are so scary!

163
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,958
Hey, that's pretty good
acting... for a machine.

164
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,375
[KIKUCHIYO]
For a machine?!

165
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,041
[KOMACHI] Yeah. And it's
really good for a 13-year old!

166
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,958
Really...?
He's only 13?

167
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,500
[KIKUCHIYO] Shut up.

168
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,375
[BOY 2] Come on,
Mr. Samurai, play again!

169
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,291
[BOY 1] I get to be
head samurai this time!

170
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,708
[BOY 3] Yeah!
You keep being the Bandit!

171
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,625
[KIKUCHIYO]
Oh... Again?

172
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,583
[CLANK]

173
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,666
Ha, ha, ha! I win!

174
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,458
[BOYS LAUGH]

175
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,625
[KIKUCHIYO] Those parts
cannot be replaced!

176
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,000
Ohhh... 

177
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,000
Kikuchiyo sure is popular
among the kids, isn't he?

178
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,958
And it's been like
that since he got here.

179
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,208
I'm sure he's sick of them.

180
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,958
Hey mom, we're hungry
can we have some rice?!

181
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,750
Where did you boys
leave the samurai?

182
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,541
Take it easy, boys.

183
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,166
Oh, Kambei.

184
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,166
[KAMBEI]
Has the rice cooled yet?

185
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,708
[SHINO]
Yes, help yourself.

186
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,416
Actually, if it's
alright with you

187
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,208
I'd like you to give it
to the men instead.

188
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,166
[SHINO] Sure!

189
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,250
Kirara... Is it ready?

190
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,416
Yes.
It's right here.

191
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,833
Like you asked.

192
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,041
Thanks.

193
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,750
Is your wound still
hurting you at all?

194
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,083
Not so much.

195
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,500
Is that
firefly gruel?

196
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,583
[KAMBEI GRUNTS]

197
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,916
I had a certain
craving for it today.

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,416
Are you sure you want that?

199
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
We have plenty of
riceballs for everyone.

200
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,791
White rice prepares
a man's body...

201
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,208
But only firefly gruel
prepares his soul.

202
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,208
Kirara... Shichiroji, too.

203
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:36,875
[KIRARA]
Here you go.

204
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,791
All right... If you insist.

205
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,791
The people of Kanna village

206
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,583
are like this firefly
gruel, Shichiroji.

207
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,958
A simpler food often
ignored or thrown aside

208
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,708
for the heartier grain.

209
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,625
And we samurai are the cup...

210
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,375
A symbol of our
duty to protect

211
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,958
those less fortunate than
ourselves. Understand?

212
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,958
[SHICHIROJI] I understand
you're as kind as ever.

213
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,291
Perhaps that's why
I keep losing battles.

214
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,250
[SHICHIROJI]
What do you think?

215
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,208
It's great!

216
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,875
White rice
is my favorite ever!

217
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,583
Is that so...? Then you'd
better eat some more.

218
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,708
You want to grow up big
and strong, don't you?

219
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,416
Yeah! I wanna grow
up big and strong

220
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,166
so I can be a samurai like you!

221
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:16,833
Me too!

222
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,166
Me three!

223
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,250
And why do you want
to become a samurai?

224
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,250
Because you samurai
are really strong.

225
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,250
And you can totally kill
all the bandits, easy!

226
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,541
[KAMBEI] You really think
you want to be like me?

227
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,875
Uhh...

228
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,500
Good job, guys!

229
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,791
I don't know how you
guys stay so serious

230
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,500
with these great
riceballs to eat.

231
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,875
Mm! Oh, man...!

232
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,625
I've said it before
and I'll say it again:

233
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,708
Kanna grows the
best rice around!

234
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,125
What's the matter?
Aren't you hungry?

235
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,625
Great Samurai
Katsushiro says

236
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,875
the Bandits may
come at any time.

237
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,291
We can't afford to relax--

238
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,125
We must always be prepared
to defend our village.

239
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,250
If a guard is truly
performing his duty

240
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,708
he has no time for food.

241
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,375
But if you stand here
looking fierce all day,

242
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,041
you won't have any strength left
to fight when they get here,

243
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,750
and how will
that help anyone?

244
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,000
Dig in!

245
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,541
I will not let
Katsushiro down.

246
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,833
Oh, well... You're too
tough for me to crack.

247
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,041
[KATSUSHIRO] Listen up.
This village is a fortress

248
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,500
and it must be guarded.

249
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,250
Do not forget: you are now
soldiers of Kanna Fortress.

250
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,791
And as soldiers,
you must always--

251
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:19,375
[HEIHACHI] You know you're just
making them nervous, right?

252
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,458
Heihachi-dono...
How can you act so casual?

253
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,375
Sensei told us the
war's not yet over.

254
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,708
Are you guys scared?

255
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,375
Mm-Hmm...

256
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,458
Fine...! But I'm not scared.

257
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:36,583
No? Then you must not be
seeing things very clearly.

258
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,500
Katsushiro...
When you have taken a life...

259
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,208
you've never looked your
opponent in the eye, have you?

260
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,583
What's that got to
do with anything?

261
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,250
[HEIHACHI] You know, before
we fought the Bandits,

262
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,125
I had never taken
a life either.

263
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,375
It's no secret that you and I
have less battle experience

264
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,625
than the other samurai.

265
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,208
That's a bond we share...

266
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,666
And like you,
when this war began,

267
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,041
I was seeing things
through different eyes.

268
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,833
I couldn't see
the enemy clearly.

269
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,791
But something in my memory
poked to the surface...

270
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,583
You know where it came from?

271
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,166
The battlefield...

272
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,166
Long ago, I was in a
place just like this...

273
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,000
And when I realized that,
I felt at ease...

274
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,833
It was like...
I was home again... You know?

275
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,416
Now you can see... your enemy?

276
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,958
[HEIHACHI] Yes...
And I have no more doubts.

277
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,000
That's where you and I differ:

278
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,333
You're growing more passionate,

279
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,375
and I'm just growing
more cynical.

280
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,750
[KATSUSHIRO]
But Heihachi-dono...

281
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,708
You'd never end up as bitter
as Honoka or Manzo...

282
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,166
[HEIHACHI]
Betrayal leaves a wound

283
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,291
far worse than any
sword, Katsushiro.

284
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,625
Regardless of the reason,
it can never be justified.

285
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,000
The pain of betrayal
remains in the traitors heart...

286
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,708
And it never goes away.

287
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,958
[KATSUSHIRO] Sensei!

288
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,291
[HEIHACHI]
When did you get here?

289
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,708
[SHICHIROJI] Oh, around
"Like I was home again."

290
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,666
[HEIHACHI]
Man, you guys are everywhere!

291
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,708
Is that--?

292
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,791
[SHICHIROJI] Firefly gruel.

293
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,916
Uhh...

294
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,125
Don't worry.
It's not for you.

295
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,083
A samurai toast before battle.

296
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,416
A samurai toast?

297
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,750
[CLACKING]

298
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,416
What is it,
Great Samurai?

299
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,708
Be quiet.

300
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:17,666
He's alone.

301
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,250
Yes... But...

302
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,708
Kyuzo-dono!

303
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,166
[HEIHACHI GRUNTS]

304
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,666
Think we can use it?

305
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,708
[HEIHACHI]
I'll check it out.

306
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,916
Good work, Kyuzo.

307
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,458
I took out a Raiden...
Thirty remain.

308
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:43,083
Mostly Yakan and
Tobito... A few Yoroi.

309
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,291
When will
they be here?

310
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,375
By tomorrow.

311
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,166
I need sleep.

312
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,833
Katsushiro.

313
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,666
[KATSUSHIRO]
Yes, sensei?

314
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,125
Tomorrow we win or
lose this battle...

315
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,083
I want you to make sure
the guards get some sleep

316
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,083
by changing shifts
once every hour.

317
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,166
Do you understand?

318
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,416
