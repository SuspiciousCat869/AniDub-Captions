someone worth looking for.

160
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,083
[HEIHACHI]
Ah, a motorized pulley.

161
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,833
Start the crank, and it
does the lifting for you!

162
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,750
I see how this would
come in handy.

163
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,541
Looks like it's seen
some action, too.

164
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,833
Yep... It's a relic
from the Great War...

165
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,083
Want to take it home...?
I'll sell it to you cheap.

166
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,833
I'd love to, but I'm
a bit short on cash...

167
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,000
Huh...?

168
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,958
[KIKUCHIYO]
Absolutely shameless, Masamune.

169
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,625
Making a samurai chop
wood for a piece of junk

170
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,166
you were gonna
melt down anyway...

171
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,208
Don't blame me!

172
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,666
He's the one
who suggested it.

173
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,666
[KIKUCHIYO] Well, he's
obviously crazy. Heh, ha, ha!

174
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,625
Even crazier than you are, Kiku?

175
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,250
[KIKUCHIYO]
Yeah, I'm crazy...

176
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,750
...crazy enough to
eat little girls!

177
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,958
[KOMACHI LAUGHS]

178
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,000
Hmm...

179
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,041
Heh...

180
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,500
[HEIHACHI] Hey.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,791
Ahh...

182
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,458
I know--chopping wood
with my sword...

183
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,083
...hardly lives up to
the whole samurai tradition.

184
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,416
Nonsense...

185
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,791
Looks like a lot more fun
than chopping up people.

186
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,000
[GOROBEI LAUGHS]

187
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,458
How about it...?

188
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,791
I mean what's your
opinion on it?

189
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,250
Bark or flesh,
which do you prefer?

190
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,416
[HEIHACHI]
Well, to be honest...

191
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,916
I can't say.

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,916
I've never killed
a single person before.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,375
Oh...?
That surprises me.

194
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,625
How did a swordsman
of your talent

195
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,083
avoid fighting
in the Great War?

196
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,208
[HEIHACHI]
No, I was there.

197
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,000
Just not on
the front lines.

198
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,250
Kind of have a knack
for details, see,

199
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,250
and somehow that always
got me working with engineers.

200
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,500
Call it luck or
call it cowardice,

201
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,416
but at the end of it all,
I crawled out of a ship,

202
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,666
covered in soot
and still breathing.

203
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,916
I call it triumph...

204
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,208
If you die, you lose,
if you survive, you win.

205
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,208
It's simple as that.

206
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,000
You really think so?

207
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,958
That's my belief,
for whatever it's worth.

208
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,208
[HEIHACHI]
Much obliged.

209
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,250
[GOROBEI]
Oh, by the way,

210
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,208
I don't suppose
you'd be interested

211
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:53,000
in killing about
forty Nobuseri?

212
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:56,083
[KIRARA] He's a samurai who
chops wood with his sword...

213
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,083
You'd think people
would remember him.

214
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,625
[KATSUSHIRO] We'll search
for him again tomorrow,

215
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,208
and the day after
that if we must.

216
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,500
[RIKICHI] Yeah.

217
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,958
It's about time you guys got
back here... Hurry inside...

218
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,625
You'll want to meet
our latest recruit:

219
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,875
a most peculiar
wood-cutting samurai.

220
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,208
A-A wood cutter?

221
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,833
You think?

222
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,791
[GOROBEI]
Say hello to Heihachi-dono.

223
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,333
[KATSUSHIRO] I know this
is a strange question,

224
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,916
but did you by any chance
cut some wood for a tea shop?

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,458
[HEIHACHI]
Yeah, that was me.

226
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,666
I can't believe we
finally found you!

227
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,916
We've been looking
for you all night!

228
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,833
Uh, really...

229
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:32,958
Huh...?

230
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,416
The river of fate cuts
a strange and winding path.

231
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,208
[HEIHACHI] So, you're real
farmers from Kanna Village, huh?

232
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,208
[RIKICHI] We are.

233
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,208
[HEIHACHI]
That's great!

234
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,041
Kanna rice is among the best!

235
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,708
A touch of sweetness with the
perfect degree of stickiness.

236
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,416
Says a lot about your village.

237
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,541
Rice is a gift born of a
farmer's eighty-eight hardships.

238
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,708
[RIKICHI] Huh...?

239
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,875
What, never heard
that proverb before...?

240
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,166
Just check out
the classic Kanji...

241
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,000
Here're the
strokes for eighty...

242
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,250
And eight, right?

243
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,291
Together, they make
the kanji for rice.

244
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,000
Hey, you're right!

245
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,416
You certainly do have
a passion for rice, don't you?

246
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,708
Indeed I do...!
And speaking of old traditions,

247
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,083
have you folks heard
the one that says that

248
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,166
rice contains seven kami?

249
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,041
Kami...?
Like deities?

250
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,416
That's right--seven deities

251
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,750
who live inside good
rice grains and protect it...

252
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,041
How can I not love the stuff?

253
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,000
It's a gift blessed
from the heavens!

254
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,208
Uhh...

255
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,583
In that case...

256
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll pray for all seven kami
to come down and protect

257
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,583
the rice of Kanna Village.

258
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,208
We only need five more.

259
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,541
Oh... so we're deities now?

260
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,416
Yes, to me you are.

261
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,375

Careful, my lady,

262
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,708
you're going to
make me blush.

263

Great Heihachi...

264
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,875
I'd like you to be
our guardian as well,

265
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,625
if Great Kambei permits it.

266

It would be a high
honor... to have your help.

[HEIHACHI]
Why not?

268
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,208

guys, don't mention it!

samurai, he should prove it,

certainly does say, "Kikuchiyo."

Of course!

I wouldn't point
to it if it didn't!

Well, that's curious.

And you are the
Kikuchiyo mentioned here...

00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,458
[KIKUCHIYO] Maybe later. I got
business with the rice man now.

315
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,875
Who, with me?

316
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,583
[KIKUCHIYO]
I challenge you!

317
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,291
A duel to the death!

318
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,291
[KOMACHI]  Uh-oh...

319
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,541
Sorry to let
you down, pal,

320
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,000
but I'm really no good at
all that violence stuff.

321
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,250
We must have met
for some other reason.

322
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,125
[KIKUCHIYO] Don't give me that
peaceful, chickening-out crap! 

323
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,666
I knew you were a lousy
samurai hoax from the start!

324
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,208
Now draw your sword!

325
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,541
You've got to stop
with the melodrama.

326
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,208
We're both
samurai, right?

327
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,583
Let's value our time
and live for the sunrise.

328
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,125
[KIKUCHIYO]
Y'said we're both samurai?!

329
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,291
Well of course...!

330
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,500
A body of iron takes 
a spirit of steel!

331
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:46,125
Swords are made of steel and
a samurai's spirit is his sword!

332
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,458
It's circular!

333
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,166
[KIKUCHIYO] I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

334
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,083
But, you definitely
called me samurai, right?

335
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,416
Uh-huh.

336
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,708
[KIKUCHIYO]
You know, I have a feeling

337
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,708
we're going to get
along just fine!

338
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:57,958
I could tell you were

339
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,916
a top-notch samurai
from the start!

[KIKUCHIYO LAUGHS]

the death and they... Umm...

Fight?! Don't be silly, sprout!

343
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,416
We're the best of pals!
Ha, ha, ha...

344
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,333
Well that's curious...

345
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,708
Yes, it is. Kikuchiyo...

346
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,250
Why don't you come help
us look for samurai today?

347
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,583
[KIKUCHIYO] Me?

348
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,958
See there?
Life's good!

349
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,375
[KIKUCHIYO]
That's right!

350
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,250
He's finally acknowledged
my usefulness to the team!

351
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,708
[KAMBEI] At this point,
I'd take help from a cat.

352
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,208
[KIKUCHIYO] Oh...

353

[KIKUCHIYO] Huh...?

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,541
A-ha! Well there's
an obvious one.

355
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,083
I'll test him,
see if he's any good.

356
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,208
Hey! You there!
Got a minute to spare?

357
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,458
Shouldn't you say something?

358
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,416
Why?
He wouldn't listen.

359
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500

[HYOGO] You've gathered a real
team of baboons, samurai...

363
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,250
So what does
that make you...?

Katsushiro, don't.

I'll back down...
But only to protect you.

Noble words...
But the task of defense...

370

daunting than attack.

sure wasn't what
I was expecting!

He doesn't look like
a samurai at all!

He chops wood, and says
funny things that confuse me,

and he's always
smiling real big!

and says he's no good at stuff.
