No... After all, it was rice
like this that hired me...

I must say,

This samurai did try to
kill the former Emperor...

But his intention was
only to free the women

My friends,
I understand his actions...

163
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,250
That is why they fear us...

164
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,291
Therefore we shall
bring it to them...

165
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,041
We shall make peace with
the farmers on their turf,

166
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,083
and they'll have no reason
to be afraid anymore.

167
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:58,166
And the final stop on
our list... Kanna Village.

168
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,791
Yes, milord.

169
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,333
If Kanna Village hadn't
hired those samurai,

170
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,791
we wouldn't be so close to
a glorious revolution right now.

171
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,041
The time has come
to repay the favor.

172
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,791
As you wish.

173
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:14,125
However... There's a slim
chance we may have a tragic...

174
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,250
...accident.

175
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,625
Huh...?

176
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,458
Any peasant who
has experienced war

177
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,125
will never be able to
return to peace...

178
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,541
I lived among them for so long
I understand how they think...

179
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,375
Now that they've enjoyed the
feel of political revolution

180
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,416
they will continue to crave it.

181
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,333
And that makes them
a danger to the Capital.

182
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,083
My Lord, take advantage
of this opportunity,

183
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,625
and flee the Capital with them.

184
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,291
You once ruled the
great city of Kougakyo.

185
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,833
You should not be forced to
waste away your remaining days

186
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,500
as a mere warehouse manager.

187
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,708
Then come with me... Tessai...

188
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,166
No, my lord, I'm afraid
that's not possible.

189
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,708
But... why not?

190
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,333
You were my most
trusted attendant.

191
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,666
And now I serve the Emperor.

192
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,333
[AYAMARO] Tessai...

[KIKUCHIYO]
Ladies! Please!

194
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,541
[TESSAI]
I'll tell the young master...

195
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:43,208
The peasants from Kanna took
you with them as their hostage.

196
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,750
He'll come after me.

197
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,833
No... It pains me to say it,

198
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,875
but you're no longer
of value to him.

199
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,833
But I... I'm his...

[KOMACHI]
I'm so glad you're not dead!

205
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,166
I watched everything from here.

206
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,291
I saw Kambei do his
amazing escape trick

207
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,083
and I heard the new
Emperor tell that ugly man

208
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,291
to set all the women free...

209
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,833
And I guess we were
wrong about Ukyo--

210

I mean the new Emperor--
cause he's really great, huh?-

Don't you think so, sis, huh?

Uh... Uh-huh.

213

Do you really
believe that garbage?

214
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,583
Huh...? What garbage?

215
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,625
Those promises from
our "new Emperor"...

216
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,625
I don't care what Ukyo said,
I still don't trust him.

217
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,875
I can't bring myself to
believe it's all over.

218
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,875
[KIKUCHIYO] Enough with the

What's our next move gonna be?

We've got a pretty big crowd.

We'll go to Firefly House...

249

We can stay there for the night,

No. We'll meet her on the way.

Oh, yes... I borrowed this.

this does make you a thief.

00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,583
[KIRARA] You just don't
get it, Katsushiro.

322
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,541
You don't understand
how we women suffered

323
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,416
while the Bandits bled us
for rice all those years.

324
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,750
We were beasts of burden,
giving them our lives,

325
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,958
just to avoid
giving them our bodies.

326
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,708
Sanae sacrificed herself
willingly so the rest of us

327
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,708
would be allowed to stay in the
village with our families...

328
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,875
She gave her life for us...

329
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:14,333
And I didn't... I didn't do
anything to stop her...

330
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,208
If I had any kind
of courage at all...

331
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,416
Then she and Rikichi would
never have been apart.

332
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,916
That's enough...
It's all in the past.

333
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,125
[KIKUCHIYO] Well,
listen to you, Great Samurai!

334
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,041
Some female tricks you
into puttin' your head

335
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,583
on a chopping block and
you go all mushy on us!

336
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,166
She really did a number
on you, didn't she? Heh heh.

337
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,916
Why don't you put a lid
on that can of yours, Kiku?

338
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,583
That woman needs some time
to put her life back together,

339
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,833
and in the meantime
she needs our support...

340
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,375
Rikichi is the one
who can help her now

341
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,125
and your cracks aren't needed.

342
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,458
[KIKUCHIYO]
Why don't I crack your face?

343
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,041
That might be needed!

344
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,750
Then who's gonna repair you?

345
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,500
[KIKUCHIYO]
Hah!

346
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,875
Anyhow, you rescued
the women like you said,

347
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,541
and I guess that's
all that matters...

348
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,291
You completed your mission...

349
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,166
Isn't that right, Kambei?

350
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,291
You fools!

351
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:18,541

352
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:23,666
[KOMACHI] Dear Okara...

353
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,500
I couldn't wait to tell you
what happened today!

354
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,333
Remember how last time
I was so worried,

355
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:29,708
because Kambei was going
to get his head chopped off?

356
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,000
Well you should have seen it!

357
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:33,583
Right as the big mean
guy was swinging his ax,

358
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,958
Kambei did the most amazing
samurai escape ever!

359
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,666
He got away and
had his chains cut

360
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,333
and got the guy's weapon
all at the same time!

361
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,208
And then Katsushiro came out,
ready to save the day,

362
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,958
and Masamune was like,
"Boy, he's got bad timing!"

363
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,500
Heh! It was pretty funny.

364
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:51,333
I guess Katsu didn't need to
worry about Kambei after all.

365
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,625
Now the two of them seem
pretty mad at each other,

366
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,333
and I'm not sure why.

367
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:59,000
Oh yeah, even bigger news!
We saved Sanae!

368
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,250
Turns out she was
the old Emperor's Okata--

369
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,333
which means special
person, or something,

370
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:06,041
and she was going to
have the Emperor's baby!

371
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,708
She's really different now.

372
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:09,208
She says she doesn't
want to go back home,

373
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:10,875
or be with Rikichi at all.

374
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,750
Oh, you better not
tell him about all this.

375
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,875
I'm scared it's going
to make him really sad.

376
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:18,166
Well, I'll write again
soon, okay? Bye-bye!
