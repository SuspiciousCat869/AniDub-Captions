I threw this together for you...

It should launch anything
you can fit in it... My treat.

Thank you.

Thank you, Emperor...

You see, we were ambushed
by peasants and ronin.

That's how I wound up like this.

214

But the odd thing is,

215
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,250
the peasants told us the
samurai weren't ronin at all--

216
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,708
that they were
defending the village

[RAIDEN] Your Excellency,
with all due respect...

You sent us into those villages
to collect rice for you.

Are those miserable dogs lying,

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,958
or did you actually pit
us against each other?

Sure--after taking over the
world you need loyal subjects...

239
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,333
Farmers and samurai are
proving their allegiance

240
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,875
by killing Nobuseri.

241
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,416
And you Nobuseri are proving
your allegiance by being killed.

And really, is there no greater
honor for any proud warrior

the service of his master?

of that memento.

Well, should be easy without
you around... Kambei the thief!

all thanks to you!"

won so much as a coin toss

before he met up with us!

Yeah but he still had
the stink of battle!

What do you mean by that?

300

darn scary to me!

Nothing.

[KIKUCHIYO] Hey, uh...
Why are they staring at us?

305
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,375
Oh... I completely forgot!

306
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,500
[KIKUCHIYO]
Forgot what, sprout?

307
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,500
We left their scary
suits at the Capital--

308
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,375
and we didn't untie
their friends either!

309

Oh...

00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,250
We're so sorry!

311
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,833
[MESSENGER] We've received a
report from our recon team.

312

Go on, I don't have all day.

313
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,916
They've lost visual on
Kambei Shimada's position.

He and his group were last seen

Former samurai.

Rather than becoming
Bandits or ronin,

they chose to lay
down their swords.

Right... I should've guessed...

372

No wonder they have so
many of these old ships

from the war lying around.

And they're surprisingly
easy to bargain with...

I guess all their dealings
with the merchants
