00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,000
It's time to go.

160
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,125
Sanae...

161
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,666
Okata, sorry!

162
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,250
Okata?

163
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,583
The sun is strong today
and your skin is so fair.

164
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,291
Perhaps it would please
you to go indoors now?

165
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,708
Oh... yes.

166
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,958
[MIZUKI] Finally... 
we can breathe!

167
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,875
All this polite-speak gets
my tongue all twisted up!

168
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,125
I feel the same way--

169
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,500
and having to call Sanae
"Okata" all the time.

170
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,583
But those formalities are
the way His Excellency likes it.

171
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,333
You needn't get so
worked up over it--

172
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:28,083
the Amanushi is far more lenient
than any of you seem to realize.

173
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:31,000
He's really got you brainwashed
there hasn't he, Sanae?

174
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,375
Quite the opposite.

175
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,583
I've come to learn I simply
misjudged him at first.

176
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,416
How can you defend that brute?!

177
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,166
You've been fooled by
his cold exterior Mizuki.

178
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,708
He's actually a very
kind and gentle man.

179
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,625
He's a kidnapper, is what he is!

180
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,083
Keep it down Mizuki!

181
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, if they ever hear
you talking like this

182
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,000
there's no telling
what they'd do to us!

Okata, Lord Amanushi
requests your presence.

185
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,375
I'm sorry, My Lady's body
is in a highly fragile state

186
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,000
at the moment and
she must abstain--

187
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,833
I mean refrain from
any strenuous activity.

188
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,750
Thank you Mizuki...

189

we come before you

with information about the Envoy
who was murdered in Kougakyo.

196
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,750
This Samurai has
confessed to the crime.

197
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,083
And so, in accordance
with the Capital's decree

198
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,375
and as an act of good faith on
the part of the Shikimoribito,

199
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,541
we're turning him over to you.

200
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,291
We trust you will punish
him as you see fit...

201
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,000
and we hope you will
remember our fealty.

You asked to see me, My Lord?

I have called you here

because I wish for your
insight on this matter.

The Samurai before us claims to
have murdered an Imperial Envoy.

You may address me directly.
What is your name?

I am Shimada Kambei.

Ha, ha, ha, ha...

You are a fool...

I do not believe
you are capable

228

of killing a

Kambei Shimada...

Can you tell us the
true killer's identity?

00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,125
Or is this some
ill-conceived joke?

You do not answer...?

will loosen your tongue...

00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,708
Last time we were on the road,
Katsushiro got injured

316
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,708
and you let the
Nobuseri kidnap you--

317
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,833
not the best of records.

318
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,583
[KIKUCHIYO]
Bah! Excuses, excuses...!

319
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,375
Just 'cause you're older than
us, doesn't mean we're children!

320
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,416
C'mon, Katsu.
Help me out here.

321
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,958
Hello?

322
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,750
My place is with Sensei,
fighting at his side!

323
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,000
Because you think rebuilding
a village is somehow

324
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,750
beneath you as a Samurai?

325
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,041
No, that's not what
I meant at all...

326
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,708
Have you taken a
moment to think about

327
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:45,166
why Kambei-sama might have
left you behind this time?

328
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,375
Let's just leave it
at that for now...

329
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,041
Here, take some
rice for your trip.

330
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,875
Kanna grows the best
in the world, you know.

331
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,541
Thank you, Heihachi.

332
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,500
[KIKUCHIYO]
All right, Katsu, let's move.

333
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,166
That sword's not gonna
do you much good, is it?

334
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,541
[KIKUCHIYO] I'll get
Masamune to fix it up for me.

335
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,416
Masamune seems
pretty well-traveled.

336
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
I'd be willing to
bet he can tell us

337
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,458
where we can find the Capital.

338
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,625
[KIKUCHIYO]
Huh? Rikichi?

339
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,208
[RIKICHI] Please...
I want to go with you.

340
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,333
[KATSUSHIRO] I'm afraid you're
in no condition to go to war.

341
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,625
But I swear to you,
we will bring your wife back.

342
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,375
[KIRARA]
Please, wait!

343
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,500
[KOMACHI] Kiku!

[KIRARA AND KOMACHI
BREATHE HEAVILY]

346
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,875
Please you've got
to take us with you!

347
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,250
Yeah, you gotta!

348
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,583
[KIKUCHIYO] You know
we're not going off to play.

349
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,000
We understand
the risk involved

350
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,833
and we're prepared
for whatever comes.

351
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,250
Please, we can help!

352
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,791
[KIKUCHIYO] Help us how?
This is war we're talkin' about.

353
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,625
But if you go without me, I'll
be worried sick about you...

354
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,416
An' you don't want that!

355
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,708
[KIKUCHIYO]
Heh. Of course not.

[KOMACHI LAUGHS]

I can't expose you
to any more danger.

358
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,375
[KIKUCHIYO] But you know...
Kirara is pretty good

at finding things with
that crystal of hers.

360

[KATSUSHIRO]
Don't leave my side.

361
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,708
I won't.

362
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,666
And don't you
leave mine, sidekick!

363
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,083
[KIKUCHIYO]
I couldn't if I tried. Heh...

364
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,416
[ELDER]
A thing such as this

365
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,791
would have never been
allowed in older times.

366
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,875
Perhaps our Kirara
is simply not meant

367
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,041
to be a Water
Priestess any longer.

368
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,083
Only she and the
waters can decide that.

369
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,791
[MIZUKI] Hello.
I've brought dinner for you...

370
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,166
...and for the prisoner as well.

371
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,833
Let me guess, Great Samurai.

372
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,791
You're wondering what
happened to Sanae...

373
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,625
How she could show such
affection for the man

374
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,791
who plucked her
from her home--

375
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,666
but it's more
complicated than that.

376
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,125
Did the Emperor speak the truth
about Sanae? Is she with child?

377
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:58,708
[MIZUKI] Yes...

378
00:21:58,791 --> 00:21:59,916
I see.

379
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,458
[MIZUKI]
But it's not what you think.

380
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,333
She only did it for our sake.

381
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,916
She told us that as long as
the Emperor favored her,

382
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,750
he would leave the
other girls alone...

383
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,166
It was just for show,

384
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,541
but now I think she's starting
to believe her own act.

385
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,416
Please, you have
to do something...

386

In case you hadn't noticed
I'm about to be executed.

387

I'd like nothing more
than to help her,

388
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,583
but I'm in no
position to do so.

Yeah... You've got
something planned.

391
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,750
That's why you went through
so much trouble to get caught--

392
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,958
Because you have a plan
to rescue all of us...

By any chance, do you
know if one of them

00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:38,416
has an older sister
named Honoka?

He's a terrorist who incited
panic throughout my city.

While they're still attached
to his body, that is...

410
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,166
Perhaps the time
has finally come

00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,791
I've been practicing
with the Dowsing Crystal,

but it's a lot harder
than it looks.

learn how to use it,

be Priestess anymore

on a certain Samurai.

confused about stuff.
