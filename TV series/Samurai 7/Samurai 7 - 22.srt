00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,500
But in reality, he will crush
all who stand against him.

160
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,250
Whatever he told you is a lie.

161
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,208
[KIKUCHIYO] Kambei and
I know all about lying!

162
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,250
Sometimes you gotta make
stuff up to win in the end--

163
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,833
It's how you learn to be strong!

164
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,625
You are, without a doubt,
my sworn nemesis,

165
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,708
Tsukumozaka Jurobei Mitsuharu!

166
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,625
If it advances your cause,
then lying is all right...

167
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,083
That was the first lesson
I ever taught Ukyo.

168
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,833
You must be so
proud of your boy--

169
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,875
following in your
footsteps like that...

170
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,958
In public he's a gracious
Emperor who doles out rice...

171
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,833
[KIKUCHIYO] Yeah, 'til he
gets the bandits to stomp

172
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,375
on the people and
take the rice back!

173
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,250
We still have work to do.

174
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,208
So it seems.

175
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,250
You'll have to wait longer.

176
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,333
I apologize.

177
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,875
[UKYO YAWNS]

178
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,666
Please, you humble me...

179
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,958
There's no need for
you to bow like that.

180
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,166
But Divine Emperor,

181
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,083
we are nothing more
than lowly peasants...

182
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,916
We're not worthy to stand here
and look one so magnificent

183
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,166
as you in the eye.

184
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,416
Never mind that...!

185
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,791
Give yourselves some credit--

186
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,875
you're clearly not as
worthless as you say!

187
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,291
I just witnessed a terrifying
Nobuseri burned to a crisp...

188
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,291
That was your doing, was it not?

189
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,708
Yes, milord!

190
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,666
We were just doing 
our duty, Your Excellency--

191
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,750
it was you who wisely sent
us samurai to this village...

192
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,125
Together with these farmers,
we beat back the Bandits,

193
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,291
just as you intended.

194
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,875
Thanks to these honorable
warriors we can breathe easily

195
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,625
and once again focus all our
attention on the rice fields.

196
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,208
We thank you, so very much.

197
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,333
You have all suffered
for too long...

198
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,291
Having lived among you,
I understand your suffering,

199
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,250
the hardships
you've all endured...

200
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,875
But despite your
plaintive cries,

201
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,000
the Capital has done nothing
to help ease your pain.

202
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,541
Instead, they let the
Bandits run rampant.

203
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,250
And for that,
I sincerely apologize.

204
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,041
Please, that isn't necessary.

205
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,125
No, it is we who
should bow our heads

206
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,333
in thanks for all you've done.

207
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,958
Raise up your heads, all of you.

208
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,166
From this day forth...

209
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,541
the Capital and I will
be your protectors.

210
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,416
I know the Bandits
seem insurmountable,

211
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,791
but if we work together...

212
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,041
there's nothing we won't
be able to accomplish--

213
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,541
we can change the world...

214
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,041
I only ask you to
persevere a little longer.

215
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,958
We always will, Emperor--
perseverance is our birthright.

216
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,833
I thank you for that.

217
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,958
[OLD MAN]
This is all the rice

218
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,875
we were able to keep
away from the Bandits.

219
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,416
We would like you to have it.

220
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Please accept this modest gift
as a token of our gratitude.

221
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,625
It sickens us to
think the Bandits

222
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,375
are enjoying the fruits
of our labor...

223
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,166
But if Your Excellency
were to eat our rice,

224
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,166
we peasants would feel
nothing but pride in our hearts.

225
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,791
Thank you all so much!
I don't know what to say!

226
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,541
[FARMER 1]
What a truly great man!

227
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,416
For the first time
since the Great War...

228
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,666
we finally have an Emperor
who will govern the land justly.

229
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,375
I'm not so sure...

230
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,375
It doesn't matter
who the Emperor is,

231
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,666
or what promises are made--

232
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,708
the lives of us
farmers won't change.

233
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,000
Why not?

234
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,750
[OLD MAN] Weeds are
made to be trampled on,

235
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,625
and they always grow back...

236
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,250
It's the same with us...

237
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,208
Regardless of how the
world changes around us,

238
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,250
our lot remains the same.

239
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,666
Now everyone will just
give us all of their rice,

240
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,666
without us having
to use force...

241
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,291
It really is brilliant.

242
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,708
But if the peasants find out

243
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,083
the Nobuseri are being
sent by the Capital...

244
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,666
I wasn't aware of it myself

245
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,875
until "old Dad" plucked me
from the fields...

246
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,500
No simple farmer's ever
going to figure it out...

247
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,666
I wonder, when my predecessor
cast me out into the farmlands,

248
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,916
was it just because he
enjoyed watching me suffer?

249
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,708
I believe, my lord, that he
watched over all of his clones

250
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,083
as they "learned
the ways of the world."

251
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,125
That's one way of putting it.

252
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,125
[MESSENGER]
Pardon me, Amanushi.

253
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,500
May I interrupt?

254
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,250
Yes, yes, go ahead.

255
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,291
[MESSENGER] We've received word
the assassination attempts

256
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,541
on Kambei Shimada and
your father have both failed.

257
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,625
Why must those two
be so difficult?

258
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,750
Understood. Keep after them.

259
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,625
[MESSENGER]
Yes, Milord.

260
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,458
[KIRARA]
Great Kambei?

261
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,208
How is Sanae adjusting?

262
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,583
Mizuki and the others
are helping her get ready.

263
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,875
Good to hear.

264
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,375
You really think
she'll be all right?

265
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,083
Back in Kanna Village,
after all this?

266
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,250
[KOMACHI]
One, two, three, four...

267
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,791
[KIKUCHIYO]
Here we go, stretch it out!

268
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,791
One more time, other side!

269
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,833
[KIKUCHIYO]
All right, sprout, all right...

270
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,416
[KOMACHI]
One, two, three, four...

271
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,416
Are we done now?

272
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,333
Kiku! Look over there!

273
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,291
It's a Yakan!

274
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,500
[KIKUCHIYO] Oh...

275
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,583
[KIKUCHIYO YELLS]

276
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,750
Good morning, everyone!

277
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,291
[KIKUCHIYO]
Momotaro! Hey!

278
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,500
What is this?

279
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,958
Rikichi!

280
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,458
I know-- kind of sloppy.

281
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,416
Hey.

282
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,583
Look what the tide dragged in.

283
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,583
Missed you, too.

284
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,416
So, "Momotaro"...
Where's your pile of treasure?

285
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,833
Ah, for cryin' out loud!
I knew I forgot something!

286
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,625
To make it up to you...

287
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,291
I'll take out the trash.

288
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,208
[KIKUCHIYO]
Rikichi... how's your wound?

289
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,166
I'm feeling much
better now, thanks...

290
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,833
And Kikuchiyo...

291
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,250
Look.

292
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,250
This is Gorobei's old sword.

293
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,541
With his fighting spirit at
my side, I know I can help.

294
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,750
Sanae!

295
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,291
[SANAE]
Don't open the door!

296
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:36,333
Sanae, it's me, Rikichi!
Your husband! Sanae!

297
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,125
[SANAE]
I'm sorry... Rikichi...

298
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,791
But I can't... I can't go
back to being your wife.

299
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,791
[RIKICHI] I know about what
happened, and I don't care!

300
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,625
You're alive and
we're together again!

301
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,291
That's all that matters to me!

302
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,666
Now please, let's go home.

303
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,333
[SANAE]
I can't.

304
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,500
Come home.

305
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,000
[SANAE]
My Amanushi needed me

306
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,041
and I couldn't even
ease his suffering...

307
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,125
And then I let him down again...

308
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,166
I killed our child!

309
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,208
Do you remember this?

310
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,708
Please, for me...
wear it again.

311
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,500
I can't-- I belong
to the Amanushi.

312
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,041
I won't accept that.
You are my wife.

313
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,250
And no matter what you say,
I am taking you home...

314
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,500
If you want, I'll even
build them a grave.

315
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,750
Right next to our house...
