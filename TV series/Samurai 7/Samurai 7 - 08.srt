I was about to ask
you the same question.

[KIKUCHIYO] Well, I was
following those giant Bandits.

[KOMACHI] Dear Okara, I met
some amazing people today.

356
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,416
They're called Shikimoribito,
or the Guardians for short.

357
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,000
But I don't know why
they're called that.

358
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,833
I haven't figured out
what they're guarding--

359
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:35,250
besides their rice
and their cave. 

360
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,875
They wear weird masks,

361
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,833
and weird clothes,
and drink weird sap,

362
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:41,583
and hang upside down in
their home called Metal City.

363
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,375
And the big evil merchants
can't even touch them! 

364
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,666
Can you believe that?

365
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,791
But there's one thing
I've learned for sure--

366
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:50,875
There are some crazy
people in this world!

367
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:52,750
We still don't have
seven samurai,

368
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,833
and I don't know where
we're going to find more.

told Katsushiro

370

he was part of the team.

371
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:01,583
I'm so happy for him--
he really wanted it bad.

it was just 'cause
