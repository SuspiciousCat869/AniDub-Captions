How bout this thing?!

160
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,125
You want one of
these big ones, right?

161
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:15,708
[KIKUCHIYO GRUNTS]

162
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,333
[THUD]

163
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,583
[KOMACHI]
What is it?!

164
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,458
[KIKUCHIYO]
A heap of junk, apparently.

165
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,625
He's probably right,
it's no good.

166
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,750
I'm not sure...

167
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,750
Gorobei-dono...

168
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,708
I realize now you
led me back here

169
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,833
because they needed my help.

170
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,625
Ah... The spirits
guided you back.

171
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,125
[KATSUSHIRO]
After I saw a vision of him,

172
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,500
I thought I should come
here one last time...

173
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,375
A final goodbye before
joining the battle...

174
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,333
The Capital's henchmen
were already here--

175
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:10,041
I must've been
guided by Gorobei.

176
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,541
Great Samurai, where's Kirara?

177
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,000
[KATSUSHIRO]
She's with Sensei.

178
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,041
Huh... And all this time
I assumed my granddaughter

179
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,875
went off with those samurai
to be with that young man.

180
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,291
Kirara did what?

181
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,166
You're slow, old woman.

182
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,208
Okara...! You know
something, don't you?

183
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,708
You've got her reasons
for leaving right,

184
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,791
but you've got
the wrong samurai.

185
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,625
Then who...

186
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,375
[KAMBEI]
How's it look?

187
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,833
I think she'll fly for us.

188
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,666
Good... As soon as
the repairs are done,

189
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,125
we'll head
for the Capital.

190
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,291
All right.

191
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,916
Well it might not be
much of a war ship,

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,458
but it certainly is faster
than that old wagon...

193
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,375
It's too bad we don't have time
to find something with defenses.

194
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,333
The Capital isn't
going to wait for us.

195
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,125
[KIKUCHIYO]
So we're finally gonna strike?

[KAMBEI GRUNTS]

197
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,000
How many years has it been
since we've taken on

198
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,500
one of those airships?

199
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,333
I'd say I'm nervous,
but I keep thinking of what

200
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,500
Gorobei-san would
say if he were here.

201
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,750
[KIKUCHIYO]
Yeah! He'd say...

202
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,916
"Nervous? You gotta be kidding!

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,291
Get out there and
die with honor, man!"

Komachi, what's
the matter with you?

206
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,916
I don't want Kiku
to die with honor.

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,166
[KIKUCHIYO]
Oh. Well, listen. I was just--

That's--That's just
tough guy talk.

Who could ever die and
leave you behind, sprout?

210
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,458
Really? Promise?

211
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,458
[KIKUCHIYO]
Here, I tell you what...

212
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,916
I want you to hang
onto this for me.

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,875
It's my proof that I'm samurai.

214
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,083
The scroll
that you stole?

[KIKUCHIYO]
I didn't steal it! I found it.

Anyway, that doesn't matter.

217

You were the first person who
ever accepted me as a samurai--

So I want you to have my
most valuable possession.

Keep it safe for me,
and I'll be back for it.

It's a deal!

something even more important.

[KAMBEI] Are the defenses
the same as during the war?

[KAMBEI] Hmm...

00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,083
What do we do about
the main engines?

249

I say we disconnect 'em.

If the're still running
when it crashes...

all this beautiful farmland
will be destroyed.

[SHICHIROJI] You mean
all this beautiful farmland

00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,500
that's needed to grow

Hey, we are the rice kami.

engines to him.

So what's our move, Kambei-sama?

No.

She's a great girl.

Guess we should give
Ukyo some credit...

At least he has
great taste in women.

270
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:25,291
[SHICHIROJI] It's hard to tell
who the enemy is these days.

271
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,750
During the war it was easy...

272
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,250
You just killed anything
that held a sword.

273
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:34,500
Perhaps the days of fighting
battles with swords are no more.

As soon as the repairs are
completed, we're heading out...

If you see anything unusual,

send out the warning
with the clappers,

290

then wait for my signal
to take action, understood?

Yes, sir.

292
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,458

00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,625

Where's Kiku?

He's gone, Komachi.

298
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,750
But he... can't be...

299
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,958
I didn't get to say
good-bye to him!

300
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,541
Your sister thought it would be
less painful for you this way.

Sister, why didn't you
let me say good-bye to Kiku?

302
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,833
We can't worry about such
petty things now, Komachi,

303
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,416
not when the war
is about to begin.

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,500
I promised them that
I would be strong,

307
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,083
but I feel like I'm breaking.

308
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,083
Take it from someone
who has been broken,

309
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,583
when your heart
opens a new window,

310
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,250
there is no gain in hiding
your eyes from the light.

311
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,916
But if I allow
myself to admit it

312
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,875
then I won't be able to keep
from telling him the truth.

313
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,958
That I want him...
Body and soul.

314
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,000
Then we just have to
pray as hard as we can
