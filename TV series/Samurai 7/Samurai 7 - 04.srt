[KAMBEI]
Kyuzo-dono was it...?

323
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,666
We will fight again once my
team has defeated the Bandits...

324
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,083
You'll have to
wait until then...

325
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,958
Unless... You would kill me
while my back is turned.

[KYUZO] Hmm...

00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,458
Wow... This is scary.

Ah, heh, heh... Finally done!

[KOMACHI]
Hey Okara, Komachi here.

341
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,000
Whew! Things have been
pretty crazy around here.

342
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,583
Just listen to this!

343
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:30,500
First Sister got kidnapped by
that crazy boy with the makeup

344
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,250
who was trying to
butter her up.

345
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,791
Then he sent his goons after her

346
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,083
and Katsushiro and
Kiku fought them off.

347
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,625
Mostly Kiku, though.

348
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,166
Then they came after us again

349
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,208
and Gorobe and Kambei sliced
'em to pieces! Whack! Whack!

350
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,958
We really got to see them in
action, and they are scar-ee!

351
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:50,250
Kiku got a little carried away,
though, and made everyone mad. 

352
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,166
Then, when everything
was calm again, 

353
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,416
this weird samurai
comes out of nowhere

354
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,958
and starts fighting Kambei.

355
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:59,208
He said his name was Kyuzo,
but that's about all he said.

356
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,916
Didn't seem like
much of a talker,

357
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,791
but that just made
him scarier...

358
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,750
I thought no one
could beat Kambei,

359
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:06,666
but this guy was just as good.

360
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,458
And you wanna hear
something strange? 

361
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,541
I think Kambei kinda liked him.

362
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,875
Now why would you like
someone who wants to kill you?

363
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,708
I'm too tired to figure it out.

364
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,125
Good night!
