[AILEEN]
Is this smell demon incense?

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.351 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
He hasn't fully transformed.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:19.554 position:19% line:83% align:start
He can still turn back
into a human.

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:21.421 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:26.126 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Someone's coming! Flee!

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:35.937 position:7% line:89% align:start
Great. You let a demon escape.

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.872 position:30% line:83% align:start
Whatever could
you mean? A demon--

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:39.306 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:45.479 position:16% line:83% align:start
I knew you were a woman.
What's your name?

00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:24.779 position:30% line:83% align:start
So I've caught
the church's intelligence

00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:26.279 position:19% line:89% align:start
network in a bad light!

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:27.815 position:38% line:83% align:start
Who am I?
You have not a clue,

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.384 position:19% line:83% align:start
whereas I know you and
your friend Kyle well!

00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:31.819 position:41% line:83% align:start
[WALT]
Oh, do you?

00:02:31.953 --> 00:02:33.220 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know you're Nameless Priests,

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:35.222 position:27% line:83% align:start
cleansers of the
Mirchetta Church.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.859 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're demon hunters who were
raised in the shadows there,

00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:41.729 position:13% line:83% align:start
and you've been physically
enhanced using demon incense.

00:02:41.863 --> 00:02:43.798 position:13% line:83% align:start
You infiltrated the academy
to hunt the demon

00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:46.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
your church has been so
desperate to take down.

00:02:46.668 --> 00:02:48.569 position:21% line:83% align:start
Perhaps your kind's
penchant for incense

00:02:48.703 --> 00:02:51.338 position:10% line:89% align:start
might explain that odd smell.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:55.076 position:21% line:83% align:start
You get one more try.
Who are you?

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.309 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Not a threat.

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:58.880 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your real identity
is safe with me.

00:02:59.013 --> 00:03:01.816 position:21% line:83% align:start
Perhaps, in exchange
we can leave my real identity

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.251 position:21% line:89% align:start
out of the equation.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:05.953 position:35% line:89% align:start
Fine by me.

00:03:06.087 --> 00:03:07.855 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't gain anything from
telling others you're a girl.

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.257 position:21% line:83% align:start
And who doesn't love
a salacious secret?

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.660 position:24% line:83% align:start
Glad we could reach
an agreement, comrade.

00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:15.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
So. How do you plan on
bringing that one down?

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.865 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Eyewitness testimony
won't be enough.

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
But he'll get his
comeuppance eventually.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.870 position:21% line:83% align:start
He'll make any excuse
he can to save his hide.

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:25.840 position:19% line:83% align:start
I worry we'd be remiss
to not look into him further.

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:29.911 position:19% line:83% align:start
Dig around and see what
you can find, like incense.

00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:31.211 position:24% line:89% align:start
Afraid I must pass.

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:33.380 position:27% line:83% align:start
The small fry may
lead us to a nice catch.

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:35.083 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let's us be going.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.884 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ailey, huh?

00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:39.887 position:19% line:83% align:start
Curious. Might "Ailey"
take a dash of inspiration

00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:41.488 position:19% line:89% align:start
from your actual name?

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:44.025 position:21% line:89% align:start
Odd. I can't recall.

00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:46.160 position:13% line:83% align:start
[WALT] If we're "comrades,"
then don't be so cold!

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:50.230 position:7% line:83% align:start
I thought you and I were close
enough to swap secrets, no?

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.371 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wanted to save my friend
from her fiancÃ©.

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:00.474 position:5% line:89% align:start
He started to grow very abusive.

00:04:00.608 --> 00:04:02.043 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's a noble cause.

00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:05.345 position:7% line:83% align:start
Is this friend also the victim
in the vampire case?

00:04:06.514 --> 00:04:08.816 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well? It's yes or no.

00:04:10.618 --> 00:04:14.589 position:21% line:83% align:start
Rachel. Take us back
to the very beginning, please.

00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:16.023 position:10% line:89% align:start
Her fiancÃ©'s behavior changed

00:04:16.157 --> 00:04:18.693 position:16% line:83% align:start
after he started smoking
this suspicious pipe.

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:21.461 position:10% line:83% align:start
I asked Lady Selena about it,
but she was clueless.

00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:24.297 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] A pipe, huh?
Could be demon incense.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.933 position:27% line:83% align:start
I wasn't certain
what we should do.

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:29.369 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, when Koenig offered
me guidance, I took it.

00:04:29.504 --> 00:04:30.671 position:5% line:89% align:start
He told me he knew of a way that

00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:32.339 position:24% line:83% align:start
we could both annul
our engagements.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.108 position:21% line:89% align:start
It seemed so perfect.

00:04:34.242 --> 00:04:35.375 position:10% line:89% align:start
I see. That explains why you

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.912 position:27% line:83% align:start
told your friend
to meet with him.

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:39.279 position:38% line:83% align:start
[RACHEL]
I trusted him.

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.516 position:24% line:83% align:start
I didn't think that
he would hurt her.

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:44.619 position:13% line:83% align:start
Who would? And he asked to
meet with you after that?

00:04:44.752 --> 00:04:47.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
[RACHEL] Yes. I was so nervous
because he was demanding money.

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.724 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I had to figure out
what happened.

00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:52.693 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sighs] How odd. In my opinion,

00:04:52.827 --> 00:04:56.030 position:16% line:83% align:start
it seems this deviant was
targeting you from the get-go.

00:04:56.164 --> 00:04:57.430 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:57.565 --> 00:04:59.332 position:19% line:83% align:start
He spoke to you first,
didn't he?

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.068 position:24% line:83% align:start
If your friend was
his primary target,

00:05:01.202 --> 00:05:02.537 position:27% line:83% align:start
he would've gone
straight to her.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.438 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah. I suppose that makes sense.

00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:07.241 position:10% line:89% align:start
Regardless, we need to ensure

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:09.644 position:27% line:83% align:start
the professor is
punished accordingly.

00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:11.813 position:24% line:83% align:start
Koenig is known for
being a gambler.

00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:14.982 position:16% line:83% align:start
Rumor has it he's already
accrued many lifetimes of debt.

00:05:15.116 --> 00:05:18.152 position:10% line:83% align:start
Speaking of suspicious pipes,
he's addicted to one.

00:05:18.286 --> 00:05:19.620 position:19% line:89% align:start
The solution is simple.

00:05:19.754 --> 00:05:21.823 position:21% line:83% align:start
We keep the truth of
the case to ourselves

00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:24.225 position:19% line:83% align:start
and obliterate the cur
in the meantime.

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:25.626 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
At moments like this,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.830 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm grateful to be
on Isaac's good side.

00:05:32.867 --> 00:05:34.168 position:33% line:89% align:start
[door opens]

00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:35.970 position:27% line:89% align:start
The deed is done.

00:05:36.103 --> 00:05:38.906 position:24% line:83% align:start
I pick disturbingly
brilliant allies.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.175 position:30% line:83% align:start
Go on, tell us
how you bested him.

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:44.679 position:7% line:83% align:start
I flashed money in his face and
asked him to a game of poker.

00:05:44.812 --> 00:05:47.215 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not only did I obtain
information about Rachel,

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.083 position:33% line:83% align:start
but I robbed
the poor fool blind.

00:05:49.217 --> 00:05:52.286 position:27% line:83% align:start
Really? How odd,
I heard he was a great player.

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.755 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm an even
greater cheater.

00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:59.560 position:10% line:89% align:start
An IOU? That's astronomical!

00:05:59.694 --> 00:06:01.062 position:16% line:89% align:start
As long as we have this,

00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:03.363 position:19% line:83% align:start
that old man is reduced
to putty in our hands.

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:06.267 position:7% line:83% align:start
Did you happen to see his pipe?
Was it demon incense?

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:09.637 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes, but he claims he
picked up the pipe offhandedly.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.572 position:21% line:83% align:start
He knew little about
its contents.

00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:14.775 position:5% line:89% align:start
To think, he teaches us. [gasps]

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:16.310 position:5% line:89% align:start
As this ordeal comes to an end,

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.478 position:16% line:83% align:start
it's crucial we frame it
as an accident.

00:06:18.613 --> 00:06:20.815 position:19% line:83% align:start
That way no one will be
suspicious of the victim.

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:23.985 position:21% line:83% align:start
And we need to annul
Rachel's engagement as well.

00:06:24.118 --> 00:06:27.088 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll have to ponder
the best way to go about it.

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:29.624 position:21% line:83% align:start
Better yet, we could
talk it over with her now.

00:06:29.757 --> 00:06:30.992 position:10% line:89% align:start
If that's all right, Rachel.

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:34.762 position:33% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC gasps]
You can handle this.

00:06:34.896 --> 00:06:37.598 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll go mop up the professor.

00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:41.702 position:5% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Does trusting my friend
make you uneasy?

00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:44.872 position:38% line:83% align:start

Huh? Oh, no, it's not him.

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:46.641 position:13% line:83% align:start

you put your faith in

00:06:46.774 --> 00:06:48.943 position:19% line:89% align:start
turned out to be cruel.

make you write off my sex!

that seem to feed off
hurting you,

I feel as though I should
bring up the annulment myself.

I can't live in fear.
If I do, nothing will change.

Good. I wish you luck.

as the security force's office.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.070 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, please get permission
from the school president.

00:07:49.203 --> 00:07:51.205 position:24% line:83% align:start
[WALT] Is that all?
As you wish, my liege.

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.641 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think the office could benefit
from a good cleaning!

00:07:53.774 --> 00:07:56.177 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll find some
equipment to borrow!

00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:59.080 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, all things considered,
how do you plan to

00:07:59.213 --> 00:08:02.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
report the vampire case
updates to President James?

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:03.985 position:16% line:89% align:start
I plan to tell the truth,

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:06.087 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I will recommend
that we keep things quiet.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.223 position:13% line:83% align:start
We don't want to provoke or
frighten the student body.

00:08:09.357 --> 00:08:10.791 position:27% line:89% align:start
What a surprise.

00:08:10.925 --> 00:08:12.760 position:7% line:83% align:start
You came off as the embodiment
of justice herself!

00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:15.329 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'd be willing to sweep
this infraction under the rug?

00:08:15.463 --> 00:08:18.032 position:10% line:83% align:start
"The small fry might lead us
to a nice catch," yes?

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:20.468 position:19% line:83% align:start
Besides, I'm confident
that the real culprit

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.136 position:5% line:89% align:start
is still out there on the loose.

00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:26.540 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well. I should get going.
Force duties to attend to.

[STUDENT B]
Why would we do that?

00:09:05.746 --> 00:09:07.014 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are we not allowed
to read something

00:09:07.148 --> 00:09:09.283 position:24% line:83% align:start
that's been posted
for the public to see?

00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:10.851 position:19% line:89% align:start
That doesn't seem fair.

Thank you, Kyle.

00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:34.141 position:13% line:83% align:start
You spared me some serious

You're sorely mistaken.

[KYLE] Would a kind person
have done that?

00:09:43.818 --> 00:09:45.352 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh... Yes, actually.

00:09:45.486 --> 00:09:47.988 position:13% line:83% align:start
At this point destroying it
was the right thing to do.

00:09:48.122 --> 00:09:49.223 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:09:49.356 --> 00:09:50.424 position:19% line:83% align:start

into the first stage

of Kyle's romance path.

00:09:52.226 --> 00:09:53.794 position:21% line:83% align:start
The only difference
is that in the game,

00:09:53.928 --> 00:09:56.397 position:16% line:83% align:start
Selena ends up returning
the letter to her friend.

Lord Claude is coming here?!

00:11:13.007 --> 00:11:14.842 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] The school festival
is the most extravagant

00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:16.611 position:13% line:89% align:start
celebration at the Academy.

00:11:16.744 --> 00:11:18.879 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's composed of
two major events.

00:11:19.013 --> 00:11:21.015 position:21% line:83% align:start
The first day is the
swordsmanship tournament.

00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:23.050 position:19% line:83% align:start
In the game, the church
sponsoring the event

00:11:23.184 --> 00:11:26.287 position:16% line:83% align:start
very sneakily hides demon
incense amongst the prizes.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.924 position:19% line:83% align:start
This causes poor James
to go full demon mode.

00:11:30.057 --> 00:11:32.026 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I can stop him
from transforming,

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:34.862 position:13% line:83% align:start

destruction of the Grand Duchy,

00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:38.232 position:19% line:83% align:start
and more importantly,
my unfortunate ending!

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:40.000 position:30% line:83% align:start
The major event
of the second day is

00:11:40.134 --> 00:11:43.170 position:5% line:83% align:start
the contest to become the ball's
"White Lily Princess."

00:11:43.304 --> 00:11:46.173 position:10% line:83% align:start
All in all, it's nothing more
than a glorified beauty pageant.

00:11:46.307 --> 00:11:48.742 position:16% line:83% align:start
And... it looks like the
mad dash to find a partner

00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:50.911 position:7% line:89% align:start

00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:36.950 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Belzebuth is
keeping time correctly?

00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:38.653 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh! They grow up so fast!

00:13:38.787 --> 00:13:41.989 position:10% line:83% align:start
No. We must first familiarize
ourselves with the grounds.

00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:44.793 position:24% line:83% align:start
We must prepare for
Ashtarte's inevitable attack.

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:46.427 position:30% line:83% align:start
But he won't be
able to attack.

00:13:46.561 --> 00:13:50.030 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's not a demon alive that
can lay a hand on you, my lord.

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:54.001 position:10% line:83% align:start
Bee-L. You shouldn't rely on
dogmatic assumptions.

00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:55.704 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let's think through this.

00:13:55.836 --> 00:13:58.105 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] He's taking the time
to give Bel guidance?

00:13:58.238 --> 00:14:00.542 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's a changed man
and I take credit!

00:14:00.675 --> 00:14:03.277 position:24% line:83% align:start
While you're here,
I have a quick question.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.648 position:7% line:83% align:start
Are you familiar with a student
that masquerades as a duck?

00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:07.649 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AILEEN gasps]

00:14:07.782 --> 00:14:08.817 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
A duck?

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.719 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SELENA]
President James!

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:12.953 position:21% line:83% align:start
You haven't had your
lunch break yet, have you?

00:14:13.087 --> 00:14:14.656 position:5% line:89% align:start
Allow me to take over from here.

00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:15.657 position:33% line:89% align:start
Are you sure?

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.257 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes! Oh!

00:14:17.391 --> 00:14:19.159 position:19% line:83% align:start
And if you haven't had
lunch either, Director,

00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:22.062 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can show you to the cafeteria!

00:14:22.764 --> 00:14:24.231 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
What's this crap?

00:14:24.365 --> 00:14:25.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why is the Holy Sword Maiden's
number one fan getting

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:27.401 position:5% line:89% align:start
all touchy with the demon lord?

00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:29.637 position:21% line:89% align:start
That makes no sense!

00:14:30.672 --> 00:14:32.507 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, the two of you
should head back.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.208 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll trust this
young lady to give me

00:14:34.341 --> 00:14:36.143 position:19% line:83% align:start
a more complete picture
of the school.

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:38.747 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? Well. If you wish.

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:40.347 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hold down the fort.

00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:41.549 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now. Miss...?

00:14:41.683 --> 00:14:43.651 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh no, you can just
call me Selena.

00:14:43.785 --> 00:14:46.487 position:19% line:83% align:start
All right. I would like
a full tour, Selena.

00:14:46.621 --> 00:14:51.158 position:24% line:83% align:start
Perfect. Leave it
to me. Lord, uh...

00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:53.894 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is it okay if I
call you Lord Claude?

00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:57.866 position:7% line:83% align:start
Quite, but please refrain from
using that sweet inflection.

00:14:57.998 --> 00:14:59.734 position:30% line:83% align:start
My dear fiancÃ©e
gets jealous easily

00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:01.969 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I know she wouldn't approve.

00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:03.505 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT B]
He's so dreamy!

00:15:03.638 --> 00:15:05.707 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] His face is
such a deadly weapon.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.644 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wish I had a paper bag
to put over his head!

00:15:09.778 --> 00:15:11.646 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JAMES] In response
to Ashtarte's threats,

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.980 position:5% line:89% align:start
the director tells me that we'll

00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:15.282 position:16% line:83% align:start
have a brigade of knights
at the ready.

00:15:15.416 --> 00:15:17.552 position:24% line:83% align:start
As far as choosing
a mediator goes--

00:15:17.685 --> 00:15:19.554 position:13% line:89% align:start
Me! I'd be happy to do it.

00:15:19.687 --> 00:15:20.954 position:27% line:89% align:start
It should be me.

00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:22.956 position:19% line:83% align:start
It'd be more dangerous
for a woman.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.893 position:19% line:83% align:start
Please, my new comrade,
Lord Claude,

00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:26.260 position:5% line:89% align:start
would be honored to protect me.

00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:27.662 position:30% line:83% align:start
I think you've
forgotten something!

00:15:27.796 --> 00:15:29.129 position:13% line:89% align:start
That man's the demon lord,

00:15:29.263 --> 00:15:30.665 position:13% line:83% align:start
the enemy of your precious
Holy Sword Maiden!

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:33.568 position:21% line:83% align:start
Be quiet! He's still
a human, after all!

00:15:33.701 --> 00:15:35.235 position:33% line:89% align:start
I mean, true.

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:37.204 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you knew about
the Holy Sword Maiden,

00:15:37.337 --> 00:15:40.441 position:7% line:83% align:start
then you would know she'd most
certainly try to save him.

00:15:40.575 --> 00:15:41.509 position:30% line:89% align:start
You understand?

00:15:41.643 --> 00:15:44.111 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's why I plan
to take his side.

00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:45.680 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
What a snake.

00:15:45.814 --> 00:15:48.215 position:16% line:83% align:start
It seems quite unwise to
have a woman act as mediator.

00:15:48.348 --> 00:15:49.950 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's a chance it would
upset the young lady

00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:51.985 position:7% line:89% align:start
of the d'Autriche family, yes?

00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:53.688 position:30% line:89% align:start
Absolutely yes!

00:15:53.822 --> 00:15:55.155 position:13% line:83% align:start
You seem to forget that the
director has a proper fiancÃ©e--

00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:57.458 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SELENA]
I would gladly take her on.

00:15:57.592 --> 00:15:59.126 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
That would be foolish.

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:02.095 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's rumored to be
a very aggressive woman.

00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:03.598 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who knows what she's capable of?

00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:05.365 position:30% line:83% align:start
I heard she has
a harsh personality.

00:16:05.499 --> 00:16:07.702 position:30% line:83% align:start
She might even
storm the academy.

00:16:07.836 --> 00:16:10.003 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, the demon lord
didn't bring her along.

00:16:10.137 --> 00:16:12.339 position:21% line:83% align:start
Most likely to avoid
the additional chaos.

00:16:12.473 --> 00:16:15.577 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Poor gentlemen.
You'll live to regret this.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.244 position:27% line:89% align:start
Have you seen it?

00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:19.547 position:10% line:83% align:start
That portrait of hers that's
been making the rounds recently?

00:16:19.681 --> 00:16:20.481 position:30% line:89% align:start
What portrait?

00:16:20.615 --> 00:16:22.550 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
Here. Take a look.

00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:24.017 position:27% line:89% align:start
She seems unique.

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:27.522 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm impressed the demon lord has
such interesting taste in women.

00:16:27.655 --> 00:16:29.557 position:30% line:83% align:start
But interesting
doesn't mean good.

00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:31.291 position:24% line:83% align:start
It only makes sense
a demon would find

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:34.461 position:27% line:83% align:start
the most comfort
with a beastly bride.

00:16:35.763 --> 00:16:37.799 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] I don't know who
disseminated this image,

00:16:37.932 --> 00:16:40.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
but they have a death wish.

00:16:40.234 --> 00:16:41.836 position:13% line:89% align:start
I doubt he had any choice.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.438 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sure the d'Autriche family
forced the engagement on him.

00:16:44.572 --> 00:16:45.740 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hence my plan!

00:16:45.874 --> 00:16:48.308 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm going to ask him to be
my date to the festival!

00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:50.143 position:27% line:83% align:start
Imagine me as the
White Lily Princess!

00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:51.579 position:19% line:89% align:start
Lord Claude at my side!

00:16:51.713 --> 00:16:53.347 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
On that note, I should go.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.315 position:24% line:83% align:start
These grounds won't
patrol themselves.

00:16:55.449 --> 00:16:57.652 position:5% line:89% align:start
I suppose I'll join you tonight.

00:16:57.785 --> 00:16:58.720 position:41% line:83% align:start
[WALT]
I will, too.

00:16:58.853 --> 00:16:59.888 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KYLE]
Might as well.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.089 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
Wait for me, guys!

00:17:07.595 --> 00:17:10.430 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why do you insist on
infringing upon my solitude?

00:17:10.565 --> 00:17:12.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
The conversation devolved,
don't you think?

00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:14.736 position:16% line:89% align:start
I needed to escape that.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:17.337 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well. Now we can decide
who'll be the mediator.

00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:19.273 position:30% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately,
we have no choice.

00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:22.309 position:13% line:83% align:start
The demon lord took it upon
himself to request Selena.

00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:23.545 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
That's a surprise.

00:17:23.678 --> 00:17:25.580 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Lord Claude requested her?

00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:28.348 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's going on?
Is he cheating on me?

00:17:28.482 --> 00:17:29.651 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come to think of it,
have we ever

00:17:29.784 --> 00:17:32.185 position:33% line:83% align:start
walked around
together like this?

00:17:32.887 --> 00:17:34.454 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, I don't think we have.

00:17:34.589 --> 00:17:36.524 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's the fun in
meandering with men?

00:17:36.658 --> 00:17:37.926 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's such a drag.

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:39.661 position:7% line:83% align:start
You would surely operate better
as a student council

00:17:39.794 --> 00:17:42.262 position:19% line:83% align:start
if you took the time to
develop some comradery.

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:44.666 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ailey is always full
of such great ideas!

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:47.569 position:7% line:83% align:start
Starting now we'll be friends,
I say! Right, men?

00:17:47.702 --> 00:17:49.037 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
Absolutely not.

00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:50.672 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's all just focus
and do our jobs.

00:17:50.805 --> 00:17:53.307 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't want any of you lot
bringing me down.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.777 position:35% line:83% align:start
Apologies,
forgot how cold you are.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.712 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] I guess it makes
sense these guys can't

00:17:57.845 --> 00:18:00.480 position:27% line:83% align:start
get along without
some serious effort.

00:18:00.615 --> 00:18:03.216 position:24% line:83% align:start
First, we have the
demon hunters, Walt and Kyle.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.019 position:19% line:83% align:start
And then there's James,
their target.

00:18:05.152 --> 00:18:08.422 position:5% line:83% align:start
And lastly there's Auguste, who
eventually deals the final blow.

00:18:08.556 --> 00:18:10.692 position:24% line:83% align:start
If things progress
like they do in the game,

00:18:10.825 --> 00:18:13.728 position:19% line:83% align:start
these four are destined
to try to kill each other.

00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:17.799 position:13% line:83% align:start
No matter what, they can't
find out James's true identity.

00:18:17.932 --> 00:18:21.101 position:13% line:83% align:start
[gasps] Are you picking up
that sickly sweet smell?

00:18:21.234 --> 00:18:22.704 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KYLE, WALT gasp]

00:18:24.539 --> 00:18:25.840 position:21% line:89% align:start
James! What's wrong?

00:18:25.974 --> 00:18:28.342 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hush. I'm all right,
don't worry about me.

00:18:28.475 --> 00:18:29.611 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
This is bad!

00:18:29.744 --> 00:18:30.979 position:27% line:89% align:start
Quick! Come! Now!

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.413 position:13% line:83% align:start
Please take President James
to the dorms to rest!

00:18:33.548 --> 00:18:36.551 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh, okay. James,
I'm here to help.

00:18:36.684 --> 00:18:39.353 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JAMES] It's fine.
I can make it on my own.

00:18:39.486 --> 00:18:41.221 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE] Don't be dense.
You're as white as a sheet!

00:18:41.355 --> 00:18:42.890 position:24% line:89% align:start
Listen, Ailey. Now.

00:18:43.024 --> 00:18:45.760 position:10% line:83% align:start
I need you to go notify the
professors of what happened.

00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:47.160 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Me? But I--

00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:49.864 position:13% line:83% align:start
[WALT] Oh, there's no need,
Kyle. He's safe.

00:18:49.998 --> 00:18:51.298 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:18:51.431 --> 00:18:52.700 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ailey here is familiar
with our identities,

00:18:52.834 --> 00:18:55.737 position:21% line:83% align:start
so you might as well
think of him as an ally.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:19:01.109 position:38% line:83% align:start
An ally?
That scrawny-looking thing?

00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:03.477 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's not scrawny, he's--[gasps]

00:19:03.611 --> 00:19:05.613 position:13% line:83% align:start
We must locate the incense
as soon as we can.

00:19:05.747 --> 00:19:07.715 position:27% line:83% align:start
We don't want it
attracting demons, do we?

00:19:07.849 --> 00:19:09.449 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh! But--

00:19:15.723 --> 00:19:19.927 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Look here! This has to be it!

00:19:20.061 --> 00:19:22.664 position:7% line:83% align:start
[WALT] It's empty. And there's
not much of a scent remaining.

00:19:22.797 --> 00:19:25.232 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's no chance this
could attract a demon.

00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:27.535 position:19% line:83% align:start
Odd. Why would someone
leave this here?

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:30.638 position:5% line:83% align:start
Might the church be scattering
incense throughout the academy?

00:19:30.772 --> 00:19:32.507 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well. I doubt they would
litter them around

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.008 position:10% line:89% align:start
just to have us pick them up.

00:19:34.142 --> 00:19:35.242 position:21% line:89% align:start
Seems quite useless.

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:36.577 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
I'm not convinced.

00:19:36.711 --> 00:19:38.245 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've heard rumors
that the church is

00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:39.947 position:16% line:83% align:start
taking it upon themselves
to lure out the demon

00:19:40.081 --> 00:19:42.684 position:16% line:83% align:start
in the academy by mixing
incense in with the prizes

00:19:42.817 --> 00:19:45.053 position:21% line:83% align:start
for the swordsmanship
tournament.

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:46.621 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't say that!

00:19:46.754 --> 00:19:48.856 position:13% line:83% align:start
The church wouldn't partake
in such dastardly deeds!

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.191 position:19% line:83% align:start
We both know how those
priests could be convinced.

00:19:51.324 --> 00:19:52.960 position:24% line:83% align:start
With a few fistfuls
of cash, of course.

00:19:53.094 --> 00:19:54.461 position:30% line:89% align:start
Walt, stop it!

00:19:54.595 --> 00:19:55.963 position:35% line:83% align:start
By the way,
our client for this mission

00:19:56.097 --> 00:19:58.032 position:24% line:83% align:start
is none other than
the Mirchetta family.

00:19:58.166 --> 00:19:59.433 position:7% line:89% align:start
I hope our skills will be used

00:19:59.567 --> 00:20:01.669 position:19% line:83% align:start
for more than dawdling
in family affairs.

00:20:01.803 --> 00:20:03.403 position:27% line:83% align:start
Be quiet! You've
already revealed

00:20:03.538 --> 00:20:05.873 position:19% line:83% align:start
more than enough secret
information to Ailey!

00:20:06.007 --> 00:20:09.143 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please, he already knows
all that. Don't you?

00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:11.079 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Yes, I know the gist of it.

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:12.345 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
From the game.

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:14.949 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
What is demon incense?

00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:16.450 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL gasp]

00:20:16.584 --> 00:20:20.788 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, uh. Well, it turns out
James is feeling better.

00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:25.993 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
Seriously? You're all agents?

00:20:26.127 --> 00:20:27.695 position:19% line:83% align:start
And you were sent here
on a secret mission

00:20:27.829 --> 00:20:30.865 position:21% line:83% align:start
for the Elmir Empire?
That's amazing!

00:20:30.998 --> 00:20:32.466 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, that's correct.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.434 position:10% line:83% align:start
And even though Walt and Kyle
may look more formidable,

00:20:34.569 --> 00:20:36.604 position:24% line:83% align:start
they're still just
lowly apprentices.

00:20:36.738 --> 00:20:39.607 position:24% line:83% align:start
But that would mean
you're in charge of us, somehow!

00:20:39.741 --> 00:20:40.875 position:38% line:89% align:start
Am I not?

00:20:41.008 --> 00:20:42.176 position:33% line:89% align:start
No! You are!

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:43.511 position:27% line:89% align:start
Of course, boss.

00:20:43.644 --> 00:20:45.412 position:30% line:83% align:start
More underlings
for the collection.

00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:46.814 position:16% line:89% align:start
On a more important note,

00:20:46.948 --> 00:20:49.282 position:24% line:83% align:start
does demon incense
make people grow violent?

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:50.383 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:20:50.518 --> 00:20:51.853 position:10% line:89% align:start
I see. That would explain why

00:20:51.986 --> 00:20:54.354 position:19% line:83% align:start
the abuse of women has
increased at the academy.

00:20:54.488 --> 00:20:57.658 position:24% line:83% align:start
Huh? I figured that
was the norm here,

00:20:57.792 --> 00:20:59.761 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I think you might
be onto something.

00:20:59.894 --> 00:21:01.428 position:27% line:83% align:start
We can't let this
horrid substance

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:03.296 position:7% line:89% align:start
poison our school any further!

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.199 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll gladly help
to put a stop to it.

00:21:05.332 --> 00:21:06.934 position:27% line:89% align:start
Great. Thank you.

00:21:07.068 --> 00:21:10.138 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well? James? Aren't you
going to offer to help, too?

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.806 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why would I do that?

00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:13.841 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's apparent there's much more
they're hiding from us.

00:21:13.975 --> 00:21:15.143 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AUGUSTE gasps]

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.477 position:19% line:83% align:start
You say that this demon
incense is very dangerous

00:21:17.612 --> 00:21:19.479 position:24% line:83% align:start
and causes mankind
to act violently.

00:21:19.614 --> 00:21:21.616 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is that all it does?

00:21:23.084 --> 00:21:26.187 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll be reporting this
to the director of the academy.

00:21:26.353 --> 00:21:27.755 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL gasp]

00:21:27.889 --> 00:21:29.957 position:19% line:83% align:start
James, this secrecy is
merely a part of their job.

00:21:30.091 --> 00:21:32.425 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sure there are many things
they can't tell us about.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.262 position:10% line:89% align:start
I think we should trust them.

00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:37.364 position:5% line:89% align:start
I do envy your naivetÃ©. However.

00:21:37.497 --> 00:21:40.500 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's not a single
soul that I trust.

00:21:42.703 --> 00:21:45.573 position:7% line:89% align:start
No. I can get him on our side!

00:21:47.809 --> 00:21:50.278 position:10% line:89% align:start
James! Please wait a moment!

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.345 position:13% line:89% align:start
We need to talk! Right now!

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:54.248 position:27% line:83% align:start
[JAMES] I agree.
There's something I've been

00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:57.350 position:5% line:89% align:start
meaning to ask for a long time.

00:21:58.119 --> 00:21:59.720 position:13% line:89% align:start
Who are you, Ailey Calois?

00:21:59.854 --> 00:22:02.089 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't be silly, I just came
clean about that, did I not?

00:22:02.223 --> 00:22:05.059 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JAMES] Let me ask
a different question.

00:22:05.193 --> 00:22:09.797 position:16% line:83% align:start
The other night. You saw
my true form, didn't you?

00:22:09.931 --> 00:22:11.632 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]
