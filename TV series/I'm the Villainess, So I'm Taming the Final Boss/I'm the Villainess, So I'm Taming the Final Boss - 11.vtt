[AILEEN] If I am so in your way,
then I shall be gone as well!

00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:13.635 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's see, here. You're
Belzebuth, is that right?

00:02:13.768 --> 00:02:16.738 position:7% line:83% align:start
[gasps] My lord's still willing
to call me by my name!

00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:19.139 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you are unable
to recall, I'm Keith.

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:23.443 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your trusted aide.
Ah! How unacceptable.

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:26.179 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your cushion is at
the wrong angle.

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:30.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KEITH] This tea looks
dreadful, as well.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.153 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let me prepare you a fresh cup.

00:02:38.593 --> 00:02:40.862 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sir? Is it true
you plan to dissolve

00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:43.564 position:5% line:89% align:start
your engagement to Lady Aileen?

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:46.934 position:16% line:89% align:start
Feelings can't be helped,

00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:49.336 position:13% line:83% align:start
but still, wishing for her
to disappear was cruel.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.371 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I didn't raise
you to be so rude,

00:02:51.506 --> 00:02:53.273 position:10% line:89% align:start
especially to the fairer sex.

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:56.243 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now listen here!
I didn't wish that.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.477 position:10% line:89% align:start
I just acknowledged the fact

00:02:57.612 --> 00:02:59.479 position:27% line:83% align:start
that we shouldn't
get any closer.

00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:01.783 position:7% line:83% align:start
Interesting, your true feelings
must've gotten warped

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:05.119 position:30% line:83% align:start
when they were
transmitted to the demon.

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:08.856 position:16% line:83% align:start
How are you feeling about
the whole situation, my Lord?

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:12.760 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KEITH]
Bel?!

00:03:12.894 --> 00:03:14.361 position:21% line:83% align:start
There were traces of
poison on the dresser,

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:17.632 position:5% line:89% align:start
so I purified it. Damned humans!

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:20.902 position:13% line:83% align:start
Next time, we should think
before we ignite, my friend!

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.235 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's there to think about?

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.238 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Extinguish the fire, Bel.

00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:33.781 position:10% line:89% align:start
My Lord! Give us your orders.

00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:39.687 position:19% line:83% align:start
One request. I must see
Aileen Lauren d'Autriche.

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.790 position:27% line:83% align:start
Make certain she
attends the ball.

How unlike you.

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.666 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are you seriously
not going to go?

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Oh please, I just have
better things to focus on!

00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:56.104 position:19% line:89% align:start
My career, for example!

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.272 position:7% line:83% align:start
As long as business is booming,
to hell with the engagement!

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.942 position:5% line:89% align:start
It matters not if I'm disowned.

00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:02.877 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC] For someone so done
with the demon lord,

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.213 position:13% line:83% align:start
it's odd that you're still
living in his castle.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:06.814 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey! Unfair!

00:04:06.948 --> 00:04:09.117 position:13% line:83% align:start
Almond and the rest of the
demons begged me to stay!

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.987 position:16% line:83% align:start
They even choreographed a
little "don't leave us" dance!

00:04:15.156 --> 00:04:18.526 position:24% line:83% align:start
Lady Aileen! I have
a delivery for you!

00:04:20.762 --> 00:04:22.130 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
What's this?

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.331 position:24% line:83% align:start
[KEITH] Your dress!
The ball is two days away!

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:25.933 position:19% line:89% align:start
What is going on here?

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:28.669 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's quite simple, really.
My Lord instructed me

00:04:28.803 --> 00:04:31.338 position:13% line:83% align:start
to give you this dress and
order you to attend the ball.

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:32.607 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh...

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.875 position:38% line:83% align:start

Go, Aileen!

But why? After all
that man put me through?

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.750 position:7% line:89% align:start
No! I absolutely refuse to go!

00:04:42.884 --> 00:04:44.484 position:24% line:83% align:start
No matter how you
whine and dissent,

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:46.087 position:19% line:89% align:start
orders are orders, yes?

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.123 position:7% line:89% align:start
Or would you prefer execution?

00:04:49.257 --> 00:04:52.960 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even without his memories,
my Lord is still the man he was.

00:04:53.094 --> 00:04:57.297 position:10% line:83% align:start
He'd rather die than let go
of the things he holds dear.

00:04:58.599 --> 00:04:59.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
You think he holds me dear?

00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:02.469 position:24% line:83% align:start
Really? Even after
I slapped him?

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:04.038 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't be surprised
if that made him

00:05:04.172 --> 00:05:06.941 position:21% line:83% align:start
fall in love with you
all over again!

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:09.977 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's no way you can
convince me to go!

00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:12.280 position:19% line:83% align:start
Save this stubbornness
for another day.

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:13.781 position:30% line:89% align:start
Go! Go! Demons!
