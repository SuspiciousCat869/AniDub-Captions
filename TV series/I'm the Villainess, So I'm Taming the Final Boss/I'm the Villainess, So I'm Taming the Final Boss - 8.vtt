why did you bring the duck head?

two of you to me in a heartbeat.

00:16:28.823 --> 00:16:30.090 position:13% line:89% align:start
Did I hear that correctly?

00:16:30.224 --> 00:16:32.727 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sold off like cattle
to the demon king.

00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:36.731 position:7% line:83% align:start
And Selena... She slipped away
after the demon incident.

00:16:36.865 --> 00:16:39.534 position:33% line:83% align:start
Rest assured,
she didn't too get far.

00:16:39.667 --> 00:16:41.936 position:24% line:83% align:start
How did you capture
her so quickly?

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:43.170 position:16% line:89% align:start
It wasn't very difficult.

00:16:43.303 --> 00:16:45.072 position:24% line:83% align:start
You see, the scent
of demon incense

00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:46.975 position:13% line:89% align:start
was on her the whole time.

00:16:47.107 --> 00:16:49.744 position:35% line:89% align:start
[inaudible]

00:16:50.845 --> 00:16:52.246 position:10% line:89% align:start
I had to remain on my guard.

00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:54.616 position:24% line:83% align:start
Lest I fall victim
to her trickery.

00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:57.084 position:24% line:83% align:start
She never seemed to
catch on that I knew.

00:16:57.217 --> 00:16:59.286 position:30% line:89% align:start
[GROUP gasping]

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:01.154 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Selena had demon incense on her

00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:03.525 position:7% line:89% align:start
without realizing what it was.

00:17:03.658 --> 00:17:06.895 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nonsense. I don't even
know what that is.

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:08.495 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
She also knew Auguste

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.465 position:16% line:83% align:start
should have possessed the
holy sword, like in the game.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:12.934 position:35% line:89% align:start
You don't?

00:17:13.066 --> 00:17:15.135 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I thought that you were
the rightful wielder of it!

00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:17.237 position:21% line:89% align:start
Or so I was informed.

00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:20.040 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] So, was Selena
following the instructions

00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:23.578 position:24% line:83% align:start
of someone who has
knowledge of the game?

00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:26.748 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is wrong! This wasn't
what was supposed to happen!

00:17:26.881 --> 00:17:29.149 position:13% line:83% align:start
I followed the instructions
in the letter.

00:17:29.283 --> 00:17:30.785 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Letters...

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:36.156 position:7% line:83% align:start
The person penning the letters
to Selena... Who is it?

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.593 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oops. I should've mentioned
Selena's a big fan

00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:39.861 position:27% line:89% align:start
of Lady Lilia's.

00:17:39.994 --> 00:17:43.096 position:16% line:83% align:start
The two of them have even
exchanged letters before.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.900 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AILEEN gasps]

00:17:46.034 --> 00:17:49.571 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] That's it. I know
who the mastermind is.

00:17:49.704 --> 00:17:53.106 position:24% line:83% align:start
The one pretending
to be Ashtarte.

00:18:08.155 --> 00:18:09.757 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LILIA]
Oh, Lady Aileen!

00:18:09.891 --> 00:18:13.695 position:10% line:83% align:start
What a surprise to see you've
returned from Mirchetta.

00:18:16.463 --> 00:18:17.865 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Skip the small talk.

00:18:17.999 --> 00:18:19.534 position:19% line:89% align:start
You know why I'm here.

00:18:19.667 --> 00:18:23.136 position:13% line:83% align:start
This was a test to see if I
know about the game, right?

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.073 position:19% line:83% align:start
You wanted to find out
if I have memories

00:18:25.205 --> 00:18:27.842 position:5% line:89% align:start
of my past life the way you do.

00:18:40.088 --> 00:18:41.956 position:24% line:89% align:start
Out with it, when?

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.423 position:33% line:89% align:start
My memories?

00:18:43.558 --> 00:18:45.526 position:24% line:83% align:start
I started recalling
details around the time

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.461 position:10% line:89% align:start
I met you and Prince CÃ©dric.

00:18:47.595 --> 00:18:50.064 position:13% line:83% align:start
And if people died because
of your careless actions,

00:18:50.197 --> 00:18:51.866 position:16% line:89% align:start
what would you have done?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.669 position:30% line:83% align:start
If people died?
What are you talking about?

00:18:54.802 --> 00:18:57.270 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know they're only
characters in a game.

00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:58.773 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AILEEN grunts]

00:18:58.906 --> 00:19:00.908 position:19% line:83% align:start
Come now, don't tell me
you're one of those types

00:19:01.042 --> 00:19:04.478 position:10% line:83% align:start
who couldn't tell games apart
from reality in your last life?

00:19:04.612 --> 00:19:07.481 position:33% line:83% align:start
This world is
only a game, silly.

00:19:07.615 --> 00:19:10.118 position:13% line:83% align:start
Are you honestly telling me
you'd refuse to finish a game

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.719 position:24% line:83% align:start
you paid real money
for just because

00:19:11.853 --> 00:19:15.489 position:13% line:83% align:start
a few fictional characters
died along the way?

00:19:15.623 --> 00:19:19.761 position:10% line:83% align:start
Lilia, this is reality. Here,
everyone lives and breathes.

00:19:19.894 --> 00:19:23.330 position:19% line:83% align:start
Like you, if they die,
they won't come back.

00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:25.365 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're not like me
if I'm the player.

00:19:25.499 --> 00:19:28.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why it's so fun
experiencing the story

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:30.104 position:5% line:89% align:start
where you're the main character.

00:19:30.237 --> 00:19:32.674 position:13% line:83% align:start
These characters are only
programmed to follow lines

00:19:32.807 --> 00:19:36.410 position:16% line:83% align:start
of code. You're far more
interesting than any of them.

00:19:36.544 --> 00:19:40.848 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's have more fun,
Lady Aileen.

00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:43.651 position:35% line:89% align:start
I decline.

00:19:43.785 --> 00:19:46.521 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't plan on giving you
that kind of attention.

00:19:46.654 --> 00:19:50.091 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do the right thing
and turn yourself in.

00:19:50.223 --> 00:19:52.560 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did I commit a crime
of some sort?

00:19:52.694 --> 00:19:55.697 position:13% line:83% align:start
Feel free to share any real
evidence you might have.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're acting as if it's
already game over for me.

00:20:02.235 --> 00:20:05.272 position:16% line:83% align:start
The only person confused
about reality and fiction here

00:20:05.405 --> 00:20:08.308 position:16% line:83% align:start
is you, Lilia, and if you
want to play against me,

00:20:08.442 --> 00:20:11.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
you're going to have
to do better than this.

00:20:11.612 --> 00:20:15.415 position:13% line:83% align:start
If that's all, I'll be off.
Goodbye.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.267 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Shortly after,

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.104 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ashtarte announced
the end of the rebellion.

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:40.508 position:7% line:83% align:start
Peaceful days at Mische Academy
were once again the norm.

00:20:41.843 --> 00:20:44.277 position:10% line:83% align:start
The Grand Duchy of Mirchetta
was incredibly grateful

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.814 position:10% line:89% align:start
of Lord Claude's supervision.

00:20:46.948 --> 00:20:48.649 position:24% line:83% align:start
He and the members
of the security force

00:20:48.783 --> 00:20:53.087 position:19% line:83% align:start
were generously praised
for thwarting the attack.

00:20:53.221 --> 00:20:56.824 position:5% line:83% align:start
His public image bolstered, Lord
Claude advised humans and demons

00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:59.761 position:19% line:83% align:start
should all be protected
citizens, and each side

00:20:59.894 --> 00:21:03.898 position:19% line:83% align:start
enjoyed more diplomatic
relations with his counsel.

00:21:07.101 --> 00:21:09.170 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, now. Let's not dawdle.

00:21:09.302 --> 00:21:10.838 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Right.

00:21:12.907 --> 00:21:15.209 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm reminded, dearest,
that I haven't had time

00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:18.246 position:13% line:83% align:start
to properly punish you for
your earlier disobedience.

00:21:18.378 --> 00:21:21.182 position:10% line:89% align:start
[gasps] What? Punish me how?

00:21:21.314 --> 00:21:25.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, perhaps a kiss would satisfy
my longing to see you chastised.

00:21:25.352 --> 00:21:27.354 position:33% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Here?

00:21:27.487 --> 00:21:29.123 position:27% line:83% align:start
Must we have this
intimate conversation

00:21:29.257 --> 00:21:31.559 position:13% line:89% align:start
here and now, Lord Claude?

00:21:32.425 --> 00:21:34.294 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Hm?

00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:38.566 position:27% line:89% align:start
[AILEEN squeaks]

00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:41.235 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please! Someone
could have seen us!

00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:43.671 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Am I not your husband-to-be?

00:21:43.805 --> 00:21:46.406 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your beautiful blue eyes
need only focus on me,

00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:48.543 position:30% line:89% align:start
dearest Aileen.

00:21:48.676 --> 00:21:52.914 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
This man is so unfair!

00:21:54.414 --> 00:21:59.720 position:7% line:83% align:start
Let us be off then. We mustn't
keep the emperor waiting.

00:21:59.854 --> 00:22:01.522 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
We'll keep moving forward.

00:22:01.656 --> 00:22:05.927 position:16% line:83% align:start
To the happy ending that
awaits us... together!

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.430 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Yes, together.

00:22:10.565 --> 00:22:15.036 position:7% line:83% align:start
Though the path might twist and
turn, we will find our way!
