00:00:09.544 --> 00:00:11.278 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS]
Release me! At once!

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.948 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SORCERER A]
Silence, Elephas!

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS] Our women and children
are being held captive

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.117 position:30% line:89% align:start
in the capital!

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.253 position:5% line:89% align:start
You would sacrifice their lives?

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.221 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SORCERER A] Do not bow
to the dowager empress

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.825 position:21% line:83% align:start
then pretend to care
for our people's lives!

00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.026 position:24% line:83% align:start
We will control the
demon king and use him

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.762 position:21% line:89% align:start
to attack the empire!

00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:31.866 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
That went well.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.001 position:38% line:89% align:start
What now?

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.067 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS]
Joy, you're awake.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.570 position:21% line:89% align:start
Interesting fellows.

00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:37.705 position:21% line:83% align:start
I understand they're
planning a coup d'Ã©tat.

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.974 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you can't stop them,
then the Levi family

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:42.109 position:19% line:89% align:start
really will go extinct.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.645 position:21% line:89% align:start
I fear you're right.

00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:45.279 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's as Lady Lilia said.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:47.214 position:10% line:89% align:start
The future cannot be altered.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.850 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Lady Lilia?

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:51.019 position:5% line:89% align:start
So she's who you're working for.

00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:54.022 position:47% line:89% align:start
No.

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:56.691 position:10% line:83% align:start
The horrid master I spoke of
before is the dowager empress.

00:00:56.824 --> 00:00:58.492 position:24% line:89% align:start
I fancy Lady Lilia.

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:00.595 position:10% line:89% align:start
Though she doesn't fancy me.

00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:02.062 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Hmm.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.732 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why do you glare as if I've
said something unforgivable?

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.501 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
No reason. Go on.

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:11.873 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS] Our first encounter
was about six months ago.

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:13.307 position:24% line:89% align:start
I remember it well.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.309 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Let me guess,
she said something like,

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.612 position:13% line:83% align:start
"It breaks my heart to see
all your heroic efforts

00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:20.014 position:19% line:83% align:start
go to waste," and after
that you couldn't get her

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:21.516 position:27% line:89% align:start
out of your mind.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:22.884 position:38% line:89% align:start
Too easy.

00:01:23.017 --> 00:01:25.485 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let us not destroy any more
of my treasured memories.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.755 position:27% line:83% align:start
You would benefit
from some tact.

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:29.156 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Toughen up.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.258 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, after that she told
you that the Levi family

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.093 position:5% line:89% align:start
would be destroyed at this rate?

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.929 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS]
Yes, exactly.

00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:37.699 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ah. Just as I thought.

00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:40.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS] What you might not
know is that she got her hands

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:41.836 position:19% line:89% align:start
on another holy sword.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.037 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.471 position:7% line:89% align:start
I borrowed the sword from her,

00:01:44.606 --> 00:01:48.275 position:19% line:83% align:start
and well, I should say,
I'm sorry.

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:50.310 position:13% line:89% align:start
This has all been my fault.

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.245 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
I fell for her scheme.

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.549 position:30% line:83% align:start
She got Elephas
on her side early,

00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:56.416 position:24% line:83% align:start
which set him on a
completely different path

00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:58.519 position:19% line:89% align:start
from the original game.

00:01:58.653 --> 00:02:00.187 position:5% line:89% align:start
I would break out of this cell,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.456 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I unfortunately
lack the magic.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.458 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
What? How could that be?

00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:07.260 position:16% line:83% align:start
You absorbed all my power
with your holy sword.

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:11.164 position:27% line:83% align:start
And, after that,
we managed to crash directly

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.001 position:27% line:89% align:start
into my homeland.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.267 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
I see.

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:16.470 position:24% line:83% align:start
My sword swallowed
up your magic.

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:18.773 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was curious as to where
this newfound energy

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:19.941 position:35% line:89% align:start
came from.

00:02:20.074 --> 00:02:21.274 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS]
Huh?

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.694 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well then, it would seem
I have plenty of strength

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:41.294 position:21% line:89% align:start
to save your people.

00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:42.897 position:27% line:89% align:start
Anything to say?

00:02:43.031 --> 00:02:44.899 position:19% line:89% align:start
Words fail me, my lady.

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:46.534 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't even waste your breath.

00:02:46.668 --> 00:02:49.504 position:16% line:83% align:start
I will never forgive you
for what you did to Almond.

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.810 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now get down on
your knees and beg.

00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:58.846 position:21% line:83% align:start
Humiliate yourself in
pursuit of my sympathy!

00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:03.718 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you do that,
Almond might understand.

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.185 position:41% line:89% align:start
I hope.

00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:13.728 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
What are you doing?

00:03:15.096 --> 00:03:16.296 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS]
A--

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.836 position:13% line:83% align:start
A sorcerer's eye is an item
of immense magical power.

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.606 position:7% line:83% align:start
Please. I wish for you to take
this, and use it to release

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.208 position:10% line:89% align:start
the spell on the demon lord.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.249 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is all I have to offer you.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.653 position:30% line:83% align:start
Accept it as a
symbol of loyalty.

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:43.791 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
You would want me to save him,

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:45.392 position:21% line:89% align:start
wouldn't you, Almond?

00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:56.003 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'll conquer your homeland
then head to the capital.

00:03:56.137 --> 00:03:58.639 position:19% line:83% align:start
Make sure that you keep
your crystal at the ready.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:30.865 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KNIGHT A]
Halt!

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:32.166 position:7% line:83% align:start
--[KNIGHT B] You can't escape!
--[KNIGHT C] You fools!

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.934 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KNIGHT A]
Halt, I say!

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:37.672 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KNIGHT B]
Over here!

00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:42.143 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SELENA]
This way.

00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:43.778 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
Selena?

00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:45.947 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you want to escape,
follow me.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.683 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know where they're
keeping Lord Claude.

00:05:48.816 --> 00:05:51.052 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why the sudden desire to help?

00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:53.788 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't be a fool,
it's not about helping you.

00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.290 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's about spiting
that wretch, Lilia.

00:05:56.423 --> 00:05:57.692 position:30% line:89% align:start
So come along.

00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:09.804 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Come to think of it,
why is the dowager empress

00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:13.341 position:10% line:83% align:start
so bent on holding sorcerers
hostage in the first place?

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.576 position:24% line:83% align:start
You must've noticed
her appearance.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.778 position:24% line:83% align:start
How do you suppose
she maintains her youth?

00:06:17.912 --> 00:06:19.914 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wait, you don't mean--you do!

00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:22.583 position:30% line:83% align:start
How completely
disrespectful to your kind!

00:06:22.717 --> 00:06:24.518 position:27% line:89% align:start
Those poor souls.

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:34.195 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Isaac! Sir Keith!

00:06:34.328 --> 00:06:35.863 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KEITH]
Lady Aileen?

00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:39.533 position:21% line:83% align:start
Explain! Why are you
carting around that traitor?

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.168 position:30% line:89% align:start
He's our enemy!

00:06:41.302 --> 00:06:43.371 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's fine! He's trained now!

00:06:43.504 --> 00:06:45.273 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please mind your word
choice, my lady.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:46.941 position:27% line:83% align:start
More importantly,
what's happening?

00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:48.910 position:21% line:83% align:start
The demons should be
running from the capital,

00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:50.144 position:30% line:89% align:start
not toward it!

00:06:50.278 --> 00:06:51.579 position:24% line:83% align:start
They've turned back
of their own volition.

00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:53.413 position:27% line:83% align:start
See? They want to
save their lord!

00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:54.749 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AILEEN gasps]

00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:58.552 position:10% line:89% align:start
I hope you've regained power,

00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:00.388 position:16% line:83% align:start
because I'm going to need
someone to catch me.

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:02.723 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? Lady Aileen wait!

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:13.668 position:30% line:89% align:start
Move! At once!

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:15.636 position:7% line:89% align:start
Our lord's crying out in pain!

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.138 position:30% line:89% align:start
Calm yourself!

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:19.607 position:16% line:83% align:start
Lord Claude didn't order
you to return, now did he?

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.709 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just who are you
trying to protect here?

00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:23.344 position:24% line:89% align:start
Those weak humans?

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:25.012 position:21% line:89% align:start
You betray our lord!

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.452 position:24% line:83% align:start
Rescuing Lord Claude
is my responsibility.

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:33.888 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now remember yours.

00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:36.489 position:27% line:83% align:start
The fate of these
demons is in your hands.

00:07:39.527 --> 00:07:41.461 position:19% line:89% align:start
You have until sunset.

00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:43.597 position:7% line:89% align:start
We won't wait a moment longer.

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:49.170 position:5% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS] I can easily transport
the two of us to the capital.

00:07:49.303 --> 00:07:50.972 position:24% line:83% align:start
But what'll we do
once we get there?

00:07:51.105 --> 00:07:52.506 position:24% line:89% align:start
We discussed this.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.108 position:21% line:89% align:start
Very generally, yes.

00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:57.211 position:10% line:83% align:start
In order to break the spell,
we must place this

00:07:57.345 --> 00:07:59.180 position:7% line:89% align:start
in the empress's magical tool.

00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:02.450 position:16% line:83% align:start
Trouble is that I don't
know where this tool is.

00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:05.519 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
Aileen? Can you hear me? Aileen!

00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:07.555 position:27% line:83% align:start
Does anybody else
hear that voice?

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:08.756 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AILEEN gasps]

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:10.825 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's James! Where are you?

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.492 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is everyone all right?

00:08:12.626 --> 00:08:14.428 position:10% line:89% align:start
We made it inside the palace.

00:08:14.562 --> 00:08:17.465 position:33% line:83% align:start
We're alive,
and we found Lord Claude.

00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:18.833 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's been drugged
with demon incense

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:20.735 position:5% line:89% align:start
to the point of unconsciousness.

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:23.604 position:21% line:83% align:start
And the imperial army
has us surrounded!

00:08:23.738 --> 00:08:25.172 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Is Rachel safe?

00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:26.507 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
Yes.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.175 position:27% line:83% align:start
Though she fought
harder than any of us.

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:31.712 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, and I'm sure that the
incense riled the demons.

00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:33.547 position:21% line:83% align:start
It caused Lord Claude
to cry out.

00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:35.916 position:21% line:83% align:start
If he regains power,
it'll disperse,

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.119 position:24% line:83% align:start
and we have no idea
how to stop it!

00:08:40.488 --> 00:08:42.056 position:13% line:89% align:start
All right. Listen, Selena.

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:43.791 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're familiar with
the dowager empress's

00:08:43.924 --> 00:08:45.526 position:16% line:89% align:start
magical tool, aren't you?

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:47.194 position:38% line:89% align:start
Her what?

00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:48.462 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Oh, please, weren't
you trying to worm your way

00:08:48.596 --> 00:08:50.164 position:24% line:89% align:start
into CÃ©dric's bed?

00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:52.433 position:7% line:83% align:start
That should've required careful
research about the palace.

00:08:52.566 --> 00:08:55.302 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if were the premier expert,
why would I tell you?

00:08:55.436 --> 00:08:58.507 position:16% line:83% align:start
After Lady Lilia, you are
my greatest sworn enemy!

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:00.908 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
Selena! Please help.

00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:03.744 position:19% line:83% align:start
Without your knowledge,
we don't know where to begin.

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:08.382 position:16% line:83% align:start
I would say the northern
tower is your best bet.

00:09:08.517 --> 00:09:10.718 position:19% line:83% align:start
If the rumors are true,
it serves as her personal

00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:12.153 position:30% line:89% align:start
treasure trove.

00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:14.021 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
Yeah. That makes sense!

00:09:14.155 --> 00:09:16.424 position:19% line:83% align:start
The holy knights aren't
allowed near that area!

00:09:16.557 --> 00:09:17.825 position:44% line:89% align:start
Well.

00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.927 position:21% line:83% align:start
You two are a great
fit for one another.

00:09:20.061 --> 00:09:22.797 position:7% line:83% align:start
I hope you fall into one of her
schemes for good, Auguste.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.231 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
What is that supposed to mean?

00:09:24.365 --> 00:09:25.599 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SELENA] And what exactly
do you mean by that?

00:09:25.733 --> 00:09:27.001 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
Aileen.

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:29.637 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll take care of Lord
Claude until you arrive.

00:09:30.938 --> 00:09:33.007 position:7% line:89% align:start
Prioritize your own wellbeing.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.009 position:7% line:89% align:start
We wouldn't want to upset him.

00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:37.611 position:13% line:83% align:start
I promise you, for I would
never dream of doing

00:09:37.745 --> 00:09:40.047 position:24% line:83% align:start
anything that would
upset my darling.

00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:52.026 position:38% line:89% align:start
This way.

00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:55.296 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you suppose the Levi
family hostages are held

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:56.565 position:24% line:89% align:start
in the same tower?

00:09:56.697 --> 00:09:57.898 position:44% line:89% align:start
I do.

00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:01.202 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
The holy sword?

00:10:01.335 --> 00:10:02.670 position:33% line:89% align:start
Could it be?

00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:16.884 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:24.725 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LILIA]
What's this?

00:10:24.859 --> 00:10:26.861 position:24% line:83% align:start
You should've been
executed by now, Elephas!

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:29.730 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your romance path was
sweet, but so tortured.

00:10:29.864 --> 00:10:32.633 position:27% line:83% align:start
I had to increase
your affection level.

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:34.335 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, my goodness,
you don't have a clue

00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:35.469 position:27% line:89% align:start
what I'm saying!

00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:37.371 position:7% line:89% align:start
No non-player character would!

00:10:37.506 --> 00:10:40.407 position:7% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right, Lady Aileen?

00:10:40.542 --> 00:10:42.376 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, are you enjoying my show?

00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:45.713 position:16% line:83% align:start
I tried to learn from my
mistakes and give it 100%!

00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:47.882 position:16% line:83% align:start
At best, your efforts are
completely misguided--

00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:49.717 position:13% line:89% align:start
at worst, they're inhumane.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.521 position:16% line:83% align:start
Aw! But I worked so hard
to get the holy sword

00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:54.655 position:7% line:89% align:start
from Leicester's romance path.

00:10:58.058 --> 00:11:00.294 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] My sword came
from Prince CÃ©dric's path.

00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:02.863 position:16% line:83% align:start
Lilia had to throttle the
heart of yet another man

00:11:02.997 --> 00:11:04.732 position:21% line:83% align:start
to get her hands on a
blade that's competitive

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:06.133 position:35% line:89% align:start
with mine.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.105 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll hold her attention.

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:13.741 position:21% line:83% align:start
You hurry and release
Lord Claude from the spell.

00:11:14.475 --> 00:11:16.310 position:5% line:89% align:start
Question, and I mean no offense.

00:11:16.443 --> 00:11:19.013 position:27% line:83% align:start
But why are you so
infatuated with me?

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:20.381 position:41% line:89% align:start
Silly.

00:11:20.515 --> 00:11:22.983 position:10% line:83% align:start
In this land of the mindless,
you're my obvious rival.

00:11:23.117 --> 00:11:24.952 position:33% line:83% align:start
So, when you
inevitably fall to me,

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:27.021 position:13% line:89% align:start
try not to be too pathetic.

00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:30.691 position:35% line:83% align:start
Stand tall.
You are the main character.

00:11:31.992 --> 00:11:34.361 position:33% line:89% align:start
[LILIA yells]

00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:35.763 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AILEEN grunts]

00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:42.903 position:35% line:83% align:start
[BELZEBUTH]
If anything happens to our lord,

00:11:43.037 --> 00:11:45.105 position:13% line:89% align:start
you will pay for it, human.

00:11:45.239 --> 00:11:46.608 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KEITH]
That's fine.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.642 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just bite my head
of and feed my body

00:11:47.775 --> 00:11:49.410 position:24% line:89% align:start
to the little ones.

00:11:49.544 --> 00:11:52.647 position:10% line:83% align:start
I would die surrounded by all
of my closest compatriots.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.415 position:21% line:89% align:start
'Twould be an honor.

00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:56.984 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, just give it a break.

00:11:57.117 --> 00:11:58.752 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm serious,
I've been jealous of you

00:11:58.886 --> 00:12:00.254 position:19% line:89% align:start
and the demons forever.

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:03.190 position:16% line:83% align:start
You have a connection to
our lord that I just don't.

00:12:03.324 --> 00:12:04.792 position:10% line:89% align:start
He could be writhing in pain,

00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:06.927 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I'd be the only
one who didn't know.

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:15.803 position:41% line:83% align:start
[DENIS]
Sir Belzebuth!

00:12:19.006 --> 00:12:20.874 position:5% line:89% align:start
It took us a while to catch up!

00:12:22.142 --> 00:12:23.877 position:7% line:89% align:start
Are any of the demons injured?

00:12:24.912 --> 00:12:26.747 position:7% line:89% align:start
We brought plenty of medicine.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.350 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd rather report the
news than partake.

00:12:29.483 --> 00:12:30.884 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, what's your plan?

00:12:31.018 --> 00:12:32.587 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you horde of heroes
going to blindly invade

00:12:32.721 --> 00:12:34.589 position:19% line:89% align:start
once the sun goes down?

00:12:34.723 --> 00:12:37.157 position:10% line:83% align:start
You could partner up with our
ranks to save Lord Claude

00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:38.225 position:27% line:89% align:start
if you'd rather.

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:39.860 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, why would you
humans ever wish

00:12:39.994 --> 00:12:41.161 position:27% line:89% align:start
to save our lord?

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:42.830 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you're all in
love with Aileen,

00:12:42.963 --> 00:12:44.932 position:19% line:83% align:start
isn't he just standing
in your way?

00:12:50.838 --> 00:12:52.306 position:16% line:83% align:start
Though even all together,
you wouldn't have

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:54.408 position:21% line:83% align:start
the slightest chance
of defeating my lord--

00:12:54.542 --> 00:12:57.077 position:13% line:83% align:start
You really must learn how
to read a room, my friend.

00:12:57.211 --> 00:12:59.581 position:21% line:83% align:start
Try to understand the
complexities of their hearts!

00:12:59.714 --> 00:13:00.649 position:41% line:89% align:start
Please!

00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:01.849 position:27% line:89% align:start
[JASPER chuckles]

00:13:01.982 --> 00:13:03.183 position:27% line:89% align:start
Here's the deal.

00:13:03.317 --> 00:13:04.753 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why would we help
you save Lord Claude?

00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:07.656 position:33% line:83% align:start
The answer is
surprisingly simple.

00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:09.857 position:5% line:89% align:start
Us humans are foolish creatures.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.859 position:5% line:89% align:start
We think if we try hard enough,

00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:14.395 position:21% line:83% align:start
we can get along with
just about anyone.

00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:17.666 position:27% line:89% align:start
Anyone, you say?

00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:20.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
Absolutely, even
a demon like you.

00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:24.338 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, that's mankind.

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:26.974 position:27% line:83% align:start
Self-serving and
extremely arrogant.

00:13:46.427 --> 00:13:47.428 position:27% line:89% align:start
[LILIA chuckles]

00:13:47.562 --> 00:13:49.963 position:19% line:83% align:start
Great, the overpowered
heroine trope.

00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:51.533 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course!

00:13:51.666 --> 00:13:53.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
If the efforts of the main
character weren't rewarded,

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:55.369 position:19% line:83% align:start
then it would hardly be
an otome game.

00:13:55.503 --> 00:13:58.138 position:7% line:83% align:start
You should've put more points
into the etiquette skill tree!

00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:00.374 position:10% line:83% align:start
[LILIA] I figured putting all
my points toward strength

00:14:00.508 --> 00:14:02.242 position:16% line:89% align:start
would be more rewarding!

00:14:02.376 --> 00:14:03.911 position:21% line:83% align:start
The villainess's base
skills are high,

00:14:04.044 --> 00:14:05.379 position:13% line:89% align:start
but it all seems balanced.

00:14:05.513 --> 00:14:08.516 position:16% line:83% align:start
The only negative thing
is... a bad personality?

00:14:09.883 --> 00:14:11.085 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AILEEN grunts]

00:14:14.888 --> 00:14:16.924 position:5% line:89% align:start
I made that wall with my sword!

00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:20.094 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just in case a cyclops
tried to spoil my fun.

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:23.464 position:33% line:89% align:start
[LILIA yells]

00:14:23.598 --> 00:14:25.933 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] I need to get that
sword away from her!

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.013 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ow!

00:14:40.147 --> 00:14:41.949 position:7% line:89% align:start
I can't believe you'd hurt me!

00:14:42.082 --> 00:14:43.785 position:41% line:89% align:start
Boohoo.

00:14:43.917 --> 00:14:45.687 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are you trying to
absorb my sword?

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.421 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm taking back what's mine!

00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:50.157 position:7% line:83% align:start
Once I have it, I alone will be
able to destroy Lord Claude

and all the demons.

00:14:52.426 --> 00:14:54.194 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is fun, you simply
must come over

00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:56.130 position:19% line:89% align:start
and play with me again!

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:00.502 position:13% line:89% align:start
This game is sort of silly.

00:15:00.635 --> 00:15:02.637 position:27% line:83% align:start
Think about it--
what in the world is a

00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:05.205 position:13% line:89% align:start
Holy Sword Maiden, anyway?

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:07.241 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
What's a Holy Sword Maiden?

00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:09.577 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's easy, she's the
woman destined to be

00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:11.378 position:19% line:89% align:start
the demon lord's wife!

00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:14.948 position:27% line:83% align:start
And what even is
the Regalia of Saints,

00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:18.318 position:7% line:89% align:start
Demons, and Maidens? Beats me.

00:15:18.452 --> 00:15:20.320 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
That's obvious.

00:15:20.454 --> 00:15:23.190 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's all about
the power of love!

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.529 position:27% line:89% align:start
How can this be?

00:15:27.662 --> 00:15:30.598 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, you're absorbing the
demon lord's magic now?

00:15:30.732 --> 00:15:32.933 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is killing him your grand plan?

[LILIA grunts]

00:15:40.174 --> 00:15:43.377 position:16% line:83% align:start
Lord Claude would never
die and leave me behind!

00:15:44.278 --> 00:15:47.181 position:19% line:83% align:start
All that to say, I need
to save my beloved

00:15:47.314 --> 00:15:50.117 position:19% line:83% align:start
before death ever gets
the chance to knock!

[ELEPHAS]
It's no use!

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:04.465 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's sealed with magic!

Too bad!

00:16:17.144 --> 00:16:19.379 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
The magic is depleting.

00:16:19.514 --> 00:16:23.016 position:5% line:89% align:start
That means Lord Claude is dying!

00:16:24.284 --> 00:16:26.754 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe if I can use the
whole of my powers...

00:16:30.592 --> 00:16:32.259 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please! Work!

[LILIA chuckles]

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.568 position:24% line:89% align:start
Look, Lady Aileen!

00:16:40.702 --> 00:16:42.202 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm the winner.

Yes, Almond!

You have to help me
save your master!

00:17:06.961 --> 00:17:08.161 position:41% line:89% align:start
Can do!

At last.

But wait, Your Majesty.

We're under imperial order.

Good, then I shall rescind it.

I regret to inform you

Will you confirm this, CÃ©dric?

If my brother says it's true,
well, then true it must be.

the black market.

Lilia. You are a
terrifying woman.

00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:39.479 position:21% line:83% align:start
You carelessly commit
these heinous atrocities,

00:19:39.614 --> 00:19:41.949 position:21% line:83% align:start
then pin them on your
peers without regret.

But Brother, I am responsible
for allowing this to unfold.

That said, my fiancÃ©e's
crimes are her own.

00:19:52.126 --> 00:19:52.994 position:35% line:89% align:start
We concede.

I'm done.

00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:59.266 position:27% line:83% align:start
I will no longer
follow you blindly.

00:19:59.399 --> 00:20:01.201 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm your puppet no more.

00:20:04.572 --> 00:20:07.642 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even so, this deep love
that I feel for you

00:20:07.775 --> 00:20:09.276 position:27% line:89% align:start
will never fade.

Don't be afraid.

Everything's all right now.

00:20:24.926 --> 00:20:26.894 position:24% line:89% align:start
Aileen. Come to me.

00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:49.050 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
"Lady Aileen shall be my bride."

00:20:49.183 --> 00:20:51.652 position:13% line:83% align:start
Lord Claude wasted no time
and made the announcement

00:20:51.786 --> 00:20:53.788 position:19% line:83% align:start
as soon as the emperor
and dowager empress

00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:55.790 position:27% line:89% align:start
left the capital.

00:20:55.923 --> 00:20:59.493 position:13% line:83% align:start
His next order of business
was releasing the Levi family.

00:20:59.627 --> 00:21:01.662 position:19% line:83% align:start
The gracious lord went
so far as to promise them

00:21:01.796 --> 00:21:05.099 position:21% line:83% align:start
official reparations
for their suffering.

00:21:05.233 --> 00:21:08.603 position:13% line:83% align:start
Our friend Almond is happy
and healthy once more.

00:21:08.736 --> 00:21:10.370 position:30% line:83% align:start
He's currently
choreographing a dance

00:21:10.505 --> 00:21:12.607 position:13% line:89% align:start
for the wedding reception.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.942 position:30% line:83% align:start
Elephas made it
out safely as well,

00:21:15.076 --> 00:21:17.178 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I think he found a
boss he'll like even more

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.546 position:38% line:89% align:start
than me.

00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:21.015 position:19% line:83% align:start
A sorcerer who refuses
to kill demons?

00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:23.851 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's the perfect fit
for the final boss.

00:21:25.953 --> 00:21:28.256 position:21% line:83% align:start
As for Prince CÃ©dric
and Lady Lilia,

00:21:28.388 --> 00:21:31.592 position:7% line:83% align:start
I hope they're making the most
out of their prison sentence.

00:21:37.231 --> 00:21:39.066 position:19% line:89% align:start
My future seemed bleak.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.569 position:21% line:83% align:start
But the Villainess's
path of destruction

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:44.539 position:21% line:83% align:start
has transformed into
a path of light.

00:21:46.274 --> 00:21:47.875 position:10% line:89% align:start
No matter what comes our way,

00:21:48.009 --> 00:21:51.112 position:27% line:83% align:start
we'll be able to
defeat it together.

00:21:51.245 --> 00:21:54.582 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because if we live with
love, there's no way

00:21:54.715 --> 00:21:57.552 position:27% line:83% align:start
we could ever meet
an unfortunate end!
