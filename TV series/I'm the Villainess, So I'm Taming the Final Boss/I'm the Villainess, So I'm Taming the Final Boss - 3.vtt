[ALMOND cawing]

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.718 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SERVANT A] Seems the crows
decided to come out and play.

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:32.967 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ALMOND]
Too close for comfort.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.836 position:13% line:89% align:start
The mission was a success!

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.738 position:19% line:89% align:start
Apple pie, here I come!

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:11.331 position:38% line:83% align:start
[RUDOLF]
Where's Aileen?

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:12.867 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAID A]
Still getting ready, sir.

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:14.936 position:13% line:83% align:start
[RUDOLF] I didn't raise my
daughter to be some vain

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.504 position:38% line:89% align:start
slowpoke.

00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:17.872 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
I'm ready, Father.

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:19.574 position:7% line:89% align:start
Apologies for making you wait.

00:02:19.707 --> 00:02:20.474 position:35% line:89% align:start
My, oh, my.

00:02:20.608 --> 00:02:22.442 position:16% line:89% align:start
What a pleasant surprise.

00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:28.215 position:19% line:83% align:start
You changed your look.
It's lovely.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.719 position:16% line:89% align:start
Might this be a bit much?

00:02:31.853 --> 00:02:34.122 position:27% line:83% align:start
The dress doesn't
outshine me now, does it?

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.355 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not at all, dear.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.991 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:40.595 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even at your debutante you
weren't so riddled with anxiety.

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:42.195 position:38% line:89% align:start
Well, I--

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:51.304 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] "Please accept this
evening gown and accessories.

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:52.940 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hope they are to your liking.

00:02:53.074 --> 00:02:56.044 position:24% line:83% align:start
Signed, Sincerely,
Claude Jeanne Elmir."

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.344 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:02:58.613 --> 00:03:00.982 position:13% line:83% align:start
The grandeur of this dress
demanded updated hair, makeup,

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:02.382 position:33% line:89% align:start
and perfume!

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.317 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AILEEN gasps]

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.420 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Least I made it this far.

00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:08.923 position:10% line:83% align:start
You look beautiful, darling,
no need to be nervous.

00:03:14.095 --> 00:03:15.863 position:33% line:83% align:start
[ONLOOKER A]
It's Lady Aileen!

00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:17.297 position:33% line:83% align:start
[ONLOOKER B]
Stunning!

00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:18.700 position:33% line:83% align:start
[ONLOOKER C]
I despise how good she looks.

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:20.434 position:33% line:83% align:start
[ONLOOKER D]
I expected no less from her!

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:21.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Lord Claude wouldn't've
just given me this dress

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:22.737 position:27% line:89% align:start
out of the blue.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.872 position:19% line:83% align:start
He meant for me to wear
it to the ball, right?

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:28.142 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, I wager Prince CÃ©dric
will fall for you again

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:30.178 position:13% line:89% align:start
once he sees your new look.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.846 position:13% line:89% align:start
Father! What a cruel joke!

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.247 position:21% line:83% align:start
A life with him would
be worse than death.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.683 position:38% line:83% align:start
[RUDOLF]
That so?

00:03:35.817 --> 00:03:37.484 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think it's a rather
viable possibility.

00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:39.954 position:13% line:83% align:start
If he comes crawling back,
perhaps we could recoup

00:03:40.088 --> 00:03:41.789 position:10% line:89% align:start
some of our financial losses.

00:03:41.923 --> 00:03:44.892 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our finances should be
the least of your concerns.

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.669 position:33% line:83% align:start
[ONLOOKER A]
Look at you!

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:57.105 position:21% line:83% align:start
You've tried Oberon's
skin toner, too, no doubt!

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.405 position:33% line:83% align:start
[ONLOOKER B]
Indeed!

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:59.907 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's instantly become
my favorite,

00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.442 position:27% line:83% align:start
as has the Oberon
Company for that matter!

00:04:02.577 --> 00:04:03.845 position:24% line:89% align:start
The Oberon Company?

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:06.279 position:24% line:83% align:start
Peculiar, I've not
heard of such group.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.751 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's the most recent endeavor
of someone you love dearly.

00:04:09.884 --> 00:04:12.520 position:7% line:83% align:start
You know, someone who couldn't
put the d'Autriche name

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:14.655 position:21% line:89% align:start
on a cosmetics line.

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:17.692 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ONLOOKER C] Unfortunately,
my sample has nearly run dry.

00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:19.359 position:33% line:83% align:start
[ONLOOKER D]
Sample?

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:21.062 position:24% line:83% align:start
I haven't received
anything from them at all.

00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:22.797 position:33% line:83% align:start
[ONLOOKER C]
That makes sense.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.832 position:7% line:83% align:start
Rumor has it they're only being
delivered to the chosen few.

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:26.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ONLOOKER D] Huh? Does
anyone know how to contact

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.569 position:24% line:89% align:start
the Oberon Company?

00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:30.605 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you happen to be acquainted
with them, I'd like to chat!

00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:33.074 position:5% line:83% align:start
[RUDOLF] They think their rivals
were deemed worthy of samples,

00:04:33.207 --> 00:04:34.407 position:21% line:89% align:start
while they were not.

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:36.010 position:16% line:89% align:start
I would be frantic, too.

00:04:36.144 --> 00:04:37.512 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Absolutely.

00:04:37.645 --> 00:04:39.180 position:13% line:83% align:start
It seems pitting the ladies
against each other

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.715 position:13% line:89% align:start
proved a successful tactic.

00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:42.950 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RUDOLF] You've made
Oberon the talk of the ball.

00:04:43.084 --> 00:04:45.285 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've employed the specialists
that Prince CÃ©dric

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:46.687 position:27% line:89% align:start
so crassly fired.

00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:48.355 position:21% line:83% align:start
Though we are still
finding our footing,

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.423 position:16% line:83% align:start
I anticipate our profits
will hugely surpass

00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:52.059 position:21% line:89% align:start
any previous losses.

00:04:52.193 --> 00:04:54.695 position:13% line:83% align:start
It will take a special man
to handle all that you are,

00:04:54.829 --> 00:04:55.797 position:38% line:89% align:start
my dear.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.965 position:24% line:83% align:start
I suppose we should
go socialize.

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
I look forward to seeing
what your new undertaking

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:02.003 position:30% line:89% align:start
shall achieve.

00:05:03.638 --> 00:05:04.939 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Father looks so happy.

00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:07.041 position:24% line:83% align:start
A little too happy,
if you ask me.

00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:17.752 position:30% line:83% align:start
The ladies just
can't get enough.

00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:20.221 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tell the boys we'll need
plenty of product to peddle.

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:23.124 position:5% line:83% align:start
Luc and Quartz will be thrilled
that their handiwork is a hit.

00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:25.993 position:7% line:83% align:start
And have we deduced the sender
of the threatening letters?

00:05:26.127 --> 00:05:27.427 position:30% line:89% align:start
You were right.

00:05:27.562 --> 00:05:28.796 position:24% line:83% align:start
Thanks to Almond we
can prove your hypothesis

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.398 position:7% line:89% align:start
about the stationery's origin.

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:32.767 position:5% line:89% align:start
I brought the evidence tonight.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.635 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just signal and
I'll pass it your way.

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:36.671 position:10% line:89% align:start
I expected no less from you.

00:05:36.804 --> 00:05:39.339 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's reassuring to have such
a dependable colleague.

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:43.244 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC] I wish we could end
there, but I bear bad news.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:44.979 position:10% line:89% align:start
Lady Lilia has gone missing.

00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.850 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] That's exactly what
happens in the threatening

00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:50.218 position:30% line:89% align:start
letters event.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.186 position:13% line:83% align:start
Back in the original game,
I hire a gang of rogues

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.421 position:30% line:89% align:start
to kidnap her.

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:56.157 position:19% line:83% align:start
Prince CÃ©dric believes
you're involved.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.093 position:7% line:83% align:start
Naturally, he sent Marcus along
with the knights-in-training

00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:00.460 position:10% line:89% align:start
into the demon lord's forest.

00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:02.330 position:27% line:89% align:start
[gasps] No! Why?

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:03.631 position:27% line:83% align:start
Does he intend to
hurt Lord Claude?

00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:05.333 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't make a scene!

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:08.002 position:21% line:83% align:start
The demon lord won't
go down so easily.

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:10.370 position:30% line:83% align:start
And there's the
non-aggression pact.

00:06:10.504 --> 00:06:11.906 position:41% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.175 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC] Lord Claude is
worried for you, too.

00:06:14.308 --> 00:06:16.777 position:10% line:89% align:start
He sent me a note via Almond.

00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:20.548 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE] Until I arrive,
take care of Aileen.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.754 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC] If you can't handle
this, who could?

00:06:26.888 --> 00:06:29.123 position:24% line:83% align:start
The demon lord has
put his faith in you.

00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
Please lay the groundwork
for Lord Claude's arrival.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.963 position:19% line:83% align:start
You have business here,
don't dawdle about me.

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:39.834 position:24% line:89% align:start
For shame, friend.

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:41.302 position:30% line:83% align:start
If there wasn't
another after you,

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:43.004 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'd have taken you for myself.

00:06:43.137 --> 00:06:45.339 position:19% line:83% align:start
I couldn't have you as
my husband, darling.

00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:47.474 position:5% line:89% align:start
I need you too badly as an ally.

00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:49.644 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sure. Whatever you say.

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:03.691 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] If things keep going
like they do in the game,

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:06.827 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll be the one who
orchestrated the kidnapping.

00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:07.929 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, well.

00:07:08.062 --> 00:07:09.897 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess it's time
to turn some tables.

00:07:15.036 --> 00:07:19.540 position:5% line:83% align:start
I might've lost the first round,
but I'll win the second!

00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:23.077 position:24% line:83% align:start
If it isn't Aileen
Lauren d'Autriche.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.578 position:33% line:89% align:start
Capture her!

00:07:30.718 --> 00:07:33.453 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even on our day off from
repairs, I must patrol.

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:35.890 position:21% line:83% align:start
The work of a knight
is never truly over.

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:39.927 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LILIA]
Excuse me?

00:07:46.801 --> 00:07:48.102 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
So this is her.

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:50.771 position:19% line:83% align:start
The one for whom CÃ©dric
cast aside Aileen.

00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:53.574 position:19% line:83% align:start
Good day, Sir, my name
is Lilia Rainworth.

00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:56.143 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know who you are,
but do you remember me?

00:07:56.277 --> 00:07:58.679 position:13% line:83% align:start
How could you have possibly
managed to breach the barrier

00:07:58.813 --> 00:08:00.514 position:21% line:89% align:start
without my noticing?

00:08:00.648 --> 00:08:03.217 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid I didn't
