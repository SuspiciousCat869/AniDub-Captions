Who are you, Ailey Calois?

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.887 position:10% line:83% align:start
Uh, that's odd. I came clean
about that, didn't I?

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.822 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll ask a different question.

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:22.256 position:35% line:89% align:start
That night,

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:25.192 position:24% line:83% align:start
you bore witness to
my true form, correct?

00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:06.193 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JAMES] Answer the question
if you want to live.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.496 position:24% line:89% align:start
You choose silence?

00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:12.132 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why would I align myself
with a complete unknown?

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
If death is your wish,
then stay quiet.

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:16.638 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
All right, allow me to explain.

00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:17.839 position:27% line:89% align:start
Come out, Ribbon!

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.943 position:21% line:89% align:start
[JAMES gasps, grunts]

00:02:22.944 --> 00:02:26.047 position:10% line:83% align:start
Get this creature off of me!
Make haste!

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.148 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
I want to protect you, James.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.951 position:24% line:89% align:start
Really? Why's that?

00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:31.586 position:30% line:89% align:start
[RIBBON barks]

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.921 position:7% line:83% align:start
As evidenced by my friend here,
I can summon demons.

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:35.790 position:13% line:83% align:start
At the bare minimum, this
should be more than enough

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:37.558 position:27% line:83% align:start
to prove I'm not
aligned with the church

00:02:37.692 --> 00:02:39.894 position:27% line:83% align:start
that's currently
hunting you down.

00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:45.265 position:16% line:83% align:start
See, I came here looking
for a demon, named Ashtarte.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.502 position:19% line:83% align:start
I imagine you've heard
of him, haven't you?

00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:52.172 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, of course I've heard
of him. I am him.

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.407 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.109 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
I was born half-demon.

00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:57.145 position:10% line:89% align:start
No one at the academy knows.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:03:00.581 position:24% line:83% align:start
Not even the other
student council members.

00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:04.552 position:10% line:83% align:start
My father is the one who gave
me the demon name Ashtarte.

00:03:04.686 --> 00:03:07.354 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I abandoned it long ago.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.691 position:5% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] I'm pretty sure I don't
remember that lore being

00:03:09.824 --> 00:03:10.992 position:33% line:89% align:start
in the game.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:12.426 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.260 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're using your name,
but you're not committing

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.327 position:33% line:89% align:start
the attacks.

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:15.930 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why would they do such a thing?

00:03:16.064 --> 00:03:17.598 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who can say?

00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:19.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
Most likely so that the true
villain can easily frame me

00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:21.401 position:30% line:89% align:start
as the culprit.

00:03:22.837 --> 00:03:25.673 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you don't mind, would you
send your demon away?

00:03:25.807 --> 00:03:29.409 position:10% line:83% align:start
It would be a catastrophe if
someone saw it here with us.

00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:31.244 position:19% line:83% align:start
And you need to be more
careful when running up

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:32.947 position:16% line:89% align:start
to strangers, little one.

00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:35.817 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm not as much like you
as my odor might suggest.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.558 position:16% line:89% align:start
You remind me of someone.

00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:46.027 position:13% line:89% align:start
Someone I care for deeply.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.562 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, thank you?

00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:50.263 position:19% line:83% align:start
The point is, I will do
my best to protect you.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.265 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I'll need your help,
and you can start by

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.035 position:27% line:83% align:start
not reporting me
to the director.

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:55.036 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can't do that.

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.336 position:38% line:89% align:start
Too bad.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.337 position:33% line:83% align:start
In that case,
come back now, Ri--

00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:58.773 position:24% line:89% align:start
Enough, I concede!

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:00.373 position:19% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't use your
friend as a shield!

00:04:00.508 --> 00:04:01.909 position:33% line:89% align:start
How cowardly.

00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:05.747 position:19% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE] And what about
the demons in the city?

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.281 position:16% line:83% align:start
[BELZEBUTH] They've been
instructed to evacuate the area.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.717 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Excellent.

00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:11.586 position:16% line:83% align:start
Keep an eye out for those
more easily corruptible.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.721 position:21% line:83% align:start
We can't let Ashtarte
get to them.

00:04:13.855 --> 00:04:15.489 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KEITH] Belzebuth and I are
going to start patrolling

00:04:15.623 --> 00:04:17.892 position:5% line:89% align:start
the surrounding areas tomorrow.

00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:19.594 position:19% line:83% align:start
I believe it's for the
best if you remain

00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:21.028 position:10% line:89% align:start
right where you are, my lord.

00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:22.630 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, I agree.

00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:26.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
The sheer vastness of this
land is most inconvenient.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.368 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's so lonely.

00:04:28.503 --> 00:04:29.804 position:24% line:89% align:start
You must stay here.

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:31.172 position:16% line:83% align:start
The students will want to
see you at this festival

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.840 position:13% line:89% align:start
we've heard so much about.

00:04:32.974 --> 00:04:36.944 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know, I'm hoping I can
make some friends there.

00:04:37.078 --> 00:04:39.180 position:16% line:83% align:start
In my entire life, I have
never made a friend,

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:43.050 position:27% line:83% align:start
and I would very
much like to try it.

00:04:43.184 --> 00:04:45.853 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll do whatever I can to aid
in your quest, my lord.

00:04:45.987 --> 00:04:47.255 position:27% line:89% align:start
A splendid idea.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.590 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's discuss the ways you
could introduce yourself.

00:04:49.724 --> 00:04:51.058 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hello, there. I'm Lord Claude,

00:04:51.192 --> 00:04:53.426 position:21% line:83% align:start
director, demon lord,
and ruler of you all!

00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:55.295 position:13% line:89% align:start
Power might be imbalanced.

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:58.132 position:7% line:83% align:start
Is the intense pressure of your
position weighing on you?

00:04:58.266 --> 00:05:00.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's not that complex,
I would simply like to have

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:01.969 position:30% line:89% align:start
a few friends.

00:05:02.103 --> 00:05:03.838 position:13% line:83% align:start
Can't you see how badly our
lord craves companions?

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.207 position:16% line:83% align:start
You should go and prepare
some immediately.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.776 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid friends aren't
something you can "prepare"

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.244 position:27% line:89% align:start
for someone else.

00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:13.181 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's right. Luckily, I know
an expert in such matters.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.883 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll have to ask my darling
Aileen for her advice.

00:05:16.017 --> 00:05:17.618 position:27% line:83% align:start
With a woman like
her by my side,

00:05:17.752 --> 00:05:19.520 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can embrace the
aspects of my humanity

00:05:19.654 --> 00:05:22.023 position:24% line:83% align:start
that I kept hidden
for far too long.

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:23.524 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KEITH]
Hear me! Please!

00:05:23.658 --> 00:05:25.726 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's an esteemed school,
not a social club!

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.662 position:19% line:83% align:start
You have your position
to think about, my lord,

00:05:27.795 --> 00:05:30.598 position:19% line:83% align:start
so please, save making
friends for another time.

00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.066 position:38% line:89% align:start
But why?

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.868 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KEITH] Because it isn't right
that while we two are hard

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.137 position:7% line:83% align:start
at work, our leader is busy at
the playground making

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.370 position:30% line:89% align:start
little friends.

00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:40.675 position:27% line:89% align:start
[thunder crashes]

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:53.621 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Security force!

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:55.690 position:24% line:83% align:start
That pipe violates
school regulations!

00:05:55.823 --> 00:05:57.825 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't be a stick in the mud,
it's a festival!

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:00.194 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
Hand it over now.

00:06:00.328 --> 00:06:01.629 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT A]
Fine.

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.234 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
It's not demon incense.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.837 position:10% line:83% align:start
Let's confiscate it and be on
our way, Ja--I mean, Blue.

00:06:09.971 --> 00:06:12.340 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JAMES] I've never felt
so foolish in my life.

00:06:13.174 --> 00:06:15.910 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Lord Claude seemed
fixated on the duck costume.

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:18.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
Where better to hide
than in plain sight?

00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.516 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
Red! Blue!

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.285 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Augu-- I mean Pink.

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:25.786 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's no time to amble about!

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.255 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's an entry deadline.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.156 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
Huh? It's already time?!

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.758 position:30% line:89% align:start
I've gotta fly!

00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:36.330 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] There's more external
entries than I anticipated.

00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:38.199 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you think Auguste
can best them?

00:06:38.332 --> 00:06:39.300 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
He'll do well.

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:41.235 position:10% line:89% align:start
He has more muscle than mind.

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:42.603 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Thank goodness.

00:06:42.737 --> 00:06:44.605 position:16% line:83% align:start
It appears they're still
accepting entries.

00:06:46.908 --> 00:06:47.909 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
The demon lord?

00:06:48.042 --> 00:06:49.744 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
What? Lord Claude?!

00:06:49.877 --> 00:06:51.812 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wow. You've got yourself
a whole flock.

00:06:51.946 --> 00:06:53.247 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
I'm signed up and ready!

00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:55.516 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? The director?

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.684 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
You're mistaken.

00:06:56.817 --> 00:06:58.586 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, my apologies, demon lord.

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:00.821 position:24% line:83% align:start
Though we look the
same, I am not he.

00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:02.056 position:27% line:89% align:start
For I am no one.

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.759 position:16% line:83% align:start
A lowly traveler passing
through with the wind.

00:07:04.892 --> 00:07:08.095 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ah! So you're working undercover
as an ordinary person!

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:09.030 position:38% line:89% align:start
I get it!

00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:10.430 position:38% line:89% align:start
Correct.

00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:12.333 position:16% line:83% align:start
That sounds like an idea
Keith would get behind.

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:14.802 position:13% line:89% align:start
Therefore, I'll go with it.

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:16.671 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
Dressed like that?

00:07:16.804 --> 00:07:19.173 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] He's totally here
for play and not work!

00:07:19.307 --> 00:07:21.742 position:10% line:83% align:start
This swordsmanship tournament
has piqued my interest.

00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:23.544 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do either of you know
how I might enter?

00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:26.080 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yes! I can show
you how to sign up.

00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:28.849 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can also show you where
to find the best food stalls.

[JAMES]
Enter first and then eat.

00:07:30.718 --> 00:07:32.286 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're running low on time.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.855 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Could you not have
figured that out yourself, love?

00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:38.159 position:13% line:83% align:start
Or is forcing teenage boys
to play "mommy" a must?

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.096 position:33% line:83% align:start
He's staring!
He's absolutely staring!

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:43.664 position:38% line:89% align:start
It's you.

00:07:43.798 --> 00:07:46.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
The peculiar little duck who
came to get my signature.

00:07:55.743 --> 00:07:58.212 position:13% line:83% align:start
Since our first encounter,
my curiosity about you

00:07:58.346 --> 00:07:59.714 position:16% line:89% align:start
has been running rampant.

00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:02.616 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] You know, this
would be incredibly sexy

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.353 position:10% line:89% align:start
if I wasn't a freakin' duck!

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.221 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why dost thou run, duck?

[AILEEN squealing]

00:08:10.424 --> 00:08:11.592 position:30% line:89% align:start
Lowly traveler?

00:08:11.726 --> 00:08:13.294 position:30% line:83% align:start
You better get
your entry in soon.

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:14.929 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Right. Of course.

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:22.903 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AILEEN sighs]

00:08:24.605 --> 00:08:26.207 position:24% line:89% align:start
At the very least,

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.243 position:10% line:83% align:start
it's good to see he's out and
about having fun with humans.

00:08:29.377 --> 00:08:30.878 position:44% line:89% align:start
Heh.

00:08:31.012 --> 00:08:33.481 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just wish I could've
explored the festival with him.

00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:35.116 position:41% line:83% align:start
[WALT]
Red! Problem!

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:39.854 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KYLE] We've just received
instruction from the church

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:42.390 position:13% line:83% align:start
to hunt down the academy's
demon no matter the cost.

00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:44.992 position:7% line:83% align:start
They've already spread incense
about the tournament grounds,

00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:47.461 position:21% line:83% align:start
hoping to force the
beast out of hiding.

00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:50.097 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's concealed in the
lanterns at the four corners

00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:51.198 position:33% line:89% align:start
of the arena.

00:08:51.332 --> 00:08:53.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
Once they're lit,
the incense will spread,

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:56.103 position:19% line:83% align:start
breaching the lungs of
everyone in the room.

00:08:56.237 --> 00:08:57.371 position:35% line:89% align:start
Trouble is,

00:08:57.506 --> 00:08:59.140 position:24% line:83% align:start
if we remove them,
we'll be labeled traitors,

00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:00.775 position:13% line:83% align:start
and in a matter of moments,
the church's assassins

00:09:00.908 --> 00:09:03.477 position:21% line:83% align:start
will be on our tails
to get rid of us.

00:09:03.611 --> 00:09:05.179 position:27% line:83% align:start
We just heard the
director is entering the

00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:07.014 position:16% line:89% align:start
swordsmanship tournament.

00:09:07.148 --> 00:09:09.650 position:21% line:83% align:start
If he's exposed to a
high volume of incense,

00:09:09.784 --> 00:09:11.886 position:24% line:83% align:start
he could transform
into a dragon.

00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:15.723 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KYLE] It won't just be
the academy at risk.

00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:17.858 position:24% line:83% align:start
The entire country
will be in danger.

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:20.661 position:30% line:89% align:start
We must think.

00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:22.163 position:24% line:83% align:start
How can we convince
Lord Claude to withdraw

00:09:22.296 --> 00:09:23.597 position:21% line:89% align:start
from the tournament?

00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:25.166 position:16% line:83% align:start
The fact that he made it
through the preliminaries

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:27.502 position:21% line:83% align:start
without any magic and
only using his left hand

00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:29.003 position:30% line:89% align:start
was a miracle.

00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:30.738 position:19% line:83% align:start
I seriously doubt he'll
progress much further

00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:32.373 position:10% line:89% align:start
with such a massive handicap.

00:09:32.507 --> 00:09:35.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
False! It'd be impossible for my
brave Lord Claude to lose!

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:37.478 position:13% line:89% align:start
I need you to think harder!

00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:38.913 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, spare me the love.

00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:42.083 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, I suppose there is
a more involved method.

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:43.217 position:41% line:89% align:start
Go on!

00:09:45.386 --> 00:09:47.721 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC] Luc has been
developing a sleeping potion.

00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:49.690 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's potent enough to
work on the demon lord,

00:09:49.824 --> 00:09:51.459 position:27% line:89% align:start
human or dragon.

00:09:51.592 --> 00:09:54.895 position:5% line:83% align:start
While the tournament rages on,
my love could sleep peacefully.

00:10:00.201 --> 00:10:01.168 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here. Try.

00:10:01.302 --> 00:10:02.703 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is the most
refreshing of waters,

00:10:02.837 --> 00:10:04.772 position:24% line:83% align:start
drawn straight from
our local well.

00:10:04.905 --> 00:10:06.607 position:21% line:89% align:start
I look forward to it.

00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:13.515 position:19% line:83% align:start
[RACHEL] Oh, and best
of luck in the finals.

00:10:13.647 --> 00:10:15.015 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Thank you.

00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:23.257 position:27% line:83% align:start
I should rest for
a moment or two.

00:10:27.428 --> 00:10:28.929 position:27% line:89% align:start
[AILEEN chuckles]

00:10:29.063 --> 00:10:31.098 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] If he can just stay
asleep, we can prevent him

00:10:31.232 --> 00:10:33.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
from going dragon mode
and James from becoming

00:10:33.535 --> 00:10:35.537 position:30% line:89% align:start
the final boss!

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:38.639 position:7% line:83% align:start
The Grand Duchy will be saved,
and Aileen d'Autriche

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:41.041 position:19% line:83% align:start
will evade yet another
unfortunate end!

00:10:41.175 --> 00:10:43.077 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SELENA]
You in there, Lord Claude?

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.447 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lord Claude?

00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:48.149 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're ready for you.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.918 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hush, Selena,
I'm not Lord Claude,

00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:52.253 position:21% line:89% align:start
but an ordinary man.

00:10:52.386 --> 00:10:55.590 position:27% line:83% align:start
For now, you can
call me Sir Black.

00:10:55.723 --> 00:10:57.291 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
The peak of creativity!

00:10:57.424 --> 00:11:00.661 position:13% line:83% align:start
More importantly, why isn't
the potion working?

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:02.296 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, Sir Black.

00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:04.398 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did you ever have a chance
to try those cookies I made

00:11:04.533 --> 00:11:05.534 position:24% line:89% align:start
especially for you?

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:06.734 position:41% line:89% align:start
I did.

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:08.002 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, great.

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:10.037 position:33% line:83% align:start
So, tell me,
how are you feeling?

00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:12.106 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Huh? The she-devil.

00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:18.312 position:10% line:89% align:start
I bet she used a love potion!

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:20.948 position:10% line:83% align:start
That must be what's throwing
off Luc's sleeping drug.

00:11:21.081 --> 00:11:22.449 position:19% line:89% align:start
I feel quite all right.

00:11:22.584 --> 00:11:24.418 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, well that's good to hear.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:29.890 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Sorry, Lord Claude.

00:11:30.024 --> 00:11:32.193 position:27% line:83% align:start

no other choice.

It's him against the demon lord.

You insulted my beloved fiancÃ©e.

A simple apology
isn't going to save you!

Quite the unsteady sword.

00:14:22.797 --> 00:14:24.965 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Yikes! Oh, gosh!

00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:37.344 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
No way! We did it!

00:14:38.479 --> 00:14:39.614 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh.

00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:53.093 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AUGUSTE yells]

00:14:54.729 --> 00:14:56.664 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now, Red! Get to safety!

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:06.708 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
What in the world is going on?

00:15:06.841 --> 00:15:09.009 position:16% line:83% align:start
[WALT] We're doing a show
to excite the audience!

00:15:09.143 --> 00:15:11.746 position:13% line:83% align:start
We wanted to show them full
strength of the security force.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.716 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KYLE] Apologies for dragging
you into it, director!

00:15:14.849 --> 00:15:17.619 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, you insulted my precious
fiancÃ©e for nothing more

00:15:17.752 --> 00:15:19.486 position:19% line:89% align:start
than a cheap spectacle?

00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:22.690 position:13% line:89% align:start
Red duck was the cruelest.

00:15:22.824 --> 00:15:24.659 position:5% line:89% align:start
Such foul behavior cannot slide.

00:15:24.793 --> 00:15:27.227 position:30% line:83% align:start
I will not stop
until it's in pieces.

00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:28.962 position:5% line:89% align:start
And a note for the rest of you.

00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:31.265 position:24% line:83% align:start
Apologies behind a
mask aren't sincere.

00:15:31.398 --> 00:15:33.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
[WALT] Yes, sir.
You're absolutely right.

00:15:39.674 --> 00:15:40.608 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
This is bad.

00:15:40.742 --> 00:15:42.577 position:13% line:89% align:start
Unfortunate-end-level bad!

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.246 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KEITH] I respect you, my lord,
but I don't understand you!

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.049 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hi, Keith.
You're back quite early.

00:15:49.183 --> 00:15:50.652 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KEITH]
Well, you see.

00:15:50.785 --> 00:15:53.387 position:10% line:83% align:start
We heard that a certain demon
lord was causing a ruckus

00:15:53.521 --> 00:15:56.658 position:21% line:83% align:start
and flew here as fast
as we could. Literally.

00:15:56.791 --> 00:15:58.158 position:35% line:83% align:start
[BELZEBUTH]
Indeed.

00:15:58.292 --> 00:15:59.594 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's more, we were able
to complete your orders

00:15:59.727 --> 00:16:00.994 position:30% line:89% align:start
first, my lord.

00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:02.162 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you're the
cause of this mess.

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:03.698 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did you try to make friends?

00:16:03.832 --> 00:16:05.265 position:13% line:89% align:start
I knew that would backfire!

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:06.967 position:19% line:83% align:start
I might've contributed,
but I'm far from the cause

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.368 position:30% line:89% align:start
of this mayhem.

00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:10.772 position:24% line:83% align:start
Playing accomplice
to chaos is no prize!

00:16:10.905 --> 00:16:12.105 position:21% line:89% align:start
You shouldn't be mad.

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:13.842 position:30% line:83% align:start
I happened upon
a surprise for you.

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:17.311 position:5% line:83% align:start
The men littered about the floor
are agents of the church.

00:16:17.444 --> 00:16:18.445 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.381 position:21% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE] They planted
something in the lanterns.

00:16:21.516 --> 00:16:23.551 position:27% line:83% align:start
Collect them and
find out what's inside.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.591 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] He noticed the
demon incense? When?

00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:33.828 position:19% line:83% align:start
I thoroughly apologize
for any trouble our lord

00:16:33.962 --> 00:16:35.262 position:24% line:89% align:start
might have caused.

00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:37.064 position:16% line:83% align:start
I will see to it that he
maintains a safe distance

00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:39.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
from the remainder of
your festival activities.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.670 position:27% line:83% align:start
Wait, what about
the final match?

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:45.807 position:24% line:89% align:start
You won, young man.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.442 position:16% line:83% align:start
More accurately, you won
against my left hand, but...

00:16:48.576 --> 00:16:50.879 position:35% line:83% align:start
Good work.
You're the winner nonetheless.

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:53.013 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wait, really? I am?

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:55.182 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd like to challenge
you again someday.

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:58.018 position:16% line:89% align:start
Next time as your friend.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.387 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'd love nothing more!

00:17:04.893 --> 00:17:05.960 position:38% line:83% align:start
[WOMAN C]
It's magic!

00:17:06.093 --> 00:17:07.094 position:38% line:83% align:start
[WOMAN D]
Well, this is a first!

00:17:07.227 --> 00:17:08.362 position:38% line:83% align:start
[WOMAN E]
Wow!

00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:09.864 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:17:09.998 --> 00:17:11.265 position:27% line:83% align:start
And the next time
our paths cross,

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:13.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll find out who
you truly are, duck.

00:17:20.942 --> 00:17:23.778 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] With that, the first
day of the school festival

00:17:23.912 --> 00:17:25.580 position:27% line:89% align:start
is in the books.

00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:27.916 position:19% line:83% align:start
The church stepped back
from the academy after that,

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:30.417 position:13% line:83% align:start
but we still couldn't find
the Ashtarte faker.

00:17:30.552 --> 00:17:33.153 position:19% line:83% align:start
Or where all the demon
incense was coming from.

00:17:33.287 --> 00:17:36.189 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] The prize for becoming
princess is demon incense?

00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:37.525 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC]
Correct.

00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:39.027 position:30% line:83% align:start
Jasper received
the information from

00:17:39.159 --> 00:17:41.796 position:24% line:83% align:start
an anonymous letter
to his newspaper.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.196 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
Wow, Ailey.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.666 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your secret organization
even has connections

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:47.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
to the press?!
You're the real deal!

00:17:47.569 --> 00:17:49.136 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KYLE] After being foiled
at the tournament,

00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:50.838 position:10% line:89% align:start
they would dare try the ball?

00:17:50.972 --> 00:17:53.041 position:10% line:83% align:start
[WALT] We'll have to confirm
the prize to know for certain.

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:54.509 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
It's being heavily guarded.

00:17:54.642 --> 00:17:56.476 position:16% line:83% align:start
The guardian association
has a tight watch

00:17:56.611 --> 00:17:58.478 position:27% line:83% align:start
on everything to
do with the ball.

00:17:58.613 --> 00:18:00.782 position:21% line:83% align:start
Frankly, I'm at a bit
of a loss here.

00:18:02.917 --> 00:18:06.453 position:10% line:83% align:start
[RACHEL] Um, I could take the
lead on this investigation.

00:18:06.588 --> 00:18:08.556 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can try to become
the White Lily Princess.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.758 position:7% line:89% align:start
That way we can get the prize.

00:18:10.892 --> 00:18:11.726 position:35% line:89% align:start
Brilliant!

00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:13.226 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sure you can handle that?

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.996 position:27% line:83% align:start
We can't have you
fainting from stage fright

00:18:15.128 --> 00:18:16.363 position:19% line:89% align:start
and losing this for us.

00:18:16.496 --> 00:18:18.231 position:38% line:83% align:start
[RACHEL]
Yes. I can do it!

00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:19.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE] Word is that
Rachel has the best chance

00:18:20.068 --> 00:18:21.002 position:30% line:89% align:start
to beat Selena.

00:18:21.134 --> 00:18:22.336 position:21% line:89% align:start
I say she's got this.

00:18:22.469 --> 00:18:23.938 position:33% line:83% align:start
Sounds like a
plausible plan to me.

00:18:24.072 --> 00:18:25.707 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't have any
objections to it.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.141 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, neither do I.

00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:30.511 position:35% line:83% align:start
Well, fine.
Our plan it shall be.

00:18:30.645 --> 00:18:33.146 position:13% line:83% align:start
Great, I guess I should go
and prepare my dress now.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.716 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:18:34.849 --> 00:18:37.619 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's right. I sold my dress;
I completely forgot.

00:18:37.752 --> 00:18:38.653 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not an issue.

00:18:38.786 --> 00:18:40.354 position:24% line:83% align:start
We still have time
before the ball.

00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:42.456 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why don't you go pick
out a gown with Isaac?

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why me? I'm far from a stylist.

00:18:45.258 --> 00:18:46.561 position:33% line:89% align:start
I trust you.

00:18:46.694 --> 00:18:49.229 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right, fine then. Let's go.

00:18:51.866 --> 00:18:53.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, run along.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.770 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey! I'm coming, wait for me!

00:18:59.507 --> 00:19:01.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] I can't believe they're
going to give the princess

00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:02.810 position:30% line:89% align:start
demon incense.

00:19:02.944 --> 00:19:05.345 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's certainly not how
it was in the game.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.950 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:19:09.083 --> 00:19:11.919 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sorry for the wait.
It's tough to put on.

00:19:12.053 --> 00:19:13.855 position:10% line:83% align:start
Isaac thought that it would
be best to go with something

00:19:13.988 --> 00:19:16.156 position:21% line:83% align:start
a little showier than
my usual style.

00:19:16.289 --> 00:19:18.626 position:27% line:83% align:start
Agreed. You look
incredible, Rachel.

00:19:20.094 --> 00:19:21.361 position:30% line:89% align:start
I've got this!

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:23.097 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's hard to tell,
but I'll have you know

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
that my etiquette and social
skills are actually top notch!

00:19:26.868 --> 00:19:29.704 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's the perfect chance to
prove myself to Sir Isaac.

00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:31.773 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you do end up
White Lily Princess,

00:19:31.906 --> 00:19:34.509 position:10% line:83% align:start
do you think you'll ask Isaac
to be your dance partner?

00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:37.979 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:19:38.112 --> 00:19:41.549 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm quite curious why he
would be your choice.

00:19:41.683 --> 00:19:43.751 position:16% line:83% align:start
When I suggested breaking
off the engagement,

00:19:43.885 --> 00:19:46.353 position:13% line:83% align:start
my parents were against it,
my fiancÃ© was irate,

00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:48.488 position:21% line:83% align:start
and it seemed no one
was on my side.

00:19:48.623 --> 00:19:50.257 position:27% line:83% align:start
The way everybody
was talking about it

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.459 position:27% line:83% align:start
made me question
my decision entirely.

00:19:52.593 --> 00:19:54.595 position:10% line:83% align:start
But then Isaac said something
to me that let me know

00:19:54.729 --> 00:19:57.065 position:10% line:89% align:start
I was doing the right thing.

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.633 position:27% line:89% align:start
Exquisitely done.

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:03.638 position:30% line:83% align:start
Those couple of
words alone filled me

00:20:03.771 --> 00:20:05.740 position:5% line:89% align:start
with a newfound pride in myself.

00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:08.876 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's why I'm going go out
there and try my best today,

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:10.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
and why I won't lose to Selena.

00:20:11.012 --> 00:20:12.847 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] That's exactly
how I felt when I went to

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.615 position:30% line:89% align:start
CÃ©dric's ball.

00:20:14.749 --> 00:20:16.316 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SELENA]
Aw, would you look at that!

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.619 position:21% line:83% align:start
You decided to enter
the competition after all?

00:20:18.753 --> 00:20:21.254 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's right.
Guess I had a change of heart.

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:24.291 position:19% line:83% align:start
Lovely! Let's both try
our best then, yes?

00:20:26.861 --> 00:20:29.564 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your dress is stunning;
I love the material.

00:20:29.697 --> 00:20:30.932 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let me get a closer look.

00:20:31.065 --> 00:20:32.432 position:30% line:89% align:start
[RACHEL yells]

00:20:33.433 --> 00:20:34.769 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Rachel!

00:20:35.903 --> 00:20:37.872 position:27% line:89% align:start
I think I'm okay.

00:20:38.005 --> 00:20:40.273 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SELENA]
Oh, no, my poor dress is ruined!

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:41.776 position:24% line:89% align:start
[STUDENTS chatter]

00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:44.112 position:19% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT A] Lady Selena
fell down the stairs?

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:45.747 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT B]
Her dress got torn.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.915 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT C]
Right before the competition?

00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:49.917 position:13% line:83% align:start
[F STUDENT D] Do you think
one of them pushed her?

00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:51.052 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:52.186 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's fine.

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:53.588 position:33% line:89% align:start
But Rachel...

00:20:55.455 --> 00:20:57.859 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's okay, I know it
was just an accident.

00:20:57.992 --> 00:20:59.259 position:24% line:89% align:start
Unfortunate timing,

00:20:59.392 --> 00:21:01.629 position:21% line:83% align:start
but hopefully I can
still save my dress.

00:21:02.764 --> 00:21:04.232 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
That snake.

00:21:04.364 --> 00:21:06.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
How dare she endanger one
of my precious underlings,

00:21:06.868 --> 00:21:09.469 position:7% line:89% align:start
and over some stupid pageant?!

00:21:09.604 --> 00:21:12.372 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's still give it our all
today, fair and square!

00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:16.878 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC] Hey. What happened?
Are you okay?

00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:20.548 position:13% line:83% align:start
It was just a little fall.
I'm fine.

00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:22.216 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC]
You can barely stand up.

00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:23.518 position:13% line:89% align:start
You won't be able to dance.

00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:24.952 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why would you say that?

00:21:25.086 --> 00:21:26.821 position:16% line:89% align:start
I just told you I'm fine!

00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:31.225 position:30% line:83% align:start
Our plan as-is
won't reach fruition.

00:21:31.358 --> 00:21:32.693 position:41% line:89% align:start
But I--

00:21:36.097 --> 00:21:37.565 position:38% line:89% align:start
New idea.

00:21:37.698 --> 00:21:39.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
Would you mind lending me
your dress for a little while,

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:40.802 position:41% line:89% align:start
Rachel?

00:21:53.581 --> 00:21:54.749 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
Is he serious?

00:21:54.882 --> 00:21:57.317 position:5% line:89% align:start
Few have courage like our Ailey.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.821 position:30% line:83% align:start
Even fewer have
such dainty features.

00:22:02.657 --> 00:22:05.193 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GROUP]
Whoa.

00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:06.961 position:30% line:89% align:start
He's so pretty.

00:22:14.502 --> 00:22:15.603 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hi, gentlemen.

00:22:15.736 --> 00:22:17.370 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's nice to meet you.
