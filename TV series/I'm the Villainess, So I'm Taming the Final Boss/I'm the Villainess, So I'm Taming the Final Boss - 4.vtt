Have you forgotten you're human?

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:13.180 position:16% line:83% align:start
It'd be utterly senseless
to come with me.

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:19.988 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's my destiny to stand
by your side, my lord.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.422 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's the one place I belong.

00:00:22.557 --> 00:00:23.758 position:38% line:89% align:start

What a dream.

What peaceful

Lady Aileen?

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:49.249 position:33% line:89% align:start
Whoa, there.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.351 position:30% line:83% align:start
What brings you
outside of the barrier?

As if you don't know.

Sir Keith.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:57.959 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're hiding a despicable
truth from Lord Claude, yes?

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.761 position:10% line:89% align:start
Care to come clean, darling?

00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:36.090 position:21% line:83% align:start
I found myself rather
perturbed by how hush-hush

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:39.127 position:10% line:83% align:start
you remained when conducting
your embezzlement investigation.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.863 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thus, I did a little
digging of my own.

00:02:41.996 --> 00:02:44.197 position:24% line:83% align:start
Much to my dismay,
I imagine my secret selling

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:46.400 position:7% line:89% align:start
of demons is secret no longer.

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:51.506 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is that the contract
of sale for the land?

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.206 position:19% line:89% align:start
How did you acquire it?

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.309 position:13% line:83% align:start
I confess, I might've asked
Father to pull a few strings.

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:59.113 position:19% line:83% align:start
My situation is growing
dire, you know.

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:00.347 position:38% line:89% align:start
I don't.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.849 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, allow me to illustrate.

00:03:01.983 --> 00:03:04.519 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm certain you've heard
of Lady Lilia by now.

00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:11.759 position:24% line:83% align:start
While it's true her
Sword Maiden powers

00:03:11.893 --> 00:03:13.761 position:16% line:83% align:start
don't have any tremendous
effect on Lord Claude

00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:17.297 position:16% line:83% align:start
in his human form, if he
awakens to his demonic form,

00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:19.600 position:27% line:83% align:start
she'll be able to
conquer him with ease.

00:03:20.802 --> 00:03:23.905 position:16% line:83% align:start
According to the legend,
when the demon lord

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:26.473 position:21% line:83% align:start
can no longer stifle
his rage and anguish,

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:28.275 position:5% line:89% align:start
these feelings will consume him,

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.712 position:24% line:83% align:start
and he'll transform
into a dragon.

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:32.914 position:16% line:83% align:start
Can you pinpoint anything
mankind could do

00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:34.849 position:16% line:89% align:start
to trigger that reaction?

00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:36.784 position:30% line:89% align:start
Here's an idea:

00:03:36.918 --> 00:03:38.786 position:24% line:83% align:start
they prove his aide
betrayed him,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.689 position:16% line:83% align:start
which leads him to kill
the one he trusted most.

[AILEEN]
Keith Eigrid.

00:03:46.194 --> 00:03:48.261 position:10% line:83% align:start
He's been serving Lord Claude
since they were both

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.697 position:33% line:89% align:start
little kids.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
If it weren't for Lord Claude,

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:55.837 position:7% line:83% align:start
my flame would've been snuffed
to ash many years ago.

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:58.873 position:27% line:83% align:start
When I was around
five years old,

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.076 position:10% line:83% align:start
I slipped while playing near
the pond in the garden.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.979 position:16% line:89% align:start
I was sure I would drown.

00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:06.781 position:16% line:89% align:start
He could've abandoned me.

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:09.050 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was a lowly servant,
after all.

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:11.018 position:30% line:83% align:start
--[MAIDS gasp]
--[KEITH] But no.

00:04:11.152 --> 00:04:13.521 position:21% line:83% align:start
He risked using magic
in front of the others,

00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:16.356 position:21% line:89% align:start
and it saved my life.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.593 position:24% line:83% align:start
He had exposed his
powers as a demon lord

00:04:18.726 --> 00:04:22.697 position:21% line:83% align:start
and was banished from
the castle a few years later.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.298 position:16% line:83% align:start
Though humanity at large
wanted nothing to do with him,

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:28.368 position:21% line:83% align:start
I refused to let him
give up on mankind.

00:04:28.503 --> 00:04:30.805 position:19% line:83% align:start
I thought the day would
eventually come

00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:33.574 position:24% line:83% align:start
when the two forces
could live in harmony.

00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:36.476 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was incredibly naÃ¯ve
back in those days.

00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:40.413 position:30% line:83% align:start
I soon learned
mankind is horrid.

00:04:40.548 --> 00:04:42.049 position:5% line:89% align:start
You would kick him off the land?

00:04:42.183 --> 00:04:45.418 position:19% line:83% align:start
He bought it from you;
I've seen the contract!

00:04:45.553 --> 00:04:48.321 position:24% line:83% align:start
You must be the one
who signed my name.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.390 position:5% line:89% align:start
Forgery is a serious crime, boy!

00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:52.226 position:10% line:89% align:start
This won't be taken lightly.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.697 position:7% line:83% align:start
Those demons your master hoards
are worth a pretty penny.

00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:59.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sell me a few and
I'll let this slide.

00:05:03.171 --> 00:05:04.572 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KEITH]
It was wrong.

00:05:04.705 --> 00:05:06.707 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I have a human mind
only capable of foolish

00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:08.609 position:27% line:89% align:start
human decisions.

00:05:08.743 --> 00:05:10.745 position:16% line:83% align:start
Perhaps Lord Claude would
be happier as a demon

00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:13.514 position:27% line:83% align:start
than as a member
our loathsome kind.

00:05:18.953 --> 00:05:20.121 position:30% line:89% align:start
Listen, Keith.

00:05:20.254 --> 00:05:22.023 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your primary weakness
is that you suffer from

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:23.791 position:19% line:89% align:start
a lack of human allies.

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:25.325 position:33% line:89% align:start
Tis a shame.

00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:29.931 position:24% line:83% align:start
But perhaps you'll
find an ally in me.

[AILEEN] We're coming up
on a major plot point.

00:05:41.142 --> 00:05:44.545 position:16% line:83% align:start
The player character can
do serious damage here.

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:46.981 position:21% line:83% align:start
Lilia and CÃ©dric play
detective and investigate

00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:48.616 position:27% line:89% align:start
the demon trade.

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:50.918 position:24% line:83% align:start
They find out Keith
is behind it.

00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:54.021 position:21% line:83% align:start
And report the whole
thing to Lord Claude.

00:05:54.155 --> 00:05:56.423 position:27% line:83% align:start
They stake out to
catch Keith in the act,

00:05:56.557 --> 00:05:58.226 position:21% line:83% align:start
but find Lord Claude
took care of the issue

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.728 position:5% line:89% align:start
and murdered his closest friend.

00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:03.531 position:19% line:83% align:start
Overcome with emotion,
he turns into a dragon

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:06.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
and Lilia defeats him
with the holy sword.

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:08.970 position:24% line:83% align:start
And just like that,
it's game over.

00:06:09.737 --> 00:06:11.572 position:19% line:83% align:start
So first those spoiled
sadists break his heart

00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:14.008 position:19% line:83% align:start
and then his beautiful,
beautiful body?

00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:15.977 position:24% line:83% align:start
Who could've dreamt
up such a thing?!

I wish this were a joke.

But knowing you,
it's likely not,

00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:25.686 position:5% line:89% align:start
so let's devise a plan quickly.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.188 position:33% line:83% align:start
Once we solve
this small dilemma,

00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:29.724 position:24% line:83% align:start
the Oberon Company
will profit handsomely.

Worry yourselves not,
for I have a trump card!

Do you, now?

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:37.999 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes! It's me, trump card Keith!

00:06:38.132 --> 00:06:41.068 position:16% line:83% align:start
As of today, I am amongst
your underling ranks!

Underling?

00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:44.972 position:16% line:83% align:start
My lord trusts your lady
so much he loaned her

00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:47.308 position:24% line:83% align:start
my services without
asking a single question

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.776 position:30% line:89% align:start
before I left!

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.311 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hopefully the man won't
hurt himself trying

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.445 position:16% line:89% align:start
to locate the tea leaves!

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.582 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're still within his
barrier, aren't we?

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:56.817 position:30% line:83% align:start
The demon lord
surely heard that jab.

00:06:56.951 --> 00:06:58.786 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now, my gifted

without cluing you in.

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:31.319 position:13% line:89% align:start
Lilia felt you should know.

Your concern is unwarranted.

which I assure you we are not,

you should wait until the

I was lounging in the other

means the non-aggression pact

Fine! But don't you feel bad
for the innocent creatures

being treated like pawns?

As future empress, there are
worlds of self-improvement

[KEITH] Lord Claude, there's
something I must tell you.

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:54.969 position:30% line:89% align:start
Say your peace.

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:58.606 position:35% line:89% align:start
However...

00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:00.274 position:16% line:83% align:start
I would like to complete
the work lady Aileen

has tasked me with first,
if that's acceptable.

00:09:03.978 --> 00:09:06.714 position:21% line:83% align:start
I refuse to leave my

00:09:40.481 --> 00:09:41.949 position:33% line:89% align:start
That traitor.

00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:45.119 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's been selling our

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:47.054 position:13% line:83% align:start
All the demons volunteered
to be sold knowing

00:09:47.188 --> 00:09:50.291 position:10% line:83% align:start
they were playing a key role
in keeping their lord safe.

On top of that, Sir Keith
did all he could to ensure

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.063 position:16% line:83% align:start
the buyers would be good
to them after purchase.

[BELZEBUTH growls]
I know that.

00:10:02.703 --> 00:10:04.038 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm not your pet.

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:06.006 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think I know what's going on.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.209 position:13% line:83% align:start
Keith was shouldering this
massive burden on his own

00:10:08.342 --> 00:10:10.478 position:10% line:83% align:start
and it's left you questioning
your own contributions

00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:12.146 position:13% line:89% align:start
and utility to Lord Claude.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:15.683 position:38% line:83% align:start
Silence!
When will the petting cease?

00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:18.285 position:7% line:89% align:start
When you begin to feel better.

00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:20.087 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, then I feel great.

00:10:26.026 --> 00:10:28.262 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is exactly how it
goes down in the game.

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:31.165 position:21% line:83% align:start
Lady Lilia should be
hiding in those bushes.

00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:33.934 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait, she's not?!

quite the haul for me today!

00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:40.074 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KEITH] I heard a funny
story, Count Penne.

00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:43.043 position:13% line:83% align:start
It has to do with the land
you've long promised us.

00:10:43.177 --> 00:10:45.179 position:19% line:83% align:start
Apparently, you sold it

what you're talking about.

Then you must be getting
forgetful, old man.

between you and Duke d'Autriche

00:10:53.387 --> 00:10:55.055 position:21% line:89% align:start
with my own two eyes.

00:10:58.192 --> 00:11:00.895 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, I propose you hand
over that account book

Damn!

[KEITH] All right, Isaac.
I'm counting on you.

00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:52.413 position:19% line:83% align:start
It goes without saying
that demons can't outright

00:11:52.547 --> 00:11:54.114 position:30% line:89% align:start
attack humans.

00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:57.484 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hence the non-aggression pact's
painfully uncreative name.

anything that stops our demons

from digging holes and
accidentally dispersing

[HENCHMAN C sneezes]

00:12:20.808 --> 00:12:22.743 position:13% line:83% align:start

to do is hand them over

00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:24.478 position:30% line:89% align:start
to the knights.

00:12:24.613 --> 00:12:26.780 position:7% line:83% align:start

me repent for my crimes.

it had to come to this.

that's true, though this pain

isn't any indicator!

I would like to,

prove quite challenging.

A disparity in size this
monumental would make daily life

as husband and
