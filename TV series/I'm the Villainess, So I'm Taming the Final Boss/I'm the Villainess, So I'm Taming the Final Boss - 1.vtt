time Aileen forbade Lilia from

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:11.599 position:27% line:89% align:start
speaking to her?

00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:12.800 position:10% line:83% align:start

the second act of the game,

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:19.841 position:13% line:83% align:start
and one of the worst places
to be the villainess.

[AILEEN] Growing up, I lived an
ideal life as the youngest child

00:07:32.153 --> 00:07:33.521 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:36.157 position:7% line:89% align:start
However, because I was a girl,

and because I wasn't quite
as strong as my brothers,

No matter how hard I tried.

For the longest time,
I felt I had no worth.

00:07:48.803 --> 00:07:50.404 position:21% line:89% align:start
Then, I turned eight.

It was the first time
anyone believed that I could

00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:57.645 position:21% line:89% align:start
accomplish something.

00:07:57.778 --> 00:07:59.447 position:21% line:83% align:start
The idea of becoming

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.649 position:16% line:89% align:start
my every waking thought.

00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:04.685 position:19% line:83% align:start
I threw myself into my

she was better than everyone
else simply for being

the prince's fiancÃ©e.

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:16.197 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wonder if there was
more I could have done

worse over much less.

That doesn't explain why
you treated her injuries.

00:09:17.825 --> 00:09:19.427 position:21% line:83% align:start
The humans and demons
agreed to a truce

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.264 position:13% line:83% align:start
and he was brought here to
live in an abandoned castle.

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:25.966 position:21% line:83% align:start
Should his hatred for
humanity ever awaken him,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.469 position:16% line:83% align:start
he'll transform into the
final boss that kills Aileen

00:09:28.602 --> 00:09:30.004 position:33% line:89% align:start
in the game.

00:09:30.137 --> 00:09:32.573 position:24% line:83% align:start
To avoid that fate,
there's but one thing to do!

00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:34.675 position:5% line:89% align:start
My only desire is to marry you!

00:09:34.809 --> 00:09:36.710 position:13% line:89% align:start
I know I'll make you happy!

00:09:38.479 --> 00:09:40.081 position:24% line:89% align:start
Remove her at once.

00:09:41.682 --> 00:09:43.884 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, I would be delighted
to leave just as soon as you

00:09:44.018 --> 00:09:45.920 position:16% line:89% align:start
agree to our engagement!

00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:48.055 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
But I've only just met you!

00:09:48.189 --> 00:09:52.927 position:24% line:83% align:start
So how could you...
I... I mean...

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.263 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is it possible that
you're in love with me?

00:09:56.397 --> 00:09:57.932 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ah, no!

00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:01.168 position:5% line:83% align:start
[KEITH] Ah, excuse me, my lord,
could you dial back the tornado?

00:10:01.302 --> 00:10:03.204 position:27% line:83% align:start
You dare to make
such a request of me,

00:10:03.337 --> 00:10:05.773 position:24% line:83% align:start
mere moments after
CÃ©dric dissolved your--

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.278 position:33% line:89% align:start
Listen to me.

00:10:11.412 --> 00:10:13.414 position:19% line:83% align:start
I am more than aware of
how this might appear.

00:10:13.548 --> 00:10:16.917 position:10% line:83% align:start
But do you expect me to spend
my days crying over what I lost?

00:10:17.051 --> 00:10:19.720 position:13% line:83% align:start
I refuse to waste another
second of my precious life

00:10:19.854 --> 00:10:21.556 position:24% line:89% align:start
thinking about him!

00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:24.758 position:7% line:83% align:start
And that's why you're courting
a demon lord instead?

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:28.829 position:16% line:89% align:start
Court you? Why, my lord,

00:10:28.963 --> 00:10:30.364 position:19% line:83% align:start
if I was simply looking
to court you,

00:10:30.498 --> 00:10:31.966 position:27% line:89% align:start
I could easily--

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.740 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hope you'll forgive me
for appearing so disheveled.

00:10:39.874 --> 00:10:41.942 position:13% line:89% align:start
I will return another time.

00:10:42.076 --> 00:10:43.878 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
There is no need for that.

00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:53.087 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now you have no reason
to return at all.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.155 position:35% line:89% align:start
So go away.

00:10:54.288 --> 00:10:56.056 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
I'll treasure this forever!

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.158 position:38% line:89% align:start
[squeals]

00:10:57.291 --> 00:11:00.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've always wanted
a magical dress!

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:02.730 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's so lovely!

00:11:07.134 --> 00:11:09.203 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Did you just cast another spell?

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:11.338 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KEITH chuckles]

00:11:11.472 --> 00:11:13.374 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Be gone!

00:11:23.317 --> 00:11:25.753 position:24% line:83% align:start
Using magic to send
me back home...

00:11:26.954 --> 00:11:28.422 position:24% line:89% align:start
You win this time.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.724 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RUDOLPH] I'm glad to see
you're looking well,

00:11:30.858 --> 00:11:33.160 position:16% line:89% align:start
given the circumstances.

00:11:33.294 --> 00:11:36.531 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's a shame this
is out of our control.

00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:38.132 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
He's already given up!

00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:39.900 position:5% line:83% align:start
As the Emperor's prime minister,
I figured he'd at least

00:11:40.034 --> 00:11:42.937 position:30% line:89% align:start
try to help me!

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.705 position:38% line:83% align:start
[RUDOLPH]
You've received an invitation.

00:11:44.838 --> 00:11:47.308 position:24% line:83% align:start
From Prince CÃ©dric
and the Lady Lilia.

00:11:50.945 --> 00:11:52.846 position:30% line:83% align:start
In two months,
they intend to hold a ball

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.316 position:16% line:83% align:start
where they will formally
announce their engagement.

00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:57.218 position:16% line:83% align:start
It seems they would like
you to sign the nullification

00:11:57.351 --> 00:12:00.655 position:27% line:83% align:start
of your previous
engagement at that time.

00:12:00.788 --> 00:12:02.223 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Would they, now?

00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:04.925 position:19% line:83% align:start
He wants an even larger
audience for my rejection?

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:06.994 position:24% line:89% align:start
It would appear so.

00:12:07.127 --> 00:12:09.430 position:21% line:83% align:start
Though Lady Lilia was
polite enough to include

00:12:09.564 --> 00:12:12.534 position:10% line:89% align:start
a letter of her own as well.

00:12:12.667 --> 00:12:14.902 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Then I suppose I'll go.

00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:16.370 position:5% line:89% align:start
If they're looking for a fight,

00:12:16.504 --> 00:12:19.139 position:19% line:83% align:start
it would be my pleasure
to oblige them.

00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:21.942 position:21% line:89% align:start
No turning back now.

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:24.478 position:24% line:83% align:start
I have to win over
Lord Claude no matter what!

00:12:28.115 --> 00:12:31.051 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait, what? How have I been
going in circles all day?

00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:33.854 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me that's
how magical barriers work!

00:12:36.857 --> 00:12:39.226 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, dear!
It's such a shame!

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.496 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess I brought these
cookies with me for nothing!

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.967 position:38% line:89% align:start
This too!

00:12:48.969 --> 00:12:51.573 position:16% line:83% align:start
Servants deserve the same
dignity as their master.

00:12:51.706 --> 00:12:53.374 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I have brought this
bow with me as a gift

00:12:53.508 --> 00:12:56.310 position:27% line:83% align:start
for whoever might
speak on my behalf.

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:59.514 position:16% line:83% align:start
Think of it as the symbol
of the gatekeeper.

00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:03.817 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ALMOND] "Symbol of the
gatekeeper" you say?

00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:07.421 position:27% line:89% align:start
[caws] You there!

00:13:07.555 --> 00:13:10.525 position:24% line:83% align:start
The only one worthy
of that symbol is me!

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:18.832 position:5% line:89% align:start
My, my! Don't you look handsome?

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:20.769 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please, feel free to help
yourself to one of these

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:22.202 position:38% line:89% align:start
as well.

00:13:24.138 --> 00:13:26.006 position:5% line:89% align:start
I always loved almonds! Delic--

00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:30.244 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, dear.

00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:38.352 position:27% line:89% align:start
What did you do?

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:41.155 position:16% line:83% align:start
I had that cookie infused
with an anesthetic.

00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:44.224 position:24% line:83% align:start
What a fool you are
for trusting a human.

00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:46.093 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now face the consequences!

00:13:46.226 --> 00:13:48.763 position:30% line:83% align:start
Since when have
humans been this scary?

00:13:48.896 --> 00:13:51.231 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hear me now, Lord Claude.
Show yourself!

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:53.000 position:7% line:89% align:start
If you refuse to meet with me,

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:55.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll strip your gatekeeper bald,
one feather at a time!

00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:58.105 position:24% line:89% align:start
Did she say bald?!

00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:09.350 position:27% line:83% align:start
Lovely to see you
again, Lord Claude!

00:14:09.483 --> 00:14:12.486 position:10% line:83% align:start
Would you care to revive your
servant before we proceed?

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:19.293 position:38% line:89% align:start
Go away!

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:21.028 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you ever come
back, I'll kill you!

00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:23.598 position:13% line:83% align:start
That was simply payback for
your rudeness yesterday!

00:14:23.732 --> 00:14:25.232 position:21% line:89% align:start
Consider us even now.

00:14:28.536 --> 00:14:30.739 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nope! I won't fall
for that again!

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:32.206 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's safe, I promise.

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:35.442 position:19% line:83% align:start
I only added anesthetic
to the almond ones.

00:14:42.851 --> 00:14:44.184 position:16% line:89% align:start
She's telling the truth.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.690 position:10% line:89% align:start
Delicious! I love chocolate!

00:14:48.823 --> 00:14:51.358 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] What shall we do?
Perhaps we could head inside.

00:14:51.492 --> 00:14:53.628 position:27% line:83% align:start
Wait, did you add
something to that cookie?

00:14:53.762 --> 00:14:55.195 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why, yes.

00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:57.030 position:13% line:83% align:start
Nothing bad, just a little
something I hoped might

00:14:57.164 --> 00:14:58.932 position:13% line:89% align:start
change your mind about me.

00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:00.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
A love potion.

00:15:02.604 --> 00:15:07.074 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KEITH laughs]

00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:08.810 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're absolutely ridiculous.

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:11.445 position:7% line:83% align:start
I just received word that I've
been invited to attend a ball

00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:12.881 position:21% line:89% align:start
two months from now.

00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:15.416 position:10% line:83% align:start
And I was hoping that I might
be able to persuade you

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.684 position:33% line:89% align:start
to escort me.

00:15:16.818 --> 00:15:18.318 position:16% line:83% align:start
What does the love potion
have to do with that?

00:15:18.452 --> 00:15:20.287 position:21% line:83% align:start
After the outcome of
our previous meeting,

00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:22.757 position:16% line:83% align:start
I assumed that you would
turn me down without it.

00:15:22.891 --> 00:15:25.058 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was going for a fait accompli.

00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:27.494 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ALMOND] Demon Lord!
We've got a problem!

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:30.497 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hello again, Almond!

00:15:30.632 --> 00:15:32.734 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ALMOND]
Don't call me that, it's stupid!

00:15:32.867 --> 00:15:33.934 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Ignore her.

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.035 position:30% line:89% align:start
What happened?

00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:36.604 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's the fenrir cub, my lord!

00:15:36.738 --> 00:15:38.338 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's not in the forest!

00:15:40.675 --> 00:15:42.409 position:13% line:83% align:start
It appears to have escaped
from the second floor

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:46.180 position:13% line:83% align:start
to the east and has already
made it past the barrier.

00:15:46.313 --> 00:15:48.415 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you think it could be
headed for the school?

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:52.821 position:21% line:83% align:start
What if the students
get their hands on it?

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:54.388 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll retrieve it at once.

00:15:54.522 --> 00:15:56.290 position:16% line:83% align:start
But if any humans were to
see you it would only serve

00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:59.026 position:30% line:83% align:start
to escalate the
situation even further.

00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:00.628 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Allow me to help.

00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:06.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm familiar with
the school's territory,

00:16:06.768 --> 00:16:08.837 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I should be able
to locate it quickly.

00:16:08.969 --> 00:16:11.138 position:27% line:83% align:start
It may be a cub,
but it's still a fenrir.

00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:13.474 position:16% line:83% align:start
It'll tear you to pieces
in an instant.

00:16:16.511 --> 00:16:18.947 position:24% line:83% align:start
If that's the case,
please allow me to take this.

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:22.449 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your scent might have a
calming effect on the creature.

00:16:22.584 --> 00:16:25.787 position:10% line:83% align:start
Good thought, but what reason
do you have to aid me?

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.455 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't help but feel
sorry for the poor thing,

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:31.526 position:10% line:83% align:start
