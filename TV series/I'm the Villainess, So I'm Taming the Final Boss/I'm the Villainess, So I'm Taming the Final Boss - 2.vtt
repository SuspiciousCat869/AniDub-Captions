00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:13.748 position:19% line:83% align:start
[RUDOLF] Aileen, due to
the nullification of your

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:17.351 position:7% line:83% align:start
engagement; your pharmaceutical
and agricultural businesses

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:20.087 position:24% line:83% align:start
will be taken over
by Prince CÃ©dric.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.190 position:7% line:83% align:start
First he dishonored me and now
he's stealing my life's work?

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.192 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is your comeuppance
for the contracts

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:26.628 position:19% line:89% align:start
you carelessly created.

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:30.297 position:16% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, this will
cost our family much.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
I-- I'm incredibly
sorry, Father.

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:35.703 position:5% line:83% align:start
[RUDOLF] I'm willing to dismiss
the issue under the circumstance

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:38.272 position:30% line:83% align:start
you recoup the
losses before the ball.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.407 position:24% line:83% align:start
But... that's only
two months from now!

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:42.109 position:21% line:83% align:start
I raised my daughter
to be a fighter,

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.646 position:27% line:83% align:start
not some sap who
wallows in her worries.

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:46.346 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now hammer away, darling.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.784 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
I can tell Father is serious.

00:00:49.918 --> 00:00:52.185 position:21% line:83% align:start
If things progress at
this rate, I'll be ousted

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:53.721 position:27% line:89% align:start
from the family.

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.950 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Step one: make up
the boatloads of money

00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:32.720 position:10% line:83% align:start
that thief of a prince stole
from me and my family.

00:02:33.888 --> 00:02:35.823 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey! Long time!

00:02:35.957 --> 00:02:38.258 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Jasper! A good day to you, sir.

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:39.794 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're surprisingly cheerful.

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:42.329 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is it true that engagement
of yours fell through?

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.665 position:21% line:89% align:start
The rumors are true.

00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:45.499 position:30% line:83% align:start
I decline to be
interviewed any further.

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:47.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
Can't a guy just say hello?

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.269 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not interested
in an interview.

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:51.338 position:19% line:83% align:start
And if I was, know that
my paper always stands

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:52.940 position:19% line:89% align:start
on the side of justice.

00:02:53.074 --> 00:02:55.442 position:19% line:83% align:start
As your friend, I can't
believe how this panned out.

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:57.111 position:19% line:83% align:start
You were so devoted to
him and he tossed you

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:58.813 position:21% line:89% align:start
straight to the curb.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:04.018 position:19% line:83% align:start
Moving along, I have a
favor I'd like to ask of you!

00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:05.352 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:09.123 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] And with that, I say
we buckle down and repair

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:10.591 position:33% line:89% align:start
this castle!

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:13.094 position:19% line:83% align:start
The funding shall come
from my very own pockets!

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.462 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uh, that's interesting.

00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:17.364 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you mean to suggest
that we allow humans

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:18.465 position:30% line:89% align:start
in the castle?

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.535 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's just downright blasphemy!

00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:22.937 position:13% line:83% align:start
I find it more blasphemous
to deprive your lord

00:03:23.071 --> 00:03:24.471 position:13% line:89% align:start
of the castle he deserves.

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:27.340 position:16% line:83% align:start
Are you too blind to see
the glory of this place?

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:29.010 position:7% line:89% align:start
And this is why I hate humans!

00:03:29.143 --> 00:03:31.946 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Jeez, delusions of
grandeur, don't you think?

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.514 position:19% line:89% align:start
There's a second angle.

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:35.449 position:13% line:83% align:start
You could also look at this
as a great opportunity

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:36.851 position:30% line:89% align:start
to help others.

00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:40.054 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE] "Help others?"
And how would I do that?

00:03:40.188 --> 00:03:41.823 position:21% line:89% align:start
So here's the truth.

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:45.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
Prince CÃ©dric let several of the
finest workers in the land go.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.628 position:27% line:83% align:start
I propose we hire
them to fix the castle.

00:03:47.762 --> 00:03:49.831 position:24% line:83% align:start
And why would you,
the daughter of a duke,

00:03:49.964 --> 00:03:52.066 position:19% line:83% align:start
go to such lengths for
those beneath you?

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.502 position:38% line:83% align:start
To help.
These gentlemen need it.

00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:59.107 position:19% line:83% align:start
I assumed you would be
quick to meet my offer

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.541 position:21% line:89% align:start
with refusal. But I--

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:02.342 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Do as you wish.

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:04.679 position:5% line:89% align:start
That went better than expected.

00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:06.748 position:24% line:83% align:start
Keith, in addition
to my subsidy,

00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:09.117 position:16% line:83% align:start
we haven't received your
salary in some time now.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.120 position:10% line:83% align:start
My lord, it's always been my
suspicion that some noble

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.788 position:16% line:89% align:start
is embezzling our funds.

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:17.491 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please, look into the issue, and
recover whatever we're owed.

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:20.061 position:24% line:83% align:start
I will use that sum
to repair the castle.

00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:21.095 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just leave it to me.

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.597 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
You should know.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.632 position:19% line:83% align:start
It so happens that I've
already tasked Jasper,

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:26.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
an excellent reporter and
acquaintance of mine,

00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:28.468 position:24% line:83% align:start
with investigating
the missing funds.

00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:31.105 position:13% line:83% align:start
Quite bold to take matters
into your own hands.

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:32.774 position:5% line:89% align:start
Apologies for any encroachment.

00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:36.144 position:10% line:83% align:start
I merely deemed it the best
course of action for us all.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.212 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your distaste for being
in the debt of another

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:39.847 position:13% line:89% align:start
grows increasingly evident.

00:04:39.981 --> 00:04:41.983 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let us turn the lens
of judgment on you.

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:44.919 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why did you take my suggestion
with such aggressive haste?

00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:47.522 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you enjoy teasing
undeserving ladies?

00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:49.657 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Perhaps. Who can say?

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:52.260 position:16% line:83% align:start
While you're in this mood
of hearing me out,

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:55.495 position:7% line:83% align:start
I would like to borrow a small
plot of land in your forest.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.298 position:16% line:83% align:start
There, I would construct
a humble croft.

00:04:58.431 --> 00:04:59.432 position:30% line:89% align:start
Would you now?

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:01.068 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's fine.

00:05:01.202 --> 00:05:03.971 position:16% line:83% align:start
Anything more will depend
on how sincerely you ask.

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:10.545 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, there's no point
in dawdling around!

00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:13.480 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sir Belzebuth,
I require the grand tour.

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:14.916 position:35% line:89% align:start
One moment.

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:16.349 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Yes?

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:26.060 position:24% line:83% align:start
--[RIBBON] Yoo-hoo!
--[AILEEN yelps]

00:05:26.194 --> 00:05:28.930 position:10% line:89% align:start
Uh, hello. We've met before!

00:05:29.063 --> 00:05:30.264 position:16% line:89% align:start
There, that should do it.

00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:32.365 position:24% line:83% align:start
I made your shadow
a demonic gateway.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.401 position:16% line:83% align:start
Demons can travel through
it as they please.

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:36.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
What compelled you
to do such a thing?

00:05:36.504 --> 00:05:37.972 position:19% line:83% align:start
With this, you will be
universally accepted

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:41.341 position:16% line:83% align:start
by all demons, no matter
where your travels take you.

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:43.644 position:41% line:89% align:start
[barks]

00:05:47.215 --> 00:05:49.884 position:21% line:83% align:start
Seems someone's taken
a fancy to my ribbon.

00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:53.087 position:19% line:83% align:start
Does Ribbon sound like
a suitable name for you?

00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:54.222 position:30% line:89% align:start
[RIBBON barks]

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.525 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JASPER] I've always known
that you existed in a league

00:05:57.658 --> 00:05:59.660 position:33% line:89% align:start
all your own.

00:05:59.794 --> 00:06:01.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
But still, Aileen,
bringing humans

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:05.233 position:13% line:83% align:start
to the demon lord's castle
to do repair work is a lot,

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.801 position:33% line:89% align:start
even for you.

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:08.536 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't you fret, it's within
the realm of the law.

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.873 position:19% line:83% align:start
I stayed up the entire
night making sure of that.

00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:14.242 position:19% line:83% align:start
Prince CÃ©dric's a fool
for letting you go.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.978 position:21% line:83% align:start
A woman as passionate
as you is hard to come by.

00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:20.014 position:19% line:83% align:start
Flattery? That's rather
out of character.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.718 position:35% line:83% align:start
[BELZEBUTH]
Woman!

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:25.353 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's infraction number one!

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:26.854 position:30% line:89% align:start
Whoa, who's he?

00:06:26.988 --> 00:06:28.189 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sir Belzebuth!

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:30.725 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey! Listen close, human!

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:31.993 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, yes?

00:06:32.126 --> 00:06:34.328 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you continue to offend
our lord in his home,

00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:38.266 position:13% line:83% align:start
his winds will blow you out
and into the next kingdom!

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.468 position:13% line:83% align:start
Jasper, when did you manage
to disgruntle Lord Claude?

00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:43.470 position:38% line:83% align:start
Beats me!
I've yet to meet the guy!

00:06:43.604 --> 00:06:47.875 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then what in the world could
that spectacle have been about?

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.978 position:10% line:83% align:start
This bluster certainly isn't
convenient for our work.

If it turns out all those rumors
that the demon lord's

emotions affect the weather are
true, then that would mean--

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.588 position:21% line:89% align:start
That would mean what?

00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:01.956 position:38% line:83% align:start

Nothing yet.

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:04.125 position:24% line:83% align:start

Allow me to nip those
thoughts in the bud

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:30.384 position:24% line:83% align:start
as there is nothing
to worry about!

00:07:30.518 --> 00:07:34.055 position:27% line:83% align:start
[sighs] Typical.
You're still you.

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:37.825 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm ever so grateful you chose
to come, Denis.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.728 position:10% line:83% align:start
Having a genius architect on
board brings great comfort.

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:42.997 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right!
What a thrilling chance to play!

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.232 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm so sorry you
were let go, Luc.

00:07:45.366 --> 00:07:47.268 position:13% line:83% align:start
It pains me so to know how
close you were to seeing

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:50.404 position:10% line:83% align:start
the results of your medicinal
research come to fruition.

00:07:50.538 --> 00:07:51.939 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's fine!

00:07:52.073 --> 00:07:53.307 position:13% line:83% align:start
The doctor in me is looking
forward to perusing

00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:55.576 position:27% line:83% align:start
the demon lord's
wealth of flora!

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.212 position:19% line:89% align:start
You must be overjoyed!

00:07:58.346 --> 00:07:59.714 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's still a touch depressed.

00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:01.849 position:16% line:83% align:start
Imagine being a botanist
and having all the plants

00:08:01.983 --> 00:08:04.218 position:13% line:83% align:start
you've grown ripped away by
someone who doesn't know

00:08:04.352 --> 00:08:06.020 position:21% line:89% align:start
how to care for them.

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:09.290 position:7% line:83% align:start
After all that, you're willing
to work for me again?

00:08:09.423 --> 00:08:11.826 position:10% line:83% align:start
If necessary, we can develop
an untraceable poison

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:13.694 position:7% line:89% align:start
for you to use as you see fit.

00:08:13.828 --> 00:08:15.262 position:24% line:83% align:start
Right? What do you
say, Lord Isaac?

00:08:15.396 --> 00:08:17.565 position:10% line:83% align:start
I want not a thing to do with
your assassination plots

00:08:17.698 --> 00:08:18.532 position:30% line:89% align:start
on the prince!

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:20.201 position:21% line:89% align:start
You downright quack!

00:08:20.334 --> 00:08:22.937 position:10% line:83% align:start
The demon forest may present
us with the perfect ingredients.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.305 position:33% line:89% align:start
Pure madness.

00:08:24.438 --> 00:08:26.440 position:13% line:83% align:start
Better yet, I could build a
bridge rigged to collapse

00:08:26.574 --> 00:08:28.676 position:16% line:83% align:start
under a certain princely
amount of weight!

00:08:28.809 --> 00:08:30.344 position:16% line:89% align:start
Build yourself a muzzle!

00:08:30.478 --> 00:08:33.814 position:5% line:83% align:start
Gentlemen! Assassination is fun,
but let's focus on the task

00:08:33.948 --> 00:08:35.082 position:38% line:89% align:start
at hand!

00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:38.753 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:40.454 position:13% line:83% align:start
You've surpassed the bounds
of my imagination!

00:08:40.588 --> 00:08:41.756 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who's that?

00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:43.190 position:24% line:83% align:start
Keith, one of Lord
Claude's aides.

00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:44.558 position:44% line:89% align:start
Who?

00:08:44.692 --> 00:08:46.127 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't fear, for I'm
an ordinary human.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.728 position:21% line:89% align:start
Quite unlike you lot.

00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:50.531 position:10% line:83% align:start
You are human, but I wouldn't
describe you as ordinary.

00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:52.166 position:38% line:83% align:start
[JASPER]
So, you've done your research.

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:55.136 position:13% line:83% align:start
That falls well within the
territory of my occupation here.

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:58.072 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm frequently gathering
information for my lord.

00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:02.810 position:10% line:83% align:start
We would be wise to a bring
our lollygagging to a close.

00:09:02.943 --> 00:09:05.813 position:19% line:83% align:start
Lord Claude is growing
increasingly upset.

00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:14.722 position:13% line:89% align:start
I bring you... our guests.

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:29.236 position:19% line:89% align:start
What a cultivated look.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.740 position:10% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE] I have but one rule
which requires your adherence.

00:09:32.873 --> 00:09:34.742 position:30% line:83% align:start
Do not harm the
demons you'll find here

00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:37.078 position:7% line:89% align:start
or threaten their way of life.

00:09:37.211 --> 00:09:39.947 position:10% line:83% align:start
Keep in mind I know all that
happens within this barrier;

00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:42.216 position:21% line:83% align:start
commit the most minor
infraction, I will see it,

00:09:42.349 --> 00:09:44.318 position:21% line:83% align:start
and you will be dealt
with accordingly.

00:09:44.452 --> 00:09:45.986 position:38% line:89% align:start
Question.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.789 position:10% line:83% align:start
Precisely what part of this
castle is in need of repair?

00:09:52.493 --> 00:09:53.761 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL gasp]

00:09:55.963 --> 00:09:57.665 position:16% line:89% align:start
Where did the ceiling go?

00:09:57.798 --> 00:09:59.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? What is this?

00:10:04.506 --> 00:10:06.941 position:19% line:83% align:start
As you can see, there's
much work to be done.

00:10:07.074 --> 00:10:09.743 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've been using magic
to hold the place together.

00:10:13.147 --> 00:10:15.216 position:30% line:83% align:start
How perplexing.
So this is magic.

00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:17.885 position:19% line:83% align:start
Any preferences on how
we fix up your home?

00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:20.221 position:19% line:83% align:start
I want the castle made
comfortable for demons.

00:10:20.354 --> 00:10:22.690 position:16% line:83% align:start
[DENIS] Then could I talk
to the demons directly?

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:24.792 position:24% line:83% align:start
Belzebuth, please
interpret for him.

00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:26.595 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, your lordship.

00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:29.598 position:27% line:83% align:start
Alert me whenever
a decision is required.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:30.965 position:35% line:89% align:start
Dismissed.

00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:32.299 position:35% line:83% align:start
[BELZEBUTH]
Demons are surprisingly...

00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:33.968 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Lord Claude?

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:36.804 position:19% line:83% align:start
You seem a smidgen more
on edge than usual.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.074 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
And?

00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:43.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] I was merely curious if
something was bothering you.

00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:47.715 position:10% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE] You seem quite close
to these men that you've hired.

00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:49.383 position:16% line:83% align:start
Any business professional
worth their salt

00:10:49.518 --> 00:10:51.886 position:21% line:83% align:start
works to build trust
with their associates.

00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:55.990 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you're put off by my urgency,

00:10:56.123 --> 00:10:57.925 position:24% line:83% align:start
know my father will
oust me from his house

00:10:58.058 --> 00:11:00.961 position:19% line:83% align:start
if I can't establish a
business before the ball.

00:11:01.095 --> 00:11:03.197 position:13% line:83% align:start
If that were to happen, I'd
be stripped of my privilege

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.432 position:27% line:83% align:start
to wear even the
simplest of gowns.

00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:07.034 position:24% line:89% align:start
Rather paltry, no?

00:11:07.168 --> 00:11:10.337 position:13% line:89% align:start
Paltry? Spoken like a man.

00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:12.907 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't you know that dresses
are womankind's battle armor?

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.308 position:21% line:83% align:start
Perhaps someone like
you has the confidence

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:16.645 position:33% line:83% align:start
to run about
au naturel, but not I!

00:11:16.777 --> 00:11:19.346 position:27% line:83% align:start
No. I'll keep my
clothing on, thanks.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.516 position:21% line:83% align:start
And! The main reason
I invest in attire

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.018 position:19% line:83% align:start
is so I may confidently
stand by your side!

00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:26.754 position:13% line:83% align:start
No matter the elegance with
which your exterior is draped,

00:11:26.887 --> 00:11:29.256 position:21% line:83% align:start
the fire that is you
burns the same.

00:11:30.724 --> 00:11:33.928 position:5% line:83% align:start
Be that as it may, I understand
the logic behind your reasoning.

00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:35.564 position:16% line:89% align:start
I beg you, wait a moment.

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:39.133 position:10% line:83% align:start
Tell me, what was instigating
your unhappiness earlier?

00:11:40.968 --> 00:11:42.136 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who knows?

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:44.371 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't say with
much certainty myself.

00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:45.773 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:47.676 --> 00:11:49.243 position:16% line:89% align:start
Gone without a trace, eh?

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:50.679 position:38% line:89% align:start
Peculiar.

00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:52.213 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KEITH]
You have nothing to worry about.

00:11:52.346 --> 00:11:54.982 position:21% line:83% align:start
See? Whatever you did
caused Lord Claude's mood

00:11:55.115 --> 00:11:56.884 position:24% line:89% align:start
to improve greatly.

00:12:03.224 --> 00:12:05.492 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Let us get to work, gentlemen.

00:12:05.627 --> 00:12:08.762 position:19% line:83% align:start
Denis, I pronounce you
head of all castle repairs.

00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:09.863 position:41% line:89% align:start
Grand!

00:12:09.997 --> 00:12:11.566 position:19% line:89% align:start
This way. Come on, kid.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.401 position:10% line:83% align:start
[DENIS] For your information,
good sir, I'm a 16-year-old man!

00:12:14.536 --> 00:12:17.238 position:10% line:83% align:start
Jasper, please begin tracing
Lord Claude's lost funds.

00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:19.674 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sir Keith will serve as your
partner in this endeavor.

00:12:19.807 --> 00:12:22.309 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's a pleasure to be working
with you, Keith the human.

00:12:22.443 --> 00:12:24.979 position:21% line:83% align:start
United we shall wring
those embezzlers dry!

00:12:26.548 --> 00:12:28.882 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm going to use you three
for a special project.

00:12:29.016 --> 00:12:30.851 position:21% line:83% align:start
Before long, we'll be
manufacturing our own line

00:12:30.985 --> 00:12:32.253 position:24% line:89% align:start
of pharmaceuticals.

00:12:32.386 --> 00:12:33.521 position:38% line:89% align:start
Perfect.

00:12:33.655 --> 00:12:35.189 position:19% line:83% align:start
I committed the formula
Prince CÃ©dric stole

00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:37.424 position:21% line:83% align:start
to memory in hopes of
an opportunity like this.

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:38.526 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm ready, too.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.760 position:10% line:89% align:start
I have some ingredients left.

00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:41.395 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't be foolish.

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:43.998 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now that Prince CÃ©dric has
ownership over the business,

00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:46.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
he'll no doubt throw a
complete and utter tantrum

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:48.703 position:7% line:83% align:start
if we produce anything remotely
in the same vein as him.

00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:51.872 position:13% line:83% align:start
What's more, he's connected
enough to shut us down.

00:12:52.006 --> 00:12:53.841 position:19% line:89% align:start
We need something new.

00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:56.143 position:13% line:89% align:start
What we need are cosmetics.

00:12:56.277 --> 00:12:59.246 position:7% line:83% align:start
We ladies are willing to spend
much in the pursuit of beauty.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.882 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll use that knowledge
to our favor.

00:13:02.016 --> 00:13:03.652 position:41% line:83% align:start
I see.
That's not a bad idea.

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:06.688 position:7% line:83% align:start
Beauty products are far beyond
my realm of expertise.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.990 position:10% line:83% align:start
You use salves and scrubs on
chapped and blistered skin, yes?

00:13:10.124 --> 00:13:12.727 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just consider this another
form of dermal healing.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.529 position:27% line:89% align:start
Interesting spin.

00:13:14.663 --> 00:13:16.163 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's give it a try.

00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:18.399 position:30% line:83% align:start
I will test our
products personally.

00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:20.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
The sight of me all done up
standing beside Lord Claude

00:13:21.035 --> 00:13:22.369 position:5% line:89% align:start
will make a great advertisement.

00:13:22.504 --> 00:13:26.407 position:24% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC] Indeed, his
beauty is otherworldly.

00:13:26.541 --> 00:13:28.108 position:27% line:83% align:start
I was hoping our
cosmetics could raise me

00:13:28.242 --> 00:13:30.210 position:19% line:83% align:start
to the playing field of
your gentleman crush.

00:13:30.344 --> 00:13:32.146 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now that's a selfish motive!

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:33.480 position:38% line:89% align:start
So be it!

00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:35.650 position:13% line:83% align:start
I will not lose any beauty
pageants to my escort!

00:13:36.618 --> 00:13:38.687 position:19% line:83% align:start
If this is an accurate
portrayal of  all womenkind,

00:13:38.852 --> 00:13:40.187 position:19% line:89% align:start
we're sure to be rich.

00:13:42.356 --> 00:13:43.957 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CÃDRIC]
What's she doing?

00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:46.393 position:13% line:83% align:start
Can't say, but she gathered
up all the laborers

00:13:46.528 --> 00:13:47.961 position:21% line:83% align:start
you recently released
and brought them

00:13:48.095 --> 00:13:49.597 position:13% line:89% align:start
to the demon lord's castle.

00:13:49.731 --> 00:13:51.932 position:13% line:83% align:start
I fear there's a scheme at
the center of her newfound

00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:54.001 position:16% line:89% align:start
fondness for my brother.

00:14:09.383 --> 00:14:11.619 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yes! It's the perfect scent!

00:14:11.753 --> 00:14:13.755 position:10% line:83% align:start
[LUC] I couldn't have done it
without the steam distiller

00:14:13.887 --> 00:14:15.657 position:13% line:89% align:start
that Denis crafted for me.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.727 position:30% line:83% align:start
[DENIS laughs]
Oh, that old bucket of bolts?

00:14:19.527 --> 00:14:22.129 position:24% line:83% align:start
This one's clearly
chamomile and lemongrass.

00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:25.866 position:16% line:83% align:start
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but is this one rosemary?

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:27.201 position:41% line:89% align:start
Indeed!

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:28.570 position:19% line:83% align:start
Using Isaac's documents
for a basis,

00:14:28.703 --> 00:14:30.404 position:24% line:83% align:start
I tried a plethora
of different plants.

00:14:30.538 --> 00:14:33.140 position:24% line:83% align:start
Our final hurdle is
finishing those repairs.

00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:35.643 position:5% line:89% align:start
Denis. How's your progress been?

00:14:35.777 --> 00:14:37.277 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right on track!

00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:39.413 position:7% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't you agree this kitchen
looks as good as new?

00:14:39.547 --> 00:14:41.616 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yes, but we can't truly judge
the quality of a kitchen

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.917 position:13% line:83% align:start
just by boiling up grasses
and flowers all day.

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:46.920 position:7% line:83% align:start
If anyone has the ingredients,
we could bake a pastry or two!

00:14:47.054 --> 00:14:48.590 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, human! Make sweets!

00:14:48.723 --> 00:14:49.990 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, do it! Bake cake!

00:14:50.124 --> 00:14:51.526 position:24% line:89% align:start
Or pie! Pie's good!

00:14:51.659 --> 00:14:54.128 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, tarts! Make tarts!
Wanna try!

00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:55.963 position:24% line:83% align:start
I find this quite a
disrespectful usage

00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:57.599 position:33% line:89% align:start
of my shadow!

00:14:57.732 --> 00:14:59.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
Return from whence
you came right now!

00:14:59.534 --> 00:15:03.671 position:24% line:83% align:start
Cookies! Brownies!
Cakes and pies and--

00:15:03.805 --> 00:15:05.239 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't you chant at me!

00:15:05.372 --> 00:15:08.510 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll bake you confections
once things calm down!

00:15:08.643 --> 00:15:09.644 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ALMOND]
...tyrant!

00:15:09.778 --> 00:15:11.311 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Don't bother her.

00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:13.748 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well! It's assuring to see
they're obedient to someone

00:15:13.882 --> 00:15:15.349 position:24% line:89% align:start
at the very least.

00:15:15.482 --> 00:15:16.950 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm delighted to report to you
that we got to the bottom

00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:18.452 position:24% line:83% align:start
of the embezzlement
case and have taken care

00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:19.687 position:33% line:89% align:start
of the issue.

00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:21.121 position:38% line:89% align:start
Goodness!

00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:23.290 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your friend Jasper
is incredibly talented!

00:15:23.424 --> 00:15:25.192 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's curious, as I received
word you obtained

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:27.494 position:21% line:83% align:start
most of the evidence
on your own.

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:29.329 position:24% line:83% align:start
Once you uncovered
the culprit's identity,

00:15:29.463 --> 00:15:31.833 position:16% line:83% align:start
why didn't you let Jasper
denounce them in the press?

00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:33.133 position:41% line:89% align:start
Simple.

00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:34.636 position:30% line:83% align:start
Some things are
best kept private.

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:37.304 position:13% line:83% align:start
The public can't know that
the demon lord was poor!

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:41.408 position:16% line:83% align:start
[DENIS gasps] You've gone
and hurt his feelings!

00:15:41.543 --> 00:15:43.210 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KEITH]
He won't be poor any longer!

00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:44.612 position:19% line:89% align:start
Money's no concern now.

00:15:44.746 --> 00:15:46.881 position:16% line:83% align:start
And preparations for the
ball are going smoothly.

00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:49.784 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're able to avoid falling
from his favor until then.

00:15:49.918 --> 00:15:51.185 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:15:52.186 --> 00:15:54.354 position:21% line:83% align:start
Right! I'll certainly
give it my all.

00:15:54.488 --> 00:15:57.926 position:7% line:83% align:start
We look forward to the big day,
don't we, Lord Claude?

00:15:58.058 --> 00:15:59.527 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't we, Lord Claude?

00:16:00.762 --> 00:16:02.296 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not especially.

00:16:03.598 --> 00:16:05.633 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Why, because he
doesn't believe my appearance

00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:07.702 position:5% line:89% align:start
will keep up with his grandeur?

00:16:07.836 --> 00:16:09.571 position:16% line:89% align:start
Was that his insinuation?

00:16:09.704 --> 00:16:12.139 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh... You read eons
too far into that.

00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:13.608 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GROUP]
Mm-hmm.

00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:16.544 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Our skin toner will
have Lord Claude eating

00:16:16.678 --> 00:16:17.912 position:21% line:89% align:start
his insinuated words.

00:16:18.045 --> 00:16:19.179 position:24% line:89% align:start
We must finish it!

00:16:19.313 --> 00:16:21.516 position:10% line:89% align:start
Work to your highest caliber!

00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:22.750 position:38% line:89% align:start
Poor man.

00:16:22.884 --> 00:16:24.819 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a shame to be foiled
by your own naivetÃ©.

00:16:24.953 --> 00:16:26.119 position:44% line:89% align:start
Look.

00:16:26.253 --> 00:16:28.523 position:24% line:83% align:start
He must not be very
angry after all.

00:16:31.826 --> 00:16:34.461 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Our products performed
swimmingly in the test,

00:16:34.596 --> 00:16:36.831 position:21% line:83% align:start
but how should we go
about selling them?

00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:40.067 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please, Almond,
I don't have sweets.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.203 position:13% line:83% align:start
[gasps] You can utilize my
shadow as well?

00:16:43.337 --> 00:16:45.372 position:5% line:89% align:start
That would've been nice to know.

00:16:45.507 --> 00:16:46.240 position:41% line:89% align:start
Human.

00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:47.842 position:13% line:89% align:start
I come here with a request.

00:16:47.976 --> 00:16:50.277 position:19% line:83% align:start
Entering a lady's room
uninvited at the dead of night

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.547 position:16% line:83% align:start
is a nearly unforgivable
transgression.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.682 position:30% line:83% align:start
But I'll turn a
blind eye this time.

00:16:54.816 --> 00:16:56.216 position:19% line:89% align:start
What is it you require?

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.820 position:19% line:83% align:start
If our lord is going to
be attending this ball,

00:16:58.953 --> 00:17:00.722 position:7% line:89% align:start
then I wish to attend as well.

00:17:00.855 --> 00:17:02.724 position:10% line:83% align:start
Aides are welcome, but you'll
be asked to stand off

00:17:02.857 --> 00:17:04.291 position:27% line:89% align:start
toward the side.

00:17:04.424 --> 00:17:05.760 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's fine with me.

00:17:05.894 --> 00:17:08.161 position:16% line:83% align:start
I only want to go because
the detestable humans

00:17:08.295 --> 00:17:10.430 position:27% line:83% align:start
who cast out our
lord will be there.

00:17:10.565 --> 00:17:16.036 position:5% line:83% align:start
Though Lord Claude is strong, he
is not necessarily invulnerable.

00:17:17.805 --> 00:17:19.507 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have heard that if I
don't want to shame him

00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:21.809 position:13% line:83% align:start
at the ball, I will need to
harness the great power

00:17:21.943 --> 00:17:23.110 position:24% line:89% align:start
known as "manners."

00:17:23.243 --> 00:17:25.880 position:24% line:83% align:start
Think you can help
me achieve this?

00:17:26.014 --> 00:17:27.649 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'd be honored to.

00:17:27.782 --> 00:17:30.785 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll arm you with all the tricks
and trades of high society!

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:33.021 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ha! I'm in your debt!

00:17:33.186 --> 00:17:34.789 position:30% line:83% align:start
Lord Claude is
lucky to have you.

00:17:34.923 --> 00:17:37.357 position:24% line:83% align:start
From all I've seen,
he's very well loved.

00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:41.829 position:13% line:83% align:start
I find it peculiar so many
are wary to get close to him.

00:17:41.963 --> 00:17:44.097 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wary to get close to, huh?

00:17:44.231 --> 00:17:46.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I remember correctly,
these two don't get along

00:17:46.834 --> 00:17:48.201 position:27% line:89% align:start
with each other.

00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:51.606 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's the perfect sales strategy!

00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:53.575 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't mean to
bother you, human,

00:17:53.708 --> 00:17:57.512 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I'd like to start my manners
training as soon as I can.

00:17:57.645 --> 00:17:58.312 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:17:58.445 --> 00:18:00.080 position:19% line:89% align:start
For your first lesson,

00:18:02.482 --> 00:18:05.252 position:16% line:83% align:start
I will teach you the art
of kneeling to a lady.

00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:09.757 position:5% line:83% align:start
[DENIS] Craftsmen, use your full
force to complete the framework!

00:18:09.891 --> 00:18:13.293 position:5% line:83% align:start
Demons, transport materials and
keep the workspace tidy, got it?

00:18:13.427 --> 00:18:14.896 position:38% line:83% align:start
[WORKERS]
Got it!

00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:17.164 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Everyone is
working so diligently.

00:18:17.297 --> 00:18:20.068 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll have to reward them
with some treats.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.703 position:19% line:89% align:start
We have a bone to pick.

00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:24.706 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you the catalyst of
Belzebuth's strange behavior?

00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:26.608 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't call his
behavior strange.

00:18:26.741 --> 00:18:29.476 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just an iota knightlier
than it usually is.

00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:31.746 position:19% line:83% align:start
He asked me to critique
the form of his bow

00:18:31.879 --> 00:18:33.280 position:21% line:89% align:start
over and over again.

00:18:33.413 --> 00:18:36.116 position:16% line:83% align:start
He'd appreciate the help
of a sophisticate like you.

00:18:36.249 --> 00:18:39.319 position:10% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE] So, it seems you've
been using sweets to force

00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:41.089 position:7% line:89% align:start
the demons to do your bidding.

00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:43.357 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
I'm not forcing anyone.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.561 position:30% line:83% align:start
On closer look,
I see that's true.

00:18:46.694 --> 00:18:48.328 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
It's a bit shocking.

00:18:48.462 --> 00:18:50.765 position:16% line:83% align:start
The land of the demons is
far vaster than I imagined.

00:18:50.898 --> 00:18:53.768 position:10% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE] That was originally
the property of some count.

00:18:53.901 --> 00:18:56.470 position:5% line:83% align:start
Keith purchased it so the demons
would have more space

00:18:56.604 --> 00:18:57.839 position:38% line:89% align:start
to roam.

00:18:57.972 --> 00:19:00.207 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're very lucky to have
an aide as clever as he is.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.274 position:41% line:89% align:start
Agreed.

00:19:01.408 --> 00:19:03.477 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've grown to trust him deeply.

00:19:03.611 --> 00:19:05.379 position:19% line:83% align:start
While I'm quite humbled
by the compliments,

00:19:05.513 --> 00:19:08.181 position:19% line:83% align:start
I regret to inform you;
we bear bad news.

00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:09.951 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's this nasty rumor.

00:19:10.084 --> 00:19:13.487 position:5% line:83% align:start
People are saying that Aileen is
going after Lady Lilia's life.

00:19:13.621 --> 00:19:15.255 position:13% line:89% align:start
How could that possibly be?

00:19:15.389 --> 00:19:17.157 position:19% line:83% align:start
The word on the street
is that Lady Lilia

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.993 position:24% line:83% align:start
has been receiving
threatening letters.

00:19:19.127 --> 00:19:21.529 position:13% line:83% align:start
They say "you aren't fit to
be Prince CÃ©dric's fiancÃ©e"

00:19:21.663 --> 00:19:23.463 position:30% line:83% align:start
and "refuse the
engagement or else."

00:19:23.598 --> 00:19:25.900 position:33% line:83% align:start
Your standard
nobleperson threats.

00:19:26.034 --> 00:19:27.635 position:7% line:89% align:start
Folks say you're sending them.

00:19:27.769 --> 00:19:31.338 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ye gods, what would cause anyone
to suppose I'm the culprit?

00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:33.007 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, as ridiculous
as it sounds,

00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:36.144 position:13% line:83% align:start
your name was signed at the
bottom of some of these letters.

00:19:36.276 --> 00:19:38.780 position:19% line:83% align:start
On top of that, they're
written on the high-quality,

00:19:38.913 --> 00:19:42.050 position:24% line:83% align:start
perfumed paper that
only noble ladies use.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.317 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Death threats, huh?

00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:46.587 position:16% line:83% align:start
I remember this happening
in the game.

00:19:46.721 --> 00:19:48.923 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's a little foggy, but I'm
pretty sure the sender

00:19:49.057 --> 00:19:50.424 position:24% line:89% align:start
was the villainess.

00:19:50.558 --> 00:19:52.426 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wait! The sender was me?

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.361 position:27% line:83% align:start
I might have been
the miscreant in the game,

00:19:54.494 --> 00:19:56.664 position:21% line:83% align:start
but in this reality,
I've been framed!

00:19:58.533 --> 00:20:00.835 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you're sure
about the stationery.

00:20:00.968 --> 00:20:03.504 position:33% line:83% align:start
Good Almond,
I require your help.

00:20:03.638 --> 00:20:04.739 position:38% line:89% align:start
On what?

00:20:04.872 --> 00:20:05.873 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:20:06.007 --> 00:20:07.642 position:16% line:89% align:start
A very important new job.

00:20:07.775 --> 00:20:09.476 position:5% line:89% align:start
The reward is a fresh apple pie.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.546 position:16% line:89% align:start
Can do! For pie, that is!

00:20:11.679 --> 00:20:12.379 position:41% line:89% align:start
Refuse.

00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:14.082 position:16% line:89% align:start
Farewell, pie! Can't do.

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:16.316 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was just going to ask him to
rummage through the rubbish

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:17.685 position:19% line:89% align:start
at the imperial palace.

00:20:17.819 --> 00:20:19.954 position:24% line:83% align:start
The servants would
surely take notice,

00:20:20.088 --> 00:20:22.890 position:5% line:83% align:start
and if he leaves the barrier, I
lose all means to protect him.

00:20:23.024 --> 00:20:24.726 position:21% line:83% align:start
How do you expect the
demons to learn or grow

00:20:24.859 --> 00:20:27.695 position:10% line:83% align:start
if they never come in contact
with the outside world?

00:20:29.931 --> 00:20:33.201 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE] Go on, but come
back if it seems dangerous.

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:34.736 position:19% line:89% align:start
Aye-aye, your lordship!

00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:37.337 position:13% line:83% align:start
If they dare hurt a feather
on his little head,

00:20:37.471 --> 00:20:38.973 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll destroy them myself!

00:20:39.107 --> 00:20:41.976 position:10% line:83% align:start
I care as much about Almond's
wellbeing as you do!

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.778 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
How strange.

00:20:43.911 --> 00:20:46.581 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't go a day without feeling
this underlying desire

00:20:46.714 --> 00:20:49.717 position:21% line:83% align:start
to make you cry, but
recently I've found myself

00:20:49.851 --> 00:20:53.788 position:19% line:83% align:start
nearly overcome by the
urge to spoil you rotten.

00:20:55.189 --> 00:20:57.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is there anything your
Lord can do for you?

00:20:57.859 --> 00:20:59.727 position:27% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN squeals]
This behavior wasn't fleshed out

00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:01.495 position:10% line:89% align:start
in his character description!

00:21:01.629 --> 00:21:03.363 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll take that as
our cue to leave.

00:21:03.497 --> 00:21:05.533 position:7% line:89% align:start
The best of luck, Lady Aileen!

00:21:05.666 --> 00:21:07.735 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN sighs]
Pull yourself together!

00:21:07.869 --> 00:21:09.837 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is a great opportunity
to draw up a contract

00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:11.706 position:30% line:89% align:start
of engagement.

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:14.441 position:7% line:83% align:start
But for some reason, it doesn't
feel like the right moment.

00:21:14.575 --> 00:21:16.711 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even though I may never
get this chance again.

00:21:18.913 --> 00:21:22.650 position:7% line:83% align:start
I want-- I want you to be the
best escort at the whole ball.

00:21:22.784 --> 00:21:24.752 position:27% line:83% align:start
You must outshine
every other man there!

00:21:24.886 --> 00:21:28.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
Especially that wretched
fool, Prince CÃ©dric!

00:21:28.556 --> 00:21:31.526 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're more formidable
than you even know.

00:21:31.659 --> 00:21:33.393 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll grant your request.

00:21:36.531 --> 00:21:38.566 position:13% line:83% align:start
In retrospect, I wonder if
should've asked for some

00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:41.468 position:27% line:83% align:start
magical substance
that promotes glowy skin.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.705 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CÃDRIC]
Lilia, are you all right?

00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:48.643 position:21% line:83% align:start
[LILIA] Oh, yes. I've
calmed myself down.

00:21:48.776 --> 00:21:51.712 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm certain that Aileen is
fraternizing with demons.

00:21:51.846 --> 00:21:54.582 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sure she's the one sending
you those horrific letters.

00:21:54.715 --> 00:21:56.117 position:21% line:83% align:start
Though I agree with
you that Lady Aileen

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.920 position:19% line:83% align:start
is a very coarse woman,
we have no real proof

00:21:59.053 --> 00:22:00.621 position:27% line:89% align:start
she's the sender.

00:22:00.755 --> 00:22:02.322 position:10% line:89% align:start
You have a pure soul, Lilia.

00:22:02.455 --> 00:22:06.027 position:10% line:83% align:start
How dare that wench confound
it with a sense of unease.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.862 position:19% line:89% align:start
My sweet Prince CÃ©dric.

00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:15.069 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CÃDRIC] Aileen, you'll rue the
day you threatened my love!
