00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:10.678 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Here.
A lock of Lord Claude's hair.

00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:11.813 position:27% line:89% align:start
Treasure it well.

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:13.347 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lord Claude?

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.149 position:19% line:83% align:start
What joy it is to hold
even a small piece of you!

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:18.452 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ALMOND]
All hail! All hail!

00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:19.954 position:33% line:89% align:start
[chattering]

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.255 position:35% line:83% align:start
[BELZEBUTH]
He's here!

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.357 position:24% line:83% align:start
Through this measly
scrap of hair.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.093 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm not concerned, Isaac.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
This version of Lord Claude is--

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.298 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's just say with a good
scheme, it'll be smooth sailing.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
Goodness. You should
really use a gentler touch

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:35.537 position:27% line:83% align:start
when dealing with
the demon lord!

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.138 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll do whatever it takes
to save our engagement!

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.274 position:19% line:83% align:start
And trust me, I'll be
very gentle and loving

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:41.743 position:21% line:89% align:start
once he can't escape.

00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:44.612 position:19% line:83% align:start
But first, I must have
him under my thumb.

00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:46.681 position:27% line:83% align:start
If I were in that
poor man's shoes,

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:48.750 position:24% line:83% align:start
it'd feel more akin
to falling off a cliff

00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:49.918 position:33% line:89% align:start
than in love.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.385 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:52.620 position:24% line:83% align:start
And yours truly will
give him a hardy push

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:53.788 position:33% line:89% align:start
off the edge!

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:55.255 position:13% line:89% align:start
Into the abyss of my love!

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:57.291 position:19% line:83% align:start
And then build a fence
around it so it's so high

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.793 position:24% line:89% align:start
he can't climb out!

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:31.284 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
An inspection of the kingdom?

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:32.820 position:38% line:83% align:start
[JASPER]
Yeah. How peculiar.

00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:35.089 position:21% line:83% align:start
Has the news not been
released that the demon lord

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:37.290 position:27% line:83% align:start
has lost both his
memories and his powers?

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:39.627 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JASPER] It has; that's why
he's doing all this.

00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:42.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
An "inspection" puts
him back out there.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.666 position:21% line:83% align:start
CÃ©dric and Lilia are
tagging along to boost

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
public opinion.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.869 position:19% line:89% align:start
Interesting selection.

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.170 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sure, but it makes sense
because I hear it was

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:52.140 position:19% line:83% align:start
Lady Lilia who thought
up and organized

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:53.708 position:24% line:89% align:start
this whole ordeal.

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:57.344 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Of course,
she was the one behind this.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:59.614 position:21% line:83% align:start
[LILIA] This world is
only a game, silly.

00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:02.150 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] There's a decent
chance this sets up another

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:05.153 position:13% line:89% align:start
turning point in the game.

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:08.422 position:16% line:83% align:start
Elephas. What would you do
to coax Lord Claude's poor,

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:11.926 position:10% line:83% align:start
clouded mind into remembering
his past, pray tell?

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.561 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nothing too complex.

00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:16.130 position:21% line:83% align:start
I would expose him to
memorable things from his past.

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:17.932 position:16% line:89% align:start
That might do the trick.

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:21.102 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, his exposure to me
didn't do a single thing.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.738 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, boo. I'm not memorable.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.073 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't despair, Miss.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.808 position:16% line:89% align:start
I doubt that's the issue.

00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:29.877 position:19% line:83% align:start
The power you hold and
his memories are at odds.

00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.680 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can't overlook the
holy sword you wield.

00:03:32.814 --> 00:03:35.917 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're saying the power from
the sword has something

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.951 position:30% line:89% align:start
to do with it?

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:38.251 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.420 position:19% line:83% align:start
His magic and memories
are intertwined,

00:03:40.555 --> 00:03:43.290 position:5% line:89% align:start
and the sword trumps his magic.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.026 position:19% line:83% align:start
Interacting with demons
that have magic

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.328 position:19% line:83% align:start
more similar to his own
might stimulate his memory.

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:49.864 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good idea.

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:52.900 position:16% line:83% align:start
My love has always had a
close bond with his demons.

00:03:53.034 --> 00:03:54.401 position:16% line:89% align:start
On the subject of demons,

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:56.403 position:13% line:83% align:start
people have been notifying
the paper en masse

00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:58.539 position:10% line:89% align:start
about sightings around town.

00:03:58.673 --> 00:04:00.373 position:21% line:83% align:start
The darlings must've
abandoned the forest

00:04:00.508 --> 00:04:02.844 position:13% line:89% align:start
to search for Lord Claude.

00:04:02.977 --> 00:04:04.377 position:24% line:89% align:start
What a coincidence.

00:04:04.512 --> 00:04:05.980 position:10% line:83% align:start
Could this little inspection
have something to do

00:04:06.114 --> 00:04:07.347 position:27% line:89% align:start
with the demons?

00:04:08.883 --> 00:04:10.918 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh. Here you are.

00:04:11.052 --> 00:04:12.153 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is from Denis.

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:13.788 position:16% line:89% align:start
He says it's a blueprint.

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:15.556 position:24% line:89% align:start
Perfect. Thank you.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.526 position:27% line:83% align:start
Explain. What are
the blueprints for?

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.728 position:35% line:83% align:start
Just a few
preparations to be safe.

00:04:20.862 --> 00:04:23.931 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well? Care to fill me in
on your next scheme?

00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:25.199 position:30% line:89% align:start
With pleasure.

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:27.935 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean to infiltrate
this inspection!

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:30.171 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Listen, darling.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.806 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you see me out and
about during the inspection

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.242 position:21% line:83% align:start
next week, be sure to
cover for me, okay?

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:35.676 position:30% line:89% align:start
What? But why?

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.712 position:27% line:83% align:start
You expect me to
protect an intruder?

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:39.312 position:13% line:89% align:start
How dare you barge in here!

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah! It's been three whole days!

00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:43.851 position:41% line:83% align:start
Please!
Just who do you think you are?

00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:46.286 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's simple--
I'm your fiancÃ©e!

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.656 position:27% line:89% align:start
Only temporarily.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.458 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll have to make it so that I
am to your body like water,

00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:54.028 position:16% line:83% align:start
and you'll slowly wither
away without me.

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:04.972 position:24% line:89% align:start
I brought a treat!

00:05:05.106 --> 00:05:07.575 position:19% line:83% align:start
An apple pie baked with
the utmost care and love!

00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:09.744 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
No, thank you.

00:05:09.877 --> 00:05:11.512 position:13% line:89% align:start
What's that you're reading?

00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:14.649 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hardly any of your concern.

00:05:14.782 --> 00:05:16.083 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is fun, isn't it?

00:05:16.217 --> 00:05:19.887 position:21% line:83% align:start
"Fun" isn't anywhere
near the word I'd use.

00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:22.690 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you know, I've never
experienced unrequited

00:05:22.824 --> 00:05:25.226 position:33% line:83% align:start
love before.
I find it a bit thrilling.

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:26.694 position:35% line:89% align:start
[knocking]

00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:29.429 position:21% line:83% align:start
[LILIA] Lord Claude?
Are you awake in there?

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:35.036 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stay! And don't utter one peep!

00:05:38.573 --> 00:05:39.607 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LILIA]
Good morning!

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.441 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're looking well today.

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:42.677 position:30% line:89% align:start
Why, thank you.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.245 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is there something
that you needed?

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:46.881 position:19% line:83% align:start
We simply came here to
notify you of a few changes

00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:48.516 position:16% line:89% align:start
to the inspection route.

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:51.484 position:16% line:83% align:start
And to hand deliver these
cookies I baked for you!

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:53.386 position:10% line:89% align:start
Would you like to have some?

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:55.923 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh?

00:05:56.057 --> 00:05:57.592 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's inside there?

00:05:57.725 --> 00:05:59.594 position:24% line:89% align:start
Smells like sweets.

00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:01.662 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes. That's, uh...

00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:03.396 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just a little something
I had the servants

00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:05.299 position:24% line:83% align:start
throw together in
case I got hungry.

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:08.536 position:13% line:83% align:start
Aw, so your sweet cravings
are satisfied, too bad.

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.005 position:24% line:83% align:start
What am I supposed
to do with these, then?

00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:14.441 position:24% line:83% align:start
Fear not, for they
won't go to waste.

00:06:14.575 --> 00:06:16.878 position:21% line:83% align:start
Prepare some tea and
we'll eat them right now.

00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:18.179 position:41% line:89% align:start
Lovely!

00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:23.517 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] He can eat her crusty
cookies but not my apple pie?

00:06:23.651 --> 00:06:26.053 position:27% line:83% align:start
Circling back to
the inspection,

00:06:26.187 --> 00:06:28.322 position:10% line:83% align:start
there's been an unprecedented
amount of demons

00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:29.891 position:24% line:89% align:start
within city limits.

00:06:30.024 --> 00:06:31.259 position:27% line:89% align:start
Demons, you say?

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:34.161 position:16% line:83% align:start
We shouldn't have issues,
but the knights-in-training

00:06:34.295 --> 00:06:36.030 position:5% line:89% align:start
will be on patrol just in case.

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:38.933 position:13% line:83% align:start
Only the littlest of demons
have appeared so far.

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:42.469 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh! I forgot!

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:45.306 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have an appointment to get
fitted for my inspection dress.

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:46.674 position:24% line:89% align:start
I should get going.

00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:48.643 position:5% line:89% align:start
CÃ©dric, must you leave, as well?

00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:51.279 position:13% line:89% align:start
No. I can stay for a while.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.947 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now wait a minute, Lord Claude.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.983 position:7% line:83% align:start
You've still yet to try one of
my delicious cookies, yes?

00:06:56.117 --> 00:06:58.886 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't leave until you
at least take a bite.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.955 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ready? Say "ah."

00:07:03.324 --> 00:07:05.092 position:5% line:89% align:start
This feels highly inappropriate.

00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:08.129 position:10% line:83% align:start

00:13:36.317 --> 00:13:38.352 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes. He may not look fearsome,

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:40.755 position:19% line:83% align:start
but this strapping young
lad was able to take down

00:13:40.888 --> 00:13:42.156 position:30% line:83% align:start

00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:48.028 position:10% line:83% align:start

the potential for much more.

The potential for
what, I wonder?

00:14:15.724 --> 00:14:17.057 position:19% line:89% align:start
Are you threatening me?

00:14:17.191 --> 00:14:18.560 position:19% line:89% align:start
Say they do behead you.

00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:22.096 position:24% line:83% align:start
So? That would mean
I'd finally be rid of you!

She won't be convinced.

00:14:26.701 --> 00:14:29.671 position:19% line:83% align:start
She's simply that type
of woman, I suppose.

00:14:29.804 --> 00:14:31.639 position:10% line:89% align:start
You have duties to attend to.

Ha! I'd like to see you try.

00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:37.878 position:16% line:83% align:start
That would make a rather

Could've been worse, princey.

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:44.385 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:15:18.285 --> 00:15:21.155 position:21% line:83% align:start
No wonder my brother's
been so worried lately.

00:15:23.858 --> 00:15:25.693 position:13% line:89% align:start
Lord Claude's been worried?

00:15:25.827 --> 00:15:27.529 position:38% line:89% align:start
But why?

00:15:27.662 --> 00:15:31.633 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS] Lady Aileen, the
carriage is nearing departure.

00:15:31.766 --> 00:15:33.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh. Thank you.

00:15:33.835 --> 00:15:35.904 position:10% line:89% align:start
And are things going to plan?

00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:37.371 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS]
Indeed.

00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:39.106 position:10% line:83% align:start
The appropriate preparations
have been made.

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:41.141 position:16% line:83% align:start
Additionally, I uncovered
the mastermind behind

00:15:41.275 --> 00:15:42.943 position:30% line:89% align:start
the inspection.

00:15:43.076 --> 00:15:44.344 position:30% line:89% align:start
The mastermind?

00:15:44.478 --> 00:15:46.648 position:24% line:83% align:start
You mean it wasn't
Prince CÃ©dric, then?

00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:49.684 position:19% line:83% align:start
It was some official by
the name Leicester Crane.

00:15:49.818 --> 00:15:53.420 position:19% line:83% align:start
He was also the one who
drafted the inspection route.

00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:55.523 position:33% line:89% align:start
That name...

00:15:55.657 --> 00:15:58.425 position:10% line:83% align:start
He's a romanceable character
from the first game.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.995 position:21% line:83% align:start
He had a rather calm
and militant nature.

00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:03.464 position:38% line:89% align:start
I wonder.

00:16:03.598 --> 00:16:05.365 position:19% line:83% align:start
Since Lady Lilia knows
the contents of the game,

00:16:05.499 --> 00:16:07.468 position:30% line:83% align:start
has she already
captured his heart?

00:16:14.843 --> 00:16:16.410 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
It's as I thought.

00:16:16.544 --> 00:16:19.581 position:10% line:83% align:start
Distancing myself from Aileen
is of paramount importance.

00:16:19.714 --> 00:16:22.115 position:30% line:83% align:start

[LILIA] Apologies for
the wait, Lord Claude!

00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:28.623 position:13% line:89% align:start
And where might CÃ©dric be?

00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:31.492 position:30% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately,
he suddenly fell ill.

00:16:31.626 --> 00:16:34.529 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's going to stay at
the castle and rest today.

00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:37.431 position:30% line:83% align:start
As his fianceÃ©,
shouldn't you be by his side?

00:16:37.565 --> 00:16:39.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
I worry how we'll be perceived.

You're my future brother-in-law,

00:16:44.606 --> 00:16:46.975 position:27% line:83% align:start

00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:18.820 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're the one in my lord's way!

00:20:18.953 --> 00:20:21.089 position:35% line:89% align:start
Disappear!

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:23.323 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] The demons are
intimately connected to Lord

00:20:23.457 --> 00:20:25.693 position:16% line:89% align:start
Claude's heart and mind.

00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:27.962 position:30% line:83% align:start
Does that mean
that his wish is...?

00:20:28.096 --> 00:20:29.296 position:16% line:89% align:start
Disappear from his sight!

00:20:29.429 --> 00:20:31.199 position:41% line:89% align:start
Go now!

00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:33.601 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
...to be rid of me?

00:20:33.735 --> 00:20:35.335 position:38% line:89% align:start
Forever?

00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:37.270 position:30% line:83% align:start
[DEMON CYCLOPS]
Disappear!

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:38.740 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE]
Ailey! Look out!

00:20:38.873 --> 00:20:41.976 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, Walt! Kyle!
Ready your guns!

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.978 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Don't kill him!

00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:45.312 position:21% line:89% align:start
Think of Lord Claude.

00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:46.681 position:21% line:89% align:start
He would be crushed.

00:20:46.814 --> 00:20:48.750 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:03.798 position:35% line:89% align:start
Poor fool.

00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:09.003 position:13% line:83% align:start
His fragile state made him
misunderstand my lord's wish.

00:21:09.137 --> 00:21:10.470 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sir.

00:21:10.605 --> 00:21:13.775 position:16% line:83% align:start
We strive to follow your
orders as best we can.

00:21:13.908 --> 00:21:20.047 position:7% line:83% align:start
As such, if you order us away,
then away we shall go.

00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:31.626 position:30% line:89% align:start
My Lord Claude.

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:34.028 position:19% line:83% align:start
Seems I must be on your
mind all hours of the day,

00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:37.765 position:16% line:83% align:start
if ridding yourself of me
is your greatest desire.

00:21:37.899 --> 00:21:41.368 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, flash a smile.
You're a pro these days.

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:50.178 position:7% line:83% align:start
First rule of unrequited love:
Set your expectations at zero.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.579 position:33% line:89% align:start
But still...

00:22:03.157 --> 00:22:06.828 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I am so in your way,
then I shall be gone as well!

00:22:06.961 --> 00:22:09.797 position:13% line:83% align:start
And rest assured, you will
not see me at the ball!
