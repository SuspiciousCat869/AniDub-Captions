00:07:17.038 --> 00:07:18.839 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're an embarrassment
of a fiancÃ©e!

00:07:18.973 --> 00:07:21.842 position:10% line:83% align:start
I knew you were a fool, but
you can't even order coffee.

00:07:23.344 --> 00:07:26.446 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your behavior towards
this lady is reproachable.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.481 position:41% line:89% align:start
Can it!

00:07:28.616 --> 00:07:30.184 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:07:30.318 --> 00:07:32.452 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who the hell are you? Speak up!

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:34.422 position:5% line:89% align:start
Transfer student, Ailey Calois.

00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:35.923 position:19% line:89% align:start
Get to your feet, sir.

00:07:36.057 --> 00:07:37.825 position:30% line:83% align:start
She deserves an
immediate apology.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.194 position:30% line:83% align:start
Absolutely not!
Apologize to a girl?

00:07:40.328 --> 00:07:42.263 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] I've heard the male
chauvinism runs rampant

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:45.599 position:16% line:83% align:start
at this academy, but it's
worse than expected.

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:47.802 position:21% line:83% align:start
You all should know,
I'm surely not a believer

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:51.072 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the old teachings on
the Holy Sword Maiden.

00:07:51.205 --> 00:07:52.206 position:35% line:89% align:start
Need help?

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.775 position:13% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT A] What happened?
Did I miss something?

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:57.912 position:19% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT B] Why would a
guy like that enroll here?

00:07:58.045 --> 00:08:00.348 position:21% line:83% align:start
I advise ending your
engagement with that louse

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.716 position:19% line:89% align:start
as quickly as you can.

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:04.352 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your life will be better for it.

00:08:04.518 --> 00:08:06.787 position:30% line:83% align:start
I must be going.
Adieu, fair miss.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.995 position:10% line:89% align:start
Impressive skills, my friend!

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.665 position:27% line:89% align:start
What an imbecile!

00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:20.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
I specifically instructed
her to lay low!

00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:22.770 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is the student
council room.

00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:34.281 position:10% line:83% align:start
Look at that, we're getting a
rare sighting of Kyle and Walt!

00:08:34.415 --> 00:08:36.984 position:21% line:83% align:start
My, newcomer, it must
be your lucky day.

00:08:37.118 --> 00:08:39.553 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kyle was seeking reprieve
from his admirers,

00:08:39.687 --> 00:08:40.855 position:24% line:89% align:start
and I tagged along.

00:08:40.988 --> 00:08:43.190 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hush. As far as mobs go,
I can't complain.

00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:44.692 position:21% line:89% align:start
[WALT, AUGUSTE laugh]

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:47.862 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Auguste. Walt. And Kyle.

00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:51.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the second game, each one of
them is a romanceable character.

00:08:52.133 --> 00:08:53.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
There are different
ways you can play,

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.504 position:16% line:89% align:start
but in the "best" ending,

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:58.739 position:7% line:83% align:start
Auguste uses Lilia's holy sword
to defeat the final boss.

00:08:58.873 --> 00:09:00.741 position:16% line:89% align:start
We haven't met. You are?

00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:02.943 position:13% line:89% align:start
Right! I just transferred.

00:09:03.077 --> 00:09:05.780 position:21% line:83% align:start
Pleased to meet you,
my name is Ailey Calois.

00:09:05.913 --> 00:09:09.150 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ah. You have a very
pretty face, Sir Ailey.

00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:11.852 position:19% line:83% align:start
A face you can observe
from way over there.

00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:21.228 position:19% line:89% align:start
What happened to haste?

00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:22.763 position:21% line:83% align:start
You were supposed to
bring him here the second

00:09:22.897 --> 00:09:24.198 position:21% line:89% align:start
he stepped on campus.

00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:26.233 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AUGUSTE] I rushed him
over as fast as I could.

00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:28.469 position:13% line:89% align:start
Apologies, President James.

00:09:28.602 --> 00:09:30.171 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
James Charles.

00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:35.109 position:7% line:83% align:start
The student council president,
and this game's final boss.

00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:47.955 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] James is a half-demon,
and was a prime candidate

00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:50.991 position:21% line:83% align:start
to be the next Grand
Duke of Mirchetta.

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:53.294 position:21% line:83% align:start
But his high standing
made him a target.

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:55.329 position:27% line:83% align:start
A powerful church
within the grand duchy

00:09:55.463 --> 00:09:58.799 position:13% line:83% align:start
constantly sends assassins
to do the poor guy in.

00:09:58.933 --> 00:10:00.968 position:7% line:89% align:start
In the midst of this distress,

00:10:01.102 --> 00:10:03.437 position:21% line:83% align:start
he pronounces himself
the demon lord's successor

00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:06.273 position:10% line:89% align:start
and attacks the grand duchy.

00:10:06.407 --> 00:10:09.009 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sure I can stop him
from becoming the boss!

00:10:09.143 --> 00:10:10.978 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll just have to
tame James, too.

00:10:11.112 --> 00:10:14.381 position:13% line:83% align:start
For the kingdom and for my
darling Lord Claude, of course!

00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:17.552 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, you're the
infamous Ailey Calois.

00:10:17.685 --> 00:10:18.953 position:27% line:83% align:start
You've been here
a fraction of a day,

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:20.621 position:19% line:83% align:start
and yet you've already
caused trouble.

00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:22.156 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now, James.

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:23.824 position:19% line:83% align:start
He was standing up for
what he thought was right.

00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.226 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JAMES] Every time you
attempt to play the hero,

00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:26.727 position:19% line:89% align:start
you waste your breath.

00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:29.797 position:16% line:83% align:start
The only law that exists
within this academy is me.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.365 position:30% line:89% align:start
Remember that.

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:40.441 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] This is how kids
would bully me when I was

00:10:40.575 --> 00:10:42.042 position:27% line:89% align:start
CÃ©dric's fiancÃ©e.

00:10:42.176 --> 00:10:45.112 position:27% line:89% align:start
[STUDENTS laugh]

00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:47.681 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wanted to check in,
are you doing all right?

00:10:47.815 --> 00:10:49.416 position:16% line:89% align:start
The girl from yesterday.

00:10:49.551 --> 00:10:50.851 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're, uh...

00:10:50.985 --> 00:10:53.287 position:19% line:83% align:start
Rachel Danis, I forgot
to give you my name.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.557 position:19% line:89% align:start
Rachel Danis, you say?

00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:58.159 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes. Have I done
something to offend you?

00:10:58.292 --> 00:10:59.628 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not at all.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.996 position:5% line:83% align:start
You just happen to have the same
name as another girl I know.

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:03.998 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see, what a funny coincidence.

00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:06.568 position:24% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT A] Rachel!
What are you doing with him?

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.602 position:30% line:89% align:start
Get over here!

00:11:07.735 --> 00:11:09.003 position:33% line:89% align:start
I should go.

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:12.072 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Rachel Danis.

00:11:12.206 --> 00:11:14.875 position:21% line:83% align:start
She's supposed to be
this game's villainess.

00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:17.311 position:30% line:83% align:start
Her personality
isn't what I expected.

00:11:17.444 --> 00:11:19.446 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KOENIG] Not only have you
proven yourself a troublemaker,

00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:21.482 position:10% line:83% align:start
but it appears you've already
managed to misplace

00:11:21.616 --> 00:11:22.783 position:30% line:89% align:start
your textbook.

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:25.119 position:24% line:83% align:start
What a joy to teach
you're sure to be.

00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:28.088 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's the answer to the
question on page 137?

00:11:28.222 --> 00:11:29.957 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's three.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.692 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well done, young man, correct.

00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:34.361 position:5% line:83% align:start

Close call.

00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:42.736 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm glad my brain held onto
that random information.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.441 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Is that...?

00:11:48.142 --> 00:11:50.144 position:21% line:83% align:start
You want me to deliver
this letter to Auguste?

00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:52.647 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yes, please. Lord Auguste went
out of his way to stand up

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.416 position:10% line:83% align:start
to my boyfriend when he was
yelling at me the other day.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.384 position:13% line:83% align:start
This felt like the best way
to tell him thank you

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:58.587 position:30% line:89% align:start
for all he did.

00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:00.287 position:27% line:89% align:start
Consider it done.

00:12:00.421 --> 00:12:01.989 position:10% line:83% align:start
And just so you're aware, if
you're having serious troubles

00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:03.592 position:21% line:83% align:start
with your boyfriend,
I would be more than happy

00:12:03.724 --> 00:12:05.159 position:5% line:89% align:start
to help you end things with him.

00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:07.228 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ah! You would do that for me?

00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:08.597 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course!

00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:10.464 position:10% line:83% align:start
But you'll have to be strong
enough to bring it up

00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:12.266 position:10% line:83% align:start
to him yourself, even though
it could be very difficult.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.401 position:24% line:83% align:start
Try to channel the
courage of Lady Lilia,

00:12:14.536 --> 00:12:15.869 position:19% line:89% align:start
the Holy Sword Maiden!

00:12:16.003 --> 00:12:17.672 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right. I will!

00:12:17.805 --> 00:12:20.441 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Selena Gilbert is
the heroine of this game,

00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:23.277 position:13% line:83% align:start
so it makes sense she adores
the heroine of the last game,

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.546 position:35% line:89% align:start
AKA Lilia.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:26.947 position:19% line:83% align:start
Much like Lilia, Selena
was born a commoner,

00:12:27.081 --> 00:12:29.316 position:7% line:89% align:start
but her father became a baron.

[AUGUSTE]
Ailey.

00:12:31.018 --> 00:12:32.820 position:21% line:83% align:start
I heard what happened
to your textbook.

00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:34.188 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you all right?

00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:35.222 position:35% line:89% align:start
Absolutely.

00:12:35.356 --> 00:12:36.890 position:24% line:83% align:start

[SELENA]
Auguste!

00:12:38.727 --> 00:12:40.995 position:7% line:83% align:start
Would you be able to walk home
together after class today?

00:12:41.128 --> 00:12:43.397 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've received yet another
delivery for you.

00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:45.533 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've been a bit overwhelmed
with all these requests

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:47.134 position:38% line:89% align:start
of late.

00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:49.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
How about we discuss it
in the student council room?

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:50.771 position:21% line:83% align:start
That way we can avoid
any passersby getting

00:12:50.904 --> 00:12:53.040 position:30% line:89% align:start
the wrong idea.

00:12:53.173 --> 00:12:55.075 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] Weird, he won't
walk home with her?

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:57.378 position:19% line:83% align:start
Her favorability rating
must be too low.

00:12:57.512 --> 00:12:59.380 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe things aren't
progressing like they did

00:12:59.514 --> 00:13:00.914 position:21% line:89% align:start
in the original game.

00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:02.517 position:10% line:83% align:start
You should be more concerned
with what passersby

00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:04.084 position:19% line:89% align:start
think of your friends.

00:13:04.218 --> 00:13:05.620 position:13% line:83% align:start
You'd really associate with
someone who denounced

the Holy Sword Maiden?

00:13:08.623 --> 00:13:10.958 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oops. I should've mentioned
Selena's a big fan of

00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:12.426 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lady Lilia's.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.362 position:16% line:83% align:start
The two of them have even
exchanged letters before.

00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:17.131 position:30% line:83% align:start
I mentioned the
Holy Sword Maiden,

00:13:17.264 --> 00:13:19.900 position:27% line:83% align:start
but Lady Lilia no
longer holds that title.

00:13:20.034 --> 00:13:22.102 position:16% line:83% align:start
Make certain not to say
that in front of Selena!

00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:24.371 position:13% line:83% align:start
And don't bring up Aileen
d'Autriche unless you want

00:13:24.506 --> 00:13:25.674 position:35% line:89% align:start
an earful.

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:27.609 position:21% line:83% align:start
She despises her and
believes she should return

00:13:27.742 --> 00:13:30.377 position:24% line:89% align:start
Lady Lilia's sword.

00:13:30.512 --> 00:13:33.480 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you're not busy, I actually
have a favor I wanted to ask

00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:34.649 position:41% line:89% align:start
of you.

00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:36.751 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KEITH]
Lord Claude.

00:13:36.884 --> 00:13:38.653 position:19% line:83% align:start
Members of the guardian
association are here to discuss

00:13:38.787 --> 00:13:40.954 position:13% line:89% align:start
an issue at Mische Academy.

00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:43.424 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
I see. You can send them in.

00:13:48.195 --> 00:13:50.431 position:24% line:83% align:start
Suppose I send her
a letter using magic.

00:13:50.565 --> 00:13:52.299 position:30% line:83% align:start
Would that be a
breach of her rule?

00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:55.869 position:5% line:83% align:start
I worry that even the slightest
use of magic would provoke her.

00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:57.304 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right.

00:13:57.438 --> 00:13:59.907 position:16% line:83% align:start
In that case, ask Almond
to deliver it for me.

00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:03.745 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, and you should know.

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:06.013 position:19% line:83% align:start
The prodigal son of the
Grand Duke of Mirchetta

00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:07.881 position:16% line:83% align:start
has been investing rather
large sums of money

00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:09.651 position:10% line:89% align:start
in that questionable church.

00:14:09.784 --> 00:14:12.886 position:10% line:83% align:start
It seems he's trying to have
his nephew assassinated.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.522 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nephew.

00:14:14.656 --> 00:14:17.692 position:10% line:83% align:start
So his deceased older sister
had an illegitimate child?

00:14:17.826 --> 00:14:19.126 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KEITH]
Indeed.

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:21.261 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nearly 20 years ago,
she eloped with a demon--

00:14:21.395 --> 00:14:23.130 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the shadows, of course.

00:14:23.263 --> 00:14:26.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
Shortly after, a half-demon
was born out of this union.

00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:29.604 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now the duke's son
is worried his nephew

00:14:29.738 --> 00:14:32.306 position:21% line:83% align:start
will be chosen to be
the next ruler over him.

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:35.342 position:13% line:83% align:start
He also believes his nephew
is the demon, Ashtarte.

00:14:35.476 --> 00:14:39.079 position:16% line:83% align:start
These concerns have made
the man quite unstable.

00:14:39.213 --> 00:14:40.247 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's good to know.

00:14:40.381 --> 00:14:42.082 position:19% line:89% align:start
I will keep it in mind.

00:14:45.687 --> 00:14:47.321 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AILEEN groans]

00:14:47.454 --> 00:14:48.222 position:27% line:89% align:start
Lots of groaning.

00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:49.657 position:10% line:89% align:start
Something you wish to report?

00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:51.492 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Well, you see...

00:14:51.626 --> 00:14:53.127 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm thinking that I
could benefit heavily

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.829 position:27% line:83% align:start
from joining the
student council.

00:14:54.962 --> 00:14:56.130 position:33% line:89% align:start
[ISAAC sighs]

00:14:56.263 --> 00:14:58.132 position:5% line:89% align:start
I implored you not to stand out!

00:14:58.265 --> 00:15:00.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have greater issues
than my stardom.

00:15:00.401 --> 00:15:02.570 position:10% line:83% align:start
I received a letter from Lord
Claude and it's alarming,

00:15:02.704 --> 00:15:03.571 position:27% line:89% align:start
to say the least.

00:15:03.705 --> 00:15:04.672 position:19% line:89% align:start
You've been discovered?

00:15:04.806 --> 00:15:06.841 position:38% line:83% align:start

No! It's not that.

00:15:06.974 --> 00:15:11.211 position:10% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE] Before you, my love,
I'm reduced to a foolish boy.

00:15:11.345 --> 00:15:13.615 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have become my entire world.

00:15:13.748 --> 00:15:15.949 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thus, if my time with you ends,

00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:18.620 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll ensure that the
world ends with it.

00:15:18.753 --> 00:15:21.556 position:7% line:83% align:start
I lie awake at night wondering
could a goddess like you

00:15:21.689 --> 00:15:24.091 position:27% line:83% align:start
be racked with the
same irrationality?

00:15:24.224 --> 00:15:26.761 position:21% line:83% align:start
My love burns bright,
and yet you've forced me

00:15:26.895 --> 00:15:28.262 position:21% line:89% align:start
to dwell in yearning.

00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:31.365 position:19% line:83% align:start
All I wish is to plunge
into its flames.

00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:33.768 position:10% line:89% align:start
I await your reply, my love.

Claude Jeanne Elmir.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.970 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] How does one begin
to reply to a letter filled

00:15:37.104 --> 00:15:39.039 position:24% line:89% align:start
with such passion?!

00:15:40.642 --> 00:15:43.578 position:7% line:83% align:start
This new friend of yours wants
a spot on the student council?

00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:45.613 position:21% line:83% align:start
I believe a transfer
student on the team

00:15:45.747 --> 00:15:47.181 position:13% line:89% align:start
would be a positive change.

00:15:47.314 --> 00:15:49.450 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's true I'm not entirely
familiar with the ways

00:15:49.584 --> 00:15:50.552 position:30% line:89% align:start
of the academy.

00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:52.352 position:24% line:83% align:start
That said, as more
of an outsider,

00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:54.121 position:16% line:83% align:start
I believe I could provide
a different perspective

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:55.657 position:24% line:89% align:start
on school matters.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.726 position:19% line:83% align:start
This academy functions
as a mirror of Mirchetta.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.196 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thus, the student council
mirrors its government.

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:03.832 position:21% line:83% align:start
It would be foolish
to grant a foreigner

00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:06.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
a leadership position in a
group they don't understand.

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:08.202 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think he would
make a great addition.

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:10.237 position:21% line:83% align:start
It isn't uncommon for
governments to scout counsel

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.706 position:21% line:89% align:start
from outside regions.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.008 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I'm not one to say
no to another comrade.

00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:16.544 position:24% line:83% align:start
Before we continue
this discussion,

00:16:16.678 --> 00:16:19.313 position:19% line:83% align:start
let's see if he has any
counsel worth scouting.

00:16:19.446 --> 00:16:21.148 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
What can I do to prove myself?

00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:22.884 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JAMES]
Investigate.

00:16:23.016 --> 00:16:25.486 position:10% line:83% align:start
A female student was injured
under mysterious circumstances.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.354 position:24% line:83% align:start
The most prevalent
rumor circulating says

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:29.156 position:10% line:89% align:start
it was the work of a vampire.

00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:30.592 position:33% line:89% align:start
How peculiar.

00:16:30.725 --> 00:16:33.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
You suspect it's some
sort of demon?

00:16:33.393 --> 00:16:35.262 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JAMES] The student
was found unconscious.

00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:38.298 position:13% line:83% align:start
She had a wound suggesting
her blood had been sucked.

00:16:38.432 --> 00:16:41.736 position:16% line:83% align:start
The victim herself had no
memories of the incident.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.471 position:16% line:83% align:start
The guardian association
heard, and has gone so far

00:16:44.606 --> 00:16:46.541 position:27% line:83% align:start
as to consult the
grand duke's proxy.

00:16:46.674 --> 00:16:48.543 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] They must be
concerned to trouble him.

00:16:48.676 --> 00:16:52.279 position:7% line:83% align:start
They contacted the demon lord?
How brazen of them.

00:16:52.412 --> 00:16:54.114 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JAMES] What's more, there
are those suspicious that

00:16:54.248 --> 00:16:55.884 position:7% line:89% align:start
the demon lord is the culprit.

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:58.686 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm willing and fully capable
of solving this case!

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.255 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll catch them with
evidence, not suspicion!

00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:03.156 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] I can't let these
people think Lord Claude

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.159 position:24% line:83% align:start
attacked a student!
He would never!

00:17:06.293 --> 00:17:08.195 position:33% line:83% align:start
In that case,
I'll leave it to you.

00:17:08.328 --> 00:17:09.931 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you succeed in
finding the culprit,

00:17:10.063 --> 00:17:11.766 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll let you join the council.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.433 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Just one question.

00:17:13.568 --> 00:17:16.638 position:10% line:83% align:start
Will you grant me permission
to create a security force?

00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:18.238 position:38% line:89% align:start
For what?

00:17:18.372 --> 00:17:19.807 position:10% line:83% align:start
If there is a demon involved,
we're better off safe

00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:21.609 position:27% line:89% align:start
than sorry, yes?

00:17:21.743 --> 00:17:22.877 position:16% line:89% align:start
Your point is justified.

00:17:23.011 --> 00:17:25.747 position:19% line:83% align:start
But before implementing
changes in security,

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.315 position:13% line:83% align:start
you'll need the director of
the academy to sign this.

00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:32.787 position:13% line:83% align:start
At the moment, that would
be the grand duke's proxy.

00:17:32.921 --> 00:17:34.522 position:35% line:89% align:start
What, now?

00:17:34.656 --> 00:17:36.323 position:10% line:83% align:start
I shouldn't have to tell you
that the director of our school

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:37.892 position:24% line:89% align:start
is the Grand Duke.

00:17:38.026 --> 00:17:40.294 position:16% line:83% align:start
Obviously his proxy will
fill the role while he cannot.

00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:42.797 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't say that was an
aspect I was aware of.

00:17:42.931 --> 00:17:45.132 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, you would throw yourself
headfirst into a vampire

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:48.468 position:16% line:83% align:start
investigation, but you're
scared of the demon lord?

00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:53.407 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Hmm.

00:17:53.541 --> 00:17:55.577 position:21% line:83% align:start
Perhaps I can hire a
craftsman to make a replica

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.512 position:30% line:83% align:start
of Aileen in the
form of a pillow.

00:17:57.645 --> 00:17:59.446 position:33% line:83% align:start
I've observed
something of you lately.

00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:01.816 position:16% line:83% align:start
It appears your weariness
and lovesickness increase

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.818 position:33% line:89% align:start
in parallel.

00:18:03.952 --> 00:18:06.788 position:13% line:83% align:start
By the way, a student from
the academy is coming by.

00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:09.489 position:16% line:83% align:start
I believe they said they
need a signature from you.

00:18:09.624 --> 00:18:11.124 position:35% line:89% align:start
[knocking]

00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:13.795 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're welcome to enter.

00:18:16.898 --> 00:18:18.098 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KEITH]
Uh...

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:40.688 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't help but ask,
why might you be a duck?

00:18:45.459 --> 00:18:48.195 position:24% line:83% align:start
There is a student
inside of there, yes?

00:18:50.031 --> 00:18:52.165 position:24% line:83% align:start
An unimportant duck
wouldn't be responsible

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:53.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
for important documents.

00:18:58.039 --> 00:19:00.942 position:19% line:83% align:start
I am certain the symbol
of the academy is a lily.

00:19:01.075 --> 00:19:03.911 position:10% line:83% align:start
It represents the Holy Sword
Maiden, not a duck.

00:19:06.213 --> 00:19:07.414 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ALMOND]
Caw!

00:19:08.348 --> 00:19:09.684 position:30% line:89% align:start
I've returned!

00:19:09.817 --> 00:19:11.986 position:19% line:83% align:start
I kept Aileen's reply
safe for you, my lord!

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.253 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Hm.

00:19:13.387 --> 00:19:14.822 position:10% line:89% align:start
You have my permission, duck.

00:19:14.956 --> 00:19:18.158 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hopefully this force will help
prevent future incidents.

00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:19.794 position:33% line:89% align:start
Be diligent.

00:19:21.763 --> 00:19:23.865 position:7% line:89% align:start
Good bird. Great work, Almond.

00:19:23.998 --> 00:19:25.833 position:5% line:89% align:start
Compliments and head scratches?

00:19:26.901 --> 00:19:29.202 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
To my beloved Lord Claude.

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:31.238 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm doing very well over here.

00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:33.306 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hope you continue
to work hard.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.743 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aileen Lauren d'Autriche.

00:19:37.945 --> 00:19:39.179 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KEITH]
Hm...

00:19:39.312 --> 00:19:41.348 position:27% line:89% align:start
[CLAUDE whimpers]

00:19:43.751 --> 00:19:45.953 position:30% line:83% align:start
I successfully
bamboozled him as a duck.

00:19:46.087 --> 00:19:48.321 position:13% line:83% align:start
And that thoughtless letter
worked to divert his attention

00:19:48.455 --> 00:19:49.657 position:33% line:89% align:start
away from me.

00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:52.426 position:21% line:83% align:start
What genius concocted
a plan so lovely?

00:20:01.569 --> 00:20:03.437 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] The rain didn't let
up until I wrote a reply

00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:06.674 position:7% line:83% align:start
that was up to his aggressively
passionate standards.

00:20:10.178 --> 00:20:11.612 position:38% line:89% align:start
Goodness!

00:20:11.746 --> 00:20:13.781 position:16% line:83% align:start
I had to whip out all my
womanly wiles for that letter!

00:20:13.915 --> 00:20:15.950 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe you should hush
about your womanly wiles

00:20:16.084 --> 00:20:17.250 position:19% line:89% align:start
in your masculine form.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:18.920 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oops, you're right. Boy time.

00:20:19.053 --> 00:20:20.621 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC]
What's your rationale here?

00:20:20.755 --> 00:20:22.590 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why make a security force?

00:20:22.724 --> 00:20:25.693 position:5% line:83% align:start
If anything fishy happens, we'll
be the first to know about it.

00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:27.829 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have a strong feeling
this whole vampire ordeal

00:20:27.962 --> 00:20:29.797 position:30% line:83% align:start
has something to
do with Ashtarte.

00:20:29.931 --> 00:20:30.932 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC]
Shh!

00:20:33.868 --> 00:20:35.235 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's Rachel!

00:20:35.368 --> 00:20:37.972 position:10% line:83% align:start
I remember her; she's the one
you protected on your first day.

00:20:38.106 --> 00:20:39.507 position:13% line:89% align:start
I even sold all my dresses.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.409 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, but I-- I still
don't have the money.

00:20:42.543 --> 00:20:43.878 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait, I know him!

00:20:45.847 --> 00:20:48.716 position:19% line:83% align:start
You realize how easy it
would be to tell them the truth.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.384 position:13% line:83% align:start
That the culprit behind the
gruesome vampire attack

00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:53.621 position:21% line:83% align:start
was none other than
little Rachel Danis.

00:20:53.755 --> 00:20:55.223 position:38% line:83% align:start
[RACHEL]
No, you can't!

00:20:55.355 --> 00:20:56.958 position:16% line:83% align:start
[WALT] To think Professor
Koenig has been the perpetrator

00:20:57.091 --> 00:20:58.693 position:27% line:89% align:start
this whole time.

00:20:58.826 --> 00:21:00.228 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
My goodness, Walt!

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.763 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why are you out so late?

00:21:01.896 --> 00:21:03.396 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me that seniors
aren't allowed to join

00:21:03.531 --> 00:21:04.999 position:24% line:89% align:start
the security force!

00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:06.466 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't believe we've met.

00:21:06.601 --> 00:21:09.336 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh. Hello, I'm a childhood
friend of Ailey's.

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:12.039 position:24% line:83% align:start
The academy brought
us back together.

00:21:12.173 --> 00:21:14.208 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well. We should probably
get the names of those two

00:21:14.341 --> 00:21:16.343 position:7% line:89% align:start
to James as quickly as we can.

00:21:16.476 --> 00:21:17.912 position:30% line:83% align:start
Since you don't
have enough money,

00:21:18.045 --> 00:21:20.014 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid you're going
to have to pay the rest

00:21:20.148 --> 00:21:21.348 position:24% line:89% align:start
in a different way.

00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:22.984 position:30% line:89% align:start
[RACHEL gasps]

00:21:23.117 --> 00:21:24.952 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KOENIG] When you wake up,
you'll appear to be nothing more

00:21:25.086 --> 00:21:27.522 position:24% line:83% align:start
than another victim
of the vampire.

00:21:27.655 --> 00:21:29.957 position:21% line:83% align:start
In reality, it'll be
the work of a de--

00:21:31.826 --> 00:21:33.761 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now, Isaac, tend to Rachel!

00:21:35.163 --> 00:21:36.463 position:38% line:89% align:start
Got her!

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:38.065 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? Sir Ailey?

00:21:38.199 --> 00:21:41.769 position:7% line:83% align:start
Ugh. You're in for yet another
spectacle, I'm sure.

00:21:46.641 --> 00:21:49.877 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] How did he get so
far away from me so fast?

00:21:50.011 --> 00:21:51.078 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's strange.

00:21:51.212 --> 00:21:53.313 position:24% line:83% align:start
Something out here
smells weirdly sweet.

00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:56.617 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KOENIG yells]

00:22:05.827 --> 00:22:08.996 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Is that... James?

00:22:12.767 --> 00:22:15.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why is he already
in his demon form?
