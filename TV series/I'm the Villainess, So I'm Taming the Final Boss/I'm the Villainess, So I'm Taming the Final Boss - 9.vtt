CÃ©dric, how do you do?

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:19.621 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's quite unusual to
see you here, brother.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:22.289 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm here because the dowager
empress summoned me.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:24.124 position:13% line:89% align:start
A summons from Grandmother?

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:26.393 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, you have my sympathies.

00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:27.762 position:35% line:89% align:start
As do you.

00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:31.164 position:10% line:83% align:start
That is to say, my apologies
for making you worry.

Me, worry?

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:34.836 position:16% line:83% align:start
Has it truly slipped your
mind that we're both

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.370 position:16% line:89% align:start
competing for the throne?

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:39.807 position:21% line:83% align:start
Neither you nor I vie
to occupy the throne.

00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:41.809 position:7% line:89% align:start
It certainly seems like we do.

00:00:41.943 --> 00:00:43.443 position:24% line:89% align:start
I will be emperor.

All that to impress Lilia?

00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:46.881 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:48.816 position:21% line:83% align:start
Aren't you aiming for
the throne to fulfill Aileen's

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.019 position:19% line:89% align:start

Allow me to impart
a note of caution.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.759 position:21% line:83% align:start
Be wary of bowing to
a woman's beck and call.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
Lilia is planning something.

00:01:06.768 --> 00:01:08.937 position:21% line:89% align:start
Do try to be careful.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.204 position:5% line:89% align:start

they were being taken.

Indeed, to a black-market
auction, of all places.

Supposedly, demon
incense is sold as well.

Should the situation go south,

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:22.469 position:21% line:83% align:start
you have my approval
to make arrests, Auguste.

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:25.840 position:24% line:83% align:start
But has Lord Claude
given you his approval?

[AILEEN]
Pardon?

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.010 position:16% line:83% align:start
Keeping secrets from him
will only do more harm.

Aren't you already in
enough trouble as it is?

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.280 position:16% line:89% align:start
Lord Claude is very kind.

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:35.083 position:19% line:83% align:start
I haven't the faintest
clue why you lot

00:07:43.664 --> 00:07:45.166 position:10% line:89% align:start
but demons can channel magic,

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:50.071 position:13% line:83% align:start
sorcerers have always been
rejected by human society.

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:53.274 position:13% line:83% align:start
Twenty years ago, the Levi
family declared war

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:56.544 position:13% line:83% align:start
against the empire, hoping
to expand their territory,

00:07:56.677 --> 00:07:58.112 position:38% line:89% align:start
but lost.

00:07:58.245 --> 00:08:00.815 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorcerers have since been
forced to provide protection

00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:04.652 position:19% line:83% align:start
to the imperial family
behind the scenes.

00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:07.788 position:16% line:83% align:start
While their children and
elders are held hostage.

00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:12.026 position:21% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE] If I were to
take over the throne,

00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:14.328 position:19% line:83% align:start
you want me to formally
recognize the people

00:08:14.462 --> 00:08:18.232 position:7% line:83% align:start
of the Levi family as citizens
of the Elmir Empire.

00:08:18.366 --> 00:08:19.867 position:21% line:89% align:start
Do I have that right?

00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:23.637 position:13% line:83% align:start
Please help free my family
from their bondage, my lord.

00:08:23.771 --> 00:08:26.507 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let your actions henceforth
decide your fate.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.710 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC sighs] More underlings
to add to your collection?

00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:31.145 position:24% line:83% align:start
What if this turns
out to be a trick?

00:08:31.278 --> 00:08:33.314 position:24% line:83% align:start
If we're aiding the
sorcerers' revenge,

00:08:33.447 --> 00:08:34.548 position:27% line:89% align:start
I say we decline.

00:08:34.682 --> 00:08:35.983 position:21% line:89% align:start
Deny their vengeance?

00:08:36.117 --> 00:08:38.619 position:24% line:83% align:start
I see no reason to,
if the sorcerers' bite

00:08:38.753 --> 00:08:40.988 position:24% line:83% align:start
matches their bark
towards the Empire.

--[AILEEN] Isaac?
--[ISAAC] Huh?

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
What we desire is an
empire where humans

00:08:45.393 --> 00:08:46.894 position:13% line:89% align:start
and demons live in harmony.

00:08:47.028 --> 00:08:48.596 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't it be in our
best interest to help

00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:50.831 position:5% line:89% align:start
the oppressed in any way we can?

00:08:50.965 --> 00:08:52.566 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't think it's a good idea.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.870 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh! I'll be sure to teach him
the greatness of Lord Claude!

00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:58.105 position:30% line:83% align:start
As long as you
have no objections?

00:08:58.239 --> 00:09:01.809 position:13% line:83% align:start
Not at all. I look forward
to learning from you.

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:04.678 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ISAAC] I warned you about
keeping a secure leash on her!

00:09:04.812 --> 00:09:07.248 position:27% line:83% align:start
Didn't I tell you
last time, My Lord?

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:08.682 position:38% line:89% align:start
You did.

00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:11.652 position:27% line:83% align:start
That will be all,

00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:25.399 position:38% line:89% align:start
That man!

Teleporting me off to
bed right in the middle

00:09:27.536 --> 00:09:29.203 position:19% line:89% align:start
of a tense discussion!

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.873 position:30% line:89% align:start
What a relief.

00:09:33.007 --> 00:09:36.744 position:16% line:83% align:start
Looks like the final boss
is on our side this time.

00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:38.612 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have a clearer memory
of the first game

00:09:38.746 --> 00:09:40.247 position:13% line:89% align:start
than I do of the fan disc.

00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:44.285 position:13% line:83% align:start
Too bad I didn't replay the
side content more often.

00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:46.821 position:27% line:83% align:start
Which reminds me,
Lord Claude was demonized

00:09:46.954 --> 00:09:48.389 position:24% line:89% align:start
in the first game.

00:09:48.523 --> 00:09:50.057 position:21% line:89% align:start
But in the fan disc,

00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:51.792 position:21% line:83% align:start
he appeared again as
one of the romanceable

options as a character extra.

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:56.931 position:16% line:89% align:start
And when that happened--

[RACHEL]
Your Grace!

00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:49.283 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've received word of
a distressing account

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:51.986 position:21% line:83% align:start
from an aid stationed
in the imperial castle.

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:53.854 position:24% line:83% align:start
They report to have
seen Lord Claude

00:10:53.988 --> 00:10:56.123 position:10% line:89% align:start
being stabbed in the abdomen.

[AILEEN gasps]

00:10:57.424 --> 00:10:59.360 position:24% line:89% align:start
Not the demon lord!

[AILEEN]
Stabbed?

00:11:00.828 --> 00:11:02.531 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, that doesn't make sense,

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:05.065 position:27% line:83% align:start
he said he loved
me only hours ago!

[RUDOLF]
Do not be alarmed.

00:11:06.934 --> 00:11:08.235 position:13% line:89% align:start
The wound is quite shallow.

00:11:08.369 --> 00:11:11.105 position:24% line:83% align:start
There is no threat
to his life at present.

But, sadly, this injury cost
Lord Claude his memories.

[AILEEN]
Love is precious.

Please explain why
you are keeping me

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:35.930 position:16% line:89% align:start
from seeing Lord Claude!

00:11:36.063 --> 00:11:37.532 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, why should you?

00:11:37.666 --> 00:11:40.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
My son's now bereft of his
memory and demonic powers,

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:42.269 position:13% line:89% align:start
and no longer a demon lord.

00:11:42.403 --> 00:11:44.104 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thus, I will separate
him from demons

00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:46.407 position:24% line:83% align:start
and have him start
over as a human.

00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:48.475 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is the perfect chance
for him to become

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.110 position:27% line:89% align:start
the next emperor.

00:11:54.315 --> 00:11:56.551 position:24% line:83% align:start
I beg your pardon,
Your Imperial Majesty,

00:11:56.685 --> 00:11:58.752 position:24% line:83% align:start
but what about your
son's arranged marriage

00:11:58.886 --> 00:12:00.187 position:27% line:89% align:start
with my daughter?

00:12:00.321 --> 00:12:02.790 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do be at ease, I don't
plan to cancel it now.

00:12:02.923 --> 00:12:06.595 position:13% line:83% align:start
I will seek a suitable time
and reason for the annulment.

00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:07.728 position:21% line:89% align:start
Without our consent?

00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:09.396 position:27% line:89% align:start
That is not fair!

00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:11.966 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's hope yet for Claude
despite this setback of his.

He has the option to
reconsider his future now.

I am certain there will
be plenty of candidates

who hope to wed him as a human.

an extravagant ball,

00:12:42.564 --> 00:12:44.098 position:24% line:83% align:start

an invitation to this ball.

00:12:58.412 --> 00:13:00.515 position:24% line:83% align:start
My, there must have
been an oversight.

00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:02.316 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't it cause more
trouble for your family

to receive an invitation
at this late date?

you're so concerned over,

allow me this much

00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:23.871 position:30% line:89% align:start
as his fiancÃ©e!

How unseemly.

00:13:25.774 --> 00:13:29.443 position:7% line:83% align:start

Pardon me for interrupting.

00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:38.252 position:21% line:89% align:start

00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:40.555 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, Grandmother,
this is far too cruel!

00:13:40.689 --> 00:13:43.558 position:10% line:83% align:start
You mustn't force Lady Aileen
to break up with him!

00:13:43.692 --> 00:13:44.626 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Lilia!

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:46.293 position:10% line:89% align:start
What is this woman plotting?

00:13:46.427 --> 00:13:48.162 position:24% line:83% align:start
It would be rather
suspicious to annul

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:51.098 position:21% line:83% align:start
the engagement after
he lost his memory.

00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:53.233 position:21% line:83% align:start
The two of them have
developed quite the reputation

00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:55.737 position:30% line:83% align:start
for being in a
close relationship.

00:13:55.869 --> 00:13:57.404 position:27% line:89% align:start
They're a couple!

00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:00.608 position:5% line:83% align:start
So we should at least invite her
to the ball, right, Grandmother?

00:14:00.742 --> 00:14:01.676 position:33% line:89% align:start
[LARA sighs]

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.110 position:10% line:89% align:start
The two of you have a point.

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:05.580 position:21% line:83% align:start
I suppose I can send
an invitation to her.

00:14:05.714 --> 00:14:08.349 position:24% line:83% align:start
However, should you
try otherwise to meet

00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:09.818 position:27% line:89% align:start
with Lord Claude,

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll have you beheaded for going
against an imperial decree.

00:14:16.524 --> 00:14:17.625 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good luck.

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:19.193 position:16% line:83% align:start
I very much look forward
to seeing what you can

00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:20.494 position:19% line:89% align:start
accomplish at the ball.

00:14:20.628 --> 00:14:22.496 position:30% line:83% align:start
Lady Aileen is
the main character.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.865 position:13% line:83% align:start
Have a little bit of faith
in her, Grandmother!

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:27.468 position:27% line:83% align:start
She won't lose in
a scenario this easy.

00:14:27.602 --> 00:14:28.902 position:38% line:89% align:start
Will you?

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.472 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lady Aileen.

00:14:31.606 --> 00:14:34.776 position:19% line:83% align:start
What do you say you and
I have a little more fun?

00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:37.144 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
So she wants to play.

00:14:40.782 --> 00:14:42.282 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Of course, Lady Lilia.

00:14:42.416 --> 00:14:45.520 position:30% line:83% align:start
But know this:
it will be the last time.

00:14:45.653 --> 00:14:49.089 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes, that's the spirit,
Lady Aileen.

00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:51.925 position:5% line:89% align:start
I would expect no less from you.

00:14:57.599 --> 00:14:58.733 position:30% line:89% align:start
[LILIA giggles]

00:14:58.867 --> 00:15:02.570 position:16% line:83% align:start
If this truly is reality,
isn't it quite cruel?

00:15:02.704 --> 00:15:04.304 position:27% line:89% align:start
Poor Lady Aileen!

00:15:06.173 --> 00:15:09.410 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CÃDRIC]
Lilia, are you sure about this?

00:15:09.544 --> 00:15:12.479 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh? Are you worried
about something?

00:15:12.614 --> 00:15:13.947 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:16.483 position:13% line:83% align:start
The culprit who attacked my
brother is still out there.

00:15:16.618 --> 00:15:18.485 position:27% line:89% align:start
And what's more--

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.656 position:16% line:83% align:start
[LILIA] Oh, is he worried
his more capable brother

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.290 position:19% line:89% align:start
will take me from him?

00:15:23.424 --> 00:15:26.393 position:24% line:83% align:start
What an exhausting,
small-minded man.

00:15:26.528 --> 00:15:28.596 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your kindness is what
I love most about you,

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.164 position:30% line:89% align:start
Prince CÃ©dric!

00:15:33.668 --> 00:15:36.203 position:21% line:83% align:start
Be wary of bowing to
a woman's beck and call.

00:15:36.336 --> 00:15:38.472 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sheep get boring fast.

Aileen.

00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:51.985 position:35% line:83% align:start
I beg you.
Please take care of my lord.

00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:53.621 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
I will.

00:15:54.656 --> 00:15:58.392 position:13% line:83% align:start
And don't you forget, I am
the demon lord's future wife.

00:16:00.895 --> 00:16:02.963 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
He's in there.

00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:04.331 position:21% line:89% align:start
Almond's a good bird.

00:16:04.465 --> 00:16:05.966 position:33% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't have
found it without him.

00:16:06.099 --> 00:16:09.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
It seems there's a holy
barrier to ward off outsiders.

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:10.538 position:21% line:89% align:start
Child's play, I say.

00:16:10.672 --> 00:16:12.607 position:24% line:83% align:start
My sword can surely
break through that barrier

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.775 position:35% line:89% align:start
with ease.

00:16:13.908 --> 00:16:15.777 position:27% line:83% align:start
I see they still
underestimate me.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.246 position:7% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS] Most people wouldn't
think about jumping off a cliff.

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:20.782 position:24% line:89% align:start
Not at this height.

00:16:20.915 --> 00:16:22.149 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's time.

00:16:22.282 --> 00:16:24.886 position:27% line:83% align:start
Prepare your wind
magic while I tear down

00:16:25.018 --> 00:16:27.354 position:24% line:83% align:start
the "holy" barrier
with my sword.

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:32.125 position:19% line:83% align:start
And may I remind you--
you'll be executed if caught.

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:33.795 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm well aware of that.

00:16:33.928 --> 00:16:35.395 position:24% line:89% align:start
As long as you are.

00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:38.065 position:35% line:89% align:start

Holy sword!

It's most remarkable.

00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:03.625 position:27% line:83% align:start
The holy sword is
loyal to your hand.

00:17:03.758 --> 00:17:04.959 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yes, for now at least.

00:17:05.092 --> 00:17:06.528 position:27% line:83% align:start
I do think about
snapping it in half

Yes, more or less.

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:17.104 position:24% line:83% align:start
And as you've just
seen, it feels like

the holy sword has

Go ahead, have your way.

This better not be a trick.

00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:52.774 position:30% line:83% align:start
Do whatever you
need to and leave.

00:17:52.907 --> 00:17:54.742 position:13% line:83% align:start
And know that I won't save
you if you get caught

can't recall who I am.

00:18:50.732 --> 00:18:53.500 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then I suppose there's no
other choice to make here.

00:18:53.635 --> 00:18:55.003 position:13% line:89% align:start
I know what I must do now!

Lord Claude, you'd make
me the happiest woman

I'd marry the first person

to propose to me
without introduction,

Are you the Aileen that
they warned me about?

00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:29.704 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've no desire to marry
someone like you,

00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:31.204 position:16% line:89% align:start
so please just leave me.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.540 position:35% line:89% align:start
Just leave?

00:19:32.674 --> 00:19:34.742 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's being a tad
cold, Lord Claude.

00:19:34.876 --> 00:19:37.177 position:27% line:83% align:start
I will not become
the demon lord again.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.413 position:21% line:83% align:start
I burdened my country
and my people

00:19:39.547 --> 00:19:41.849 position:33% line:83% align:start
by selfishly
accepting the title.

00:19:41.983 --> 00:19:44.519 position:16% line:83% align:start
Lilia and the others went
through much to save me.

00:19:44.652 --> 00:19:47.021 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't allow that
to be in vain.

00:19:47.155 --> 00:19:49.322 position:19% line:89% align:start
Do you truly mean that?

00:19:49.456 --> 00:19:51.425 position:27% line:83% align:start
Therefore, please
accept the annulment

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:53.326 position:24% line:89% align:start
of our engagement.

00:19:56.764 --> 00:19:58.800 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN] I will pretend
I did not hear that.

00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:00.635 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll have you know,
I would have cut you down

00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:02.704 position:21% line:83% align:start
right here and now if
I wasn't desperately

00:20:02.837 --> 00:20:04.639 position:27% line:89% align:start
in love with you.

00:20:04.772 --> 00:20:06.541 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're truly in love with me?

00:20:06.674 --> 00:20:08.142 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
Of course.

00:20:08.275 --> 00:20:10.243 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't have risked execution
to see you if I wasn't.

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:11.879 position:5% line:89% align:start
They threatened to execute you?

00:20:12.013 --> 00:20:14.381 position:21% line:83% align:start
As an outlaw, I'll be
beheaded if they discovered

00:20:14.515 --> 00:20:15.917 position:30% line:89% align:start
I met with you.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.785 position:21% line:83% align:start
But that's a risk I'm
more than willing to take.

00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:20.521 position:13% line:83% align:start
And if that's the price of
treason, I'm happy to pay it.

00:20:20.655 --> 00:20:22.924 position:21% line:83% align:start
But the guards could
come in at any moment.

00:20:23.057 --> 00:20:24.158 position:24% line:89% align:start
You've done enough.

00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:26.794 position:10% line:89% align:start
So please, please just leave.

00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:30.430 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're still the caring
man I fell in love with.

00:20:30.565 --> 00:20:32.466 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness you're all right.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.468 position:16% line:83% align:start
As long as you're alive,
I can win you over

00:20:34.602 --> 00:20:36.537 position:13% line:89% align:start
as many times as it takes.

00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:39.006 position:24% line:89% align:start
How brazen of you!

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.742 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't you know putting
your hands on a man

00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:43.111 position:19% line:83% align:start
is very unbecoming of a
young, unmarried woman?

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:44.612 position:27% line:89% align:start
What a gentleman!

00:20:44.746 --> 00:20:46.480 position:13% line:83% align:start
Who knew hidden underneath
your demon lord side

00:20:46.614 --> 00:20:48.683 position:24% line:83% align:start
was such a dashing
and chivalrous soul!

00:20:48.816 --> 00:20:51.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't help it! I want to steal
you away right now!

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:52.987 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CLAUDE]
Pardon?

00:20:53.121 --> 00:20:54.856 position:10% line:83% align:start
For the last time I am asking
you to unhand me right now!

00:20:54.989 --> 00:20:57.925 position:16% line:83% align:start
How can you say that when
I'm having so much fun?

00:20:58.059 --> 00:20:59.794 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ELEPHAS]
Excuse me.

00:20:59.927 --> 00:21:02.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
The patrolling guards
will pass by shortly.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.132 position:27% line:83% align:start
Those guards have
the worst timing,

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:05.365 position:16% line:89% align:start
don't they, Lord Claude?

00:21:05.499 --> 00:21:06.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
Until next time!

00:21:06.934 --> 00:21:09.369 position:16% line:83% align:start
With any luck, there will
not be a next time.

00:21:09.504 --> 00:21:11.672 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh! And please excuse me.

00:21:14.075 --> 00:21:15.243 position:38% line:89% align:start
My hair!

00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:16.978 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AILEEN]
A souvenir! I'll treasure it!

00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:20.915 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, and before I take my leave,
you must promise this.

00:21:21.048 --> 00:21:22.717 position:16% line:89% align:start
Do not ever cheat on me.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.185 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come again?

00:21:24.317 --> 00:21:26.020 position:10% line:83% align:start
Isn't the purpose of the ball
to find you a new fiancÃ©e,

00:21:26.154 --> 00:21:27.522 position:24% line:89% align:start
one to replace me?

00:21:27.655 --> 00:21:29.289 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm not interested.

00:21:29.422 --> 00:21:30.625 position:27% line:89% align:start
My plate is full.

00:21:30.758 --> 00:21:32.193 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm busy dealing with
the requirements

00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:33.895 position:13% line:89% align:start
of becoming a crown prince.

00:21:34.028 --> 00:21:36.396 position:19% line:89% align:start
I've no time for that.

00:21:36.531 --> 00:21:38.099 position:24% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:21:38.232 --> 00:21:39.600 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, just tucking you in.

00:21:39.734 --> 00:21:42.637 position:21% line:83% align:start
And thinking how you
sound like the man I love.

00:21:45.506 --> 00:21:46.874 position:30% line:89% align:start
No matter what,

00:21:47.008 --> 00:21:49.744 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll have you falling
for me again and again.

00:21:49.877 --> 00:21:51.311 position:30% line:89% align:start
I promise you.

00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:58.920 position:27% line:83% align:start
"No matter what?"
She's an odd one.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.489 position:38% line:83% align:start
FiancÃ©e?
She couldn't possibly be.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.596 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I'm destined to
fall for her again,

00:22:08.729 --> 00:22:11.566 position:16% line:89% align:start
is our love fated to be?
