We did it! She had the baby
and they're both safe!

Huh?

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center

[CLAUDIA] Lives are
lost on the battlefield,

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
but lives are born there, too.

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:32.732 position:50% align:center
In which case...

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
[CLUADIA] ...my wings
have a reason to fight.

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Odin?

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
All right, let's get
down to business.

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:45.453 position:50% align:center
The good news is our
base is just fine.

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
So now we can actually
get a handle on things again.

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:51.793 position:50% align:center
However, there's
some bad news, too.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:54.337 position:50% align:center
Komagome, if you don't mind.

00:20:56.131 --> 00:20:57.674 position:50% align:center
Here's a video of
a mural we found

00:20:57.757 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
on the other side
of that crazy gate.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:02.303 position:50% align:center
I think it's the
history of Odin.

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
The history of the gods.

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:07.058 position:50% align:center
Go back, was that
the giant from Fuji?

00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:08.893 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Good eye. Yeah.

00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
And here beside it...

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:12.689 position:50% align:center
Odin.

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:13.982 position:50% align:center
Odin? But that doesn't
look anything like...

00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:15.316 position:50% align:center
[ALL chattering]

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.735 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] It's true that
the old man in that mural

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:18.278 position:50% align:center
closely resembles Odin

00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:20.530 position:50% align:center
when he first revealed
himself to humans.

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
It's not unlikely
that this is indeed him.

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:26.202 position:50% align:center
My first question is, why
is Odin shown fighting beside

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
the giant from Fuji?

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:30.081 position:50% align:center
And If I'm right about
these depicting divine history,

00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:31.916 position:50% align:center
then the story
concludes with a bang--

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
the end of the world. AKA...

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:38.173 position:50% align:center
Ragnarok.

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:39.549 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Wait, really?

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:42.135 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] But Ragnarok
hasn't happened yet.

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.846 position:50% align:center
The reason we're
fighting is to avoid it.

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:46.890 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, we were lied to.

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA gasps]

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:53.063 position:50% align:center
Ragnarok must've happened
a long, long time ago.

[ODIN singing in
a foreign language]

00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:01.404 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
The age of Odin.

00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:05.742 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
The demise of mythology.

00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:08.161 position:50% align:center
That was Ragnarok.

00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:11.623 position:50% align:center
A tale of gods,
surviving solely in song

00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:13.958 position:50% align:center
from Claudy's Nordic homeland.

[SONOKA]
Northern Europe.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.796 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Norse mythology.

00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:22.217 position:50% align:center

Ragnarok is already over.

No. I refuse to accept it.

Ragnarok has yet to befall us!

00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:36.564 position:50% align:center
I swear it.
We have not fallen yet!
