[ONOUE] We were only
able to recover so quickly

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:42.050 position:50% align:center
thanks to Major General Okita.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:45.220 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] Yeah, his immediate
order to retreat paid off.

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.681 position:50% align:center
Though we owe it to our
allies' reinforcements,

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
and rear forces, too.

Don't forget that.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
Because we Valkyries fight
for the sake of living!

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
[MOE] Mm. And besides,
we're gonna need

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
your help once all
the fighting is over.

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:30.825 position:50% align:center

we'll put you guys to work.

us geezers into the ground, huh?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.174 position:50% align:center

[chuckles] Sorry, we
drew the short straw.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:13.660 position:50% align:center
We're aware.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
But saying it kills the vibe!

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.708 position:50% align:center
Whether you like it or not,
this is your workplace.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:23.294 position:50% align:center
And everyone here is your army.

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50% align:center
Good grief. And to think that
you guys used to be so innocent.

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.758 position:50% align:center
You just taught us well.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.093 position:50% align:center
Ditto that.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center

this is Commander
Satomi speaking.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I'm no
good at speeches.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.237 position:50% align:center
I probably couldn't
inspire you if I tried.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.657 position:50% align:center
But there is one
thing I want to say.

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:56.411 position:50% align:center
Let's put an end to the
defeats starting with today.

00:08:56.494 --> 00:09:00.582 position:50% align:center
We all returned here
for one reason: victory.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
So, let's go and take it.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.086 position:50% align:center
That crooked god
has earned our anger,

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.173 position:50% align:center
so it's only fair that
we give him a taste of it.

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
Their history ended once.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.344 position:50% align:center
Let's make it twice.

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
That's the Ragnarok I want.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50% align:center
That's what we all want.

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:19.768 position:50% align:center

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Yeah. And it was
a first-class one at that.

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:28.693 position:50% align:center

It sure was!

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center

[SONOKA giggles]
Why Azu? Are you nervous?

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO chuckles] Don't worry;
everything's gonna be just fine!

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.460 position:50% align:center

Isn't it beautiful, Claudia?

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
This place.

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.846 position:50% align:center
My birthplace...

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
...and yours.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
It's not like I recognize it.

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
I know. I just wanted to say it.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center

Either way, isn't it nice?

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:09.734 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Odin,

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center
your birthplace has
long been destroyed.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
I know you've
realized that by now.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
But that song survived.

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
It's a piece telling
of demise and revival.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.249 position:50% align:center

lose a lot of people.

Or perhaps you don't believe

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
what this crooked god
has to say anymore.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] If you withdraw your
spear, we don't have to fight.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't waste your breath.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
Why would I fold

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:39.973 position:50% align:center
when I'm trying to make as many
dead warriors as possible...

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50% align:center
...for the coming Ragnarok?

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
Dead warriors! My Einherjar!
Fall under my command!

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
I will triumph!

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
I swear, I will win Ragnarok!
So fight with me!

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
I see you're not
willing to negotiate.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
So why bother appearing
before me, then?

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
To follow up on your dream.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:07.125 position:50% align:center
Come to me, Claudia.

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
I'm offering this hand
of mine only to you.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
I will not take your hand!
I have a father.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
I have a home in my heart.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
This is nothing
but a god's utopia.

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.266 position:50% align:center
It's a dream of
a fallen kingdom!

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
[ODIN chuckles] How dare you
speak to me in such a way?

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
You know nothing
of my greatness.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
You're just an insolent
Valkyrie who defies her father!

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.153 position:50% align:center
You're so cruel.

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.155 position:50% align:center
Yet you're my beloved daughter.

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
So I'll just have to
steal your life away

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:42.327 position:50% align:center
and trap you within my kingdom!

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
Show no mercy.

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.958 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.003 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Commence operation, Ragnarok 2.

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
Battle's started. Here we go.

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.684 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Just like last time,

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
our assault begins with
Sveio deploying her bomb.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.188 position:50% align:center
The plan's in motion.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.857 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but we have
fewer Valkyries

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
to work with than the last
time we tried this, don't we?

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Yeah. You're right. Far Fewer.

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center
As soon as Fuji
Pillar is attacked,

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
Secondaries around the
world will become active.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.162 position:50% align:center
We know that now.

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
That's how the whole world got
thrashed on the last attempt.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
But this time, countries
have Valkyries on defense.

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:17.172 position:50% align:center
Fighting with us today
are most of Japan's forces.

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center
And then, there's us on standby.

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:21.009 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50% align:center
[gasps, grunts]

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Miko, I know
how you feel, but--

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
We're the trump card,
so we can't be impatient.

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.686 position:50% align:center
It's Azu's strat,

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.731 position:50% align:center
and if there's anyone I trust
from head to toe, it's Azu.

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA giggles] Well, you two
never change, that's for sure.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.198 position:50% align:center
I feel safer knowing
that no one's over-eager.

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
But...

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.992 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
The real question is,

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:48.578 position:50% align:center
how long can they
last without their best?

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:53.583 position:50% align:center
Gotta save the girls
for as long as possible.

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.960 position:50% align:center
At minimum, until Point 1,

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.213 position:50% align:center
hopefully, Point 2, if we can.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.465 position:50% align:center
And it'd be remarkable
if we made it to Point 3

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:02.425 position:50% align:center
without needing their help.

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] Secondaries
appearing within the Pillar!

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
Squadron nine-zero-one
has begun to engage!

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center
They're Type C: Cannons.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
The same type we
encountered at Umihotaru.

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:15.980 position:50% align:center
We don't have time for
your reoccurring boss fights!

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
Secondary disabled!

00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
Point 1 has been
reached without issue!

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50% align:center
Uh-uh. No way this
is all you've got,

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:27.575 position:50% align:center
right, Odin?

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:31.371 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] I thought most
of their Named left,

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:34.833 position:50% align:center
but that clumsy Sveio
decided to stay behind?

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:38.545 position:50% align:center
[ODIN chuckles]
What a clever bunch.

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
Claudia's not fighting?

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
Saving her for later
is a daring plan.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
But how long can they last for?

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI yells]

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:54.019 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
Point 3 has been reached!

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
The enemy's numbers
are quickly increasing!

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:58.189 position:50% align:center
Kurumi, did you hear that?

00:14:58.273 --> 00:15:01.192 position:50% align:center
We're at Point 3!
We can back off!

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
Not yet! Just look!

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
Cross that and it's Point 4!

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:10.493 position:50% align:center
At least Point 1...
hopefully, Point 2.

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.371 position:50% align:center
Three's remarkable... finally.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:15.790 position:50% align:center
Point 4 would be a miracle!

00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:17.959 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
[VETERAN 11B]
Now's our time to shine boys.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:23.465 position:50% align:center
It's a one-in-a-million gamble.
Do you think we can pull it off?

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
[VETERAN 11A]
Why not?

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
One in a million means
it's gotta happen once!

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
[MOE]
We're familiar with the enemy,

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.056 position:50% align:center
but our ammunition is minimal.

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:35.769 position:50% align:center
For humanity to win,
we need a miracle.

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:38.104 position:50% align:center
[MOE]
So be it! I'll lead!

00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:40.565 position:50% align:center
Everyone, follow me!

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.233 position:50% align:center
[VETERANS]
Hell yeah!

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:44.861 position:50% align:center
Careful!

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center
[VETERAN 11B]
Sometimes you gotta take risks!

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:51.034 position:50% align:center
[VETERAN 11B cheers]

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.660 position:50% align:center
[VETERAN 11A] We can't
actually shoot 'em all down,

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
but at least we can
toy with 'em a little!

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.915 position:50% align:center
[VETERAN 11B] It's fine--
these slowpokes are nothing!

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.042 position:50% align:center
[VETERAN 11A]
All right, girls. Go for it!

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI, MOE]
Roger!

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:02.170 position:50% align:center
Kurumi! Do it!

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:03.713 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
Now!

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:24.943 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI, MOE gasp]

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
You're kidding!

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
Scary! Scary! Scary! Scary!

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.746 position:50% align:center
[SHIELD SQUADRON]
Leave this one to us!

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
[MOE gasps]

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:46.131 position:50% align:center
It's them!

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:56.516 position:50% align:center
[VETERAN 11A] Is that
Tateyama's Valkyrie Wing?

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
You know it! They're our idols!

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.312 position:50% align:center
They're different from
the rest. They're way better!

00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
They're so kind that
they'll forgive us--

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.607 position:50% align:center
no matter how dirty
our thoughts are!

00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:06.693 position:50% align:center
And we realize just
how valuable that is!

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
We're still disgusted though!

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
We're starting at Point 4.
The best one, yeah?

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:15.243 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh, the sacrifice
to get here was great.

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.537 position:50% align:center
We won't waste this
chance we've been given!

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.165 position:50% align:center
Got that right. Why don't
we start by showing off

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
a little bit of our teamwork?

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:23.835 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
I'll countdown!

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:29.966 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA, MIYAKO, SONOKA]
Roger!

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.677 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Three! Two! One!

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
Now!

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI]
Wow, those guys are incredible!

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:43.063 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
You did well, you two. Good job!

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
But fall back and let us take
care of the rest, all right?

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI]
Sonoka!

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:51.404 position:50% align:center
It's okay! I'm a tough
cookie, remember?

00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:52.614 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI]
Mm.

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
Good luck!

00:17:57.118 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO giggles] Man, Sono,
when did you get so cool?

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.539 position:50% align:center
You think I'm cool?

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:03.375 position:50% align:center
I'll have to show off
that side of me more often

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:05.335 position:50% align:center
if you're gonna
praise me for it.

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center
Hmph! Bragger.

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
No. It's comforting.

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center

Command. How's visibility?

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
It's good.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] The Vandrande is
blocked by a lot of enemies.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
We'll have to
disperse them somehow,

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
then slip between them.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:24.020 position:50% align:center
We yell "fire,"
and they go boom!

00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:28.316 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE] Let's go!
Go! Go! Don't fall behind!

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
[SHADES] We can't let 'em
fly ahead of their shield!

[SHAGGY] There's a reward
waiting for whoever does best!

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
So give it your all!

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
Guys love to show off,
every chance they get

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
You're not wrong.

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:41.162 position:50% align:center
But somehow, all the guys I
know suck at showing off. Weird!

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
And for that, I'm glad.

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.708 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
No comment.

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:51.423 position:50% align:center

[ODIN]
Now...

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.681 position:50% align:center
...time to unleash
overwhelming numbers again.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.725 position:50% align:center
How will you handle this?

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] Primary Pillars
have finally gone active!

Not much time now!

as last time.

00:19:21.536 --> 00:19:22.829 position:50% align:center
Except...

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI] Secondaries across
Japan have been engaged!

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET] C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
What's the matter?

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:32.672 position:50% align:center
You can't even catch a weak,
little girl? That's pathetic!

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:34.674 position:50% align:center
We can't fight together,

00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
but we're still
under the same sky!

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
I won't let you get
anywhere near Claudia!

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:41.348 position:50% align:center
[SUMMIT LEADER 1B]
Don't think we'll let you

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:44.142 position:50% align:center
push us around forever,
you deranged god.

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
This ends today.

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:48.396 position:50% align:center
All countries,
all forces, together.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
The whole of humanity
rests on this fight.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
We've summoned the full
potential of the human race.

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:59.240 position:50% align:center
The twilight of gods,
Ragnarok is at hand!

I've gotta step up my game, too!

Wipe 'em out in one pass!

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center

It missed?!

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:34.067 position:50% align:center
That hit.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.568 position:50% align:center
Was it blocked?

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
It's the Black Valkyries.

[AZUZU]
Svartr Valkyries.

00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
It's Sakura...

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.832 position:50% align:center
And Leyli.

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:51.543 position:50% align:center
You had to figure
they'd show up.

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:54.129 position:50% align:center
He's been making such
predictable moves,

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:56.756 position:50% align:center
it's almost boring me.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.968 position:50% align:center
Come on. Am I better
at strategy than a god?

00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:02.137 position:50% align:center
Totally! 'Cause
my Azu's a genius,

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center
and don't you ever forget it!

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:04.723 position:50% align:center
'Kay, that's enough.

00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:06.683 position:50% align:center
You guys are too much sometimes.

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
She's right though;
we're doing well.

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
Get it, Odin? This isn't
nearly enough to beat us!

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:14.941 position:50% align:center
Understand?

00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
Obviously.

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:21.489 position:50% align:center
Now then, is this enough
to shatter your hopes?!

[CLAUDIA gasps]
Everyone, evade, quickly!

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
Command?

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.473 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
We're fine. It missed us.

00:21:46.556 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
Oh? Heh.

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center
Good job. It seems that your
base was well placed this time.

00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:54.773 position:50% align:center
Of course it was.

00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:57.567 position:50% align:center
I mean, I was in
charge of strategy.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.653 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] It's just one
clever move after another.

00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:03.365 position:50% align:center
Such neurotic-level planning.

00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:06.493 position:50% align:center
It's been truly
splendid to watch.

00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:08.870 position:50% align:center
But it all ends now.

Dread your destruction.
Fear the power of a god.

know helplessness.
