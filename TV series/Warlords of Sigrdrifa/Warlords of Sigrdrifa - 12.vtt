you've got a point, idiot.

some serious courage.

[ODIN] Why, Claudia? Why do
you fly toward your demise?!

[CLAUDIA] I fear death.
And I'm afraid of ruin.

my friends and family,

[YAYOI] You managed
not to cry this time.

Yup. Are you proud of me?

Then that must be the--

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:34.522 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
You've done well to reach here.

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
It's splendid.

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
You're not Claudia,
nor even a Named.

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:43.615 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed a human
could make it all this way.

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:46.159 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] If you're sitting here
on your ass, where's Claudy?

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] You're a smart one. You
should know without me saying.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:54.668 position:50% align:center
And it's not just Claudia.
Many people are dead.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
So why do you continue fighting?

00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:02.634 position:50% align:center
You've lost your friends,
your allies... and for what?

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:05.887 position:50% align:center
You know what, Odin?
I could ask you the same thing!

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.847 position:50% align:center
It's time for you
to face the facts.

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
Ragnarok is long over!

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:12.811 position:50% align:center

Odin!

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:23.071 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
Why must a god behave honorably?

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:27.075 position:50% align:center
Must they graciously
welcome their own ruin?

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
Is wanting to protect the
things you love so wrong?

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
My wife, my children,
and friends...

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
I don't want to lose anyone!

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:41.339 position:50% align:center

I refuse to lose anyone!

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU yelps, groans]

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
Surely, you're out of moves now.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.432 position:50% align:center
All that's left is to
take your friends outside,

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
and add them to
my army, one by one.

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
And then, the decisive
battle will be-- Hm?

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.565 position:50% align:center
Why stand?

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:02.027 position:50% align:center
You're quite the stubborn
daughter, aren't you?

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
Do you have another
plan in mind?

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.197 position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:07.949 position:50% align:center
Even a genius such as myself

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
couldn't plan her
way out of this mess.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
Really, it's
because I believe...

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.959 position:50% align:center
I believe in what saves me
whenever I'm in a bind.

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:19.794 position:50% align:center
Meaning what?

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:23.965 position:50% align:center
I believe my hero
will come for me!

your goal all along?

What is it?

00:15:56.915 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
What's the difference
between us? You and me?

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:04.631 position:50% align:center
I resisted my destruction
with everything I had.

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:07.425 position:50% align:center
Yet it wasn't enough.

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:09.219 position:50% align:center
Tell me,

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
what's the difference
between you and me?

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:16.267 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
You're alone.

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
You tried to carry
your burden alone

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:22.607 position:50% align:center

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.451 position:50% align:center
[HARUKAMI]
I'll grab a ball!

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:21.119 position:50% align:center
[TAKADA]
The kids there yet?

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.246 position:50% align:center
The noisy ones are
gone, but somehow

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
the base hasn't
changed much at all.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.543 position:50% align:center
We can thank them for
that in more ways than one.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:31.963 position:50% align:center
We loved this base because
they were a part of it.

00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:35.592 position:50% align:center
Those who are sent off
by Valkyries become heroes.

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Yeah, and
they reunite somewhere new

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
with the people
they love, right?

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:43.475 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Mm-hm.
Think they have already?

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:46.853 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] This is reality,
not a fairy-tale,

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:50.023 position:50% align:center
but seeing how there're gods

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.650 position:50% align:center
and we fight with
mysterious power,

00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
not to mention one
of us has god's blood...

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.283 position:50% align:center
Well, I think fairy-tales
being true isn't so crazy.

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:02.410 position:50% align:center
They're not the
hero types, though.

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] You should have
quit while you were ahead.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:05.789 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Typical Azuzu.

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:07.374 position:50% align:center
Stop it!

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:09.959 position:50% align:center
I can picture them now. Saying,
"She's right, we're not heroes,"

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
and laughing all the while.

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:17.092 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Man, you guys
were the coolest ever!

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:21.763 position:50% align:center
[inhales] I love you guys!

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
You big idiots!

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:30.105 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] Well, we were
able to retake Mount Fuji,

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:37.654 position:50% align:center
and Odin seems to have vanished,

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:40.949 position:50% align:center
but there're still Primary
Pillars around the world.

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50% align:center
And the threat of Secondaries
domestically still remains.

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:45.286 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI]
Umm.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
What?

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:48.206 position:50% align:center
[MOE] Should you really
be clipping your toenails

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
during a serious discussion?

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.501 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Sorry.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
You see, I haven't
exactly had much time

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
to take care of
'em lately, so...

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
It is important
to do frequently.

00:20:57.215 --> 00:20:58.675 position:50% align:center
It can hurt when
they get snagged.

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.510 position:50% align:center
Kurumi, can you not defend him?

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:03.013 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it's nice
to have you here.

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:05.682 position:50% align:center
We can give you a base tour,
but I'd need someone--

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Us, us, us!

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
We'll do it! All four of us!

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Ugh. This is embarrassing.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Oh, give me a break!
We all know you wanted to.

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
There's no use denying it!

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:19.738 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:21.364 position:50% align:center
[KAKIWADA]
Look who's here!

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:23.533 position:50% align:center
[SHINGUU]
They officially join today, huh?

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.452 position:50% align:center
[YAMATANI]
Lucky us! Lucky us!

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:27.078 position:50% align:center
Okay, that's enough!

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
No harassing my cute juniors,
or we'll have problems!

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:30.790 position:50% align:center
Shoo, shoo!

00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:33.043 position:50% align:center
Aww. You're so mean, Sono!

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
[MAINTENANCE LEADER 1A]
Hey, brats!

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:37.172 position:50% align:center
If you've got time to chitchat,
you've got time to work!

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:38.715 position:50% align:center
[MAINTENANCE CREW]
Yeah...

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.592 position:50% align:center
Um, today's our first
day here, and we--

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:43.094 position:50% align:center
[MAINTENANCE LEADER 1A]
Eh, don't know, don't care.

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:46.723 position:50% align:center
I'll do my job and keep her
in perfect working condition.

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
You push her to the limit.

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:49.642 position:50% align:center
[MOE, KURUMI]
Uhh...

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:51.811 position:50% align:center
Take it from me; he's got
high hopes for you two.

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:53.063 position:50% align:center
You sure about that?

00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:54.439 position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:56.691 position:50% align:center
[MAINTENANCE LEADER 1A]
Shut your mouth, Gladiator!

00:21:56.775 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Run for it!

00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:00.153 position:50% align:center
--[KURUMI] Huh?!
--[MOE] Wait, run where?!

00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
This is Claudia Bruford,
ready for takeoff.

00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:11.206 position:50% align:center
Sonoka Watarai.
I'm all good to go.

00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:13.833 position:50% align:center
Azuzu Komagome. Standing by.

00:22:13.917 --> 00:22:16.586 position:50% align:center
Miyako Muguruma.
I'm ready to rock!

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.255 position:50% align:center
Moe Isurugi, reporting for duty!

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:23.968 position:50% align:center
Uh, hold on! I'm Kurumi
Suzuhara! Happy to be here!

00:22:30.183 --> 00:22:33.353 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA, AZUZU, MIYAKO, SONOKA]
We welcome you to Tateyama Base!
