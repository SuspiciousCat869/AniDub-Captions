What's that sound?

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.250 position:50% align:center
[KOUMOTO]
That, like, buzzing?

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
[SERA] Huh? I thought
they took that one down.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
Weird.

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
[high-pitched noise]

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
There it is again, you hear it?

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
[KOUMOTO]
That Pillar's back, too!

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center
[SERA gasps] Someone got hit!
They're falling this way!

--[AIZAWA gasps, yells]

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:38.143 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Hey, don't
wallow in your failure.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:39.811 position:50% align:center
I could help you practice.

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:41.604 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me, too.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
Good work, guys.

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.236 position:50% align:center
[BOYS gasp]

00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
What's up?

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
Got an idea?

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:01.124 position:50% align:center
You can tell?

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh! 'Cause the face you're
making is my favorite one!

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:04.419 position:50% align:center
Your inspired face!

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.670 position:50% align:center
Ugh!

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.672 position:50% align:center
So are you gonna tell us
what you figured out?

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
'Course I am.

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:11.468 position:50% align:center
How to outwit the Pillars
and rub it in their faces!

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.345 position:50% align:center
Faces?

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
Do Pillars have faces?

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] Uh? You know what
those sound waves were?

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center
That's Komagome for you--
always pulling through for us.

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] I'm pretty sure they're
using ultrasonic frequencies

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.649 position:50% align:center
that most people can't hear.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
Ultrasonic frequencies?

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.528 position:50% align:center
So a mosquito tone?

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
A what?

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:32.697 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA, AZUZU, CLAUDIA grunt]

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center
It's an extremely
high-pitched sound wave.

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.702 position:50% align:center
It's not unlike that of
a mosquito buzzing by your ear.

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
Ah! That buzzing
sound from before!

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.414 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Yeah.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:43.583 position:50% align:center
When one of these Pillars are
destroyed, they emit a sound,

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:47.253 position:50% align:center
signaling one of the others
nearby to help regenerate it.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.964 position:50% align:center
By the way, you can't
hear it if you're too old.

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:52.258 position:50% align:center
There's kind of an age cut-off.

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO chuckles]
Explains a lot.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
[MISATO gasps]

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.138 position:50% align:center

Hm?

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.309 position:50% align:center
[MISATO squeals]

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:03.353 position:50% align:center
I heard it, okay?!
I heard it and that's final!

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
Not another word!

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.773 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Anyway, now
that we know the signal,

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.274 position:50% align:center
we can easily disrupt it.

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
If we can do that while
we attack it, we'll--

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:14.114 position:50% align:center
--[GROUP gasps]
--What the--? What's going on?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] Um, don't
panic when you see this.

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Uh? Is that
Tateyama Castle by the base?

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] I've got
a bad feeling about this.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.084 position:50% align:center
Yup, I was right.

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.336 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] Yeah. It's the
worst case scenario.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.505 position:50% align:center
It reappeared right
outside the base.

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:31.965 position:50% align:center
Getting the four of you back

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
to your Hero Wings is going
to be a bit of a problem.

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.514 position:50% align:center
Tell us everything
about the situation.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.224 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
The same four Tertiary Pillars

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
from earlier
reappeared in Tateyama.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.271 position:50% align:center
Their search range
extends to 2,000 meters.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:47.647 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
But for some unknown,

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:49.566 position:50% align:center
and might I add,
annoying reason,

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.944 position:50% align:center
one moved near Tateyama Castle
and expanded the range.

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
[GROUP groans]

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Okay. And why
can't we return to base?

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Because unfortunately,

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.828 position:50% align:center
Pillars have a preference
when choosing targets.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
For weapons,
they attack planes first.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:05.915 position:50% align:center
But as for people...

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
They go after Valkyries.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
So the moment we
step into their range,

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.630 position:50% align:center
they'll know and launch
an all-out attack on us.

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
--[GROUP groans]
--[MIYAKO] I see.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50% align:center
We asked for help from the
other bases, but with no luck.

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
Everyone's afraid
one of the others

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
will appear near
their hangars now.

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
[MISATO gasps]

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.142 position:50% align:center
How much longer before
the nearest one becomes active?

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.519 position:50% align:center
We've got approximately
90 minutes.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:27.812 position:50% align:center
You heard the lady.

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
We're gonna need to
find a way to get you back

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
and ready to fly before then.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Oh, boy.

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:35.111 position:50% align:center
What if we sneaked back quietly?

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:38.073 position:50% align:center
Or sped home in a car
and tried to outrun the enemy?

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.783 position:50% align:center
We've actually tried
both of those plans

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
with Valkyries before, and
as a rule, we don't anymore.

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
You can imagine why.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:45.705 position:50% align:center
Yes, I can.

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
It's not fair.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
How do the Pillars even know
that it's us and not some rando?

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
They have their ways.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
While some use the basics,
like hearing and sight,

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
others can sense our
divine protection innately.

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:58.677 position:50% align:center
At least, that's
how it seems to us.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.930 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] These ones likely use
high frequencies to detect us.

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.640 position:50% align:center
But people have
avoided detection

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.558 position:50% align:center
underground in past cases.

Before the Pillars awaken,

we need to get you airborne.

Therefore, we've quickly
devised this plan!

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY] First, we leave
Taibusa-Misaki by sea

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
and make sure to stay out
of their search range.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
[SHADES] Then, using an
underground path we know of,

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
we'll carefully guide
you back to base.

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:47.619 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Somehow or another!

You're not even sure how?

So! Do you have any questions?

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.086 position:50% align:center

care to explain the underwear?

Sure thing.

How's that wave analysis?

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
Analysis complete.

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:51.876 position:50% align:center
The interference signal is ready
to go at a moment's notice.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.169 position:50% align:center
That's perfect!

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
Miyako, you remember
the plan, right?

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] All we've
gotta do is take 'em down

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:58.675 position:50% align:center
at the same time, one each!

00:20:58.758 --> 00:20:59.926 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Right.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
But timing is everything.

[AZUZU grunts]

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:25.618 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Yet again, Azu's
plan is a huge success!

00:21:25.702 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center
No surprise!

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
Thanks for all
your help, everyone!

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.373 position:50% align:center
[CREW]
Heh!

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.293 position:50% align:center
Whew! All that falling
really paid off in the end.

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:36.129 position:50% align:center
[CREW] That's our Azu!
Everyone's favorite!

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
Uh... Okay, sure, whatever.

[ICHIRO]
Good work, everyone.

00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center
It was another rough one today,
but you pulled through.

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center
We couldn't have done it

00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:47.432 position:50% align:center
without a brave
crew by our side.

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.476 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, Commander.

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:51.269 position:50% align:center
Where'd that plane come from?

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:52.729 position:50% align:center
Oh, good question.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:54.981 position:50% align:center
But if you wanna
know the answer,

00:21:55.065 --> 00:21:57.275 position:50% align:center
you might as well ask the pilot.
