I don't know how,

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.350 position:50% align:center
but multiple secondaries
have just appeared around Fuji!

[OKITA grunts]
How the hell?

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:23.231 position:50% align:center
Attention,
all aircraft near Fuji:

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center
Don't let the enemy
near the summit!

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.985 position:50% align:center
Your objective is now to secure

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.030 position:50% align:center
an escape route for
those inside at all costs!

That's--

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:37.328 position:50% align:center

No. It can't be.

Who...?

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
Who the hell's doing this?!

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:47.797 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
All of the unknown planes

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.300 position:50% align:center
are being identified
as downed Valkyries!

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.052 position:50% align:center
I don't know what's happening.

What the hell is that giant?

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.223 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY] I've never
seen a Pillar like that!

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.309 position:50% align:center

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:00.643 position:50% align:center

Break!

[SHAGGY]
That maneuvering!

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.482 position:50% align:center
Is that--?

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:06.649 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE]
No way.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.984 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
All aircraft,

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.278 position:50% align:center
the unknowns are
all downed Valkyries.

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:12.572 position:50% align:center
But they've been
reclassified as enemies.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:14.366 position:50% align:center
Permission to fire, granted.

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:16.743 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE]
Shit! Are you kidding?

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:18.453 position:50% align:center
So these are the
very same Valkyries

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.330 position:50% align:center
we've loved and adored?

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:25.669 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE] Just who the hell
do you guys think you are?!

[KOMACHI]
Shield Squadron is under attack!

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:04.392 position:50% align:center
Enemies in the forties,
fifties, and increasing!

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:06.186 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
So our enemies are Valkyries

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center
who we once fought beside.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:09.814 position:50% align:center
It's not hard to tell.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
Their planes and
piloting make it clear.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.861 position:50% align:center
After all, we've
been saved by them

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:18.365 position:50% align:center
a countless number
of times... for years.

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50% align:center
We remember.
How could we forget?

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.496 position:50% align:center
But to pit us against them?

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:26.831 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO grunts]

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.793 position:50% align:center
We didn't remember
each of them for this!

Why isn't the big one moving?

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:40.220 position:50% align:center

Focus on the enemies at hand!

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
[PILOT 7B gasps] What the--?
That thing's crazy fast!

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] Those marks...
They're Ortlinde's!

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
The S-Class Named!

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:57.529 position:50% align:center
She was the Guardian
of Japan. Sakura Okita.

Sakura...

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.831 position:50% align:center
[PILOT 7C]
Japan's Guardian is back?

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.207 position:50% align:center
And she's our enemy?!

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.626 position:50% align:center
[PILOT 7A] I know! Wake me
from this nightmare!

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.255 position:50% align:center

It's no use! I'm dead!

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET]
Not on my watch!

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
We'll take over from here!

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
You back off!

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
[PILOT 7C]
Thanks!

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET]
This piloting...

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.243 position:50% align:center
It really is Sakura.

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
[LEYLI] Reuniting like
this... It's horrible.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] It's a good thing
we're always moving forward.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
Because that means
the us of today,

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
are stronger than
the you of yesterday!

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50% align:center
Wow! Just listen
to her, all tough!

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
I know! It's inspiring, right?

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
Man, look at Claudy go! She's
in total sync with those two!

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Pay attention!
Don't lose focus, idiot!

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center
Azu! What should we do now?

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:11.728 position:50% align:center
Well, fighting an old comrade

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
wouldn't do anything
to help our morale.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.107 position:50% align:center
Let's go after the big one.

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good call. Let's do it!

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:26.242 position:50% align:center

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:44.094 position:50% align:center
They got past?

I've gotta get back! [yelps]

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.655 position:50% align:center
Is that a black Hero Wing?

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50% align:center
Shoot! I can't shake it!

Hurry up and get out of here!

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI]
Right!

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.665 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
[OKITA grunts]
Yeah, sorry. Any luck yet?

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
Have we found the Vandrande?

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
There's too much distortion-
we can't pinpoint it yet.

[ICHIRO]
What's wrong?

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:34.602 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] Pillars from all over
Japan are swarming this way!

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:37.564 position:50% align:center
You're kidding, right?
There's so many!

Radio for backup!

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center

Abort the mission!

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.444 position:50% align:center
Begin a full

What are you waiting for?

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
Inform all of our
combatants to retreat.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
[NONO]
This is command.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
All craft, withdraw from battle,
effective immediately!

Major General...?

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50% align:center

Sir?

[OKITA]
Onoue.

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:04.424 position:50% align:center
Sir?

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor.

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.218 position:50% align:center
Abort operation.

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
All craft, withdraw from battle,
effective immediately!

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
This is a retreat code, two-one.
I repeat. Abort operation.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
Retreat? But why?

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI] You heard her! Pillars
are coming from all over Japan!

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.231 position:50% align:center
We can't beat that!

[AZUZU]
Sono! Didn't you hear the order?

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
Retreat!

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
I've gotta go help them!

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
Azu, clear us a path, quick!

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:28.948 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
I'll do it! Take over for me!

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Hold on!

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Azu, they're not gonna listen.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
Let's just help the others get
out of here while they can.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.291 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Shit.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:39.876 position:50% align:center
Just don't forget to withdraw!

Oh, man! I can't lose 'em!

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.091 position:50% align:center

Leave it to me. Get outta here!

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.050 position:50% align:center
Roger!

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.885 position:50% align:center
Sorry about this!

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
Sonoka!

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
That's enough!
They're safe! Let's go!

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.689 position:50% align:center
No! Claudy's still
fighting all on her own!

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
Yeah, but she's a Named!

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
She can see things
you guys can't!

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:05.985 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Is that why?

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
What?

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.156 position:50% align:center
Is that why you did it?
Why you left me behind?

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.991 position:50% align:center
Sonoka.

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
You were a Named back then.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
That's why you left me.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Sonoka!

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:18.832 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA gasps]

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
Alice 2? No way.

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
Sonoka!

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
Sonoka! Level your plane! Hurry!

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
[OKITA] All right, let's not
beat around the bush here.

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
Tell me now.
What is this "Thor" thing?

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center

Not just yet.

"Valhalla?"

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
What do you mean? What is that?

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.536 position:50% align:center
How dare these Pillars make
us fight our fallen friends?

00:08:56.619 --> 00:09:00.331 position:50% align:center
[LEYLI] Let's put them
to rest as fast as we can!

It stopped!

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.467 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Yeah... luckily.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
But still...

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:57.305 position:50% align:center
...this operation...

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:04.145 position:50% align:center

You had us worried.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center
Come on, look this way.

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.383 position:50% align:center
Open your mouth.
Say "ah" for me.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
Everything checks out for now.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
You're quite the lucky one,

be our good news for the day.

Hey, Miko, Azu, and Clo?

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.825 position:50% align:center
What happened
after I blacked out?

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself!
You're hurt pretty bad.

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:04.748 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA groans]
Did we do it?

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.666 position:50% align:center
Did the plan work?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.461 position:50% align:center
No, we failed.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:10.628 position:50% align:center
Do you remember fighting

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.006 position:50% align:center
the downed Valkyries
inside the primary?

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah. The S-Class.

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center

[CLAUDIA]
The European girls and I,

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
somehow managed to minimize
the damage Ortlinde could do.

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.436 position:50% align:center
But then...

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:31.733 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI] That's when
the giant finally moved.

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:35.153 position:50% align:center
It used its weapon to send out
an enormous bolt of lightning.

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
Hard.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI] It wiped out
the majority of our forces.

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.958 position:50% align:center
And, yes, that includes command.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Command?

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:54.714 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me
Satomi was caught up in--

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:56.174 position:50% align:center
Please, not him, too.

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
It's not--

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:02.180 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] I'm touched that
you're so concerned about me.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
Satomi, you're okay!

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I made it
out just in time.

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
Major General Okita
made the smart call

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
and ordered us to
the auxiliary site.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.858 position:50% align:center
While on one hand, I'm relieved
that you and the operators

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
were able to make it out safe,

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center
on the other...

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
Major General Okita and
all of the officers who were

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
still with him were wiped out.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.703 position:50% align:center
Not only that,
but Odin was there, too,

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:26.413 position:50% align:center
and now no one can find him.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.790 position:50% align:center
It's unlikely he
survived the attack.

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
That beam left
nothing in its wake.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.627 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
Mm.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
It's not the easiest
thing to accept.

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
It's weird to think Odie
might actually be dead.

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Yeah, but it's true.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.681 position:50% align:center
Okay? And that's precisely
why we can't afford

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center
to lose any more
than we already have.

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
The situation's not good.

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
Our enemies in the
Primary stayed there,

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center
so we can forget
them for the moment.

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:56.192 position:50% align:center
But the ones that
came to their defense

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
still very much remain a threat.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] With this, the
operation has officially failed.

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
Now we have to undertake
a large-scale withdrawal

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center
and immediately
organize an evacuation

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.081 position:50% align:center
for all civilians
in the affected range.

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
An evacuation? Really?

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:13.877 position:50% align:center
Remember?

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
The backup Pillars are
still wandering all over.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center
They're not just
a threat to Fuji,

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:21.634 position:50% align:center
but to areas as
far away as Tateyama.

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
Tateyama, too?

we get some privacy?

Oh, man, that
takes me way back.

and held you like a body

Amatsuka, please!

You still always
act like a baby,

with your Valkyrie Wing,

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50% align:center

so many enemies out there,

to step up and do it.

Because I can't

Just keep that close

I hate you and everyone
else who has a death wish.

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:47.877 position:50% align:center
Either way,
you better come back.

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't have
you hating me, can I?

That said, if it were up to me,

I'd have preferred
some high-class saké.

You won't hear any

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center
