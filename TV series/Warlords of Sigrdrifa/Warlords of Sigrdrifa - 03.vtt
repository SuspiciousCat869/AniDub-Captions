[MIYAKO yelling]

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.359 position:50% align:center
Miyako.

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.695 position:50% align:center
Uh! Hello?

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.451 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
Nothing surprises you, does it?

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Claudia.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.415 position:50% align:center
How's my beloved daughter
doing this morning?

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.633 position:50% align:center
[sighs] How many times
do I have to say it?

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:18.096 position:50% align:center
I'm not your daughter,
and you know it, Odin.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.181 position:50% align:center
Ah, you're no fun.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:23.768 position:50% align:center
And yet I've always been here,
loving you as if you were.

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:24.728 position:50% align:center
Tragic.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:25.812 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Don't get me wrong.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.313 position:50% align:center
I'm still grateful
that you're siding

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.190 position:50% align:center
with humanity in this battle.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:32.277 position:50% align:center
But that doesn't change the fact
that I'm not your offspring.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
Such a stubborn daughter.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:37.198 position:50% align:center
But that's what
makes you so cute.

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:39.951 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Anyway, why'd you bring me here?

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:41.995 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
Must I have a reason?

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.872 position:50% align:center
I'm quite bored.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.999 position:50% align:center
I'm stuck doing
what the humans wanted.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:48.626 position:50% align:center
Sitting in isolation
to ease their minds.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.837 position:50% align:center
They're basically punishing
me for visiting my family

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.255 position:50% align:center
if you think about it.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:55.133 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] But you're a god.
How can they punish you?

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:58.219 position:50% align:center
Uh? You know what?
That's a good point.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:03.099 position:50% align:center
I walked right into that one,
Claudia! You got me good!

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.101 position:50% align:center
By the way, congrats.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.271 position:50% align:center
You've been on quite
the roll lately.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.190 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
What do you mean?

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] With those Pillars that
you refer to as "Secondary."

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.530 position:50% align:center
They've never fallen
so quickly before.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
Not in succession, at least.

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.284 position:50% align:center
At first, I was concerned
when you were

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center
sent off to the Far East,
but you haven't disappointed.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.374 position:50% align:center
Why do I get the feeling
you brought me here

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50% align:center
just to tell me that?

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
Because I did.

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:33.546 position:50% align:center
I have to praise my daughter
when she does well, right?

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50% align:center
Am I not the perfect father?

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.593 position:50% align:center
Also...

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:41.471 position:50% align:center
...Ortlinde has perished.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
What good father wouldn't
be worried for you?

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.600 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA grunts]

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.105 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
Do keep up this winning streak

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
for the decisive
battle will come.

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
And until that day,

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.737 position:50% align:center
you'd be wise to gather
as much strength as you can.

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
For Ragnarok, right?

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
Take care, now.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
I'll be watching.

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:13.420 position:50% align:center
Show me that wonderful
smile of yours.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Thank you for
the praise for my successes.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center
However, they weren't
achieved by my strength alone.

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
That is true.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.310 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're getting
along with your new friends.

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50% align:center
Really.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
Let's just hope you
don't kill them this time,

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.902 position:50% align:center
Grim Reaper Claudia.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.362 position:50% align:center

[inhales, exhales]

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Here!

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.079 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.707 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] I'm surprised
you knew it was me.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.250 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
I just trusted my gut.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.502 position:50% align:center
I thought I saw you for a sec
when I was cleaning before,

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
but then you disappeared.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50% align:center
So I figured you must have
gone to see Odie, that's all.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.886 position:50% align:center
"Odie" as in Odin?
You and your nicknames.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA grunts]

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
So what happened?

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
How was Odie? In a good mood?

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA clears throat]
It's hard to tell.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
He just seemed the
same as usual, I guess.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] I don't see him enough
to know what "usual" means.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:18.651 position:50% align:center
He says I'm too loud,

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.362 position:50% align:center
and I kinda get the
feeling he hates me.

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
You think so? Odin?
Even though you're a Valkyrie?

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50% align:center
That's what it seems
like, at least.

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:26.993 position:50% align:center
But not you!
You're Odie's favorite!

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.953 position:50% align:center
You guys get along, right?

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center
It doesn't exactly
feel that way honestly.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] So what were
you here for anyway?

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:35.794 position:50% align:center
Morning training?

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
Such a hard worker!

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
I could ask you the same thing.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
What are you doing at
the dojo this early?

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.802 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Morning training,
too. And some cleaning.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
Glad you're here though!

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
I'm, like, the only
one who uses the dojo.

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
So having company is
a welcome change of pace.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:51.643 position:50% align:center
You train, too?
Who'd have guessed?

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
The house I grew up
in had a dojo,

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
so training is a part
of my morning routine.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.565 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.901 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO sighs] But I don't
have the time for it today.

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
I gotta head over to
the cafeteria in a sec.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.864 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] It's way too early for
breakfast. I doubt it's open.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO laughs]
I know it's closed.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
But they'll let me in.
It's my turn to make breakfast.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
Are you serious? You're
gonna make everyone breakfast?

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.040 position:50% align:center
Yup! I sure am!

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
Oh, y'know what?

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:17.585 position:50% align:center
Since you're already up,
why don't you give me a hand?

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50% align:center
That would make
everyone so happy!

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:20.547 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Uhh...

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
Lookin' good, girl!

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
If you're ever
unsure what to do,

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.719 position:50% align:center
just let me know and
I'll show you how it's done.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.346 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] To be honest, I don't
know where to begi-- Ahh!

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center
Wait, is it still alive?

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.559 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Yeah, it's a spunky one, huh?

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:35.812 position:50% align:center
Wanna do me a favor
and get the plates ready?

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.439 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO humming]

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:39.691 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
You make this look like magic.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.234 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Practice makes perfect!

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center
The most important
part in cooking is love,

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
but good technique is
what helps you mix it in!

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.616 position:50% align:center
Give it a taste!

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center
It's delicious.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
Well, it's easy
to learn something

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.582 position:50% align:center
when you love doing it!

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
Learning is a matter
of loving something, huh?

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.295 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.590 position:50% align:center
[CREW cheering]

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.925 position:50% align:center
Okay, I want to see
a single file line!

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.387 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I can't believe how
tired I am just from cooking.

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Good work, Clo.

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.683 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Sonoka.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:14.809 position:50% align:center
Who is Clo?

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.644 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
You! Since we're buddies now,

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:20.273 position:50% align:center
I wanted to give you a nickname
like I did for the other girls!

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
Miko...

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
...Clo...

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.652 position:50% align:center
...and Azu.

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.571 position:50% align:center
Where is she? Sleeping?

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] I imagine.
She's not a morning person.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.742 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Thanks for waiting!

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.911 position:50% align:center
Miyako's way better at cooking
than I would have thought.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] She does seem
kinda clumsy at first.

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:36.748 position:50% align:center
Is that why you're surprised?

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.667 position:50% align:center
I don't know.
I wouldn't go that far.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Well, I wouldn't
blame you if you did.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
Truth is, she's not
only good at cooking,

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.297 position:50% align:center
but all sorts of
other chores, too.

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:47.550 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Okay, maybe I am
a little bit surprised.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Hm? What are you two

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.512 position:50% align:center
talking about
over here in secret?

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.514 position:50% align:center
It's nothing. Clo's just
shocked to see all of your

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50% align:center
domestic skills in
action, that's all.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center
Sonoka...

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.977 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO giggles]
Don't worry, no offense taken.

00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:00.021 position:50% align:center
I get told that pretty often.

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
You pick up a few things
in a strict household.

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.526 position:50% align:center
Especially when you
have a mom like mine.

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
She always said, "You're pretty
cute, but you're not too bright,

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
so learn how to do the
housework to make up for it."

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50% align:center
And I did!

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.033 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Sounds about right.

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:14.035 position:50% align:center
I mean, your skills
are so refined.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.121 position:50% align:center
You're even graceful
using chopsticks!

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.706 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Huh? That reminds me.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
I'm not so bad with
chopsticks myself,

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
even though I'm not from here.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Oh, I bet you learned how to

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center
use 'em from your Dad, huh?

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
That's right. I did.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.967 position:50% align:center
He drilled it into me.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
So your Dad knew how to
use them well? How come?

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
It's 'cause he loved Japan!
Claudy told me so!

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.558 position:50% align:center
Doesn't that make you kinda
happy? It does for me.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
Wow! Yeah, for some
reason it does!

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA gasps]

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
What's up? Is something wrong?

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:44.065 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] This is raw fish.
I don't think I can handle it.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Huh?! But it's so tasty!

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:47.610 position:50% align:center
You're never gonna
grow big and tall

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:49.237 position:50% align:center
if you're picky about your food!

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.239 position:50% align:center
Maybe if Sonoka was
taller I'd buy that.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.575 position:50% align:center
She eats anything
and everything.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] All her growth
happens in her chest.

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.245 position:50% align:center
Can't you tell by looking?

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.998 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Hey! Stop staring
at me, you pervert!

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.500 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] You're all way too
energetic for how early it is.

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Uh! Good morning, Azu!

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
Surprised to see you up!

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna eat with us?

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
[yawns] No. I don't think
I can stomach it yet.

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
Uh! I'll have this though.

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
That is such bad manners, Azu!

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
At least sit up!

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
Here, use your chopsticks.

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
Agh, sheesh! Guess I'll
just have to feed you.

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] You Valkyries sure
are lively this morning, huh?

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO grunts] Hey, Commander!
How's the morning treating you?

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center
I can't complain. Though
I'm not as awake as you.

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to see you're
finally opening up

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
to your partners in the sky.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
Not that I thought you wouldn't.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Yup! You got
that right, Commander!

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.668 position:50% align:center
We're the bestest of friends!

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.045 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
Good. Couldn't ask
for anything more!

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Didn't get much sleep?

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:53.385 position:50% align:center
I see a lot of people
yawning this morning.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:56.888 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I've got plenty
of reasons for losing sleep.

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.557 position:50% align:center
So, what's the Valkyrie
Wing up to today?

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
Any plans?

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Nothing on my schedule yet.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] I've got a meeting
with maintenance later.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
Doin' some more modifications?

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
Just routine maintenance
on my Hero Wing.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:12.445 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] In that case, I've got
something for the rest of you.

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:15.573 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to go to Umihotaru,
the site of the recent attack,

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:18.076 position:50% align:center
and perform a disaster
recovery assessment.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Umihotaru.

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
An assessment makes sense.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
But why ask us to
do it specifically?

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:25.834 position:50% align:center
It was a pretty
irregular situation

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.127 position:50% align:center
when it comes down to it.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
It's possible the area
could still be affected.

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:32.799 position:50% align:center
If it is, there's not
many people who can tell.

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Just those with Odin's
divine protection, us Valkyries.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:41.057 position:50% align:center
Thank you for explaining.
I understand. Mission accepted.

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
Roger. We'll go and
check it out for you.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
Commander, I'm, uh, kinda busy.

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.523 position:50% align:center
Chill, Miyako.
I've got you covered.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
I'll let you know the second
anything changes, okay?

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
Azu.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:54.738 position:50% align:center
See? I'm totally
trustworthy, right?

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.531 position:50% align:center
You're safe with me.
So can I put a rocket engine

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
on your Hero Wing or what?

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.492 position:50% align:center
Let's be real; you'd
find a way to botch it.

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:00.452 position:50% align:center
Say what?!

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Did you forget your mods

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
have a track
record of exploding?

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.330 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU growls]

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
Commander! Mission
accepted! I'll go!

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:11.046 position:50% align:center
Glad to hear it.
I'll have some of the guys

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center
take you there in the
van, so just sit tight.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.759 position:50% align:center
You'll be in charge once
you're there, Captain Claudy.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Hm? Wait, I'm in charge?

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
[GROUP giggles]

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.891 position:50% align:center
We'll be at your service,
Captain Claudy!

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:25.518 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Sigururi!

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Sigururi.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE]
You know what?

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
Having the honor of
escorting you girls around

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
is just the thing
I needed today!

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.073 position:50% align:center
Looks like all that
rock-paper-scissors

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
training has paid off.

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.618 position:50% align:center
This is a mission,
not some vacation.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.412 position:50% align:center
We know! And we'll get
the job done. Promise.

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
But hittin'
Umihotaru with girls?

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
The thought alone is enough
to get any guy excited.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
Cut us some slack!

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center
Take it from me, Clo.

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
You'll feel a lot better if
you just ignore what they say.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE] Sono, you're so mean!
Wouldn't have it any other way.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.718 position:50% align:center
Look, you can see it now!

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:00.762 position:50% align:center
Umihotaru!

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.474 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised it's so busy.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50% align:center
They're tough
cookies for reopening

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.811 position:50% align:center
as soon as the military
gave 'em permission,

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
but this is more
than I expected.

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, what?

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
They gave them permission
before our assessment?

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
Uh! I, uh--

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
I mean...

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Claudy! Check it out!

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
They said they'd
give us a freebie!

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
Get your butt over here!

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
But we've barely
begun our assessment.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
We can't keep her waiting, Clo!

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center

Wait, Sonoka!

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:31.626 position:50% align:center

So good!

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.795 position:50% align:center

So good!

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center

That was awesome!

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:40.719 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Yes, it was wonderful!

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.971 position:50% align:center
C'mon! Let's hit the next
place. I'm not full yet!

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
What do you mean the next place?

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE 3A] Thanks for
everything, Miss Valkyrie.

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
Tell your friends, that, too!

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center

enough for what you do for us!

Excuse me.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO sihs] I think we
were able to hit everywhere!

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:32.020 position:50% align:center
I still can't believe
everyone gave us free stuff.

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:33.438 position:50% align:center
I'm glad we came!

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
All right, I've had enough.

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
Don't you guys
think we're mixing

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:37.442 position:50% align:center
business and pleasure here?

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
We're soldiers who came
here with specific orders.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.280 position:50% align:center
You know as well as I do that
they weren't to play around.

forgotten the assessment.

Wait!

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:49.746 position:50% align:center
What's the problem? We've been
following orders all day.

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:50.747 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Hm?

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
If you take a look around,

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
can't you see how happy
and healthy everyone is?

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.878 position:50% align:center

okay is the job.

I've always thought that calling
it an "assessment" was overkill.

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
It sounds so formal,
but I promise,

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.308 position:50% align:center

Well, guess you could say that.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
Hey! Let's take a break
at that rest area!

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:42.882 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Good grief.

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
We've spent practically
all day eating.

[MIYAKO]
It's not like we do this often.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Yeah. You're right.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:52.183 position:50% align:center
Why did you two
come to Tateyama?

[SONOKA]
Uh?

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50% align:center
Why? There's no special reason.

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.272 position:50% align:center
I was just told by
the commander to come,

00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:59.190 position:50% align:center
so I was following orders.

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:00.358 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
I think I'm here 'cause

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:02.235 position:50% align:center
I screwed up at the
last place I was at.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
You know how it is.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.613 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Yeah, Miko's a problem child

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
who got sent away
for bad behavior.

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:10.618 position:50% align:center
You were a "problem child"?
That doesn't sound good.

00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
It's no big deal!

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50% align:center
I just got in a little trouble
for ignoring some orders.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.374 position:50% align:center
Along with Azu.

Uhh...

[SONOKA]
Yeah, you heard that right.

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
Miko and Azu are
an inseparable pair.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.423 position:50% align:center

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.258 position:50% align:center
Isn't that nice?

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:26.468 position:50% align:center
I remember at first

00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50% align:center
I was really worried
about being sent away.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.306 position:50% align:center
But I've got Azu, Sono,
and now you by my side.

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:34.476 position:50% align:center
So considering how it turned
out, I'm glad it happened.

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
I'm so thankful I have you guys!

That goes for me, too.

don't kill them this time,

Hey, Miko?

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:56.373 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm ready.
Sorry. I gotta go.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:59.376 position:50% align:center
Don't mind us. Do what
you gotta do, Miko.

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Mm.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:06.508 position:50% align:center
I'm lost. What was
that all about?

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Have you ever heard the saying

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:12.639 position:50% align:center
people who are sent off by
Valkyries become heroes?

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
Well, it's also said that
those who become "heroes"

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:17.060 position:50% align:center
are able to reunite
with the people they love.

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:18.478 position:50% align:center
Does that ring a bell?

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] No. But it
sounds like a fairy-tale.

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:23.942 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's how
I feel about it, too.

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
But it's a fact that we
live in a world with gods.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:33.076 position:50% align:center
So maybe, fairy-tales like
that might be true after all.

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.376 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY]
Decided to come?

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Is Miyako inside?

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY]
That's right.

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:49.718 position:50% align:center
But, uh... hang on a sec.

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
There's something you
should probably know, Claudy.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
[grunts] You're here,
too, Azuzu?

00:16:58.518 --> 00:16:59.894 position:50% align:center
Where's Miyako?

[AZUZU grunts]

00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:06.151 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
And who's she in there with?

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
A soldier.

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
One of the guys that
flew recon for Umihotaru.

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
They say he
shielded his comrade.

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.703 position:50% align:center
I remember.

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
I tell her it's
just superstition

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:21.750 position:50% align:center
for Valkyries to
send people off,

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
but that fool
doesn't listen to me.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
She always does it,
like some kind of idiot.

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
[RECON 2A] Man, I get
you all to myself, Miko?

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
Wait till the other guys find
out. They'll be jealous.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, they
can't be that mean.

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
I doubt they'd be so
petty when you're injured.

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:41.144 position:50% align:center
You don't think
they'll just let it slide?

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:44.022 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe. [chuckles]

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
But I gotta say,
you're the best, Miko.

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
Just perfect.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:52.530 position:50% align:center

good about little ol' me?

First of all, your long hair.

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center
You work in the kitchen,
but your hands are so smooth.

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
[RECON 2A] You've got
those big, bright eyes.

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:06.461 position:50% align:center
And you don't cry
when saying good-bye.

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:08.171 position:50% align:center
But the best thing...

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.215 position:50% align:center
But the best thing?

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:14.636 position:50% align:center
[RECON 2A] ...is that I know
you'll live much longer than me.

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:19.599 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Oh. I see. Maybe.

00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:22.894 position:50% align:center
His condition's been
bad since last night.

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
It's a miracle
he's conscious again.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
Wait, since last night? Really?

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:31.444 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I've got plenty
of reasons for losing sleep.

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
If you go in there,
you'll regret it.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.328 position:50% align:center

just because she is.

Sorry,

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:49.504 position:50% align:center

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:07.040 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Rest in peace.

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:09.125 position:50% align:center
And thank you.

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
I know it's a cruel
and unfair thing

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
to burden you girls with,

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.596 position:50% align:center
but we're all
eternally grateful.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
If there's a
Valkyrie by our side,

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center
we know that we'll never
have to face death alone.

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
And that really is a comfort.

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
Sorry about this.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center

time to set a new tone

I wanna ask you something.

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.265 position:50% align:center
Okay.

[MIYAKO] I'm not.
At least, I don't think I am.

But if my new buddy
Claudy thinks that I am,

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:03.698 position:50% align:center
it'd be rude of me to
keep my secret from her!

00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:06.743 position:50% align:center
And I wouldn't wanna be
rude to my friend, now would I?

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.705 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
I'll tell you it.

[MIYAKO] The secret
to unbridled strength

00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:17.087 position:50% align:center
is a willingness to
eat all kinds of foods
