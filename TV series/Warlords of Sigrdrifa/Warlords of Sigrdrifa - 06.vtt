[MIYAKO] Whoa! Look at
how many planes there are!

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:40.040 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Calm down, idiot.
They'll laugh at you.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:41.166 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU sighs]

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:44.044 position:50% align:center
I kinda get how
Miyako feels though.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:47.547 position:50% align:center
It's not every day
there's a battle this big.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.966 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
You can tell everyone's on edge.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.009 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
It's a counteroffensive

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:53.011 position:50% align:center
on a scale unlike any other.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.304 position:50% align:center
I'm not surprised.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.555 position:50% align:center
Good thing the dormant period

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
means all those
Pillars are asleep.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:58.975 position:50% align:center
Since it's safe to
leave their posts,

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.518 position:50% align:center
they were able to
send us Valkyries

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:01.978 position:50% align:center
from all over the world.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.938 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Well, I can't
imagine any other situation

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:07.025 position:50% align:center
that would allow for so many
of us to gather in one place.

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.611 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Man, Valkyries
from the world over!

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:12.238 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to see what
they're like. So exciting!

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:13.823 position:50% align:center
You're so carefree.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.910 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] She just likes
to keep things positive.

You see that face she made?

[gasps]

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.793 position:50% align:center

That wasn't very nice of you.

[CLAUDIA]
Lizbet! Leyli!

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:30.465 position:50% align:center
Yo! Sure been
a while, huh, Claudia?

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.267 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI whistles]
Japan's best,

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
and the rest of the world's
aces, all right in front of us.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:11.149 position:50% align:center
It's not every day you see this!

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.817 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE gasps]
Whoa!

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
It's actually them!

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
The Dancing Goddess
and the Maid from Hell!

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:19.949 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it!

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.659 position:50% align:center
Me neither! I never
thought I'd see them

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.411 position:50% align:center
outside of <i>Einherjar Monthly</i> !

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:24.829 position:50% align:center
Never heard of it.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY]
It's a military magazine.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.208 position:50% align:center
It's how we keep up
with the battles

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50% align:center
happening around the world,
and the Valkyries fightin' em!

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:32.420 position:50% align:center
I heard they're thinking
about covering our base

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center
in the next edition,
which I'm all for.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Awesome!

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.677 position:50% align:center
You guys think they'll
wanna take pictures of us?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.345 position:50% align:center
Or maybe do an interview or two?

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:42.222 position:50% align:center
I thought that name
sounded familiar.

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.516 position:50% align:center
I think they approached
me for an article one time.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center
You know, I keep forgetting
that you're S-Class,

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center
but then you go and
say stuff like that.

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50% align:center
Look, dude, it's
Europe's top three.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
[MAINTENANCE 6A]
Basically mankind's best!

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center
Good ol' S-Class, always
the center of attention.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
Happens. Just ignore them.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Hey, Claudy,
do you have a cool nickname

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.200 position:50% align:center
like those other girls?

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
The one's that were
in the magazine, I mean.

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
What, you mean
besides Grim Reaper?

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.289 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE]
That's not cute enough!

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
Let's brainstorm and come up
with a different nickname.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
One that's more fitting!

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.128 position:50% align:center
The Princess!

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.129 position:50% align:center
[SHADES]
Angel!

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:15.547 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
How 'bout Glutton?

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center
Would you morons cut it out?!

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
Look at them go. Weird
bunch you ended up with.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
They sure are.

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
And I'm proud to have them.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50% align:center
What's with that face? You okay?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
I'm fine.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50% align:center
[LEYLI chuckles]
I can explain!

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
She's just pouting because
you're praising them so openly.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.735 position:50% align:center
I'd put money on it.

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lily!

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:41.906 position:50% align:center
I kinda expected
you to be depressed,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.451 position:50% align:center
or uncomfortable here,
but it's the opposite.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.494 position:50% align:center
You're loving it, aren't you?

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.163 position:50% align:center
[LEYLI]
That's a good thing.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:49.664 position:50% align:center
So how is it here?

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:52.250 position:50% align:center
Well, for one thing,
the food's really good.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.044 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET] That's the
first thing you thought of?

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
It's important to me.

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
It's nice seeing you get along

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
with people I've
never met before!

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.926 position:50% align:center
I'm getting major buddy
vibes between you three!

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
These two and I
aren't exactly...

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.140 position:50% align:center
No, I guess you're right.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
They're great friends.

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO squeals]

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
What? Wha--?

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
What's gotten into
you all of a sudden?

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
What are we even
supposed to say to that?

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
You're puttin' us on the spot!

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, we can
tell you're happy.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.986 position:50% align:center
I am, too, though.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
Ahem! Man, you're
tripping me up today.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we've been hurting
to fill the hole you left,

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
you know.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Yeah. I'm sorry
about that, but--

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET]
But?

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
If we all come together

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
and defeat the Primary
Pillar in this operation,

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
doesn't that more
than make up for it?

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
Look at you, talkin' all big.

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:41.633 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Claudy's right!

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50% align:center
So, let's all do our best!

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure to
work with you both!

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.514 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Same here!

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.516 position:50% align:center
I'm looking
forward to it, Miyako.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
Miko sure acts like
a big shot sometimes.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
I think you mean a big idiot.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
I bet she's got no idea she's
talking to prestigious pilots.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
Knowing her, she wouldn't care.

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:02.320 position:50% align:center
She'd treat them the same.

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI] Okay, okay!
Sorry to spoil all the fun

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
you girls are having,
but it's time for us to go.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.620 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Shoot! Move your butt!

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.831 position:50% align:center
We'll have to talk again later!

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.916 position:50% align:center
Sure thing, see ya!

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
After you, Miss Helmwige.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:21.006 position:50% align:center
Oh, stop. Let's all
just head there together.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
Helmwige, huh?

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
You're late.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.176 position:50% align:center
We thought you wouldn't make it!

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.262 position:50% align:center
We got to talking
and lost track of time!

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50% align:center
In other words, they think
the world revolves around them

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:30.974 position:50% align:center
and they could just
show up whenever they want.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Hey, sit down, it's starting!

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.939 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Who's that getting on stage?

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:39.524 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Commander of the operation,

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
Major General Okita.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
What's Major General?

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
It's like an Air-Vice Marshal.
That more familiar?

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
So the commander's going to

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
explain the plan himself?

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.660 position:50% align:center
That's unusual.

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] No, there's
plenty of officers for that.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
He's got a job only
a commander can do.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.136 position:50% align:center
[OKITA]
Six years.

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:12.515 position:50% align:center
Six years since humanity
first encountered the Pillars.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.685 position:50% align:center
And we have only known defeat.

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
We lost Europe, fled to Asia,

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:22.525 position:50% align:center
and in the skies,
we fight a losing war.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:27.113 position:50% align:center
We fight the Pillars,
which continue to destroy us.

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
"Victory" in battle...

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
...is something we
have yet to claim.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
[OKITA]
Nevertheless,

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50% align:center
today, we have come together.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.378 position:50% align:center
And for what purpose?

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.214 position:50% align:center
So we can win.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50% align:center
[OKITA]
For what purpose?

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:47.676 position:50% align:center
T-To win, sir!

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.386 position:50% align:center
For victory!

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
You! For what purpose?

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
To take back everything
they took from us!

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.767 position:50% align:center
[PILOT 6A]
To avenge our comrades!

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
[PILOT 6B]
To regain our dignity!

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
So that we may not
lose sight of who we are!

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.441 position:50% align:center
So that all of us can
see tomorrow together!

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
[OKITA]
That's right! You're all right!

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
For our friends!
For our families!

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.991 position:50% align:center
For our pride!

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
We're here now because
of that thing on Mount Fuji!

A mountain
conquered by humanity!

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center
We're here to tell
that preposterous Pillar,

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:24.254 position:50% align:center
that humanity will
not be underestimated!

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.964 position:50% align:center
We're here today

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
to take back our country.

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:32.512 position:50% align:center
To take back our future!

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50% align:center
[CROWD]
Yeah!

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
Sakura?

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
A wonderful speech.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,
it truly touched my heart.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.288 position:50% align:center
It's Odin.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.914 position:50% align:center
Silence, everyone.

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:01.833 position:50% align:center
Remember, God Odin
is our partner

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
in this counteroffensive.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:06.004 position:50% align:center
It's natural he'd
appear before it begins.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:08.840 position:50% align:center
He's come here to offer you
his words of encouragement.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
In fact, that's exactly right.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:14.095 position:50% align:center
But honestly,
a speech as fun as that

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:16.389 position:50% align:center
is going to be
a tough act to follow.

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:18.558 position:50% align:center
No, thanks.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.643 position:50% align:center
Besides, this should
be heard by more

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
than just the warriors who
are present at the moment.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:29.861 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] Hear me, all of you
who have gathered here!

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:33.448 position:50% align:center
I swear, I don't intend
to question the reasons

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
for which you fight.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
However, I promise you this:

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
My beloved daughters,

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
and the warriors who fight
beside them--

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
In this impending battle,

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:49.422 position:50% align:center
I will personally
watch over you!

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
My dear humans,

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
right now,

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
Odin, a god, gives
you his blessing.

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
You have my protection!

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
We have Odin's protection!

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:11.319 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY, SHADES]
We have Odin's blessing!

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:16.408 position:50% align:center
[CROWD] Odin! Odin!

Odin! Odin! Odin! Odin!

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:25.750 position:50% align:center
Tch.

[CREW 6A] We've still
got lots of work to do!

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
[CREW 6B]
Hurry it up!

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
Man! Look at this!
Everyone's so pumped!

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center
That's what having
a god on your side does!

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:45.854 position:50% align:center
Guess so. The crowd
was going wild.

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:49.566 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Hmm. But of course, us
pilots are on orders to standby.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
Kinda makes it hard
to unwind after that.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:55.030 position:50% align:center
We'll be in the air
in a matter of hours.

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
Besides, I don't think it's
even possible for you to unwind.

00:10:58.283 --> 00:10:59.409 position:50% align:center
You know, now that
you mention it,

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.494 position:50% align:center
I think you're probably right!

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] What about you,
Sono? Are you nervous?

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
Not at all. I'm fine.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
You sure? If not,
it's okay to speak up.

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.796 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] What's with you?
Did you eat something funny?

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
Probably the black cod.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Just zip it!

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
It was tasty.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Could you guys be
nervous for once in your life?

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.346 position:50% align:center

Hey. It's the Valkyrie Wing.

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:22.766 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
We're home!

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
Welcome back!

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
[KAKIWADA] We heard Odin's
big speech from here.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.938 position:50% align:center
It must have gone out
to the whole base.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Oh, yeah? That's a god for you!

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
He's gotta make
everything a little extra.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.528 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Is Amatsuka not back yet?

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
By that do you mean Big Sis?

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
[YAMATANI] We just saw her walk
off with Commander Satomi.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it sounded like

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
they were gonna have
a serious conversation.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.625 position:50% align:center

Sono!

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] Trust me, I get
where you're coming from.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I don't want her to
be out there fighting either.

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:58.218 position:50% align:center
Although, if she doesn't fight,

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
then aren't the others
at a greater risk?

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:02.764 position:50% align:center
Just let me handle
it, all right?

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm here.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm S-Class Helmwige.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.604 position:50% align:center
Former.

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
You used to be S-Class.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.359 position:50% align:center
I still hear her crying
in my dreams from that day,

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:17.112 position:50% align:center
the last time she couldn't fly.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:20.365 position:50% align:center
I just want her to
be safe, that's all.

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.075 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
I know you do.

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
But for that you're willing
to sabotage her plane again,

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:27.205 position:50% align:center
even if it breaks her heart?

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:28.707 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.003 position:50% align:center
Just now...

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
What did you just say to her?

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
Sonoka.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA grunts]
What does he mean by that?!

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center
Answer me, Big Sister!

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO gasps]
Sono! Wait!

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry that you
all had to see that.

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.072 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
But you--

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
Spill it. What did
you mean by that?

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:07.412 position:50% align:center
Exactly what it sounded like.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.914 position:50% align:center
I simply didn't let her fly.

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:13.793 position:50% align:center
That is, two years ago,
when I was shot down.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.547 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR 6A]
Mars 1 is hit!

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.840 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Amatsuka!

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.800 position:50% align:center
No, Big Sister!

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:23.636 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
It's... not... a big deal.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
This much... won't keep me down.

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:29.768 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Can I fly yet?

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:31.853 position:50% align:center
What? You're plane's
still in no shape for that!

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.938 position:50% align:center
Besides, at this point it's--

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:35.482 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR 6B]
Mars 2, signal lost!

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No.

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA cries]
Jinguuji...

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:48.370 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Please, let me fly!

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:53.500 position:50% align:center

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Big Sister!

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.639 position:50% align:center
No!

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:12.185 position:50% align:center
Miraculously, I survived
by the skin of my teeth...

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
...somehow.

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:16.981 position:50% align:center
But I was far too
ashamed to face her.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:20.527 position:50% align:center
So Satomi here continued to
look after her in my place,

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.071 position:50% align:center
even in Tateyama.

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Well, I was responsible for

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.241 position:50% align:center
losing a Named Valkyrie.

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
Of course, they pushed me
away from the front lines.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.496 position:50% align:center
She fell into my care by chance.

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.666 position:50% align:center
I was hardly being noble.

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:38.211 position:50% align:center
You're Helmwige.

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:39.879 position:50% align:center
About two years ago,

00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:43.299 position:50% align:center
I took the place of
a Named that got unregistered.

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:44.509 position:50% align:center
If things were different,

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:47.971 position:50% align:center
you and Sakura would
have been my juniors.

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Can I ask you something?

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
Why did you sabotage
Sonoka's plane?

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
Because I had a bad feeling--

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:59.482 position:50% align:center
one that made the hair stand
up on the back of my neck.

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] You're kidding, right?
That was your reasoning?

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:05.405 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
It might seem illogical to you,

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:08.074 position:50% align:center
but it's different for me.

00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:09.909 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
I know what you mean.

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:13.997 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, it feels like
I can sense danger, too.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] And that's why
you don't want her to fly

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.042 position:50% align:center
this time, either?

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:20.712 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI] Unfortunately, this
go-around, she found me out.

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:23.256 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Dammit! This sucks!

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.384 position:50% align:center
It's not like I can fault
you for being overprotective!

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:30.972 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
I know. But we need Sonoka.

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center
And more importantly...

00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
...humanity needs her.

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:39.022 position:50% align:center
This is exactly why I hate war.

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:40.023 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.609 position:50% align:center
Azu, Claudy, let's do this!

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:44.277 position:50% align:center
We've gotta kick
Pillar butt today,

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
so Sono and Big Sis can make up!

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center
You're more concerned with them
than the survival of humanity?

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]

[ICHIRO]
Watarai, how're you feeling?

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
Could be a lot better.

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:05.215 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Well, it's understandable.

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:08.843 position:50% align:center

not even come back after that.

That's what Big--

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
That's what Amatsuka
was hoping I'd do.

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:20.188 position:50% align:center
But I decided I'm
gonna prove something.

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center

Don't get so worked up.

Try to keep up!

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY] Secondaries

[MIYAKO]
Whoa! Sono's awesome!

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
She can pull off that maneuver?

[YAYOI]
It's a piece of cake for her.

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
After all, she's...

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
She's easily matching
Schwertleite's speed!

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.310 position:50% align:center
Who is that girl?

00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50% align:center
So that's her,

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
the world's youngest
ever Named candidate.

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:30.110 position:50% align:center
Impressive. No wonder
Satomi keeps her close by.

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
To think we're at the point

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.446 position:50% align:center

this kind of thing.

All right! Finally my turn!

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:43.790 position:50% align:center

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.253 position:50% align:center
Seventy-five percent of

Nothing yet.

A Lancaster?

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
The hell did that come from?

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
That's a Named from England.

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:14.696 position:50% align:center
It's Sveio's Hero Wing.

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Is it just me, or
is it way bigger on the inside?

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
No, Primary Pillars are

00:19:57.489 --> 00:20:00.950 position:50% align:center
only supposed to be
500 meters in diameter.

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:03.661 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Must be one of
those "other dimensions."

00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:05.163 position:50% align:center
Be careful.

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
There's no telling what'll
happen now that we're inside.

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
Could you be any more ominous?

Are those..?

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
Where did all those
planes come from?

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center
There's so many of 'em!

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Then all these
people weren't sent off?

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:28.103 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
It's like a graveyard of people

00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:29.354 position:50% align:center
who were shot down before

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
they could make it to
the core of the Pillar.

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:35.777 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] And not just from Japan.
There's planes from all over.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.322 position:50% align:center
Bizarreness aside,
this makes me sick.

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
We'll have to
send them off later.

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:44.119 position:50% align:center
First, we finish the fight.

00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:46.413 position:50% align:center
Yes, I know.
