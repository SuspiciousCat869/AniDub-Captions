00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:16.558 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] This is the
truth Odin hid from us.

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:21.104 position:50% align:center
For ease, we've decided to
call it "Norse mythology."

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.107 position:50% align:center
[SUMMIT LEADER 1A] So, the end
of the world foreseen by god,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.609 position:50% align:center
has in fact, already happened?

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.069 position:50% align:center
Even if it is true,

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:30.405 position:50% align:center
it doesn't change the fact
that Odin is still our ally.

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:32.991 position:50% align:center
At this point, we have to
face the strong possibility

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:36.411 position:50% align:center
that he's been lying to us all.
We'd be fools not to.

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
Are we really going to get
into that discussion again?

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.666 position:50% align:center
[SUMMIT LEADER 1A] Our enemy
has always been a mystery to us

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.337 position:50% align:center
as has our god-granted
means to fight back.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.591 position:50% align:center
We've had nations secretly
investigating Odin's identity.

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:50.550 position:50% align:center
What do we know?

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.594 position:50% align:center
[SUMMIT LEADERS murmur]

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:54.512 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO grunts]
The heck--?

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] "The heck" is
quite the greeting, humans.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:59.893 position:50% align:center
I know that voice.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:01.853 position:50% align:center
It's God.

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:03.688 position:50% align:center
[SUMMIT LEADERS gasp]

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.357 position:50% align:center
This is our second meeting.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.275 position:50% align:center
Rather, a second coming.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.320 position:50% align:center
[SUMMIT LEADER 1A]
God Odin! Explain yourself!

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.323 position:50% align:center
Before, I bestowed upon
you the power to fight.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:17.660 position:50% align:center
So now, I bestow upon
you a motive to fight.

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.165 position:50% align:center
Isn't that the
Pillar on Mt. Fuji?

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:26.378 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO grunts]
Go figure.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.838 position:50% align:center
Odin really is sided
with the Pillars?

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.298 position:50% align:center
In recent days,

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:33.343 position:50% align:center
you've been shown the great
power of my friend, Thor.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.553 position:50% align:center
Many perished that day.

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:38.765 position:50% align:center
But not nearly enough!

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:40.934 position:50% align:center
I gave you the power to fight.

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.353 position:50% align:center
I gave you a motive to fight.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:46.856 position:50% align:center
And yes, I gave you
enemies to fight.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.025 position:50% align:center
[SUMMIT LEADERS]
Odin!

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.277 position:50% align:center
Now, resist your destruction!

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.821 position:50% align:center
I'll say it again.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.990 position:50% align:center
The great battle is near...

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:59.619 position:50% align:center
...for the coming of
Ragnarok is nigh.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.713 position:50% align:center
Ah, man, this feels so good.

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
Probably 'cause you've
been working hard.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:40.261 position:50% align:center
Uh, hmm... I don't know
if I would say that.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:43.431 position:50% align:center
I think Azu, Claudy and all the
others have been, though.

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Yeah, you're right.
They've been so busy ever since

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
we learned about the mural and
gods.

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] I don't want 'em to
wear themselves out,

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
but you know how Azu is.
It's bound to happen.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center
If she digs herself too deep,

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Clo will
step in and stop her.

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Well, yeah,
I know that, but still...

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.201 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
I get it.

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
You'd rather be at her
side while you worry, right?

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:09.457 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO grunts] Y'know,
you seem stronger now, Sono.

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center
Well, I am the youngest
Named candidate!

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:13.253 position:50% align:center
--[MIYAKO] Hah!
--[SONOKA yelps]

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:14.671 position:50% align:center
Hey, Miko!

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Sorry,
I couldn't help it!

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.301 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA gasps, chuckles]

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Now that we're back in Tateyama,

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
things feel almost normal,

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:29.019 position:50% align:center
and I've settled into
the same old routine again.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
But I feel like I should be
doing something more to help.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] The civilians have
returned to the city, too, yeah?

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Uh-huh. Everyone
loves their hometown.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Still, it seems so quiet.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.825 position:50% align:center
It's not like Tateyama at all.

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:45.243 position:50% align:center
Any other year,

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
we'd be preparing for the
festival right about now.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.039 position:50% align:center
Which festival?

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center
The annual summer one.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.959 position:50% align:center
But it's probably not--

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
That's perfect!

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
What is?

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.548 position:50% align:center
Let's have the summer festival!

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.384 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] After Odin's
apparent declaration of war,

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center
luckily, nations have been
willing to work together

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
to analyze the data
our scouts retrieved

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.557 position:50% align:center
from their trip to Valhalla.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
[NONO]
We've been able to identify

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:11.144 position:50% align:center
the Fuji Pillar
giant named Thor,

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
as well as various other gods.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI] Tyr, Freyja,
Heimdallr, Loki, too.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:18.693 position:50% align:center
Plus many more.

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
And? What do the
experts have to say?

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
That the Pillars
are sided with Odin,

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50% align:center
and somehow, Norse mythology
was lost at one point.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:31.456 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] And Ragnarok
is already over, huh?

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Mm? I told you I was right.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
Not that I have any reason
to be happy about it.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.421 position:50% align:center
Fair enough.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
How are other nations reacting?

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.343 position:50% align:center
The response has
been largely united.

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:46.304 position:50% align:center
After all, he declared
war at a summit meeting.

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:48.556 position:50% align:center
It was a slap in the
face to everyone there--

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
humanity as a whole.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
How ready are we?

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
[NONO]
Hyakuri, Hamamatsu, and Komaki

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
are racing to get
back on their feet.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
They say they'll be good
to go in two weeks' time.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
By "good to go," they mean...

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Ready to reattack
Fuji Primary Pillar.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
Don't forget the last battle

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.867 position:50% align:center
made a dent in the
enemy's forces, too.

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:10.036 position:50% align:center
They haven't fully
recovered yet either.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
Which means, fighting
is a gamble for both sides.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] And that's
putting it nicely. [groans]

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
Are you okay, Azuzu?

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center
Why? What are we supposed to do,
give up in the late game?!

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:22.048 position:50% align:center
The only reason
the world's moving

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50% align:center
is because of our discovery.

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.261 position:50% align:center
It's not like I have
time to sit around.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.681 position:50% align:center
Since Odin reappeared
even more Pillars have shown up.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:32.642 position:50% align:center
Sporadically,
but still, they're here.

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.686 position:50% align:center
And yet, the power
of the Valkyries

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50% align:center
hasn't been taken away from us.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
Huh. That's strange.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
Odin's the reason
we have enemies,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.610 position:50% align:center
yet he leaves
behind his protection?

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center
Doubt I'll ever understand
the mind of a god.

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] But without Odin, there
won't be any new Valkyries.

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.286 position:50% align:center
That's a good point.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.330 position:50% align:center
We receive Odin's blessing
and are bestowed wings.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:58.209 position:50% align:center
In other words if the wings
we have now are lost, then...

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:00.795 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Humanity is done for.

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
[clacking]

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.468 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Mm?

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.928 position:50% align:center
I'll keep at it then.
I'll double check the data

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
from our last battle...
because that's my job.

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center
--[KOMACHI grunts]
--[MISATO gasps]

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:19.314 position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:21.316 position:50% align:center
Though my job is getting
support from the big wigs,

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center
which I can't do from the
comfort of this room.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.029 position:50% align:center
Claudia, would you
mind joining me?

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.573 position:50% align:center
Your presence can
be very persuasive.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:29.908 position:50% align:center
Roger.

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center
But what about Azuzu?

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:32.911 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Don't worry about me.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna keep working on
our strategy until the

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
very last minute to increase
our odds, however I can.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
Okay, but don't push yourself.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Don't give me that.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.631 position:50% align:center
You're the one who said the
world's depending on me.

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
And you were right.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:55.350 position:50% align:center
Be well and give it your best.

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:58.228 position:50% align:center
When do I not give it my best?

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] You got let out of
here awfully quick, didn't you?

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:19.332 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET] Of course, I did.
It's not like I'm sick.

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:22.585 position:50% align:center
Other than here, my
body's totally fine.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
Can you fly?

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:26.172 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET]
At this point, who knows?

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:27.590 position:50% align:center
It doesn't feel
all that different

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center
down here on the ground,
but guess we'll see.

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:38.935 position:50% align:center
Come to tell me
I should retire?

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.771 position:50% align:center
That's a choice, but you'd
have to make it yourself.

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
It's funny. Lily always
put others first, too.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:48.361 position:50% align:center
I told her it's fine to be
a little selfish sometimes,

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
but that's just who she was.

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
And Ortlinde, or Sakura,
always made sure everyone

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.995 position:50% align:center
came back from a battle
no matter what.

00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
She'd land last 'cause that's
the kind of person she was.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.168 position:50% align:center
I'm not retiring.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
At first, I was
reluctant to fly again,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
but now I yearn for the sky.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
Sitting around and praying
while you guys are in the air

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:14.763 position:50% align:center
just isn't the
kind of person I am.

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
Are you mad?

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:20.352 position:50% align:center
Not at all. It's reassuring
to still have you.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:22.020 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET chuckles]

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
See you in the sky.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
Till then, may
the wings guide you.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:28.860 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center
May they guide you and
your comrades as well.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
I should head home. It's time...

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.382 position:50% align:center
I guess Tateyama's
home now, huh?

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.929 position:50% align:center
Azu! Time to wake up!

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:01.851 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Sheesh! You even
made a mess on your bed!

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
You're really working hard

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.938 position:50% align:center
to give everyone
a fighting chance, huh?

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Yeah, of course I am.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.359 position:50% align:center
And what have you been
doing everyday lately?

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
I feel like I barely see you!

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Sorry, sorry.

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.364 position:50% align:center
I've been busy,
so I couldn't stop by,

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
but I'm here now--don't pout!

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
I'm not pouting!

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:19.452 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.287 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO giggles]
I'm glad you asked!

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:22.205 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO giggles]

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
It just came in today!

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
Yup! Just like I thought--
it's perfect on you!

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center
Anyone ever tell you
that you look good in black?

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
I look good in
everything, so...

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:33.925 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but black especially!

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
Isn't that a yukata?
What's it for?

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.179 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Just the usual!

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:40.348 position:50% align:center
They're a must-have
for summer festivals!

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
I've got my own
ready to go, too!

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Hold on, you've
lost me. What summer festival?

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
Tateyama's! You know the one.

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
It's usually tomorrow
and it almost got canceled,

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
so I've been busy.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to prep everything.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
It's been super hectic!

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:55.655 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
What?

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:57.032 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Mm?

00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, your button.

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
A festival during this crisis?

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
Really? How the hell did
that strike you as a good idea?

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center
This is no time for that! I
doubt anyone wants one, but you!

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
Everyone's been
helping me out, though.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:17.052 position:50% align:center
Sono, people from the city,
and the base crew.

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
They all told me they'd
like to make it happen, so...

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Unbelievable.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Azu, I know this
has all been hard on you.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
I get it. So let's
have some fun.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:30.523 position:50% align:center
You think you know how I feel?

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.402 position:50% align:center
You have no idea!

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:35.737 position:50% align:center
Azu!

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
Such idiots!
Everyone here's stupid!

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:40.909 position:50% align:center
--[MISATO] Si...

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:41.618 position:50% align:center
--[NONO] ...gu...
--[MISATO] Si...

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
...ruri!

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Sigu...

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
...ruri!

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
Huh? You're looking for Azu?

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:51.252 position:50% align:center
I think I saw her hustling
towards the cafeteria.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:54.172 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I told her it wasn't
safe to run in sandals, but--

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
She zoomed right past us anyway!

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
Azu? Oh! You mean Komagome?

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.971 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. We saw her
flying out the back door.

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center
She slammed her knee
pretty hard, though.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
The brat right ran by
with tears in her eyes

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:07.811 position:50% align:center
and completely ignored me!

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.979 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to set
her straight next time.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
After that I think
she went running

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
around the building
or something.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
Careful with that!

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.860 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Azu?

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:17.737 position:50% align:center
Uhh, I haven't seen her.

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
But if I do, I'll let you know.

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.616 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Awesome, that'd be great!

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm gonna go check
over this way! See ya!

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:27.038 position:50% align:center
All right, she left.

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU grumbles]
Dammit.

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
I don't know why everyone else

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
feels like they
gotta tattle on me!

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center
Maybe 'cause of
how you treat them?

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
I did nothing wrong!

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center
You hear about this
whole festival thing?

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.926 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Yeah, I'm preparing for it.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.222 position:50% align:center
Festivals need flowers,
especially tomorrow's.

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:47.308 position:50% align:center
It's understandable
you're upset about it.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
We're in a crisis, after all.

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU grunts]

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.063 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
But it's not like anyone's being

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:54.065 position:50% align:center
forced to help out.

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they're all hoping
to get something out of it.

00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center
What do you mean,
"get something out of it"?

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
Like making good
memories or nostalgia.

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:09.205 position:50% align:center
You know what? All I really
remember is Yayoi's smile.

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.166 position:50% align:center
Weird, huh?

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:13.043 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Not that weird.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:15.628 position:50% align:center
Amatsuka's someone
who smiled a lot.

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:17.797 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Yeah. You're right.

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:21.801 position:50% align:center
I hope when people
remember me, I'm smiling, too.

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:24.179 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Don't be in
a rush to become a memory.

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm not.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
But I wanna be in
lots of memories.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.768 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna let some mean god

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:33.313 position:50% align:center
make me sad and ruin
all the photos of me.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:35.440 position:50% align:center
You know, you seem stronger.

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA giggles]
Miko said that, too.

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Maybe you guys are... but me?

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:46.284 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Thanks for
letting me hide here. Later.

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Azu.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:51.039 position:50% align:center
When I make memories
and look back on them,

00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:53.667 position:50% align:center
I'd like to do it with everyone.

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:00.507 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Miyako!

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:02.801 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Oh, Claudy!

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:04.469 position:50% align:center
You're back early, hey!

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:06.721 position:50% align:center
I missed you guys.
It's lonely without you.

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center
Oh, and the civilians
told me what's going on.

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:13.061 position:50% align:center
Speaking of, is that
yukata for the festival?

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:15.980 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] You don't think it's
a stupid idea, too, do you?

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:18.817 position:50% align:center
You're doing it for a reason,
right? It'll be great.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.694 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO chuckles]

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Azu got mad
at me about it before.

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Oh, yeah?

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
And you're trying to
patch things up, I take it?

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but first I gotta
figure out which way she went!

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
So, you met all the big
wigs, huh? How'd it go?

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Good. Everyone
seems pretty hopeful.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
And more importantly, they
promised their full support.

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
We can't lose.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.548 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
We won't lose.

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:43.341 position:50% align:center
Not with Azu planning it.

00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:45.802 position:50% align:center
You really trust her
implicitly, don't you?

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.929 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] She hasn't steered us
wrong yet!

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:49.806 position:50% align:center
She always makes the
smart-person choice,

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
which is perfect!

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'll make
the dumb-person choice,

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.269 position:50% align:center
which is usually a gamble.

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:55.937 position:50% align:center
So, with the two of
us working together,

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
we can never be wrong!

00:14:57.772 --> 00:15:00.734 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA laughs]
Oh, man!

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:03.194 position:50% align:center
Is that how that works? Okay.

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:04.279 position:50% align:center
Yes, it is!

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:05.572 position:50% align:center
Seriously.

00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
I bet Azuzu would have
loved to hear that one.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.159 position:50% align:center
Shame she's not here.

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
I know, right? Where in
the world could that girl be?

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.496 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Claudy. I'm gonna
go talk to Azu now, okay?

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.254 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Be careful.

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
I heard a rumor that
sometimes she trips

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.424 position:50% align:center
when there's nothing there.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO giggles]

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:28.094 position:50% align:center
By the way, I got
a yukata for you, too!

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
I picked one that compliments
your pretty, blonde hair!

Back when we were recruits,

staring out at the sea

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
All day, I think,

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:53.495 position:50% align:center
just how many
lives did we change?

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:57.123 position:50% align:center
How many lives did we uproot
with the info we brought back?

00:15:57.207 --> 00:16:00.335 position:50% align:center
And I'm a genius.
I'm smart and cute,

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
so I know...

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
...if our next attack doesn't
succeed, humanity is done.

We lose. The end.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.178 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking
about how to avoid that.

Oh, Azu. You are such a crybaby.

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center
Sorry I'm so weak.

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:29.364 position:50% align:center
Hey, I said you were a crybaby,
but I never said you were weak.

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:31.282 position:50% align:center
They're different things.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.580 position:50% align:center
I'm really scared.

I am, too, trust me. I get it.

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:42.627 position:50% align:center
I can't handle this
weight. It's heavy.

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
Then I'll just carry half.

Maybe.

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] But if you were
gonna die, I'd be dead, too.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.558 position:50% align:center
So I'll wake you in
heaven for breakfast.

[AZUZU] No thanks.
Your voice is too loud.

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
But if you wake me nicely,
I'll think about it.

About the festival...

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
Oh! I should tell you
we're meeting at the sea!

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:18.163 position:50% align:center

You two managed to put yours on!

Turns out Clo knows a lot
about yukatas! I was impressed!

You can thank my
Japan-loving father for that.

[SONOKA] Oh, it's nothing!
Your yukata's just cute.

Is hers special or
something, Miyako?

00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:58.620 position:50% align:center

Yup! Azu's is super special!

our way to the beach?

You and Sono probably should.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
Azu and I have other
plans at the moment.

Hold onto these!

too cramped in there!

Traditionally,

to console the living.

time, it's very Tateyama, too.

we couldn't send off,
