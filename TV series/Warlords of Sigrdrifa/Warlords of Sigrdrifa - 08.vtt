[ALL gasp]

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:36.161 position:50% align:center
[SHADES]
We've really got a secret base!

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE]
It's every man's dream!

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY]
This kicks ass, commander!

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.498 position:50% align:center
[SHADES]
I'm so pumped up!

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
Check this place out!

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.920 position:50% align:center
Salute our Commander Satomi!

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
[CREW]
With this, we can fight again!

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Okay! This is it!

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:53.970 position:50% align:center
Let's shock 'em--

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
the other girls
and even Big Sis.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.642 position:50% align:center
Let's win so hard
we blow 'em away!

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:03.229 position:50% align:center
[CREW]
Yeah!

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.158 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
Not long after our full retreat,

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:41.119 position:50% align:center
Fuji Primary Pillar
seems to have gone quiet.

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:43.997 position:50% align:center
Thus, our Level 2
Alert was canceled.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50% align:center
We're lucky it's
inactive for now.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:52.547 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but this is hardly
the time to be celebrating.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.134 position:50% align:center
We woke up a sleeping
lion in there, huh?

00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:00.180 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] You mean a sleeping
giant and the dead.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:03.183 position:50% align:center
It really hurts that
we lost the base.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Hey, Boss. Have you
been able to fix up our planes?

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.271 position:50% align:center
They're obviously
our top priority,

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:11.232 position:50% align:center
but there just ain't
enough parts at our disposal.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
And even if we fix yours,

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
there's nothing
we can do for the guys.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.572 position:50% align:center
It's not like we can let you
fly without your shield.

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.116 position:50% align:center
We're down a lot of people.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
We lost Major General Okita

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.412 position:50% align:center
and a whole slew of
officers out there.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center
Not to mention Valkyries.

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.918 position:50% align:center
Claudia, how's Rossweisse?

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.587 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
She's still in the ICU.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:36.466 position:50% align:center
She lost consciousness early on
and hasn't woken up since.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
Her life's not in danger
though, so there's that.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50% align:center
Glad to hear it.
That's what matters most.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
Now, let's discuss
our next plan.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Next plan?

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.145 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Yes.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
Our next goal is...
retaking Tateyama Air Base.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:57.320 position:50% align:center
That's absurd! Were you
listening to anyone here?!

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
Our Hero Wings need work
and we have no support squad!

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
We're in a tent!

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.910 position:50% align:center
We're a broken and injured army!

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center
Sure, without any parts
we don't stand a chance.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
But what if I told you
we've still got a shot?

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.590 position:50% align:center
Is that... Mt. Nokogiri?

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.134 position:50% align:center
What's there?

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
Loads of emergency supplies.

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
I had it stocked with
provisions a while back

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
just in case Tateyama
ever became inoperable.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
Hear that, Boss? Time to use it.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
I never thought your paranoia
would actually come in handy,

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
but credit where credit's due.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] All I'm hearing
is that it's a secret base!

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
This idiot. We're just
lucky that the mountain

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50% align:center
is outside of the
Pillar's influence.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
But if we're gonna do this,
we have to do it fast.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
Based on the
area's influence decay

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
and early warning predictions.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
Southwest Bousou Peninsula
will be safe for 36 hours.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.626 position:50% align:center
For the time being,

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.337 position:50% align:center
there're no Pillars
higher than Tertiary class

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
in the Tateyama region.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:58.256 position:50% align:center
However...

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
That'll all change
36 hours from now.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center
So we're on a time limit,
and we can't retake the base

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
without the help of a Valkyrie.

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
Right now, you're the
only ones in any shape

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.479 position:50% align:center
to even attempt
something like this.

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
'Kay. Let's do it.

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What?
Use your head, you idiot!

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center
Don't you understand
the situation we're in?!

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
I don't really get the
more complicated stuff,

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50% align:center
but I do know what's important.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
Isn't that enough?

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] There's something
we have to take back,

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50% align:center
and a chance that
we can make that happen.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.376 position:50% align:center
So if the last thing needed
for this to work is us...

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
...then of course
I want to fight!

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.258 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU grunts]

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:47.138 position:50% align:center
That settles it.
What's the plan, commander?

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:48.973 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
First, we get to Mt. Nokogiri

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
and get the Hero Wings
into working shape.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
After that, we use 'em
to retake the base.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
The operation will
begin in six hours.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.817 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO, CLAUDIA]
Roger that!

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
Roger that.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:06.241 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Commander? What about Sono?

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
Watarai...

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:12.706 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] ...won't be
participating this time.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
What'd you bring me here for?

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
If we're doing this
insane plan of yours,

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.590 position:50% align:center
I've gotta prepare for it first.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:26.052 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
I want you to listen to this.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
What is it, a recording?

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.265 position:50% align:center
[OKITA] All right, let's not
beat around the bush here.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
Tell me now. What is
this "Thor" thing?

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] I can't answer
that--not just yet.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
Someday in Valhalla.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.485 position:50% align:center
[OKITA]
"Valhalla"?

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
What do you mean? What is that?

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:49.242 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] Attachment--to that
land of Northern Europe.

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50% align:center
Distant now, the
attachment to Asgard.

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:55.707 position:50% align:center
[OKITA] Northern Europe?
Asgard? What is--?

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.879 position:50% align:center
What you heard was a recording

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
that was taken in secret
by Major General Okita

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:06.009 position:50% align:center
right before his death.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.803 position:50% align:center
"Thor" and "Valhalla,"
and then...

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:10.430 position:50% align:center
Asgard, too.

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center
How like him to use cryptic
words nobody's ever heard of.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.810 position:50% align:center
This stuff's why I hate gods.

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
I asked the European bases
if they recognized any,

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.024 position:50% align:center
but apparently no one does.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
Why's a god talking
about Northern Europe

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
when it doesn't even
have any mythology?

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
What do you make of this?

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.784 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
I want to say it's all nonsense,

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.703 position:50% align:center
but it's a message
from a real god, so

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:36.790 position:50% align:center
I guarantee it's
something important.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
Argh, dammit!

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
I thought he was
hiding something,

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.711 position:50% align:center
and now I know he was,
just not what!

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
I was hoping there'd be some
clues in that head of yours.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
That just leaves...

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:47.634 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Odin's favorite,

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
the only one who's
from Northern Europe.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
[NURSE 8A]
She's remarkably resilient.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
The doctor said your first aid
was administered quite well.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Do we have any
idea when she'll wake up?

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center
[NURSE 8A] Well, that all
depends on the patient.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.609 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.695 position:50% align:center
Don't be. That's promising.

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.072 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET grunts]

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
[NURSE 8A screams]

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
You seem surprisingly energetic.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
Why surprisingly?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:22.127 position:50% align:center
What do you expect from a
superhuman adopted by a god?

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.128 position:50% align:center
How's Lily?

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.722 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:35.640 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:36.683 position:50% align:center
Shit.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.019 position:50% align:center
Lily picked a good time to bail.

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:43.565 position:50% align:center
She owed me for juice...
and never paid me back.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET]
Helmwige.

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:49.529 position:50% align:center
No.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:52.240 position:50% align:center
Yayoi Amatsuka left a message.

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:53.825 position:50% align:center
Wait, she did?

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.077 position:50% align:center
She said Odin's
hiding something.

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
And you hold the key to it.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
Any idea what she meant by that?

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
I hold the key?

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
Either way, I agree with her.
He treated you differently.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center
You were more special
than the rest of us.

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50% align:center
And it wasn't
because you're S-Class.

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
I know Odin got hit
by that huge attack,

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.680 position:50% align:center
but we still have
his protection.

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
I mean, I don't think I'd
be alive now if we didn't.

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:24.397 position:50% align:center
So you think that's related to
whatever he's hiding from us?

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:26.441 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET]
Try to remember, Claudia.

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50% align:center
What is it that Odin
entrusted you with?

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
That could be the key,

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
then we could turn this around.

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] What would
something like that even be?

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:39.371 position:50% align:center
I'm wiped. Think I'll sleep.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET]
Claudia!

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
[LIZBET] Remember, you've
got no debt to skip out on.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
So don't go disappearing on me.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50% align:center
[sobbing]

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:16.658 position:50% align:center
What's something Odin
entrusted me with?

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Claudy, you're
back! Did you visit her?

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she's finally woken up.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.164 position:50% align:center
They said our first aid
helped out a lot, too.

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:25.166 position:50% align:center
"Finally"? That was quick!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
I swear, you S-Class
people are nuts,

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.212 position:50% align:center
even for Valkyries!

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm glad
we have good news.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:32.590 position:50% align:center
Hopefully with
a little bit of luck,

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
we can add some
more to that pile.

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.052 position:50% align:center
How's that?

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.221 position:50% align:center
I've got a question for you.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
Thor, Valhalla, Asgard.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
Any of those ring a bell?

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.858 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Thor.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.777 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Valhalla.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
Asgard.

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
Go with Asgard's blessing.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
As always, take care
of yourself, Claudia.

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.494 position:50% align:center
Oh, and remember
this one thing...

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA gasping]

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Whoa, Claudy!

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:05.915 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
For you, my daughter...

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.087 position:50% align:center
...Valhalla's gate
is always open.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
What?! What's happening?!

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.386 position:50% align:center
It's...

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.394 position:50% align:center
...the entrance to Valhalla.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:31.316 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] Uhh... So, uh,
about the tunnel of light

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
that appeared in one
of the base's hallways.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
So far we've sealed it off

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
and issued a gag order
to those who saw it.

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
That way we prevent mass panic.

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:42.577 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Odin wanted me
to find it for a reason.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.205 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it has
some sort of hint.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:48.708 position:50% align:center
I mean a hint for
humanity's victory, that is.

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:51.336 position:50% align:center
I do have my doubts,
but I agree.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
Odin seemed to be
hiding something.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
We can't let this
chance slip away.

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Question!

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:58.593 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Yes, Muguruma?

00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] So how long does this
tunnel of light stay open for?

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
Do we have any idea?

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:03.556 position:50% align:center
Well, it was opened by accident,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.060 position:50% align:center
so it could
disappear any second.

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
So we either retake Tateyama
or explore the tunnel.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center
First of all, at the very least,

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
we'd need Claudy to
pass through the gate.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'm the best
choice to accompany her

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:19.948 position:50% align:center
to identify whatever's
on the other side.

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
We would need
a small escort, too.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Mm-hm. And that's it?

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.621 position:50% align:center
Okay, that's not a problem!

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:28.123 position:50% align:center
I think we can make that work!

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU groans]

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Miyako.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center
You're not saying you'll
secure the base yourself?

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
Statistically, it is possible.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
You think you can
do it, Muguruma?

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
I can do it, commander.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.053 position:50% align:center
I'll fight enough for everyone.

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:45.515 position:50% align:center
For Azu, Claudy,
Sono, and Big Sis.

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:51.980 position:50% align:center
You'll be doing this alone,
without any backup.

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Mm-mm. I won't be alone!

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.026 position:50% align:center
[SHIELD SQUADRON]
Bam!

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
[SHADES]
Commander, we've got this!

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.738 position:50% align:center
If all we gotta
do is protect Miko

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.531 position:50% align:center
like a thousand times
better than usual,

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.033 position:50% align:center
then we're all over it!

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:05.243 position:50% align:center
The three of us are so revved
up and ready to kick butt,

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:06.953 position:50% align:center
you may as well
not even send her!

00:13:07.037 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
Hey, stop it! Don't you
dare leave me behind!

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughing]

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
I hear you guys loud and clear.

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
Taking Tateyama and
exploring Valhalla.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
Both are very important
for what lies ahead.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center
All right, soldiers!

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:31.519 position:50% align:center
It's time to strike back.

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Roger that!

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.441 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Sigururi.

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:41.029 position:50% align:center
--[KURUMI] Sigu-
--[MOE] -ruri!

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:47.327 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Cool! Is that your dad's katana?

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.661 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
I'm not as good as you,
but I know how to use it.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
Let's just hope we
don't find a reason to.

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.878 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor and
look after Azu, okay?

00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:00.256 position:50% align:center
Sometimes she trips when there's
nothing there, the poor girl.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Sure, got it.
I'll hold her hand.

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:03.843 position:50% align:center
No, you will not!

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:06.096 position:50% align:center
You should worry about--

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.016 position:50% align:center
Let me guess, you were
gonna say Sonoka?

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
Take care of her!

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
I'm on it!

00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Is everyone ready to go?

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
We should probably
get this started.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Hope you're
ready to go exploring

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
for a god's hidden secrets,
you band of nut jobs.

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.495 position:50% align:center
Yeah, whatever.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
We're more interested
in being around you.

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.416 position:50% align:center
This god stuff is
just a good excuse.

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:37.711 position:50% align:center
He's right. It's more
like a fun little bonus.

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:41.006 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
I'm surrounded by idiots.

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.924 position:50% align:center
When we return, I promise
we'll have the key

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
to turn the tide in our favor.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.970 position:50% align:center
So,

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:48.972 position:50% align:center
we'll see you in Tateyama.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.516 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS]
See ya in Tateyama!

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.157 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO gasps]
Sono!

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:11.536 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Aww, man! Bad timing.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:14.998 position:50% align:center
Azu and Claudy already left.
You just missed 'em!

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:19.377 position:50% align:center
That's all right.
It's better this way.

00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:22.380 position:50% align:center
Because when I see
people off, it's bad luck...

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:23.882 position:50% align:center
...always.

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:26.968 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Sono.

00:15:27.052 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA grunts]
That hurts, Miko.

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.223 position:50% align:center
Listen, you can't
think like that.

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:34.351 position:50% align:center
Big Sis fought with
everything she had!

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
Luck had nothing to do with it.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:40.357 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.277 position:50% align:center
Why did she go out there
when she knew the dangers?

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center
Every time we go into the sky,
we might not come back.

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
So why?

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:53.620 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine even
holding the stick.

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:56.373 position:50% align:center
It's scary now.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:59.751 position:50% align:center
How did I ever
manage to fly before?

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.922 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Sono...

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] I don't know her
reasons for flying either.

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:09.886 position:50% align:center
I couldn't tell you.

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.222 position:50% align:center
But having watched her up there,

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
I do know one thing.

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:18.395 position:50% align:center
The way you two fly
is exactly the same.

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
So... I think if you
find out one answer,

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.984 position:50% align:center
the other will naturally
find its way to you, too.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.405 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Now, I've gotta
keep up with the others

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:29.864 position:50% align:center
and get to work, okay?

00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
You help evacuate.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
But, Miko, I'm not...

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.789 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
We Valkyries can help a lot.

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
Whether we're in the air,
or anywhere else.

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Whether we're in
the air, or anywhere else.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
What is this thing made of?

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
It's not any stone
or metal that I know.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
The architecture's foreign, too.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:06.651 position:50% align:center
We might wanna
take a sample back.

00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:10.196 position:50% align:center
I get you, but for all we know,
this place might be sacred.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.532 position:50% align:center
Let's stick to video for now.

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:13.533 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Dammit!

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
These guys have no idea
