[CLAUDIA'S FATHER]
Claudia.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:43.918 position:50% align:center
At least once in your life
you should try and visit Japan.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.920 position:50% align:center
Japan? But why there?

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.965 position:50% align:center
Because it's the
samurai country.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
I wasn't there very long,

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:54.179 position:50% align:center
but I learned many important
things in the time I was.

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Samurai?

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:58.975 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA'S FATHER] Unbreakable
and unyielding men of pride.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.811 position:50% align:center
For them, bravery is
practically a way of life.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.481 position:50% align:center
And the women who
support those brave men

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.733 position:50% align:center
are kind and graceful.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:10.528 position:50% align:center
Always striving to
be ideal women.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.824 position:50% align:center
My goal is to raise you
as strong as those samurai,

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.326 position:50% align:center
and at the same time,

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.745 position:50% align:center
as graceful and dedicated
as the women who support them.

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:20.163 position:50% align:center
Although, I can't help but wish

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.207 position:50% align:center
you'd grow up in a world
without the constant threat

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.000 position:50% align:center
of Pillars looming overhead.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:26.711 position:50% align:center
Um, are you all right?

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.630 position:50% align:center
I'm fine, but that's
enough of that.

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:31.007 position:50% align:center
Why don't I tell
you some stories...

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.552 position:50% align:center
...about the days I soared
through the skies of Japan?

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.972 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
To think, ever since my father

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:41.184 position:50% align:center
spoke so highly of this country,
I've yearned to visit it.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.435 position:50% align:center
Unbreakable...

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.814 position:50% align:center

Kind and graceful...

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:49.984 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to doubt

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:52.112 position:50% align:center
the legitimacy of
my father's stories,

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:54.948 position:50% align:center
but what am I supposed to think
with how they act at this base?

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:58.118 position:50% align:center
There you are! Claudy spotted!

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:01.329 position:50% align:center
Let's all hang out!
What do you say?

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.671 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Man, I didn't think

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.090 position:50% align:center
you'd be in the
dojo of all places!

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50% align:center
Feels like I ran all over
the base looking for you!

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center
So what's the deal?

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.471 position:50% align:center
Are those <i>hakama</i>
and katana yours?

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.682 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They're old.

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
My father brought
them back for me

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
from when he was
stationed in Japan.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
I've had them for a while.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.437 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.649 position:50% align:center
That's crazy! Your dad
was in the military, too?

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
Yes, he was an
exceptional aviator.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
Now, I guess you could say

00:03:56.611 --> 00:04:00.657 position:50% align:center
I'm following in his
footsteps, in a way.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.575 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO giggles]

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.827 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.954 position:50% align:center
I'm actually kind
of happy to hear that!

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50% align:center
I mean, your dad must
have loved his time in Japan

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
if he brought you
souvenirs like that.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.127 position:50% align:center
And if so, that's super awesome!

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.878 position:50% align:center
It is?

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
You betcha!

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.007 position:50% align:center
'Cause knowing that,
I can't help but think

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.509 position:50% align:center
you and I are gonna
get along even better!

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.138 position:50% align:center
Let me guess.

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
You wanted to have
this get-together

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.057 position:50% align:center
for that exact reason?

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50% align:center
Didn't we already
party enough last night?

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but that was
totally different!

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50% align:center
This time, it's just gonna be us
girls in the Valkyrie Wing!

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
'Cause the four
of us are comrades

Ragnarok together!

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
Getting along is
funda-frickin'-mental!

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
I guess it couldn't hurt, right?

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.659 position:50% align:center
In fact, it can only help!

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
All righty! Let's all
meet up at the cafeteria

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50% align:center
in a few minutes, okay?

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50% align:center
I'll go and pester Azu
until she agrees.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50% align:center
You go and fetch Sono for me!

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
Just a heads up!

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
I think I saw Sono
over by the garden,

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:59.549 position:50% align:center

check there. Bye!

thought of it that way,

in the habit pretty quickly.

such a late riser, too.

Not exactly.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center

after that craziness?

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:54.771 position:50% align:center

Sounds like we're both

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50% align:center
in the same boat, then.

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.568 position:50% align:center
The Shield Squadron
trio were fun to watch.

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.779 position:50% align:center
They made for quite
the interesting band.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] I dunno, I think having
three vocalists is a bit much.

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.410 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] What'd you think
of the operator team's act?

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.954 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] It wasn't the best,
but it had its moments.

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50% align:center
Though I have high
hopes for next time.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50% align:center

base surprised you at all?

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
Well, I'd be lying to you
if I implied otherwise.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
Forgive my ignorance, but is
this what all of Japan is like?

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
worry about that.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.520 position:50% align:center
Rest assured,
this base is a special,

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center

really call that reassuring.

[MIYAKO]
Surprise!

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
I brought you some breakfast!

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:00.462 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's the problem?

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.631 position:50% align:center
Oh! Don't worry,

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
I made sure to take out all
the stuff you don't like.

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.345 position:50% align:center
But it's important to
eat a wide variety of food!

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
So I suggest you work on that.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:14.017 position:50% align:center
That's none of your business,
but, ugh, fine, whatever!

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
So we're here.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
Did you have something
particular in mind for us to do?

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
Since yesterday was
a big cluster of crazy,

today we can finally
all sit down and talk!

We're all Valkyrie sisters here!

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.072 position:50% align:center
So let's strengthen
our bonds as a team!

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
So we can get back out
there and "fire!" and stuff!

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:31.618 position:50% align:center

every single day?

Of course!

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:45.006 position:50% align:center
Gotta turn those
frowns upside down!

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it's introduction
time, so let's hop to it!

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
Yeah! That's our Miko!

The only reason it's
possible in the first place

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
is because I'm
the one who did it.

Still, even though I could
add some really cool features,

with their planes

it's her dream to work
on other Hero Wings.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
I think it's because she wants

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:52.157 position:50% align:center
to increase everyone's chances
of survival. Right, Azu?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:04.552 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's it!

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:06.721 position:50% align:center
Do we know if the
Aqua-Line has been flooded?

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:07.847 position:50% align:center
It hasn't been.

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.432 position:50% align:center
That's what I like to hear!

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.267 position:50% align:center
Way to keep us in
the game, newbie!

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.061 position:50% align:center
What's the deal?
Did you have an idea?

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
We can do this!
Man, I am such a genius!

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.276 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] Shield Squadron,
prepare to launch.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
Be safe out there!

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
[MAINTENANCE LEADER 1A]
Listen here, you stooges!

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:24.406 position:50% align:center
If you bite it out there,

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
do me a favor and
spare the planes, will ya?

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
Hey!

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
[SHADES] Got it! I don't
think I'll ever get used to

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
the way that old man
shows his concern.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
Let's keep the Valkyries
safe and sound.

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:37.210 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE]
Shield Squadron, takeoff!

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.427 position:50% align:center
[NONO] Nine-hundred
and ninth Valkyrie Wing,

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
ready for takeoff!

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Sigrdrifa 909, takeoff!

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center
[VALKYRIES]
Roger!

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.652 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Will this actually work?

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center
Absolutely! Just do what I said
and it can't possibly go wrong!

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:08.867 position:50% align:center
Pulling off what you said is
exactly what I'm worried about.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
Come on, Sono,
we're gonna be fine!

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.789 position:50% align:center
After all, Claudy signed
off on this plan, too!

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:16.458 position:50% align:center
We fly through the tunnel?!

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.959 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Yup!

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:20.045 position:50% align:center
The Tower of Wind is right
outside the Pillar's barrier,

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:23.715 position:50% align:center
and it also happens to be the
Aqua-Line's ventilation tunnel!

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
And since we've confirmed
the line isn't flooded,

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
it means the water
barrier can't possibly

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:29.220 position:50% align:center
have reached it underground.

00:15:29.304 --> 00:15:30.430 position:50% align:center
That's great and all,

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:31.890 position:50% align:center
but I've never flown
through a tunnel before!

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center
Okay, say we get through
the tunnel no problem.

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:36.186 position:50% align:center
Are we sure the exit
is safe to fly through?

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
Wait, as crazy as it sounds,
I think this plan might work.

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
If it's okay,

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
I'd like to request to
fly lead for this mission.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:46.363 position:50% align:center
I had a sneaking suspicion
you would ask for that.

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:48.156 position:50% align:center
I read you like a book.

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:51.576 position:50% align:center
All right. Request granted.
Schwertleite will lead.

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:54.245 position:50% align:center
Naturally, that means the
rest of you will back her up.

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:55.538 position:50% align:center
Now, all that's left

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:57.040 position:50% align:center
is for us to come up
with a name for the plan.

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:57.999 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Me!

00:15:58.083 --> 00:15:59.292 position:50% align:center
Yes, Muguruma?

00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
I vote "Sneaky Eel Plan!"

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] Get ready. You're
closing in on the target zone.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.384 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE] We'll keep the
enemy's attention on us,

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center
you do your thing.

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:10.887 position:50% align:center
[SHADES] Yeah, head
straight for the Aqua-Line!

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.389 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Don't get hurt!

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY]
Got it!

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:16.434 position:50% align:center
[NONO] The enemy's attack
range is ten kilometers.

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
Make sure to stay
further away than that!

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.313 position:50% align:center
[SHIELD SQUADRON]
Roger!

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:25.485 position:50% align:center
[SHADES]
Break!

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
[SHADES]
Nice! Just as planned!

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.201 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
There!

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:34.911 position:50% align:center
It's the entrance
to the Aqua-Line!

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Good! Now then,
"Sneaky Eel Plan," begin!

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.875 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] We can't keep going
with these ridiculous names--

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:43.044 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
In we go!

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.217 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Will this take
us to the Tower of Wind?

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
After all this,
let's hope it does.

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
Enemy Pillar dead ahead!

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
[VALKYRIES yelp]

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] They're smaller
stationary types?

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Leave it to me! Sondergerat!

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
Did we miss, or are
there just more?!

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Just hang in there!
Do that and we win!

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
I see it!

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.660 position:50% align:center
Let's go, guys!

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
Punch through!

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.001 position:50% align:center
Hell, yeah!
We're right up on it!

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Yes! The plan worked!

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Hurry! Before it attacks!

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Right!

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:30.300 position:50% align:center
First hit's mine!

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
Take this!

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:34.846 position:50% align:center
A wall of water?!

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Ah! And here
we finally got inside!

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
The barrier!

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
Control, you see this?

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Damn right, we see it.

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center
Send rescue to Umihotaru!

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
[MISATO, NONO, KOMACHI]
Roger!

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY]
Woo!

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
Looks like the girls were
able to make it inside!

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
Claudy, look at
the top! It's open!

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.825 position:50% align:center
All right, it's do or die time!

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Aye-aye, sir!

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] We're gonna try to get
a shot on the Pillar from above.

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
I need you two to keep it
busy down below, okay?

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU, SONOKA]
Roger!

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
All right! Time to blow this
thing into a million pieces!

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:10.548 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Wow, Azu, that sounded
like something Miko would say.

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
Please be kidding.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.052 position:50% align:center
That's the worst thing
anyone's ever said to me!

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:19.307 position:50% align:center
I see the Vandrande!

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:20.809 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Here goes!

00:18:20.892 --> 00:18:24.979 position:50% align:center
Hero Cannon, fire!

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:31.069 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Claudy! Miko!

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
We're all good!

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
No problems here!

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.033 position:50% align:center
Everything's hunky-dory!

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.451 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Don't scare us like that!

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA giggles]
You did it!

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:43.331 position:50% align:center
There's so much steam.

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA gasps]

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Miyako, evade!

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:54.592 position:50% align:center
Huh? [screams]

00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
That flame means one thing.

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
It's one of those boogy cones!

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] It's "buccal cone," but
this isn't the time for that!

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Let's try again!

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
What?! Why?!

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.614 position:50% align:center
Is the heat high enough
to melt it on contact?

00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:18.241 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Claudy, what now?

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
I don't think we
can win like this.

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
No, we can!

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center
Sono, did you pack it?

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, yeah! I sure did!

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
All right! Then this extreme
heat is no longer a problem.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
Unload everything you've got!

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:34.132 position:50% align:center
Bombs away!

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
Was that some kind of coolant?

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:43.183 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] A precautionary measure,
in case the place caught fire.

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:45.060 position:50% align:center
Good thing we brought it, huh?

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:46.102 position:50% align:center
Go, Miko!

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:49.147 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Roger! My last big boom!

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
Fire!

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
There it is!
It's all you, Claudy!

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Hm!

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:04.287 position:50% align:center
To pick up where we left off,
I'm Claudia Bruford!

00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:06.790 position:50% align:center
I'm a Valkyrie, Schwertleite.

00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
And I fly a Gladiator!

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:14.297 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to
working with all of you!

00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:47.539 position:50% align:center
Nice work, Claudy!

00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Whoa.

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:52.252 position:50% align:center
We pulled it off!
A complete win!

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:55.380 position:50% align:center
We sure did, thanks to
some solid teamwork.

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:57.298 position:50% align:center
That's right!
So how do you feel?

00:20:57.382 --> 00:21:00.260 position:50% align:center
After two big fights, you think
you're clicking with everyone?

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:02.178 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure I would at first.

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I thought I'd been
sent to a base full of nutcases.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
Although,
had I been working alone,

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:13.189 position:50% align:center
there would've been
no victory today.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
You're all different
experience levels,

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:18.403 position:50% align:center
and your planes are as quirky
as aerodynamics allow.

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:19.571 position:50% align:center
But still...

00:21:19.654 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
One way or another,
we're really strong!

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:25.535 position:50% align:center
So as long as we all want
and hope for the same thing,

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:26.828 position:50% align:center
there's no doubt in my mind

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
that we're all gonna
get along just fine!

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:33.376 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I think you're
right on the money, there.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.462 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:21:35.545 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
Hang on. If I didn't
