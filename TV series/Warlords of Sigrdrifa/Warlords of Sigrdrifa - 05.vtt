Always so spunky!

[MIYAKO] Well, of course,
spunk is my specialty!

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.178 position:50% align:center

By the way, Azuzu,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
I was wondering, how do you
know that Amatsuka Valkyrie?

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50% align:center
Now I'm wondering what
made you assume I do.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
She was acting
friendly with Miyako.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
And since you two
are joined at the hip,

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd have met her.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor and
stop considering me

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
and this idiot a package deal.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
But you're right, I know her.

At our last base,

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
I actually flew with
Amatsuka all the time.

it's amazing how she makes

from one base to another

to little, old Tateyama for?

Good question.

I'm sure you'll
hear it from Satomi,

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.458 position:50% align:center
but I might as well tell you.

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU, CLAUDIA, MIYAKO]
A counteroffensive?

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50% align:center

Yup.

To answer your question,
that's why we're here.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center

but what's the target?

That's insane!

What about what happened in
North America two years ago?

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
Wasn't that lesson enough?

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
Just how many Valkyries died?

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.570 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] But, there must
be a good reason for it.

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, why would
they risk carrying out

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50% align:center
such a dangerous mission?

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
I'm right, aren't I?

and a good one.

earned Odin's cooperation.

off his butt and help us out.

storm off in a fit, too?

like me much anyway,

something Miyako would say.

get some sort of perk

him or anything?

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.112 position:50% align:center
I'd use it to have
you answer her question.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
Such a selfless daughter.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
Very well, what's your question?

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
I told you. What's with
this counteroffensive?

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
And what did you trick
the brass into agreeing to?

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
How insulting for you to
suggest that I tricked them!

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.710 position:50% align:center
All I did was help them
come up with the plan.

00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.715 position:50% align:center
Now, let's play
a game while we talk.

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.260 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] It'll be a fun way for us
to bond as father and daughter.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
Screw tha--

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.014 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] If you won't,
I refuse to talk.

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.223 position:50% align:center
[GAME]
Hiyah!

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.350 position:50% align:center
So, will you play?
What can I say?

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:40.478 position:50% align:center
I'm a bit immature.

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
In the simplest terms possible,

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
the plan is to attack
the Fuji Primary Pillar

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.818 position:50% align:center
during its dormant period.

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
And by that, I assume you mean

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
that weird period of time
when Pillars are less active?

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:54.367 position:50% align:center
But I thought we couldn't tell
when it starts and ends.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.244 position:50% align:center
Yes, well, that's
the wonder of science.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:58.997 position:50% align:center
Through painstaking effort,
one can deduce anything.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.042 position:50% align:center
But a sprinkle of my
god powers didn't hurt.

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:04.252 position:50% align:center
Your Komagome Theory
came in handy, too.

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
You live up to
your title of genius.

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Shut up and continue!

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.050 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
With our talk or the game?

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Our talk!

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
Anyway, all of the blood, sweat,

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
and tears eventually paid off,

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
and now we know when the
next Pillar will go dormant.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.935 position:50% align:center
And we know that
it's Fuji Primary Pillar.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.605 position:50% align:center
Then that would explain
the counteroffensive.

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:26.608 position:50% align:center
And you're certain enough
to risk attacking it head-on?

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.444 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] I guarantee the
Pillar will be less active.

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
You have this god's word.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.449 position:50% align:center
However, no matter
how deep its sleep,

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
Pillars will wake
when facing an attack.

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.662 position:50% align:center
It will be a fierce fight.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
Therefore,

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center
Japan has understandably
been gathering forces

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.751 position:50% align:center
for the upcoming battle

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
and has invited the best of
the best from around the world.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.757 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
The best of the best? You mean--

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's right,
my beloved daughters.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.553 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU groans]

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:58.181 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] Sometimes being too
smart is the reason you lose.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
The more choices
you have to consider,

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50% align:center
the longer it takes to make one.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.437 position:50% align:center
That's why you're
shot down so much.

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
It'll kill you.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.108 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right! Some random
game says nothing about me!

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] Well, it may just be a
game, but it exposes your flaws.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
Truthfully, you make
a mediocre Valkyrie,

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
but your mind's a rare gem.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center
I think you'd be a lot happier

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
doing something
that let you use it.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
You don't think--

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
You don't think I know that?

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.253 position:50% align:center
Of course, I do.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:31.548 position:50% align:center
But... I can't.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
If you're this quick to cry,

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:36.636 position:50% align:center
you'll run out of
tears soon enough.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
Odin!

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
Whoops!

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't want two of
my daughters to hate me.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.559 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.519 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
I heard what I came for.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
I'll go along with the
counteroffensive, for now.

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
And I'll keep the advice
you gave me in mind, too.

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.318 position:50% align:center
[ODIN]
Good, that's smart.

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
Azuzu, you okay?

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's just
the wise, old words

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
of a scheming, soulless god.

00:10:58.241 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
Why should I care about it?

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:00.744 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
I need to ask something, too.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
I have to wonder.

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:07.709 position:50% align:center
Was my being moved here
related to the counteroffensive?

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.627 position:50% align:center
You're so clever.

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
Indeed, the power of a Named

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
is vital in defeating
a Primary Pillar.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
And with Ortlinde's
unfortunate death,

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:19.179 position:50% align:center
the country needed
a replacement weapon.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
So that's how it is, huh?

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
[ODIN] Now then,
go get your beauty sleep.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
It's about time you were on your
way, my beautiful daughters.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.316 position:50% align:center
Go with Asgard's blessing.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA gasps]
Did you say something?

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.862 position:50% align:center
Nothing, just wishing you well.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
As always, take care
of yourself, Claudia.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.700 position:50% align:center
Oh, and remember this one thing.

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
For you, my daughter,
Valhalla's gate is always open.

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Mr. Eyepatch
was certainly talkative today.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
You think? Feels like
he's always that way.

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Are you serious?

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:56.675 position:50% align:center
I've never heard him
blabber on like that before.

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:58.385 position:50% align:center
On a separate but related topic,

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
do you agree with what
he said about me in there?

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
No, I don't think being able to

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:04.349 position:50% align:center
imagine all of your options
is a bad thing at all.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:06.476 position:50% align:center
But to be fair,
you are shot down a lot.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.477 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Hey!

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
But you've got a team,

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:10.271 position:50% align:center
and we help make up for that.

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:11.564 position:50% align:center
Miyako would tell you the same.

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU groans]
Dammit!

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
And who was it that said
I sounded like her before?

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:19.155 position:50% align:center
Don't mimic an idiot
if you don't wanna be an idiot!

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.366 position:50% align:center
Thanks for standing
up for me, though.

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
See ya in the morning.

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
Oh, good grief. You're not
very true to your feelings.

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.395 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
Sigururi.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
Sigururi.

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.235 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] This plan is
the real deal, people.

00:12:57.318 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
However, it is a
counteroffensive based on intel

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:04.409 position:50% align:center
from what I would call, the
shadiest source on the planet.

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
In plain terms,

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
all of Japan is attacking Fuji
Primary Pillar as it sleeps.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.335 position:50% align:center
Sounds pretty simple, right?

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
I propose a toast!

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
Here's hoping for a successful
mission with Big Sis!

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center

like a fairly popular place.

You don't know what
you should get, do you?

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:41.321 position:50% align:center
In that case,
here's my recommendation.

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:42.822 position:50% align:center
The black cod!

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:43.948 position:50% align:center

be a fun surprise.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center
Sorry for the wait.

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50% align:center
Wow, it's huge!

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.066 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Like I said, you're my hero.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.652 position:50% align:center
Lemme help you pick out
the bones, it can be tricky.

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:04.154 position:50% align:center
Yoink! Yoink! Yoink!

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Wow, you're really good at that.

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
Hey, Miyako, how would
you like to be my wife?

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO giggles]
Twice in one day!

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:13.163 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
I could've retired, yet didn't.

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:16.708 position:50% align:center
Being told that flat out
really hits a sore spot.

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA grunts]

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
Now that I think about it,

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.755 position:50% align:center
Azu and I might be more
alike than I thought.

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.715 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
Sono, don't feel like you have
to say anything to defend me.

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:29.137 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
But...

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.390 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] But if it's for
your own sake, feel free.

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA grunts]

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.354 position:50% align:center
I'm curious what
your perspective

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.898 position:50% align:center
on the counteroffensive is.
What do you make of it?

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.233 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI] Well, the big wigs
are serious about it.

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.027 position:50% align:center
And with this many
of us in one place,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.904 position:50% align:center
we're more powerful than ever.

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
They're really hoping to
topple Fuji and liberate Japan.

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI] However, Odin being so
gung-ho about the whole thing

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:58.208 position:50% align:center
doesn't sit right with me.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
I take it you don't
trust Odin then,

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
not that I can really blame you.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
He's interesting,

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:05.090 position:50% align:center
and I'm thankful
for his help, but no.

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
I don't trust him.

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.468 position:50% align:center
Why? What about you?

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Considering he's a god,

00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:12.681 position:50% align:center
it's practically impossible
to tell what he's thinking.

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:14.349 position:50% align:center
But...

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
But?

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:16.935 position:50% align:center
As far as I can tell,

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
he's sincerely supporting
the plan for whatever reason.

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI] Really? Did he
actually tell you that?

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.567 position:50% align:center
I don't know why he
finally chose to cooperate,

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
but he wants to destroy
the Pillars as much as we do.

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.072 position:50% align:center
And since he helped
come up with this plan,

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
I want to believe in it.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.700 position:50% align:center
Okay, that's enough!

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
No talking about difficult
stuff while we eat!

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
It'll ruin the mood
and our food'll get cold!

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
You realize we haven't gotten
to the difficult stuff yet?!

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
Yeah, rub it in, why don'tcha?!
It's all difficult to me!

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
I'm not a super
smarty-pants like you!

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
Why are you getting
all mad at me now?!

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:46.172 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Oh, it doesn't matter!
I don't know much about Odie,

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:47.382 position:50% align:center
but his plan has us

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:48.925 position:50% align:center
striking during the
dormant period, right?

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.428 position:50% align:center
So! When the time comes and
it's our turn in the limelight,

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:54.222 position:50% align:center
learn from today, and make
sure to give it all you got!

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:55.473 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:57.017 position:50% align:center
Whatever dangers we're
up against out there,

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.436 position:50% align:center
face them with all your heart
and it'll open up new doors!

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
Like her!

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:06.693 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] She conquered
the black cod with heart!

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:08.570 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
You ate it all?!

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
It was so fatty, after the first
bite I couldn't help myself.

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
But there's only so much fat
you can eat in one sitting!

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
I gave up after my first taste!

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.580 position:50% align:center
Face your problems with
all your heart, huh?

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:20.749 position:50% align:center
Your youthfulness is inspiring.

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:22.542 position:50% align:center
I'm jealous.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
What do you mean?

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.503 position:50% align:center
Aren't you barely
older than we are?

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Valkyries like us

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.924 position:50% align:center
don't usually live
for very long.

00:17:30.008 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
I might as well be middle-aged.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
I'm going back to the base.

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] But you barely
touched your food.

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
You can have it.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Oh, thank you!

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
That's all you gotta say?!

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
Yikes, that didn't go well.

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] What does that mean?
Were you plotting something?

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Did it have anything to do with

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:48.068 position:50% align:center
how Sonoka was acting?

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Uhh...

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI] Miko was only trying to
smooth things over between us.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.409 position:50% align:center
Between Sonoka and I, I mean.

00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:58.995 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Is there something
going on with you two?

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:02.707 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI] Once upon a time,
we were in the same squadron.

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.502 position:50% align:center
It's a complicated relationship.

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:12.676 position:50% align:center
Why now, after all this time?

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.099 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
Tryin' to give
me a heart attack?

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center
That Watarai?

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:26.940 position:50% align:center
Come on...

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:29.150 position:50% align:center
This is my office, you know?

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:33.321 position:50% align:center
And I'm kinda the highest-
ranking person at the base.

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
Well, the door wasn't locked.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
It's your fault someone
could get in here.

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me
you sneaked in here

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
just to try and
teach me a lesson.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
I didn't forget to lock
the door--it was intentional.

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:44.916 position:50% align:center
I always leave it open...

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
...in case lost little girls
have nowhere else to go.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.880 position:50% align:center
I'm not some lost little girl.

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] Hey, I never said
I was talking about you, did I?

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA gasps]
Meanie.

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] Sorry I kept
quiet about Amatsuka.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
Orders came from above.
They never asked me anything.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.394 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] If you were
just following orders,

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
then I understand.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.231 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'm a soldier,
too. I get it.

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:12.277 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO sighs] Fourteen-years
old, and yet you're a soldier.

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:15.405 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Seeing you kids,

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:18.199 position:50% align:center
it breaks the hearts
of us sorry adults.

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:20.577 position:50% align:center
There's just not
enough of us left.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
Plus, we're on the way out.

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:27.000 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
I'm sorry.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
What, are you asking
for forgiveness?

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO grunts]

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:35.550 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Sorry to intrude.
I'll leave now.

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
'Kay.

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:48.980 position:50% align:center
Feel free to swing by
whenever you like.

00:19:49.064 --> 00:19:50.523 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
I won't anymore.

00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:52.233 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
You always say that.

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Meanie.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
If they forgave me,

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:06.122 position:50% align:center
I don't think I could
send them out there again.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
What an awful person I am.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.638 position:50% align:center
This is really wearing me out.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
[NONO] Not long now.
Under 120 seconds until

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center
Fuji Primary Pillar
enters a dormant state.

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
I wonder if it'll actually stop.

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
Well, that's what the higher-ups

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
and that god
are saying, at least.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
But we'll know for
sure soon enough.

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:38.697 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] Be on the
lookout for any movement.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
Plane status?

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:42.200 position:50% align:center
They're in perfect
shape, you scaredy-cat.

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:44.494 position:50% align:center
Like always,
the wings can fly whenever.

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
The rest is up to
our Valkyries here.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:50.083 position:50% align:center
You just gotta
whip 'em into action.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:51.042 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
True.

00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Ah, I'm so nervous!

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
C-Calm down, idiot!

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:56.631 position:50% align:center
We'll see what
happens in second.

00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:58.466 position:50% align:center
No point in worrying!

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:04.139 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Sonoka, you okay?

00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:05.306 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA gasps]

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Something on your mind?

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
If so, you can talk to me.
Don't forget, we're a team.

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:15.900 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA giggles]
You sound like Miko now.

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA chuckles]
Azuzu said that, too.

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Then that makes it official.

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:22.032 position:50% align:center
You're totally one of us now.

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Really? That's, uh...

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
What, scary to hear?

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:28.830 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
No, that's not it.
