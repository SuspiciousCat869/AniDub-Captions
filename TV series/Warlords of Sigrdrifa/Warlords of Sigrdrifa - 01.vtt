00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:14.993 position:50% align:center
...about 400 seconds
at the very most!

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
Copy. Hear that?

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
We're gonna keep it
busy for 400 seconds

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
with a little game
of tag. Sound good?

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:21.666 position:50% align:center
We have to work together
and attack in waves,

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
so stay with me.

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
Red, Pink.

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:26.838 position:50% align:center
Maintain your speed and
poke at it as you approach.

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
No problem!

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.049 position:50% align:center
Now we're talkin'!

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Anonym.

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:31.843 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna take
a wild guess and say

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:33.553 position:50% align:center
that you want me to
stay on your left wing?

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
That'll work. Try to keep up.

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:37.599 position:50% align:center
Show us what an S-Class
is made--[gasps]

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
Whoa! What the heck?

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:40.560 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Let's get down to business.

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.395 position:50% align:center
Pink, break right in five.

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
Red, at the same time,
you send it a wake-up call.

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
--[MIYAKO] Roger!
--[SONOKA] Copy that!

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Here comes
Hero Cannon two! Fire!

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
Wow, Azu's never this clear!

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.201 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she's never
this helpful, either!

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
You guys are gonna make me cry!

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.288 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Anonym. Can you keep up?

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:01.831 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Well, haven't I been?

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:02.916 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Behind us!

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Again?

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
Shoot! Crap!

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.004 position:50% align:center
It's breaking! It's breaking!

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:10.340 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Teeny Hero Cannon!

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
Are you doin' okay, Azu?

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:14.552 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU grunts]
Pay attention, they're on you!

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center
Move!

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
Should be reaching its limit.

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.395 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Countdown! Forty seconds!

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center
Thirty-nine!

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:26.272 position:50% align:center
Thirty-eight?

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:32.529 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Zero! Yay!
We win! Nice, everyone!

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA sighs]
Thank goodness!

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Mission complete.

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
It ran out of energy
quicker than we thought,

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.578 position:50% align:center
but no complaints here.

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
The transport is safe, too.

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:44.207 position:50% align:center
You showed some good
teamwork out there.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the backup.

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
Hey, same to you. You had
some pretty sick moves.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:49.921 position:50% align:center
Gotta say, I'm kinda impressed.

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:52.132 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Careful, Miko! You
should probably treat the Named

00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
with more respect than that.

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.343 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Oh, will you lighten up?

00:18:55.427 --> 00:18:56.886 position:50% align:center
You don't have
to be such a stiff.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.680 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Hey, don't call me a stiff!

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.140 position:50% align:center
Who am I, Azu?

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
You guys are dead!

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
[yelps] Azu's scary!

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.481 position:50% align:center
Well, I'll see
ya around, S-Size!

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
It's not S-Size, it's S-Class!

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you!
We've gotta be on our way!

00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:18.033 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] I swear, those
two are unbelievable!

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
So? Did I meet your standards?

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.079 position:50% align:center
Ah, good to know
you've got S-Class sarcasm

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:24.330 position:50% align:center
as well as abilities.

00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:25.165 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Sarcasm?

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center
That was real?!

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU growls]
Whatever.

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
Thanks for taking command.
Take care of yourself.

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Yeah, same to you.
May the wings ever guide you.

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:36.968 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
May the wings guide you.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Oh, I forgot to
ask which wing they're with.

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:48.146 position:50% align:center
My lively little sisters.

00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:53.693 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] May we meet
in the sky again someday.

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Mm...

00:19:57.572 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hiya!

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
Guess we meet again!
Been a while!

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Yeah, a while.

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:09.626 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Sigururi!

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
[sighs] That's more like it!

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:24.224 position:50% align:center
Oh. It doesn't bother me.

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
I'm Claudia Bruford!

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
As of today, I've been
reassigned here.

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center
I shall be under your--

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.105 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
Chill out.

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:32.357 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.525 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
I've already got the crew here

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
preparing for
your welcome party.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.946 position:50% align:center
Don't put their efforts
to waste by actin' like that.

00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.905 position:50% align:center
You gotta have some fun.

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
A welcome party?

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.950 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:44.452 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] Uh-huh. Although, with
that Pillar showing up at sea,

00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:48.456 position:50% align:center
it's pretty much on an
indefinite hold for now.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.959 position:50% align:center
At least until the Level 2
alert's called off.

00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
Um, hold on a minute.

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
I hope this doesn't
come off wrong,

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
but do you not know
who I am, Commander?

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
I read your papers.

00:20:57.841 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
You're one of our
ever-so-valuable Named.

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
But you like to party.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
Doesn't everyone?

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.890 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA grunts]

00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
Anyways...

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:09.894 position:50% align:center
...since we're on Level 2 Alert,
you can't really unpack yet.

00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:11.396 position:50% align:center
Oh, I've got an idea.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
Would you like to get a tour
of the base until it's over?

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:15.900 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
All right.

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:17.986 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] Wonderful.
Your tour guide will be--

00:21:18.069 --> 00:21:19.738 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Me, me, me!

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:23.033 position:50% align:center
Winner of rock, paper, scissors!

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:26.828 position:50% align:center
There you have it. I hope
you two get along well.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO giggles]
Not gonna lie,

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:32.292 position:50% align:center
I was pretty into the
idea of showing you around.

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.544 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad I won!

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
My name is Miyako!

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:37.672 position:50% align:center
Miyako Muguruma!

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:40.175 position:50% align:center
Pilot of the red
Fourty-Four, as you know.

00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:41.259 position:50% align:center
Wazzup?

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:43.470 position:50% align:center
You can call me Claudia Bruford.

00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:46.473 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Claudia Bruford.

00:21:46.556 --> 00:21:49.142 position:50% align:center
Mm... It's kinda' hard to say.

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
Uh, you think so?

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:53.188 position:50% align:center
Such nice scenery here.

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:55.440 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Oh! Aren't our palm trees cool?

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
Feels like a tropical
resort, right?

00:21:57.233 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
That's kind of
our selling point.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:21:59.652 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Selling point?

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Selling point!

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:02.906 position:50% align:center
Since we're on alert and all,
we can't leave the base yet,

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:05.158 position:50% align:center
but if there's somewhere here
you wanna see, let me know.

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:07.160 position:50% align:center
I can take you wherever, Claudy.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:09.496 position:50% align:center
Good to know.
Maybe your facility--

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:11.790 position:50% align:center
--[CLAUDIA] Hold on!
--[MIYAKO] Sir!

00:22:11.873 --> 00:22:13.416 position:50% align:center
What was that
"Claudy" thing about?

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.835 position:50% align:center
Your nickname!
Like, Claudia? Claudy?

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:18.630 position:50% align:center
I've been called "Claudette"
before, but that's all.

00:22:18.713 --> 00:22:20.674 position:50% align:center
That doesn't sound fun to say.

00:22:20.757 --> 00:22:23.635 position:50% align:center
Tell ya what, you call me
Miyako or Miko in exchange!

00:22:23.718 --> 00:22:25.011 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay.

00:22:25.095 --> 00:22:26.346 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO gasps]

00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:28.473 position:50% align:center
You can come up with
something on your own, too!

00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:30.141 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll think on it.

00:22:30.225 --> 00:22:31.893 position:50% align:center
You do that. Oh!

00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:34.354 position:50% align:center
How about we head
to the hanger, Claudy?

00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:36.481 position:50% align:center
Your Hero Wing's
there! Let's go! 'Kay?

00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:38.400 position:50% align:center
Whoa, wait up!

00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:39.609 position:50% align:center
Hey, look, it's Miko.

00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:41.653 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Sorry to bother!

00:22:41.736 --> 00:22:43.113 position:50% align:center
What's goin' on with you?

00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:46.449 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO chuckles] Oh, not much,
just being a tour guide.

00:22:46.533 --> 00:22:48.660 position:50% align:center
Showin' the new blood,
Claudy, here around the base.

00:22:48.743 --> 00:22:51.579 position:50% align:center
Hold up, are you telling me that
beaut's our new transfer pilot?

00:22:51.663 --> 00:22:54.124 position:50% align:center
This I gotta see! C'mon guys!

00:22:54.207 --> 00:22:56.126 position:50% align:center
[MAINTENANCE 1B gasps]
A European girl!

00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:57.669 position:50% align:center
[MAINTENANCE 1D]
A blonde Valkyrie!

00:22:57.752 --> 00:23:00.630 position:50% align:center
Hey! Back up! Talk about
a bad first impression!

00:23:00.714 --> 00:23:02.382 position:50% align:center
Don't creep on the poor girl!

00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:03.717 position:50% align:center
Shh, shh!

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.468 position:50% align:center
C'mon! You know we're
just messin' around, Miko.

00:23:05.552 --> 00:23:09.055 position:50% align:center

Oh. Uh, sorry...

00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:31.202 position:50% align:center

already tell all I need to know

about a pilot by their plane.

00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:35.081 position:50% align:center
And that's plenty enough for me.

00:23:35.165 --> 00:23:36.624 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure to do my job

00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:38.960 position:50% align:center

working condition.

amazing, Claudy!

I'm sorry,

00:24:10.784 --> 00:24:13.119 position:50% align:center
how does a cafeteria
help to raise our spirits?

00:24:13.203 --> 00:24:14.621 position:50% align:center
Oh, c'mon, you know.

00:24:14.704 --> 00:24:17.874 position:50% align:center
Empty stomach fighting's bad

00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:19.000 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Oh, you mean,

00:24:19.084 --> 00:24:20.710 position:50% align:center
"you can't fight on
an empty stomach"?

00:24:20.794 --> 00:24:22.462 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Yeah, that! I almost had it!

00:24:22.545 --> 00:24:25.090 position:50% align:center
So, when it comes to the food
here, I recommend the curry!

00:24:25.173 --> 00:24:26.132 position:50% align:center

[MIYAKO]
Huh?

00:24:32.263 --> 00:24:34.349 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Thanks for
giving her the base tour.

[CLAUDIA]
Are you a Valkyrie here, too?

00:24:36.267 --> 00:24:38.895 position:50% align:center
Yes! Sorry, I should have
said that immediately.

00:24:38.978 --> 00:24:42.941 position:50% align:center
I'm Sonoka Watarai. Or as
you called me before, "Pink."

00:24:43.024 --> 00:24:44.442 position:50% align:center
That 72?

00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:46.027 position:50% align:center
This is a surprise.

00:24:46.111 --> 00:24:48.655 position:50% align:center
For being such a talented pilot,
you're younger than I'd expect.

00:24:48.738 --> 00:24:50.615 position:50% align:center
Hah, hah. Impressive, right?

00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:52.784 position:50% align:center
Would you believe
Sono's our youngest ace?

00:24:52.867 --> 00:24:54.536 position:50% align:center
She's a certified speed demon!

00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:55.620 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Miko, Stop!

00:24:55.704 --> 00:24:57.330 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna be called a demon!

00:24:57.414 --> 00:25:00.583 position:50% align:center
Really? But they're all strong
and on fire. Isn't it cool?

00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:02.043 position:50% align:center
I don't find it cool at all.

00:25:02.127 --> 00:25:03.586 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well, I think they're cool.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.588 position:50% align:center
So you're Claudia.
Did I say that right?

00:25:05.672 --> 00:25:08.383 position:50% align:center
Where are my manners?
I should have introduced myself.

00:25:08.466 --> 00:25:09.843 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's Claudia Bruford.

00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:11.052 position:50% align:center
Though I've been
calling her "Claudy,"

00:25:11.136 --> 00:25:12.262 position:50% align:center
so if you feel so inclined,

00:25:12.345 --> 00:25:14.180 position:50% align:center
you're free to
join in on the fun!

00:25:14.264 --> 00:25:17.183 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
All right! Then, Claudy it is!

00:25:17.267 --> 00:25:19.185 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Claudy's a bit of a shy one! Oh!

00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:21.813 position:50% align:center
I just realized what you meant
when you said we're on standby.

00:25:21.896 --> 00:25:24.399 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Yup! The cafeteria
people are all out on the field

00:25:24.482 --> 00:25:25.734 position:50% align:center
right now 'cause of it.

Today's secret
ingredient is loquat jam!

00:25:30.238 --> 00:25:33.074 position:50% align:center
Wait. With the cafeteria
closed, how's there food?

00:25:33.158 --> 00:25:34.784 position:50% align:center
Come on! It's like
the saying goes,

00:25:34.868 --> 00:25:36.619 position:50% align:center
"you can't stomach
an empty fight!" Right?

00:25:36.703 --> 00:25:38.913 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] It's "you can't
fight on an empty stomach."

00:25:38.997 --> 00:25:41.207 position:50% align:center
Fine, but believing
is seeing. Let's go!

00:25:41.291 --> 00:25:42.792 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure what
Miko's saying is

00:25:42.876 --> 00:25:45.170 position:50% align:center
"you'll see when you get there,"
so you might wanna follow her.

00:25:45.253 --> 00:25:47.255 position:50% align:center

signaling for help.

some good eyes on you, Claudy.

you go over there

00:26:31.383 --> 00:26:32.550 position:50% align:center
and help her out
before she ends up

you had your hands full.

[SONOKA]
But it's on water!

00:33:44.941 --> 00:33:47.485 position:50% align:center

[AZUZU]
The part about hiding!

00:34:01.207 --> 00:34:05.086 position:50% align:center
It's not appearing on the radar

They're incapable of
destroying a Pillar entirely.

00:34:30.278 --> 00:34:32.864 position:50% align:center
We could shoot at it all we
like, but to defeat a Pillar,

00:34:32.947 --> 00:34:35.700 position:50% align:center
we have to sever the
Vandrande's link to the ground.

00:34:36.993 --> 00:34:39.454 position:50% align:center

the Pillar's core!

this to you before!

That's a long name.
Can we just say "Vandra?"

00:34:44.167 --> 00:34:45.502 position:50% align:center
Okay, so to put it simply,

00:34:45.585 --> 00:34:47.212 position:50% align:center
we need get the Vandra
out of the water,

00:34:47.295 --> 00:34:49.089 position:50% align:center
and then we can
destroy it, right?

00:34:49.172 --> 00:34:51.925 position:50% align:center
That's correct. We don't have
much time to plan, though...

00:34:52.008 --> 00:34:53.093 position:50% align:center
...at all.

00:34:53.176 --> 00:34:53.968 position:50% align:center

00:34:56.304 --> 00:34:57.722 position:50% align:center
It's totally unfair
that they get to hide

an enemy that's underwater.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:09.275 position:50% align:center
We could attack it once it
makes its way to land, but...

00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:11.319 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Tateyama is a port town,

00:35:11.403 --> 00:35:14.114 position:50% align:center
so the damage would be
nothing short of tremendous.

00:35:14.197 --> 00:35:15.699 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
You're right.

00:35:15.782 --> 00:35:18.118 position:50% align:center
Preventing it from reaching the
town should be our top priority.

00:35:18.201 --> 00:35:19.744 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Obviously.

00:35:19.828 --> 00:35:22.622 position:50% align:center
So, I was trying to
come up with a strategy.

00:35:22.706 --> 00:35:24.040 position:50% align:center
And since it's underwater,

00:35:24.124 --> 00:35:26.376 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help but think,
"how about we go fishing?"

00:35:26.459 --> 00:35:28.128 position:50% align:center
Don't you be stupid, too.

00:35:28.211 --> 00:35:30.380 position:50% align:center
Uh! No, that's it!

00:35:30.463 --> 00:35:31.965 position:50% align:center
So, we're fishing?

00:35:32.048 --> 00:35:33.717 position:50% align:center
No, of course not!

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.094 position:50% align:center
What we'll do is
treat it like a fish!

00:35:36.177 --> 00:35:37.804 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Like a fish?

00:35:37.887 --> 00:35:40.724 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Yeah! And I know just
the way to accomplish that.

00:35:40.807 --> 00:35:43.518 position:50% align:center
Stupid Miyako,
wanna be part of my plan?

00:35:43.601 --> 00:35:46.855 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO gasps]
That's my specialty!

00:35:46.938 --> 00:35:48.356 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
Pillar confirmed in water.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.110 position:50% align:center
All aircraft, change targets
from Tertiary to Secondary.

00:35:52.193 --> 00:35:53.611 position:50% align:center
[SHADES]
Yeah?

00:35:53.695 --> 00:35:55.864 position:50% align:center
Thought we were up against
the grunts, not the miniboss.

00:35:55.947 --> 00:35:57.157 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY]
You've gotta be kidding!

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.825 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE]
Just think of it this way, boys:

00:35:58.908 --> 00:36:01.619 position:50% align:center
This is our chance
to show off to Claudia!

00:36:01.703 --> 00:36:02.704 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY]
Speaking of,

00:36:02.787 --> 00:36:04.205 position:50% align:center
what an annoying
Pillar to make her fight

00:36:04.289 --> 00:36:06.332 position:50% align:center
on her first day, huh?

00:36:06.416 --> 00:36:07.709 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Hey, Claudy?

00:36:07.792 --> 00:36:09.419 position:50% align:center
Worried about the plan?

00:36:09.502 --> 00:36:11.338 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. Not really.

00:36:11.421 --> 00:36:13.298 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] Good, 'cause
there's nothing to worry about!

00:36:13.381 --> 00:36:16.843 position:50% align:center
Azu may be kind of a hot mess,
but she's actually really smart!

00:36:16.926 --> 00:36:18.136 position:50% align:center
I can hear you!

00:36:18.219 --> 00:36:20.805 position:50% align:center
Really? I wasn't
even talking that loud.

00:36:20.889 --> 00:36:22.557 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU whimpers]

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.017 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Poor Azu.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.518 position:50% align:center
I don't get you sometimes.

00:36:25.602 --> 00:36:27.812 position:50% align:center
We're about to go fight a
Secondary we know nothing about.

00:36:27.896 --> 00:36:29.606 position:50% align:center
How can you be so relaxed?

00:36:29.689 --> 00:36:33.109 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] 'Cause we've got me,
Azu, Sono, and now, Claudy, too!

00:36:33.193 --> 00:36:35.070 position:50% align:center
We can't lose!

00:36:35.153 --> 00:36:36.821 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] I get the
feeling Miko doesn't know

00:36:36.905 --> 00:36:39.657 position:50% align:center
about Claudy's history
in Europe then, huh?

00:36:39.741 --> 00:36:42.535 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] This is why
I can't handle idiots.

00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:44.454 position:50% align:center
Setting aside
idiocy for a minute,

00:36:44.537 --> 00:36:46.581 position:50% align:center
don't forget you're
part of the plan, too.

00:36:46.664 --> 00:36:48.708 position:50% align:center
You're prepared for that, right?

00:36:48.792 --> 00:36:50.377 position:50% align:center
Of course...

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.461 position:50% align:center
I just...

00:36:51.544 --> 00:36:52.796 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
What?

00:36:52.879 --> 00:36:55.215 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] I just worry
about us fighting together.

00:36:56.758 --> 00:36:58.176 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:36:58.259 --> 00:36:59.094 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] I--

00:36:59.177 --> 00:37:01.471 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Tch! So superstitious!

00:37:01.554 --> 00:37:03.181 position:50% align:center
I'll get rid of
your stupid worries.

00:37:03.264 --> 00:37:04.849 position:50% align:center
Easy!

00:37:04.933 --> 00:37:06.643 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone, listen up!

00:37:06.726 --> 00:37:08.770 position:50% align:center
According to the new
girl, back in Europe,

00:37:08.853 --> 00:37:10.689 position:50% align:center
everyone used to call
her "Grim Reaper."

00:37:10.772 --> 00:37:12.190 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:15.151 position:50% align:center
[SHADES] Grim Reaper?
As in, this is doomed to fail?

00:37:15.235 --> 00:37:17.612 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE] To be fair,
she does have some bad luck.

00:37:17.696 --> 00:37:20.448 position:50% align:center
I mean, we are fighting
a Pillar on her first day.

00:37:21.741 --> 00:37:24.828 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY] Ah, whatever!
Our Grim Reaper's a beauty!

00:37:24.911 --> 00:37:27.122 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] Sounds like
damn good luck to me!

00:37:27.205 --> 00:37:28.123 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA gasps]

00:37:28.206 --> 00:37:29.457 position:50% align:center
[MAINTENANCE CREW]
Damn straight!

00:37:29.541 --> 00:37:30.458 position:50% align:center
What?

00:37:30.542 --> 00:37:32.836 position:50% align:center
[MAINTENANCE CREW chuckles]

00:37:32.919 --> 00:37:34.295 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA gasps]

00:37:34.379 --> 00:37:36.423 position:50% align:center
Told ya. How do you feel now?

00:37:36.506 --> 00:37:39.300 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Azu, that wasn't very tactful.

00:37:39.384 --> 00:37:42.095 position:50% align:center
[yells] Whaddya mean?!
It went perfectly!

00:37:42.178 --> 00:37:45.056 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Maybe brush up on
your communication skills.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.143 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but which
one of us is older again?

00:37:48.226 --> 00:37:49.561 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA giggles]

00:37:49.644 --> 00:37:52.188 position:50% align:center
Claudy, I may not be
the best when it comes to

00:37:52.272 --> 00:37:54.899 position:50% align:center
sensitive topics
like this, but...

00:37:54.983 --> 00:37:56.234 position:50% align:center
...if there's one
thing I do know,

00:37:56.317 --> 00:37:58.403 position:50% align:center
it's that you seem
a little happier now.

00:37:58.486 --> 00:38:00.572 position:50% align:center
So I'm happy, too.

00:38:04.325 --> 00:38:08.496 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] Valkyrie Wing, change
our flight lead to Schwertleite.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.914 position:50% align:center
And good luck with the plan.

00:38:09.998 --> 00:38:11.332 position:50% align:center
You got this.

00:38:11.416 --> 00:38:12.417 position:50% align:center
Roger, roger!

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.127 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, Azu's been demoted!

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:16.379 position:50% align:center
Not permanently! Just for now!

00:38:16.463 --> 00:38:18.631 position:50% align:center
Blade One, we doing this?

00:38:19.758 --> 00:38:22.302 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Yeah. Just follow my lead!

00:38:22.385 --> 00:38:23.511 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Copy that!

00:38:23.595 --> 00:38:27.766 position:50% align:center
All right. Let "Dynamite
Fishing Plan" begin!

00:38:35.857 --> 00:38:37.359 position:50% align:center
Go for it!

00:38:37.442 --> 00:38:42.155 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO grunts]
Hero Cannon, surprise fire!

00:38:44.449 --> 00:38:46.409 position:50% align:center
"Dynamite Fishing Plan," huh?

00:38:46.493 --> 00:38:48.578 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe the other
names were even worse.

00:38:48.661 --> 00:38:50.080 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
It's coming!

00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:54.876 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Finally showed yourself.

00:38:54.959 --> 00:38:56.711 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
That's one huge fish!

00:38:56.795 --> 00:38:59.214 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] I'm pretty sure
it's a whale, actually.

00:38:59.297 --> 00:39:00.048 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Well, we did it.

00:39:00.131 --> 00:39:01.758 position:50% align:center
We drew it out of the water.

00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:02.926 position:50% align:center
Now that it's up here,

00:39:03.009 --> 00:39:04.511 position:50% align:center
it should run out
of energy eventually.

00:39:04.594 --> 00:39:06.721 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] Yeah, but it'll
reach land if we stall!

00:39:06.805 --> 00:39:08.765 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Right, then proceed as planned.

00:39:08.848 --> 00:39:10.725 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
We blow it up with... Uh...

00:39:10.809 --> 00:39:11.935 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
What's wrong?

00:39:12.018 --> 00:39:14.104 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO] I shot two
Hero Cannons back there!

00:39:14.187 --> 00:39:15.313 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Are you serious?!

00:39:15.397 --> 00:39:17.315 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
I'll go re-arm!

00:39:17.399 --> 00:39:18.566 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO yelps]

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:21.152 position:50% align:center

They're after me!

00:39:21.236 --> 00:39:23.238 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
I'll cover you! Just go!

00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:24.406 position:50% align:center
Roger!

00:39:24.489 --> 00:39:26.324 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Shield Squadron, protect Red!

00:39:26.408 --> 00:39:28.451 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE]
Understood! We're on it!

00:39:28.535 --> 00:39:29.536 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
And us?

00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:30.704 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Let's do what we can.

00:39:30.787 --> 00:39:32.330 position:50% align:center
Try to cut down
on their numbers!

00:39:32.414 --> 00:39:33.790 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU, SONOKA]
Roger!

00:39:37.168 --> 00:39:39.587 position:50% align:center
[SHAGGY]
What the hell?! You see that?

00:39:39.671 --> 00:39:40.839 position:50% align:center
[SHADES]
Can you pull that off?

00:39:40.922 --> 00:39:42.841 position:50% align:center
[BLONDIE]
No way! No chance in hell!

00:39:42.924 --> 00:39:44.801 position:50% align:center
[SQUADRON]
Named are badass!

00:39:44.884 --> 00:39:46.636 position:50% align:center

Anonym, you're too deep!

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.388 position:50% align:center
Don't try to imitate me!

00:39:48.471 --> 00:39:51.891 position:50% align:center
I'm not doing that!
Plus, I've got this!

00:39:51.975 --> 00:39:54.060 position:50% align:center
Sondergerat!

00:39:56.604 --> 00:39:57.939 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:39:58.023 --> 00:40:00.108 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] Oh, nothing.
Azu tinkers with her Hero Wing

00:40:00.191 --> 00:40:02.402 position:50% align:center
and puts weird equipment
on it from time to time.

00:40:02.485 --> 00:40:05.030 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
She does? Is that allowed?

00:40:05.113 --> 00:40:06.656 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
It is when it works flawlessly!

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.200 position:50% align:center

Now!

[SHADES]
Ooh. Look at our girls go!

00:40:21.254 --> 00:40:22.714 position:50% align:center
They're keeping up with a Named!

00:40:22.797 --> 00:40:27.093 position:50% align:center

get back in the action!

[CLAUDIA]
There's no end to 'em.

00:40:28.595 --> 00:40:30.889 position:50% align:center
We've gotta take down
the main one and quickly.

00:40:30.972 --> 00:40:32.807 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Pink?

00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:34.601 position:50% align:center
What's she planning to do?

00:40:34.684 --> 00:40:36.394 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Here goes!

00:40:39.189 --> 00:40:41.900 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA grunts]

00:40:44.194 --> 00:40:45.862 position:50% align:center
That was so reckless!

00:40:45.945 --> 00:40:47.655 position:50% align:center
You might not think
it on first glance

00:40:47.739 --> 00:40:49.366 position:50% align:center
considering she's
so timid all the time,

00:40:49.449 --> 00:40:52.410 position:50% align:center
but in reality, Sono's the
craziest one out of all of us.

I can hear you.

00:40:53.995 --> 00:40:55.538 position:50% align:center

find the Vandrande now.

Right there.

00:41:08.301 --> 00:41:09.260 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
You can tell?

00:41:09.344 --> 00:41:10.261 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Yeah.

00:41:10.345 --> 00:41:11.471 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Breaking through that many

00:41:11.554 --> 00:41:13.807 position:50% align:center
would be a tall order,
even for our idiot.

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:15.225 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
In that case...

00:41:15.308 --> 00:41:16.726 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA, MIYAKO, AZUZU, SONOKA]
...we'll do it together!

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:20.146 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA] Make it rain!
Shoot everything you've got!

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.690 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Roger that!

00:41:21.773 --> 00:41:23.274 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Copy!

00:41:23.358 --> 00:41:25.110 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Okay!

00:41:25.193 --> 00:41:27.612 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Can't even reply the same way.

00:41:33.535 --> 00:41:35.203 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
One!

00:41:35.286 --> 00:41:37.872 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA] It's been a while since
I tailed anyone in a fight!

00:41:37.956 --> 00:41:39.457 position:50% align:center
Take this!

00:41:40.625 --> 00:41:42.502 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Two!

00:41:42.585 --> 00:41:44.379 position:50% align:center
Modified warhead!

00:41:44.462 --> 00:41:46.506 position:50% align:center
Gouge a way through!

00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:48.925 position:50% align:center
Three! Go for it, Miyako!

00:41:49.009 --> 00:41:51.761 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Hero Cannon's back!

00:41:51.845 --> 00:41:53.888 position:50% align:center
Go!

00:41:58.893 --> 00:41:59.811 position:50% align:center
Did it work?

00:41:59.894 --> 00:42:02.480 position:50% align:center
It won't if you
jinx it like that.

00:42:02.564 --> 00:42:04.524 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
It's closing! Disengage!

00:42:04.607 --> 00:42:05.567 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
No!

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.485 position:50% align:center
The Vandra's right there!

00:42:08.653 --> 00:42:10.989 position:50% align:center
That idiot! What's she doing?

00:42:11.072 --> 00:42:14.951 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO yelling]

00:42:19.414 --> 00:42:21.249 position:50% align:center

--[AZUZU] Miyako!

00:42:25.587 --> 00:42:27.672 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA gasps]

00:42:29.966 --> 00:42:32.802 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Am I the only one again?

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.222 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
I'm the Grim Reaper.

00:42:36.306 --> 00:42:39.893 position:50% align:center
That's right. You're
forever the Grim Reaper.

00:42:39.976 --> 00:42:42.645 position:50% align:center
The Grim Reaper, Claudia.

00:42:46.274 --> 00:42:47.901 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Come in.

00:42:52.072 --> 00:42:55.033 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
This is Schwertleite.

00:42:55.116 --> 00:42:56.993 position:50% align:center
Come in.

00:43:00.914 --> 00:43:03.041 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Someone...

00:43:03.124 --> 00:43:05.794 position:50% align:center
Please, someone come in.

00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:11.091 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Pink.

00:43:11.174 --> 00:43:13.093 position:50% align:center
Anonym.

00:43:16.471 --> 00:43:17.931 position:50% align:center
Or Red?

00:43:18.014 --> 00:43:19.557 position:50% align:center
No.

00:43:20.642 --> 00:43:23.019 position:50% align:center
Miyako!

00:43:29.567 --> 00:43:32.821 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

00:43:32.904 --> 00:43:33.738 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:43:33.822 --> 00:43:35.949 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Me! Right here!

00:43:36.032 --> 00:43:37.951 position:50% align:center
That's me. Miyako! Miyako!

00:43:38.034 --> 00:43:39.661 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
Agh, shut up!

00:43:39.744 --> 00:43:41.788 position:50% align:center
Quit repeating yourself already!

00:43:41.871 --> 00:43:43.206 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you?!

00:43:43.289 --> 00:43:44.666 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
I'm just happy!

00:43:44.749 --> 00:43:47.669 position:50% align:center
It's the first time Claudy's
ever called me by my name!

00:43:47.752 --> 00:43:49.879 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] You really got
this excited over that?

00:43:49.963 --> 00:43:51.715 position:50% align:center
What, are you jealous, Azu?

00:43:51.798 --> 00:43:53.299 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
In your dreams!

00:43:53.383 --> 00:43:56.344 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Claudy! It's me, Miyako!

00:43:56.428 --> 00:43:57.804 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA gasps]

00:43:57.887 --> 00:44:01.349 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO] Uh, we're confirming
four Valkyrie here, too.

00:44:01.433 --> 00:44:04.561 position:50% align:center
And no signs of
the Pillar at all.

00:44:04.644 --> 00:44:06.771 position:50% align:center
Copy.

00:44:06.855 --> 00:44:08.189 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO]
One more thing.

00:44:08.273 --> 00:44:10.358 position:50% align:center
Hell of a job on
your first mission.

00:44:10.442 --> 00:44:12.402 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA gasps]

00:44:14.612 --> 00:44:16.990 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Coming home.

00:44:17.073 --> 00:44:19.868 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] I can't believe you
pulled such a stupid stunt.

00:44:19.951 --> 00:44:21.536 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Me? What do you mean by "stunt"?

00:44:21.619 --> 00:44:24.247 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU] At the end!
You jumped out and attacked it!

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.041 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Yeah, but we won 'cause of it!

00:44:26.124 --> 00:44:28.001 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad I brought my katana!

00:44:28.084 --> 00:44:28.960 position:50% align:center
We're safe!

00:44:29.044 --> 00:44:30.128 position:50% align:center
Victor!

00:44:30.211 --> 00:44:32.213 position:50% align:center
[AZUZU]
It's "victory"!

00:44:32.297 --> 00:44:33.798 position:50% align:center
Good work out there today.

00:44:33.882 --> 00:44:36.634 position:50% align:center
Miko and Azu seem full
of energy despite the battle,

00:44:36.718 --> 00:44:39.137 position:50% align:center
but I, for one,
am totally worn out.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.555 position:50% align:center
I imagine.

00:44:40.638 --> 00:44:42.724 position:50% align:center
You were pretty courageous
out there, you know that?

00:44:42.807 --> 00:44:44.726 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
That's all I get? "You"?

00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:47.645 position:50% align:center
You called Miko,
"Miyako," didn't you?

00:44:47.729 --> 00:44:49.814 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:44:49.898 --> 00:44:51.858 position:50% align:center
[SONOKA]
Oh, well. Time's up.

00:44:51.941 --> 00:44:53.360 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:45:03.411 --> 00:45:05.205 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO]
Awesome job, everyone!

00:45:05.288 --> 00:45:06.539 position:50% align:center
There's Miko!

00:45:06.623 --> 00:45:08.124 position:50% align:center
I heard you were crazy again!

00:45:08.208 --> 00:45:09.793 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO giggles]

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:22.305 position:50% align:center
Beautiful.

00:45:22.389 --> 00:45:25.308 position:50% align:center
[MIYAKO gasps]
Oh, man! I almost forgot!

00:45:25.392 --> 00:45:26.768 position:50% align:center

00:45:49.958 --> 00:45:53.962 position:50% align:center
This is Claudia Bruford,
reporting for duty!

00:47:27.639 --> 00:47:29.599 position:50% align:center
