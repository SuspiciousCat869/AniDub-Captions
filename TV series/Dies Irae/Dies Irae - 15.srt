[SHIROU]
Ew...

158
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,548
[SHIROU]
Yuck.

159
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,049
Is the food not good?

160
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,051
No, it's delicious.

161
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,178
[SHIROU]
I'll bet. Here ya go.

162
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,639
Okay?

163
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,558
[SHIROU]
We'll drink to our loyalty.

164
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,726

but it's all we've got.

165
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,228
[MARIE]
Our loyalty?

166
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,521
[REN]
I get it.

167
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,314
[SHIROU] To show we'll
be there for each other.

168
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,900

00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,235
Alright.

170
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,490
But don't take this to mean that

171
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,909
I'm looking to die with you
two idiots, you understand?

172
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,537
Point taken. Down the hatch.

173
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,084
How 'bout none of us die.
Does that work? Yeah?

174
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,087
Oui. I will drink to that.

175
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,927
And we must all make a vow to
meet here again. Once it's done.

176
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,597
Sounds good. I'll be here.

177
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,852
[REN] We'll win. No matter
what it takes!

178
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,353
Always gotta show‐off.

179
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,148
[MARIE] After this,
we'll have our victory party!

180
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:45,038
Tell me this. What does the word
victory mean to each one of you?

181
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,541
Victory is that which shines
majestically from up on high.

182
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,835
Victory is something
that you look back on,

183
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,253
rather than forward to.

184
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,881
I look at victory as the
ultimate climax

185
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,342
that one can reach.

186
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,553
Samiel. If it
shines majestically

187
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,848
in the highest heavens,
Then it stands to reason that

188
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,934
one would get
burned pursuing it.

189
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,852
Much like young Icarus.

190
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,606
Ja. We long for it,
because we can't reach it.

191
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,360
What I desired was only to be
burned by its glorious light.

192
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,694
Und the mark it left on me

193
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,155
I wear proudly as
a badge of honor.

194
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,991
It sounds like you're talking
about being in love to me.

195
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,118
I never knew you
could be so cute.

196
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,620
But I think I like this softer,

197
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,789
more feminine side
of you, Samiel.

198
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,165
You freak.

199
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,460
Well, Schreiber. Explain your
thoughts on victory.

200
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,255
Your response earlier
was rather puzzling.

201
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,258
Would you please be so
kind as to enlighten me?

202
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,801
I'll try my lord.

203
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,971
All my life, I've acted first
und thought about it later.

204
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:47,308
But when I look back, I see
footprints leading to victory.

205
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,936
I've only looked back und
found myself to be the loser

206
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,356
once in my life. It won't
happen again, because I

207
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,651
swore absolute loyalty to
you after that, Lord Heydrich.

208
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,404
Und now I share all
my victories with you.

209
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,866
Now I see. I suppose that
explains what you meant.

210
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,579
Machina, you referred to
it as "the climax," ja?

211
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,958
By that, you mean "the end".
Throughout history,

212
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,503
the stories of heroes
often end with their death.

213
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,881
That is what you wish for?

214
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,302
The ultimate battlefield,
und the ultimate rival.

215
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,638
Two crucial components for one
to attain the "hero's end"

216
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:30,101
that you desire. Very good.
Ja, very good, indeed.

217
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:34,605
The wait is over.
Now that time is upon us.

218
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,660
Onward!

219
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,173
Wait. Stop this.

You will?

[REA whimpers]
I want to know something.

227

I want to know if you were
really Isaak's father!

228
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,506
Is that why Riza was
so afraid of him?

229
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,675
She thought he'd turn out
to be a monster like you.

230
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,886
I need to know the
truth about myself!

Oh, Theresia. Lovely child.

You possess many qualities
that remind me of Isaak.

not know who that thing's

How very rude.

You may not believe this, but I
am not the sort of man who

neglects his familial duties.
If I could answer you, I would.

Okay.

243
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,674
Isaak was an abomination.
But I want you to know this:

I love everything equally.

[REA]
I pity you, really.

249

Because you have so much
power but so little insight

250
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,988
into the world that all of
it is just wasted on you.

251
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,407
Loving everything the same
is no different than saying

252
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,118
there's nothing that
you think is special.

253
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,538
I think victory is impossible
for a person like you.

Both Karl und I are quite
lacking in that aspect.

257
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:08,050
You pity me, do you, child?
Such honest words from a

258
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,387
beautiful girl like you never
fails to stir my heart.

For that, I thank you.

So what is your victory?

You wanna know?

262
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,395
To be surrounded
by everyone I love.

Unlike you, there're people I
value more than anything else

You will meet Isaak quite soon.

I'm the last of my clan.

So it's up to me to make my
family's wish come true at last.

Which means... I must

End this curse for good!

I confess to that sin!
