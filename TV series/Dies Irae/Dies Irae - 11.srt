[KEI] In the days of
the Second World War,

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,320
my great‐grandfather,
skilled at the forge,

3
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,072
was invited to Germany,

4
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,533
tasked with the replication
of the Holy Lance.

5
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,165
[KEI] In and of itself, that
wasn't particularly strange.

6
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:43,377
In order to protect famous
relics from wear and theft,

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,671
replicas were often
used in displays.

8
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,883
It was a rather
standard precaution.

9
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,180
But, there was a
miscalculation, or perhaps,

10
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,765
it's quite possible
that what happened

11
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,267
had been the plan all along.

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,315
It seems my great‐grandfather
was too capable.

13
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,736
He had made more
than a mere replica.

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,446
The new Holy Lance
he had crafted

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,365
possessed and killed him.

One of several titles
he was given.

20
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,428
[KEI] Thereafter, members
of the Sakurai bloodline

21
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,847
have been possessed
by that cursed blade,

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,016
and have been part of
the black round table.

23
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,603
Even with their
souls sucked out,

24
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,688
their corpses keep moving.

25
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,442
When they decay, the lance
moves on to the next Sakurai.

26
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,068
A neverending cycle.

27
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,656
[KEI]
One day, my turn will come.

28
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,869
But, there was someone who
tried to save me from that fate.

29

You don't have to worry
about anything at all. 'Kay?

00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,042
I'm going to put
an end to all of this.

00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,753
You're going to be
happy from here on out.

32
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,504
And that's a promise.

33
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,505
You got it?

34
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,465
Yeah.

35
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,842
I love you, Kai and Beatrice!

I want to be with you forever!

37
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,433
[KEI] It's frustrating to think
how stupid and naÃ¯ve

38
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,393
I was back then.

39
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,270
I knew nothing at all.

40
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,939
With no way to comprehend
what he was talking about,

41
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,609
I just expected everything
to stay the same.

42
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,279
But then, in the
blink of an eye,

43
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,073
the people I loved were gone.

44
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,536
That's why I wanted
to take it all back.

45
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,039
I would do anything
to see them again,

no matter how
great the sacrifice!

00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,336
I love them.

My brother. Beatrice.

00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,482
[VALERIA] Well, this is
an unexpected issue.

50
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,735
It appears Samiel felt the
urge to make an appearance.

51
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,654
Why don't we suspend
hostilities? For now.

52
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,323
We haven't the time for this.

53
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,580
Is she here on orders?

Sent by our Lord to
open the fifth swastika?

55
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,251
The target has been
set and lined up

in the crosshairs.

Just look.

58
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,216
It's quite obvious
that you are her quarry.

59
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,509
If you make one wrong move,

60
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,011
I fear Samiel will
pull the trigger.

61
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,765
But I seem to have
gone unnoticed so far.

62
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,849
That said...

63
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,226
You want me to put
Johann's bloodline

64
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,394
under your protection for now?

65
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,938
[VALERIA]
Correct.

00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,940

Do you really trust me
so little, Riza?

Or is it Samiel?

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,867
I suspect you may be trying
to put on a brave face

now that she's here

That's ridiculous.

You need to be smarter
about this, my dear.

How many people

penchant for indecision?

You've lost the ability
to read the hearts

You're too far gone.

80

[RIZA] A lifetime ago,
you were a weak man.

81
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,979
At times, even pathetic,
but I liked that about you.

82
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,689
It was so very human.

83
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,235
But I know the shame
it made you feel.

84
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,029
Tenderness isn't
a masculine trait.

85
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,157
You threw yourself away
only to become this.

86
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,619
It isn't very wise to
say that sort of thing.

87
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,121
Perhaps.

88

But we've both proven
what fools we really are.

Thinking we have the
power to protect anyone

90
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,128
is pure arrogance.

I won't let you do

[ELEONORE]
So what?

00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,583
Does that mean you're ready
to take on all three of us

00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,544
to protect your little friend?

[MARIE]
No. Just you.

168
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,173
You're the only one here
with that sort of intention.

[ELEONORE]
That's true.

You've got a point.

The situation looks
that way to me, too.

172
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,311
I respect my enemies
more than so‐called allies

Now then, what do we do?

00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,987
You have ultimate
command here, Samiel.

I will follow the
orders you give me.

I have no opinion of my own.

[ELEONORE chuckles]

That's the way it should be.

And what about you, Brenner?

You weren't a part of this

Why don't you stay

[RIZA]
Leon.

You should know
Samiel's an immortal.

189
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,387
The magic of the Golden
Blessing can either be used

190
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,932
for resurrection or for
granting one immortality.

191

She sacrificed all
the souls she needed

192

in the Battle of Berlin,
and has had her wish granted.

193
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,692
So I insist that you
not cause any trouble.

194
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,819
I have a claim to
every last human soul

that remains in the building.

196

After all, I can't imagine that
you need any more, now do you?

00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,701
You aren't wrong.

If I had to choose,
I really don't need them.

199
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:48,333
However, Lord Heydrich
gave me instructions.

200
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,751
He tasked me
personally with seeing

201

the fifth swastika opened.

202

Give it a rest, Brenner.

You cannot fool me.

I've known you for far too long,

I don't know your
reasoning, exactly,

but there's somebody
out there you don't want

You may lack the resolve needed

[RIZA gasps]

211

00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,359
with my orders.

It's a bit late to mention this,

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,408
but I've hated you
for a long time.

217
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,910
After all...

218
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,330
It was Kircheisen that always
stopped us from fighting,

219
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,332
but she's no longer with us.

Pay close attention, girl.

221
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,214
I'll give you an order
that even someone

If that wench so much
as moves, kill her.

If you want the glory of
opening the fifth swastika,

225
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,641
then you can kill each
other over it, Brenner.

226
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,768
I'd imagine you're quite
used to getting rid of brats

by now, aren't you?

I need for this young man
