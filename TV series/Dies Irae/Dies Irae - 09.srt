156
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:18,825
Right. I'll go up to the school.

157
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:22,370
Yeah. I know it's selfish,
but I have to.

158
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:25,999
Also. Sakurai and
Rusalka were up there.

159
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:28,334
They can't be ignored.

160
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:31,421
All right! I had a
feeling you'd say that.

161
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,172
The bridge was destroyed,

162
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:35,633
and there are pictures of the
giant all over the internet.

163
00:09:35,717 --> 00:09:37,343
With all the chaos
that's been going on,

164
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:39,470
everybody staying in their
houses for a few days

165
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:41,222
would be the most
favorable outcome.

166
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:43,933
But Japan's been at
peace for so long.

167
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,810
I doubt you can count on that.

168
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:47,520
You think you could do
something about the people

169
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:49,480
at the hospital
before it's too late?

170
00:09:49,564 --> 00:09:54,235
[ERI sighs] I'm certainly
going to do whatever I can.

171
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:57,572
[REN] Fair enough. Thanks for
taking the wool off my eyes.

172
00:09:57,655 --> 00:10:00,950
I owe you one. I'll pay
you back somehow.

173
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,869
So ya gotta be careful, okay?

174
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:04,370
See ya.

175
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:07,498
[MARIE] Are you done talking?
Look what I've found, Ren!

176
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:10,043
I borrowed Kasumi's
school uniform!

177
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:13,963
We are going to the school, no?
Does it look good?

178
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,717
Yeah. You look gorgeous.

179

[REN]
You're right.

185
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:01,260
And worse, Sakurai and Rusalka
are nowhere in sight.

186
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:02,845
Rea either.

187
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,847
\Which could mean they've
already got a plan to prevent

188
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,599
anyone from escaping.

189
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:09,268
And somehow they got
every student to show up.

190
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:11,646
Might be hypnosis or something.

191
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,109
[REN] But if that is what's
happening, why aren't they here?

192
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:17,985
And where the hell are they?

193
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,031
They were able to orchestrate
this right under my nose.

194
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,742
[MARIE]
Ren! Come sit with me!

195
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:29,997
Your face, it looks like this.

196
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:32,208
You haven't had a
chance to rest at all.

197
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:36,420
So come here and sit down.

[MARIE]
Is it because you're hungry?

205
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:13,541
[REN] Yeah. I guess.
How are you feeling, Marie?

206
00:12:13,624 --> 00:12:16,377
I'm feeling okay
for the time being.

207
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,046
Would you like me to go
and get something for you?

208
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,967
No, stay with me. I don't
particularly want to be alone

209
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,971
with my thoughts right now.

210

[MARIE] Tell me everything.
I want to hear all about

213
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:37,315
the things you used to do
when you came to school.

214
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:40,234
This building reminds me of
a castle in certain way,

215
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:41,694
it's so big.

216
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:43,654
And since there are so many
people that are around the

217
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:46,365
same age, I bet you
had a lot of fun here.

221

Tell me about it.

222
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,084
Sure. Kasumi, Shirou, and I

223
00:12:57,168 --> 00:13:00,087
have been friends as
long as I can remember.

224
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:02,131
They're both dumb and noisy,

225
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,926
which meant they were
both magnets for trouble.

226
00:13:06,844 --> 00:13:10,431
[REN] But. I think that
was part of the fun.

227
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:14,060
I wished it could
keep going on forever.

228
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:17,980
I'd always go up to the roof
when I felt like getting away.

229
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:22,526
My first year here,
I met this weird older girl.

230
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,904
Then Kasumi came
looking for me,

231
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:28,074
and it ended up being somewhere
we would go to hang out.

232
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,371
[REN]
Shirou was always a bonehead,

233
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:37,667
and Rea would eat the most
stomach‐churning sandwiches.

234
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,045
To think, not so long ago,

235
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:43,714
the four of us were
together all the time.

236
