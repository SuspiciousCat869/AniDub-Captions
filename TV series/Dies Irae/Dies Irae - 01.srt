Days ago,

3
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,842
a bomb went off in the hopes
of assassinating the Führer.

4
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:18,013
This act of terrorism had
been foretold. By you, in fact.

5
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,141
Surely this can not
be mere coincidence.

6
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,809
Look at me.

7
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,062
You were arrested under
suspicion of treason

8
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,688
against the Reich.

00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,856

and Chief of Security

I assume you know my
name is Karl Krafft.

But did you know that
some call me a mage?

[REINHARD grunts]

16
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:46,249
[KARL] Ah! You recently
witnessed a strange vision,

17
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,876
did you not?

18
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,298
[KARL] To put it plainly,
you're seeking my assistance

19
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,217
in your propaganda efforts?

20
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,346
[REINHARD] Indeed. That is my
condition for sparing your life.

21
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,307
Essentially, we require
our own Nostradamus.

22
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,893
Someone to help restore our
sense of national pride

23
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:09,606
after our great defeat, and the
humiliation at Versailles.

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,485
[KARL] I understand.
You have my support.

25
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,654
If you wish me to be
the new Nostradamus,

26
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,739
then I gladly accept.

I will lead you to your destiny.

of the "master race".

I'm honored, but you give
me far too much credit.

I followed my orders.

Just as any good soldier
of the Fatherland would.

Ah...! And this "work issue",

was something you had to
attend to personally, was it?

75
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,457
[REINHARD] I used the excuse
as my chance to leave.

76
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,211
The fact that my duty converged
with my desire was good fortune.

Working for the RMVP, I've

But I am at a loss as to
why the Three Valkyries

00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,668
felt the need to intercept our
retreat from the festivities.

00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,129
Well, we've come here in
regards to Herr Heydrich's

earlier decision. It is our
wish to accompany the General,

and assist him
however we can.

97
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,804
The General's work is outside
the scope of your duties.

98
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,015
True, but we are
servants of the Reich,

00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,808
and are ready to
do what we must.

We believe in the
work you're doing, sir.

Thus, we would like to pledge
ourselves as your swords,

[REINHARD] Do as you please,
but be prepared for punishment

104
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,411
for insubordination
further down the line.

105
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,456
And of course, you're all
responsible for you own safety.

[REINHARD]
No matter.

114
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,150
This next move falls outside
of your duties, as well.

along anyway, won't you?

Of course.

I haven't forgotten the
promise I made to lead you

to your destiny,

promise is drawing nigh.

Once again, Father,

124
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,884
I would like to
express my gratitude.

125
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,721
Thank you for entrusting a relic
of such absolute importance

126
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,347
to my department.

127
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,558
I'm just glad to
be of assistance.

128
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,144
I would do anything to
support the Ahnenerbe.

129
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,687
I hope it will help you.

130
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,856
Though interesting from
a cultural perspective,

131
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,400
the relic itself is
an ill‐omened thing.

132
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,818
If you and your organization

133
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,403
are willing to take
it off my hands,

134
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,155
then I'm glad to be rid of it.

135
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,656
[ANNA]
Oh really?

136
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,743
Then I would expect you to look
a lot happier than you do.

137
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,038
Or is something else bothering
your delicate sensibilities?

138
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,623
Not at all. I was just‐‐

139
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,167
Well, cheer up!

140
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,127
In another time, this little
box would have seen you tried

141
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,920
by the church for heresy!

142
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,674
I can completely
understand your concern.

143
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,926
Speaking of such
a thing reminds me.

144
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,055
Several years ago, someone told
me about a priest who could

145
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,766
read the hearts
and minds of men.

146
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,311
That would certainly be
labeled heretical, wouldn't it?

147
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,730
In a different era, he would
have been burned at the stake

148
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,565
for practicing
the dark arts.

149
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,233
When you think
about it that way,

150
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,320
I suppose he would
feel very fortunate.

151
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,032
Well, perhaps he would have
been happier back then.

152
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,658
He might not have had to witness

153
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:39,454
the sorts of things a man can't
unsee unfolding all around him.

154
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,790
There are horrors
in our era, too.

[gasps, grunts]

156
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:50,757
Dear god, no! I can't stay here.
