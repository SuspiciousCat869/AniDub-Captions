[REN] Did you know that
girl with the dark hair?

309
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,310
No. She needed some directions.

310
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,519
[REN]
Hm.

311
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,229
I was just trying to be
helpful, that's all.

312
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,690
Have you been up at the
school this entire time?

313
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,108
We just now left there.

314
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,110
I've been busy taking
care of this one.

315
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,362
So you're taking care
of me now, are ya?

316
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,113
What was that?

317
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,698
[REA giggles]

318
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,035
[REN] I guess I'm just trying
to read more into everything.

319
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,370
But it's all the same as before.

320
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,499
Let's go, Rea.

321
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,752
[REN]
I tried convincing myself.

322
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,422
Because I wanted to believe
even without Shirou,

323
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,383
nothing about my daily
life had changed.

It's here.

Welcome to Shambhala.

[VALERIA]
Sturmscharführer Maria,

328
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,029
and Obersturmführer Bey.
It's been a long time.

329
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,698
And it most certainly
is a pleasure

330
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,282
to see you again, Father.

331
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,659
Enough blathering.

332
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,703
Tell me, how many of
the others have already

333
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,037
arrived at Shambhala?

334
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,040
Leonhart, Sonnenkind,
Babylon, and Tubal Cain

335
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,834
all have come. As things stand,

336
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,211
Schpinneh is the only one
of our number missing.

337
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,713
Leonhart's there?

338
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,465
Ah? Our little
missing Valkyrie?

339
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,719
Has that girl gotten
any better at all?

340
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,596
[VALERIA] You may find that
out for yourself soon enough.

341
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,099
The vice commander
has prepared this unit.

342
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,644
Working tirelessly for the sake
of the mighty Lord Heydrich.

[VALERIA]
And now, the Ars Magna

344
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,358
we have long desired
is finally upon us.

345
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,655
[VALERIA] There is no evil.
There are no sins.

There are no further chains
that might bind you.

All taboos are
rendered meaningless.

348
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,912
Our divine lord, Our god,

349
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,248
shall lead us all
unto this land.

350
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,792
And you will take
your sword in hand,

351
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,879
and smite all those who would
block our lord's purpose.

352
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,382
And we shall not leave a single
thing alive in our wake.

353
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:02,136
Now come, children, and join
me in our unholy benediction.

354
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,139
We shall kill the men,
and kill the women.

355
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,100
We shall kill the aged,
and the mewling babes.

356
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,686
We'll kill all the dogs.
All of the horses.

357
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,564
Slaughter the cattle,
the camels, and the goats.

358
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,067
[VALERIA] Our god will
allow it, as will I.

359
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,446
Your lord will allow all.
You are his knights.

The claws and fangs of a beast.

Wilhelm Ehrenburg will serve.

As will Rusalka
Maria Schwägerin.
