Are you serious about this?

Yeah.

10
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,101
My colleague's death
was rather unexpected.

11
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,354
And the poor boy desperately
needs a place to call home.

All right.

I think Kasumi will be

So tell me, what's his name?

Yes, that's right,

[MERCURIUS]
Ja.

36
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,342
For you, this is how
our twisted story began.

37
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,306
[MERCURIUS] And now, beloved
factor of self‐destruction.

38
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,433
I will share with you
the requisite conditions

39
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,352
to be the star of the show.

40
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:28,065
[MERCURIUS] One of
God's featured playthings.

41
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,880
[MERCURIUS]
Every man has his own path

42
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,466
that fate leads him down.

43
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,968
For example, there are those
hunters who are destined

44
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,512
to always have their
favorite quarry stolen out

45
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,389
from under them.

46
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,309
And others, forever unable
to escape from the depths

47
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,270
of their own soulless husk.

48
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,022
And thus,

49
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,274
they desperately grab
at the legs of others,

50
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,610
only pulling them
to their deaths.

51
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,363
Like a drowning man,
flailing and sputtering for air.

52
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,327
[MERCURIUS]
I'm only describing the two

53
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,162
with whom you've interacted.

54
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,624
But they have been quite
entertaining in their own way.

55
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,501
As Shakespeare once said,

56
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,003
"All the world's a stage,
and all the men and women

57
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,713
merely players."

58
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,048
In other words‐‐

59
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,925
Shut up!
Who the hell are you?

60
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,428
You keep going off on all this
crap I never asked about!

61
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,889
I don't give a damn
about your moody poetry!

62
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,099
[MERCURIUS] I suppose
the question you want answered

63
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,561
is why you are still alive.

64
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,898
But that's a foolish
question for you to ask.

65
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,901
You should already be
well aware of the answer.

66
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,695
As long as you feel
that sense of déjà vu,

67
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,781
death will never
be able to claim you.

68
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,534
And as impossible as
it sounds, it's true.

69
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,536
You cannot die.

70
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,413
Because I won't let you perish
before your work is done.

[SHIROU]
You what?

72
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,667
[MERCURIUS]
I suppose I should start from

73
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,919
the beginning.

74
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,712
When you were a young boy,

75
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,923
a seemingly minor change
occurred in your life that would

76
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,925
set your course.

77
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,428
It began with the arrival of
your new neighbor, Ren Fujii.

78
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,223
What did you think of him
that first time?

79
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,474
[SHIROU]
Nothing.

80
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,935
He just seemed kinda gloomy.

81
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,312
[MERCURIUS]
Indeed, but was that all you

82
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,690
thought about him, nothing more?

83
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,608
If so, then why
did you build a

84
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,735
friendship with him
in the first place?

85
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,655
One that has lasted
to this very day.

[MERCURIUS]
You remember.

That sensation you
first felt that day,

91
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,364
at that precise moment.

92
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,242
That twinge at the
back of your mind.

93
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,828
[SHIROU]
It felt like I'd done it before.

94
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,622
[MERCURIUS]
Yes.

95
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,167
That was the moment when
your déjà vu first began.

96
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,969
[MERCURIUS]
The father in this sordid tale

97
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,473
didn't have what most might
call an average background.

98
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,267
His role was to cultivate a
subject of vital importance

99
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,936
in a project I'd
first envisioned

100
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,396
during the height of
the Second World War.

101
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,900
He also set about
the business

102
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,861
of incorporating another
special bloodline, as well.

103
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,614
"Eugenics" is what they call it.

104
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,075
Put simply, both of your
childhood friends were born

105
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,660
as a result of
decades of planning

106
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,620
and genetic coordination.

107
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,705
Ironic, is it not?

108
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,166
You, the greatest
rule‐breaker of them all,

109
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,794
were actually the most
normal among your friends.

110
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,837
Just your luck, eh?

111
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,048
If you had never been
involved with them,

112
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,134
you would have been able
to die like any other human.

113
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,388
What the hell
are you getting at?

114
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,556
Are you trying to make me
believe killing that old bastard

115
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,016
wasn't even my decision?

116
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,810
Well, that is the truth.

117
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,313
You were never intended
to be a part of this plan.

118
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,191
So the question remains thus:
why did you become the

119
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:07,112
murderer, a central character
in our macabre play?

120
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,823
Or perhaps I should
put it another way.

121
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,242
Who was it that stood to gain
the most from the death

122
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,868
of the cruel father?

123
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,664
[MERCURIUS]
If Ren had spoken up about

124
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,165
what was happening to him,

125
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,209
Kasumi would have
been devastated.

126
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,503
Thus, when he decided
to suffer in silence,

127
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,171
his feelings were genuine.

128
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,883
But all things have
front and back sides.

129
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:33,847
His wish to destroy his false,
everyday life was also genuine.

130
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,266
However, you were
able to take its place.

131
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,978
To both rescue it
and destroy it.

132
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,397
Just as my dear friend
is to me...

133
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,316
You, the manifestation
of the urge for ruination,

134
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,444
the self‐destruction factor.

135
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,447
That is the role you must play.

136
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,990
I will not allow you to die

137
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,950
as long as you are useful to me,

138
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,911
and as long as you don't
overextend your déjà vu.

139
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,123
Show me the unforeseen
conclusion I've longed for.

140
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,542
That is the reason I've gifted
you with such incredible

141
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,335
power and uncanny luck.

Damn.

144

You really think I'm gonna
believe that your pompous ass

145
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,385
is God?

146
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,636
And me and everybody
else are just toys

147
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,555
for you to play with?

148
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,725
You can take that‐‐
and shove it up your ass!

149
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,312
I believe you're that much
of a dick, but Ren isn't!

150
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,024
His friendship with you is
both true and important.

151
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,610
And you can be certain the
feelings I have for my friend

152
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,029
and counterpart are exactly
the same as the ones

153
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,198
my son holds for you.

154
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,825
Like the fleeting thought
of falling from a high place,

155
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,995
or lacerating oneself
whilst handling a blade.

156
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,538
No matter how hard we try,

157
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,750
we always build a
destructive relationship.

158
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,376
As you know,

159
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,003
from the moment you
picked up that blade,

160
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,631
you brought his
normal life to an end.

butcher every last one!

324
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,131
[WILHELM] Ja, she can
be a bit overprotective.

325
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,509
Whenever I get too
excitable, she comes out.

326
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:59,263
Goddamn, you really are
one crazy motherfucker!

327
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,891
Don't you dare speak
that way to my son!

328
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,105
[HELGA laughing]

329
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,370
[WILHELM yells]

330
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,456
[SHIROU gasps]

331
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,886
[WILHELM laughing]

332
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,222
I love it! Keep the
good stuff coming, kid!

333
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,140
I want more, so don't stop!

334
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,601
That was all right
for an appetizer,

335
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,812
but now it's time
for the main course.

336
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,647
Yeah?

337
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,524
Well save room for the
ass‐kicking I'm serving ya!

338
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,905
[WILHELM grunting]

339
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,533
[WILHELM]
Schreiber?

340
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,118
Let me go!

341
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,411
[WOLFGANG]
Quiet down.

342
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,995
You're in my way.

343
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,289
I think it's about
time you got lost.

344
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,709
I'm here for him.

345
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,757
[WILHELM yelling]

346
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,890
[WILHELM]
Not yet! No!

347
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,364
[WOLFGANG chuckles]

348
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,451
I must say you've surprised me.

349
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,703
I can't believe Bey
lost to you like that.

350
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,414
I swear, I never would have
imagined that outcome.

351
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,458
Look, you're the one
who killed him, Patch.

352
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,501
That's not important.

353
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,296
You're responsible
for this, yeah?

354
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,215
I guess our love was like
ships passing in the night,

355
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,509
but I still have to
avenge her death.

356
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,554
So I'm going to kill you
for what you did.

357
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,306
[RUSALKA]
Help me.

358
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,057
Please, help me.

359
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,350
It hurts.

360
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,269
Please, Schreiber.

361
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,645
I don't want to die‐‐

362
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,986
Once she's dead,
I will seek my revenge.

363
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,238
Run away while you still can.

364
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,907
It doesn't matter
where you hide.

365
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,993
I'll find you,
and then rip you to pieces.

366
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,996
[WOLFGANG laughing]

367
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,125
We'll meet again soon.

368
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,420
You have the word
of Wolfgang Schreiber:

369
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,964
<i>Einherjar</i> of Lord Heydrich!

370
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:43,469
A fallen warrior lifted by
valkyries into golden Valhalla!

371
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,598
