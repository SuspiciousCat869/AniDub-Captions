00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,829
und had lived a normal
life until recently.

161
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,541
Though, having grown up with
creatures like us around her,

162
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:10,545
"normal" may not be the most apt
qualifier in Theresia's case.

163
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,797
But, one mustn't
blame her for that.

164
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,259
The human mind always finds a
way to see what it wants to see.

165
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,095
Especially without proof to
contradict those thoughts.

166
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,347
She may have a vague
sense of unease,

167
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,891
but that isn't enough
to act upon.

168
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,351
That's only because you
monsters kept her in the dark

169
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,895
and fed her lies.

170
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,855
I cannot deny that fact.

171
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,442
Though Riza deserves most
of the credit, of course.

172
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,361
But for now, you should
worry about yourself,

173
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,071
und forget about her.

174
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,991
To be quite frank, the last
thing I would want

175
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,660
is to be in your
shoes right now, Fujii.

176
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,626
Know that I speak from
the heart when I say this.

177
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,003
I wish you the
very best of luck.

178
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,881
Lord Heydrich is a
man unlike any other.

179
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,925
You must not make the
mistake of judging him

180
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,927
as an average human being.

181
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,493
[grunts]

182
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,744
[gasps]

183
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:37,966
That sign. Is it? Kill?
Slaughter? No, not quite.

184
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,259
I know that sigil.

185
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,301
[REINHARD]
"Hagall."

186
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,302
[gasps]

187
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,054
[REINHARD]
Destruction. The end.

188
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,599
The death of the old order,
und the power to make it happen.

189
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:50,353
The unstoppable force
of nature. Pure calamity.

190
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,023
The twilight of the gods.
The final war.

191
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:59,195
It is Dies Irae. Long have
I awaited its coming.

192
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,822
Please take a seat, boy.

193
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,617
You need not to be
so afraid, for now.

194
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,036
The Grail Priest no doubt
frightened you as he brought you

195
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,622
to me, but I place great
value on politeness.

196
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,250
As the master of this place,
I know how to extend

197
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,420
hospitality to our
esteemed guests.

198
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,171
Now then, do sit.

199
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,968
[REINHARD chuckles]
Ja, I see.

200
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,429
An interesting choice,
I'll give you that.

201
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,015
Quite symbolic,
one could even say.

202
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,852
Tell me. Do you have any idea
which seat you've chosen?

203
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,646
No clue, and I honestly
don't give a damn.

204
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,982
Just tell me what you're
planning to do to me.

205
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,650
Do to you?

206
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,985
[scoffs]

207
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,195
I simply wanted to have a
conversation with you,

208
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,280
face to face.

209
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,364
[gasps]

210
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,412
[REINHARD] Every fraction of
every single moment. I'm aware.

211
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,832
Testing my perceptions for the
slightest hint of the unknown.

212
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,377
Und contemplating how I might
better sense the undetectable.

213
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,506
In other words. I am
a prisoner of déjà vu.

214
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,552
[REINHARD] I thought that would
be the easiest way to explain

215
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,262
my experience to you.

216
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,430
[gasps]

217
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,640
[REINHARD]
I remember this moment.

218
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:13,311
I have repeated it an
infinite number of times.

219
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,731
Without even the
most minute deviation.

220
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,941
At this point, I can no
longer dismiss it as

221
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:23,613
"as mere hallucination". Not
since the first time I met Karl.

222
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,114
You mean Karl Krafft.

223
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,077
[REINHARD] Ja. A stranger
man than most.

224
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,662
It is said that he has possessed
thousands of appellations

225
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,247
over the years.

226
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:38,503
Such as Faust, for example.
Saint Germain. Paracelsus.

227
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,046
Cagliostro.

228
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,130
[REN grunts]

229
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,674
[REINHARD]
And of course, Mercurius.

230
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,178
Which is, I believe,
the most well known.

231
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,013
That's ridiculous!

232
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,891
So what, he's been alive
for countless centuries?

233
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,684
Do you really believe that crap?

234
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:57,063
What if I do believe it?
Would that change anything?

235
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,982
Besides, that's not
the important part.

236
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,861
His power is what mattered,
und he was quite interesting.

237
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,031
His objectives matched
my own, und so,

238
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,201
there were no
problems between us.

239
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,452
What objectives?

240
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,872
To make it stop. This Déjà vu.

241
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,292
After meeting him, I formed
a friendship with the man,

242
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:22,922
und thanks to that choice, the
whole world now seems blurry.

243
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,341
My life had always
been passionless,

244
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,260
but this was somehow
even worse.

245
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,011
I have never felt a
sense of achievement

246
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,222
at any point in my life.

247
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:35,476
Und without free agency, there
isn't any sense of satisfaction.

248
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,311
No matter what
position I held.

249
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,022
What glory and honor
were heaped upon me.

250
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,110
I never had a sense
of fulfillment. But why?

251
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,237
Like Karl said,

252
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,488
[MERCURIUS]
The truth is,

253
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:50,408
you have yet to use your
strength to the fullest.

254
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,118
[REINHARD]
Clichéd, perhaps.

255
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,872
Like a boy's fantasies of
being drunk on omnipotence.

256
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,416
But he also shared
the following with me:

257
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,128
The closer to the extreme,
the more clichéd you are.

258
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:07,091
In other words. I seem to have
been born into the wrong world.

259
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,052
But he said controlling myself
would be untrue to the core

260
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,264
of my very essence.

261
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,309
If I turn to truly face
the world head on,

262
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,312
and this world is
consequently destroyed,

263
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,023
then my love is
that destruction.

264
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,069
It is my wish, to both
embrace und destroy.

265
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:32,116
Whatever. You'll kill millions
so you can feel satisfied?

266
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,453
What else can one
hope for from this life?

267
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,164
Two things, specifically:.

268
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,666
A situation in which I
have no choice but to use

269
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,127
the full extent of my power,

270
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:47,632
und one in which what follows
is completely unknown to me.

271
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,009
This is not my world, currently.

272
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,471
Thus, I must create the
new world that should be,

273
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,348
und release the flow.

274
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,060
[REINHARD] I must forge a
mountain worthy of climbing,

275
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,937
und then ascend it.

276
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,273
That will be the
end of my déjà vu.

277
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,525
Because I love everything,

278
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:09,237
I will destroy everything
and paint it over.

279
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,033
I once sacrificed all of Berlin,
but it still was not enough.

280
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,995
It is no secret. The result of
making a world to rival the law

281
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,332
of déjà vu simply shifted
it into another dimension.

282
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,959
Like two great powers,

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,879
staring at each other from
across the expanse of the sea.

284
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,925
Therefore, to invade.
I require a sacrifice now,

285
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,468
und that means...

286
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,345
[REN]
This whole town?

287
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,264
[REINHARD]
Hm. Indeed.

288
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,848
[REN]
Really?!

289
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,519
Everyone that lives here is just
a tool for achieving your goals?

290
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,355
Your outrage is directed
at the wrong man.

291
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,524
If it were not for
our persistence,

292
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,026
this town would never
have come to be.

293
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,822
Lovely Shambhala.
The Eastern Paradise.

294
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,658
Ever since World War Two,
Karl has been making this

295
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,869
eastern jewel into
a second Berlin.

296
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,664
A special place,
with eight ley lines.

297
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,417
Manifest eight battlefields
on those points,

298
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,336
und sacrifice countless
souls in our wake.

299
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,298
[REINHARD] The resulting
magic will give you

300
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:14,510
a city‐sized relic. A swastika.

301
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,263
A golden alchemical circle
that will grant my wish

302
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,807
for an end to my
plight at long last.

303
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,978
Und of the eight sites, two of
them have already been opened.

304
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:28,190
Thus, six battlefields remain
between us und the end.

305
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:32,278
A great deal of blood und a
soul's penitence are required.

306
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:36,866
Do you understand? Und that
is where you come in.

307
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,744
Conquer the eight battlefields
here in Shambhala,

308
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,830
which will allow
me to manifest.

309
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,666
Refusal will only result
in the death of the masses

310
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,628
being meaningless.
You cannot refuse.
