00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,117
To remind you, that I am, and
always will be on your side.

158
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,453
You never told me why you
and Shirou had that big fight

159
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,871
in the first place.

160
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,082
You're bottling it
up like always.

161
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,001
[KASUMI] You have a
bad habit of leaving me

162
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,295
completely out of
the loop, Ren.

163
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,964
And, frankly, it's frustrating.

164
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,677
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,847
So whenever things get hard,
I want you to come right to me.

166
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,268
If you need someone to fight
for you, I'm good at kendo!

167
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,145
Yeah, I know you are.

168
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,191
I want to help you out
in any way I can, Ren.

169
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,986
Always remember that. Always.

170
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,122
[KASUMI] So, is there anything I
can do for you? Anything at all.

171
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,792
[MERCURIUS] Certainly,
but there is no need to ask.

172
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,212
[MERCURIUS]
My luminescent goddess.

173
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,131
I have fashioned
the ultimate necklace

174
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,092
to adorn your beauteous frame.

175
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:39,264
Now then. Let us begin tonight's
Grand Guignol, shall we?

176
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:57,365
[VALERIA] Things seem to finally
be set in motion. Come, behold.

177
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,370
Cast your gaze upon
this most holy relic.

178
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,456
You can see the synchronization
has begun as of now.

179
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,751
It already has enough
sacrifices to activate, does it?

180
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,880
[VALERIA] Ja. Und as I'm
sure you'll remember,

181
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:16,342
this is where Kirc‐heisen fell,
now eleven years ago.

182
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,179
Thus, the souls required
to open the swastika

183
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,680
are already in place.

184
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,848
But at the time,

185
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,850
those conditions had
not yet been met,

186
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,728
und a delay was
deemed necessary.

187
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,730
It's entirely possible
the murders in town

188
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,232
are an attempt to get
the process started again.

189
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,651
All to prepare the stage.

190
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,238
[VALERIA] Though this guillotine
should already be complete

191
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,950
in and of itself. It doesn't
need any lesser souls.

192
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,744
You understand that, don't you?

193
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,622
The power that dwells
inside this relic?

194
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,419
[KEI] In preparation, I shall go
and personally supervise things.

195
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,975
[MARIE]
Now, Cagliostro.

196
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,518
[REN gasps]

197
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:11,105
[MARIE] Tell me. What do
you want me to do?

198
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,025
[REN] No, you have it wrong.
That isn't my name.

199
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,528
I'm Ren. Ren Fujii.

200
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,822
And what do I call you?

201
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,951
My name is Marie.

202
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:28,039
I've been waiting here,
for a very long time.

203
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,501
Tell me something.
I need to know.

204
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,753
[inaudible]

205
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,632
[REN gasps]
What was I doing?

206
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,093
Kasumi!

207
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,011
Where are you?!

208
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,557
[REN] Damn it.
This can't be real!

209
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,814
[POLICEMAN A]
Stop! Hold on, young man!

210
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,982
You can't go in there! Hey!

211
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,316
[POLICEMAN A, B]
Hey!

212
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,030
Kasumi... Kasumi!

213
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:07,495
[REN]
Where are you...? Kasumi!

214
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:18,798
[REN gasps]

215
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,639
[KEI] What's the matter?
Aren't you going to call her?

216
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,725
[REN gasps]

217
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,520
[KEI] You'd sort things out
quickly that way, but no.

218
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,981
You already know
what the answer is.

219
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,233
What answer? What do you mean?

220
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,776
[KEI]
Once upon a time,

221
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,071
there was a powerful
mage who had gone mad.

222
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,907
He secretly controlled a
certain nation's army,

223
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,202
and changed them
into inhuman monsters.

224
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:53,124
The man's name was Karl Krafft.
His second name was Mercurius.

225
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,711
[KEI]
Did you know?

226
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:01,049
The symbol of Mercury.
It's a two‐headed snake.

227
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:04,469
The snakes wrap in from both
sides of the central stave.

228
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,596
One decoy, one real.

229
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,016
[KEI]
The purpose of a side character,

230
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,936
is often to prepare the stage
for the main character.

231
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,358
That girl did everything she
could, and all for your sake.

232
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,444
But even if she were killed
by someone before her time,

233
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,654
she could be replaced.

234
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,615
[REN]
Shut up.

235
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,284
[KEI] Of course, I'm sure
you already knew all this.

236
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,621
Isn't that why you
subconsciously chased after her?

237
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,874
That was how Bey and Malleus
got their hands on you.

238
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,461
Now, there's one question
I don't have an answer to.

239
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,962
[REN gasps]

240
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,714
[KEI] Your little friend that
you were with that night.

241
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,801
If she'd been caught and killed,
what would you have done?

242
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,221
I told you to shut up!
What are you even talking about?

243
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,514
I don't know what you're‐‐

244
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,601
[KEI] Stop lying.
We both know the truth.

245
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,687
We have arrived. And we're
prepared for total war.

246
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,315
I'd gain some power soon,
if I were you.

247
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,777
[KEI] Or else the
game can't begin.

248
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,029
Then everything she's
done will be for naught.

249
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,031
[REN gasps]

250
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,159
I want to help you out
in any way I can, Ren.

251
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,083
[KASUMI] So, is there anything I
can do for you? Anything at all.

252
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,211
[REN gasps]

253
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,589
[KEI]
Very well. I'll be watching.

254
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,465
Do your best.

255
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,342
[REN gasps]

[phone rings]

259
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,860
What the hell is going on?

00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,236
[gasps]

[REN gasps]

262
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:54,871
[KASUMI sighs]
Ren. You're here.

263
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,417
Kasumi. What're you
doing here, you idiot?

264
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,627
[KASUMI RECORDING]
Hey‐a! This is Kasumi!

265
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,005
I'm a bit busy at the moment,
but if you need something,

266
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,465
please leave a message!

267
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,385
[REN]
This can't be right.

268
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,804
Did you do all of
this because of me?

269
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,182
Then this isn't
your fault at all!

270
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,019
[REN] I won't let anyone
blame you for this!

271
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,396
I can vouch for you!

272
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,858
You aren't the kind of person
who's even capable of this!

273
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,069
[REN]
So let's just go home.

274
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,906
And we'll be done with it,
like it's a bad dream.

275
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,872
[MERCURIUS] Rejoice, for
this merely marks the ending

276
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,457
of the prologue.

277
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,176
[MERCURIUS] An opera,
offered up unto my dear friend,

278
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,136
and my beloved goddess.

279
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,764
Sing, dear child, for you are
the featured player in this

280
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,516
season's company.

281
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,310
I know all that was, is,
and shall come to pass.

282
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,896
My universe eternally
and equally repeating.

283
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,689
A perpetually recurring cycle.

284
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,943
Déjà vu crashing like waves
on an infinite ocean.

285
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,737
All I yearn for is
an unknown moment.

286
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,948
Grant me the salvation
of a grand finale

287
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,824
I have not foreseen.

288
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,034
This is the one opera

289
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,246
that you were always
destined to sing, child.

290
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,546
For you know that what has been
lost can never be regained,

291
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:30,049
and no amount of wishing
will change that.

292
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,552
[REN]
I've heard enough!

293
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:37,723
[REN groans]

294
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,977
I haven't lost anything yet
that I can't still save!

295
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,563
I'll protect it all,
starting now!

296
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,108
Just don't drag people that
aren't involved into this!

297
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,068
But I am involved.

298
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:53,322
Why would you say something
so insensitive? I hate it.

299
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,324
You really hurt my feelings.

300
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,867
So what?

301
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:00,663
Am I really that oblivious about
everything that's happening?

302
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,081
Have I been getting
in your way,

303
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,542
or pulling your attention from
more important things?

304
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,462
Am I totally useless as
far as you're concerned?

305
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,173
Well? Do you honestly believe
I can't do anything?

306
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,842
There's got to be
something I can do

307
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,761
to prove how helpful I can be!

308
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:20,391
It's beyond frustrating.
It makes me feel so small.

309
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,310
So I did what I could.

310
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:26,564
Did my best. My best.
To help you.

311
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,275
But it was such a tough job,
I didn't know where to start.

312
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,194
I was completely clueless.

313
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,281
And then I focused on
it as hard as I could.

314

[REN grunts]

315
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,367
[KASUMI]
And this.

316
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,746
This seemed like the
best way for me to help.

317

[grunts]

318

[KASUMI]
Are you proud?

319
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,587
I really hope I can
help you out again soon.

[REN shouts]

321
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,511
You drained it. But why, Ren?

322
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,639
You should know that by now!

323
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,893
[REN]
Because I care,

324
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,188
and I don't want you to have
to keep doing this any longer!

325
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,859
This thing belongs
to me, Kasumi.

326
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:15,279
So it responds to my words
before anyone else, even you.

327
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,574
Though, it seems to have the
wrong idea about what I want.

328
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,035
But you don't need it
to be useful to me,

329
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,412
you're always helping me out!

330
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,709
[REN] Without you. I would have
come unglued a long time ago.

331
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,088
[REN]
That's why...

332
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,757
...I need you to stay where
things are still bright.

333
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,303
Or else, I'm afraid I might
get lost in the dark.

334
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,722
And I apologize for
being so selfish,

335
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,974
but I promise that
I'll come back for you.

336
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,142
So wait for me.

Ren.

[KASUMI]
You're right about one thing.

340
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,409
You are totally selfish.

341
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,828
And yet, I stick by your side.

00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,497
I must be a special
kind of idiot.

[VALERIA gasps]
Could this be?

[chuckles] This pain
I feel. It's delectable!

I can sense Lord
Heydrich is nearby.

Ja. Only seven others remain.

Und what of the
investigation I requested?

351
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,541
Is it complete, Spinne?

00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,211
Indeed, und the findings were
precisely as you expected.

Johann's alive, und he's close.

Very close.

Is that so? How marvelous!
Of course, now I see it!

The vice commander's
approach is truly inspired!

Then, that's it.

I'll need to hurry to set
my next move in action.

I'm going head to head
against the mind of a devil.

Well, from my perspective,

you aren't that far from
being a devil yourself.

Get some rest, Kasumi.
I'll take it from here.
