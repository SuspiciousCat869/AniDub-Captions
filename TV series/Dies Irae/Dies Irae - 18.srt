center of the world!

The stage is set! Let's perform
the final act of this opera!

5
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,981
You just want to steal
the souls of innocents!

6
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,527
That's your only
true desire, isn't it?

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,490
[REINHARD] Ja. Their passions.
Love, hatred, und anguish.

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,535
A small taste leaves
me wanting more.

9
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:38,288
So many lives playing
out for our pleasure.

10
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:42,584
There are those who fear me,
those who worship me,

11
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,879
und those who want me to grant
them what they have lost.

12
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:54,096
Those wretched souls.
They are the greatest offering.

13
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,098
You've fed on them for too long!

[KARL] Think of emanation
as a work of art.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,443
One which uses all that
exists as its canvas.

18
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,238
The colors are entirely
of the artist's choosing.

19
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,699
Once it has begun,
it cannot be stopped.

20
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,076
It cannot remain unfinished.

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,581
Und when the artwork is
completed, it cannot be undone.

22
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:24,293
However, it can be repainted
by another artist.

23
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:29,423
Ja. Therein lies
the eternal conflict.

24
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:34,177
These forceful brush strokes!
Layering upon the former's work.

25
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,764
The frame may not
withstand such intensity!

You wished for time to stop?

36

However. You understand
what's happening.

37

We are on the same level.
Both performing an Emanation.

38
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,123
[REN] Yeah, I realize that,
but it also means...

39
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,502
...everything that
you do, I can undo.

40
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,174
You would revive
them over and over.

41
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,385
Bring them back only to die.

42
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,720
Your Valhalla is just
a city full of corpses,

43
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:03,100
suffering for eternity!
You've turned them into slaves!

It's over! I refuse to
let it happen again!

[REINHARD chuckles]

46

[REINHARD] The rejection of what
one chooses not to believe

47
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:18,699
is one of man's greatest sins.
An indelible stain on humankind.

48
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,826
Your refusal means nothing!

War's engrained in us,
not something you can escape.

cannot be avoided

[REINHARD] So many experience
life as a slow march to death.

They simply do what
existence requires.

all been waiting for!

This is the last

but it will be
followed by another!

159
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,121
I did see Isaak shatter.
But your battle was so

160
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:49,792
incredible it tore a hole
through the fabric of existence.

161
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,669
If she survived that,

162
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,839
then she's likely somewhere
in the outer reaches.

163
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:58,009
Far enough to remain safe,
if she stays there.

164
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,219
You're sure of that?

165
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,555
Ja. As long as you
ask nothing of her.

166
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,640
[REN grunts]

167
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:12,315
Please don't leave me!
I'll go with you.

168
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,234
No. You need to stay here.

169
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,777
Please Ren!

170
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,451
[MARIE gasps]

171
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,635
[REINHARD] You've said
your goodbyes, then?

172
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,011
[REN]
Yeah.

173
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,305
An idiot like me doesn't
belong in a place like this.

174
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,184
Ah. Then you und Karl
are of the same mind?

175
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,478
Guess you could say that.
The ones who reached

176
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,856
the emanation level
were me, you, Mercurius,

177
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,485
and Marie. That makes
for quite the quartet.

178
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,320
But only one of us
can stay here.

179
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,572
That's how it
plays out, isn't it?

180
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:06,244
Indeed. There cannot be multiple
rulers at the same time.

181
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,329
A single artist will
choose the colors.

182
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,707
They alone will paint
the new world.

183
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,336
Karl's time is up. He's more
than ready to drift into death.

184
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,299
[REN] Whatever happens to him,
I can't let you take his place.

185
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,384
Und you don't want the honor?

186
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,096
No. I am not worthy of that.

187
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,098
What I really want is for
everything except me

188
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,392
and my friends to freeze.

189
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,186
Not a great world
for everyone else.

190
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,314
I'm no better than you.

191
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:38,484
I'm just another selfish
idiot and troublemaker.

192
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:43,323
Do I deserve to
be a god? No way.

193
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,116
[REINHARD]
Very well then.

194
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,453
I've found there are two types
of strength in this world.

195
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:52,165
One for one's own sake und
one for the sake of others.

196
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,875
Neither is better or worse.

197
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,878
If there is a difference,
it is our faith.

198
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,505
If you wish to be the
knight to our new queen,

199
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,258
this will be the first
test of your loyalty.

200
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,179
I shall destroy you with the
utmost respect in my heart.

201
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,388
Come!

202
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:22,236
[REN] Marie. Please forgive me.
I'm sorry for making you cry.

203
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,407
For leaving you behind. I'm sure
you're disappointed in me,

204
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,493
but I did what I had
to do to protect you.

205
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,203
It was my only choice!

206
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,625
[KARL] I've fallen madly
in love with you.

207
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,212
I kneel down before you
in absolute adoration.

208
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,589
Sweet flower.

209
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,551
[MARIE] What you're saying is,
I should be as you are.

210
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:49,347
In a way, but,
do as you see fit.

211
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,226
Those men have strong desires,
full of nothing but problems.

212
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,062
One wishing for a
world ruled by war,

213
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,107
the other wanting time
itself to fall static.

214
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,692
Neither would be suitable
for humankind.

215
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,946
I can't, because my
heart belongs to Ren.

216
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,907
Does it? Und you're
solely devoted to him?

217
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,951
We're together!

218
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:14,205
So, what flows from me, is the
same as what flows from him.

219
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,875
We shared our hearts.
We laughed and cried together.

220
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,086
We fought by each other's side.

221
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,546
We loved!

222
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,757
[MARIE sobs]

223
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,343
[MARIE]
These feelings are so important.

224
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,679
I know he would say
the same thing.

225
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,557
[KARL] You believe that he
understands your feelings.

226
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,436
I know he can be such
a fool sometimes!

227
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,438
He loves to show off and brag.

228
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,190
He says he understands when
he really doesn't at all.

229
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,277
But he can't help it. He doesn't
want anyone to doubt him!

230
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,904
So he pretends, and it's stupid.

231
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,325
Somehow it makes
me love him more.

232
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,744
So you can tell me
whatever you want,

233
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,747
it won't change my
feelings for him.

234
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,249
[KARL]
Hm.

235
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,586
Let's assume that you know
his heart as well as you say.

236
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,922
How do you plan to live in
the world which he creates?

237
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,216
A world frozen in time.

238
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,302
The two of you living forever,

239
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,637
und everyone else
not living at all.

240
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:16,559
[MARIE] I... Can't things
just stay as they are?

241
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,560
[KARL]
They cannot.

242
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,062
[MARIE gasps]

243
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,440
[KARL]
I won't accept that outcome.

244
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,318
For if you were to make the
choice for continuation,

245
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,945
my old friend would
surely kill you.

246
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,199
There would be no future.

247
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,618
[MARIE gasps]
What do you mean?

248
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,203
How can you say that?

249
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,789
I swore that one day I
would truly let you bloom.

250
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:42,460
But first I would have to set
you free, my sweet flower.

251
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,045
Beautiful goddess.

252
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,381
I fell madly in love with
your soul, Marguerite.

253
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,301
At this moment,
your desire is clear.

254
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,515
You wish to hold me in
your arms, don't you?

255
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,563
[ERI]
Rea. Hey, Rea.

256
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:06,067
[SHIROU] I'm sorry, but we're
gonna need to tag you in.

257
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,371
Und victory, is mine.

258
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,707
[REN yells]

259
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,751
[REINHARD] You have been
a worthy adversary.

260
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,547
But in the end, my desires
proved to be stronger.

261
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,299
They simply overpowered
your faith.

262
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,760
Und now I shall take
the gold I longed for.

263
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,262
[REN yells]

264
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:38,599
The entirety. All that exists,
shall be mine.

265
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:43,271
[REN grunts] No. Never.
I'll never let that happen.

266
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:47,024
I'll do whatever it takes.
I can't let you win.

267
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,818
[SHIROU]
Some hero line.

268
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,444
[ERI]
It's not bad.

269
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,446
[KEI]
You can do better though.

270
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,700
[REA] Please don't die, Fujii.
You have to live.

271
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,081
[REINHARD]
Impossible.

272
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:06,085
This is her. Theresia.

273
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,764
O‐kay.

274
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:33,321
[REINHARD groans]

275
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,073
[REA]
What got you in the end,

276
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,410
was the way that
you treated Isaak.

277
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,288
You left your son
frightened and all alone.

278
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,040
That's the only reason
I could do this.

279
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,207
[REINHARD gasps]

280
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,086
[REA] No matter how many
souls you collected.

281
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,256
How many millions
you took with you.

282
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,842
When it came down to it,
you had no one.

283
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,762
You were alone. And you lost.

284
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,434
[REINHARD chuckles]
Now come beautiful death.

285
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,686
Behold the glorious unknown.

286
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,356
[laughs]

287
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:16,072
[MARIE gasps]

288
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:24,705
I do want to hold you.
<i>Oui</i> . It's true.

289
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,959
But I love Ren
with all my being!

290
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,884
And I know it's wrong
to commit adultery.

291
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:46,394
Wait. That's him! Ren!

292
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:53,943
[laughs]

293
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,613
The unknown. This is it!

294
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:02,660
[laughs]

295
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:12,545
[REN pants, grunts]

296
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,963
[REN]
I won.

297
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:24,640
[REN] Shirou. Honjou.
Sakurai. Rea. Kasumi.

298
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,729
[REN] It's all because
of you. Thank you.

299
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,816
[REINHARD]
Why do you cry?

300
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:40,406
[REINHARD] You've claimed
victory. Take pride in it.

301
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,908
Allow me that in my defeat.

302
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,119
I simply couldn't
bear losing to someone

303
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,955
who shrank away from triumph.

304
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,208
Und I don't believe you
were alone in your fight.

305
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:55,629
No. I wasn't alone.
I had my friends

306
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,467
and the strength of those hoping
for a new world on my side.

307
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,304
[REINHARD] Well then. You have
the pride of the righteous.

308
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,140
Blessings unto you. Farewell.

309
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,750
[KEI]
So uh. How is she doing?

310
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,669
[ERI] Well, I mean.
She's getting really old.

311
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,713
And nobody can live forever.

312
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,549
[ERI] Look. I know you're
worried about Ms. Kasumi,

313
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,760
but she's still got
some life in her.

I'm glad to hear it.

315
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,889
[SHIROU] Wouldn't be surprised
if the ol' battleaxe outlives

316
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,349
all of us.

Ah. It's been a long time.
I hope you're doing well

What about you? All good?

[KASUMI]
Nothing worth complaining about.

320
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,959
So, tell me what brings
you here today.

321
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,794
I've spent more years
than I should have

322
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,421
worrying half to
death about you.

323
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:25,839
And to this very day,

324
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,134
you've never told me what
really happened back then.

325
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:36,100
Ah. Sorry. Forget it.
I understand how you feel.

[KASUMI]
Anyway, I've been thinking a lot

327
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,773
about something lately.

328
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,525
Reincarnation.

329
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:48,278
I'm actually starting to
believe that it really happens.

330
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,032
[REN]
Yeah. I believe in it, too.

331
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,867
Without a doubt.

[MARIE] Hey there Kasumi!
It's me! You see?

333
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,706
These flowers are so pretty!
