00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,148
horrible influence on our
impressionable new friend.

158
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,567
You can shut up!
Now let's get back to it.

159
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:14,114
We're spending today
helping her! Okay?

[REN sighs]

163

[REN] Somehow, that doesn't
happen whenever I'm with her.

164
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,213
What is it that lets me be able
to touch her in the first place?

Hey, Ren! Let's go!

167
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,431
Yeah.

00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,406
[inaudible]

Oh, man. I couldn't
eat another bite.

170
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,813
[REN] Okay. Sorry for
making you wait.

171
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,648
I hope all that stuff
we did today didn't

172
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,025

[MARIE]
Mm‐mm.

174
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,905
Well that's good. It ended
up being a really fun.

175
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,365
The entire day was
huge surprise for me.

176
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,410
Actually, I haven't had a day
this good in a long time.

177
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,037
So, thank you.

[MARIE grunts]

179
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,750
You're pretty strange,
huh, Marie?

180
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,336
But I hope you understand,
If people find out you're

181
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,463
staying with me, they might
start to think we're‐‐

182
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,717
It's okay. That was the promise
from the very beginning.

183
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,637
I know, because Cagliostro
said so.

184
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,307
I want to stay
with you, Ren. Truly.

Say, do you mind telling me
a little bit more about that

187
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,773
Cagliostro guy you mentioned?

188
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,025
[ERI] Hi! I'm sorry
to interrupt, you look busy,

[REN, MARIE gasp]

190
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,362
Could we talk for
just a second?

191
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,697
Who in the hell are you?

192
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:23,159
Name's Eri Honjou.
Shirou sent me here.

193
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,327
He wants to see you.

Will you please follow me?

196
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,422
[VALERIA] As you can see,
all is proceeding as planned.

197
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:40,301
I will see to everything you
leave in my care. Farewell.

198
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,185

Was there something else, sir?

199
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,606
Lord Heydrich, you cannot mean,
are you certain?

00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,045
Alright kids. Come on down.

204
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,684
Let me be the first to welcome
you to the depths of our

[gasps]

207
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,939
Shirou's been hanging
around down here with me

208
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,984
ever since the two of you
had that little scuffle.

209
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,239
[SHIROU]
Hey, it's been a while.

210
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,199
[REN grunts]

211
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,286
Knowing you, I'm sure there's a
lot you'd like to say right now.

212
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,996
But why don't we get
the pleasantries

213
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,248
out of the way first, old buddy.

214
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,459
Glad to see that
you're doing well.

215
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,544
Glad to see you're
the cocky dumbass

216
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,504
you always wanted to be.

217
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,257
[SHIROU] Don't be so harsh!
You still pissed off about that?

218
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,259
You're outta the hospital,
aren't ya?

219
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,512
And it isn't like I did
any permanent damage to ya.

220
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,390
How about we relax and
let bygones be bygones?

221
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,559
And although I didn't bring you
down here to show off our

222
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:15,396
new girlfriends, I gotta say,
she's a real cutie.

223
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,023
Where'd you find her?

224
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,775
Don't pretend you don't
know the answer to that.

225
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,193
[chuckles]

226
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,153
If I'm being perfectly frank,

227
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,781
a lot of strange things have
happened recently. You're aware.

228
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,241
You've been watching
the whole time, right?

229
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,660
[SHIROU]
No, not at the very beginning.

230
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,246
Just a little the last few days,

231
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,207
but I'd heard what
you'd been up to.

232
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,918
Hell, I've even been
backing you up!

233
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,503
When Kasumi was
covered in blood,

234
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,755
and you had to
carry her home?

235
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,716
It's pretty lucky you didn't
run into anyone, isn't it?

236
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,010
That assignment was a real
headache from the start,

237
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,930
and all this jerk ever does
is bark out orders to me!

238
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,348
I'm the one who
does all the work.

239
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,475
So what's your game?

240
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,268
Don't try telling me
you're doing this

241
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,062
because you're the
sentimental type.

242
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,689
[SHIROU]
Ha! How cynical!

243
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,651
But you are beginning
to catch on now, at least!

244
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,529
Look, you and I had a little
disagreement didn't we?

245
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,906
Unfortunately we never
settled the score.

246
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,491
But I think I've may
have figured out

247
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,284
just how we can accomplish that.

248
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,078
[REN] Weren't you the one
who said we should let

249
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,913
bygones be bygones?

250
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,124
[SHIROU] This is a completely
different situation.

251
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,501
I just wouldn't feel right
leaving it unfinished.

252
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,961
I'm gonna stop beating
around the bush

253
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,838
and be straight with ya.

254
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,424
We want to play a part in this
mess you're caught up in.

255
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,384
And whoever's still
standing at the end,

256
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,094
will be the official
winner of our fight.

257
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,639
Are you really that dumb?
We're done here.

258
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,975
If that's all you wanted to say,
you've wasted our time.

259
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,268
You aren't leaving yet.

260

[ERI]
Just so you know,

262
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,730
we've been dealing with these
freaks of nature and their magic

263
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,566
a lot longer than you have.

264
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,943
And now they seem to want
something from both of you.

He's had the occasional
run‐in with them

266
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,780
ever since he snuck
out of the hospital.

267

/Personally, I've spent the
better part of ten years

268
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,909
planning to stop them.

269
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,454
It was a family tradition
started by my grandfather.

270
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,331
All these murders in town
are a sign that they're back.

271
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,292
[grunts]

272
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,461
So you aren't the only one who's
rumbled with those monsters.

273
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,171
We got our asses stomped.

274
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,464
But we're still alive.

275
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,840
[REN gasps]

276
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,925
[ERI]
To boil it all down, Ren,

277
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,387
we're trying to say that we'd
be useful allies to you.

278
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,264
Besides, there's still
so much that you

279
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,974
don't have a clue
about, isn't there?

280
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,018
For instance, details.

281
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,479
We know about the
Longinus Dreiztehn Orden.

282
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,190
[SHIROU]
They're super‐wanted fugitives.

283
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,858
As bad as bad can get.

284
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,152
If we were to take
out just one of them,

285
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,489
we could earn enough money
to party for seven lifetimes!

286
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,200
The money? Is that what
you're thinking about?

287
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,953
This isn't a dust‐up
between rival gangs!

288
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,706
[ERI] The money was merely
meant as an example.

289
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,584
[ERI] We aren't going to pretend
that it isn't part of it for us,

290
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,961
but we know they're as
dangerous as a den of vipers.

291
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,964
And they're here now,
slithering around in our city.

292
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,466
Just awful, isn't it?

293
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,259
Which is why those
of us who live here

294
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,220
need to ask them politely,
but firmly, to leave.

295
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,971
In other words,

296
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,849
I think we feel the same
way about them as you do.

297
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,895
[REN] I can do something about
them, but neither of you can.

298
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,855
We'd only die, at worst.

299
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:06,859
[REN] That's right! And I refuse
to help you commit suicide!

[MARIE grunts]

301
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,112
[SHIROU]
Now I get it.

302
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,948
You're different because
you've got a trump card

303
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,742
hidden up your sleeve,
that's all that is.

304
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,827
You can fight because of her.

305
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,122
That's the real difference
between you and us, right?

306
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,458
I might not know
all the details,

307
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,044
but I think I get
the basic idea.

308
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,549
[SHIROU] In exchange for
the intel we just gave you,

309

any chance you might fill

I'm sorry.

He backed out of our agreement.

That's why I couldn't bring
myself to forgive him.

But, if I'm being honest,

my secret to come out.

What just happened
is a perfect example.

342
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,899
It's sort of like
looking over the edge

343

up hating myself.

But he's your friend?

Yeah, but I'm not sure why.
Maybe there's some part of me

that wants to be a
little more like him.

Deep down, maybe I wanna
spiral into self destruction.
