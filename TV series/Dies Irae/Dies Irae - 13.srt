What could be a more
extraordinary circumstance,

the closer you are to
the very root of God.

22
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,485
Creation seems liberating,

what you create.

Und, thus all things
began to flow from him.

in such a manner, did they not?

29
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:09,004
Primary among them is one which
I call "Eternal Recurrence".

30

An existence where everything
repeats in an unending cycle.

sense of déjà vu?

I can assume the only way
to finally be rid of it,

00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,064

from his throne.

This is the same way in which
the current God of our world

He destroyed his predecessor

God himself can be replaced.

myself and all the people

312
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,893
I've encountered
throughout my life.

313
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:08,272
Now I see. I understand what
Cagliostro told me before.

314
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,401
This world we live in is
constantly repeating itself,

315
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,071
over and over again
with no sign of stopping.

316
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,489
Instead of death being the end,

317
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,783
I'll simply return to
my mother's belly.

318
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:23,663
To be born and live the exact
same life as I did before.

319
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,666
But if that's true,
I don't belong as I am.

320
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,335
Ghosts cannot exist
in this world,

321
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,046
so I feel out of
place and crazy.

322
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,591
[MARIE whimpers]
What am I?

323
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,638
There are two big parts of
my life I can't talk about.

324
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,516
The first is all these memories
that I can't explain.

325
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,768
I guess they're from
my previous life.

326
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,105
I remember a "me" who's
different from who I am now.

327
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,066
Someone who lived and
died in a different time.

328
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,110
It gets pretty hazy at the end,

329
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,363
but I know it's more
than just a dream.

330
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,783
And if it's real, then I'm
just as crazy as you are.

331
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,786
I'm breaking the rules of
this world the same way.

332
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,746
[MARIE gasps]
You're different, Ren!

333
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,456
It's true you may
be a bit crazy,

334
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,376
but there's nothing
wrong with who you are!

335
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,753
There's something about
your soul that's beautiful.

336
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,339
Spending time with you
makes me so happy!

337
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,800
I'd stay with you for
eternity if I could.

338
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,721
But I'm afraid that if I were to
stay, it would be bad for you.

339
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,973
I'd get in your way.

[REN] The second secret I
carry with me. It's bad.

341
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,728
When I was a little boy,

342
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,021
I saw somebody get killed
right before my very eyes

343
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,649
and that image has haunted
me ever since that day.

344
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,693
I can never say
anything about it,

345
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,863
because if I were to let
it out, it would hurt Kasumi.

346
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,574
It makes me feel like
such a damn coward.

347
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,075
To be perfectly frank,

348
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,493
even though they
weren't a good person,

349
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,162
sometimes I wish
they'd come back

350
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,623
so I wouldn't have
to keep lying.

351
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:53,502
But I know that's
not right either.

352

Uh, I suppose what I'm
really trying to say...

And I'm glad that I have
you right here by my side.

Meeting you's changed my life.
It's a wonderful thing.

358
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,104
[MARIE gasps] So the fact
that I'm not a normal girl

359
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,939
actually makes you happy?

360
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,317
You're saying you
like that about me?

361
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,906
[MARIE] You are strange.
I can't deny that about you.

362
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,491
But still, in my heart,

363
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,368
I feel as though I'm nothing
more than a burden.

364
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,787
Because of me,

365
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,456
you've been in too many
dangerous and scary situations.

366
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,793
I know all of it's caused you
so much pain and suffering.

367
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,711
I'd be crying if I were you.

368
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,048
But through all of this,
you've never complained.

Tell me why..w hy are you always
so sweet and kind to me?

A fair question. And normally,

I would be complaining
a little bit, at least.

Of course.

made me finally realize.

[REN]
As long as I can remember,

380

I've always wondered how
I could atone for my sins.

You've given me the answer
I was looking for.

382
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,555
It's not for the dead
to come back to life.

383
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,850
Or to repeat the same
thing for the rest of time.

There's a way to do it that's
only possible because I met you.

reason I was put on this earth
