1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:11,041
- SO WHY'D YOU WANNA TALK?
- SEEMS I HAVE A NEW RIVAL.

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,166
H.Q. INTEL COULDN'T TURN UP
ANYTHING FOR ME,

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,333
SO I'M DIGGING MYSELF.

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,958
OUR COMPETITION
IS THE SECRET ARM

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,458
OF JAPAN'S DEFENSE
INTELLIGENCE HEADQUARTERS,

6
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,500
A SPECIAL RESEARCH UNIT
FOR THE FORMER JOINT STAFF,

7
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,708
ALSO KNOWN AS THE S.R. UNIT.

8
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,250
AND THEIR DIRECTOR
IS YOSUKE HINOKI.

9
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,166
IT'S YOUR OLD CREW, TOJO.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,875
- ( theme music playing )


11
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,208
- Kasper:
'COURSE, YOU KNOW A LOT MORE

12
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,791
ABOUT THE D.I.H. THAN I DO.

13
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:15,333
SO THIS HINOKI ISN'T MUCH MORE
THAN A PHOTO TO ME.

14
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,000
I'VE GOT A STRONG SUSPICION

15
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,875
THEY'RE THE GHOSTS
WHO'VE BEEN HAUNTING ME

16
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,708
AND WHO'VE BEEN CAUSING
ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE

17
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,583
WITH MY OPERATIONS
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.

18
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,416
BUT I'D LIKE CONFIRMATION.

19
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,250
YOU WERE AN S.R. OFFICER.
CAN YOU TELL ME IT'S THEM?

20
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,500
- THIS SOUNDS MORE LIKE A FAVOR
THAN A COMMAND, KASPER.

21
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,458
I'M CONFUSED.

22
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,500
- GRANTED, I USED TO BE
YOUR BOSS, TOJO,

23
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,500
BUT I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO EXPLOIT THAT.

24
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,250
I'VE JUST GOT A JOB.

25
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,416
AND YOU'RE THE BEST MAN
TO HANDLE IT.

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,166
ACTUALLY,
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE INTO THIS,

27
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,000
THE WAY YOU LIKE TO WORK.

28
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,333
YOU'D ALWAYS SAY
HOW YOU HATED MY METHODS,

29
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,833
AS YOU BOUNCED FROM JOB TO JOB,
WHEREVER THE WIND BLEW.

30
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,875
WELL, PAL, THINK OF THIS
AS A GENTLE SPRING BREEZE,

31
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,791
BLOWING YOU BACK TO OLD TIMES.

32
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,625
WE CAN NEVER TRULY ESCAPE
THE CHAINS OF OUR PAST, CAN WE?

33
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,833
- THIS DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

34
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,291
WHY ARE YOU TAKING
THE S.R. UNIT SO LIGHTLY?

35
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,791
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE THEY'RE AN EASY WIN.

36
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,916
KNOWING YOU, YOU ALREADY
PICKED A FIGHT WITH THEM

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,916
AND NOW YOU WANT US
TO DO THE CLEANUP.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,333
WIPE YOUR OWN ASS.
- I DIDN'T PICK ANYTHING.

39
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,541
I'VE SIMPLY
ACCEPTED A CHALLENGE.

40
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,916
AN INVISIBLE MAN
TRIED TO STRANGLE ME,

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,458
SO I DID WHAT'S NATURAL--
I SWUNG MY FISTS.

42
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,416
AND IF I WAS TAKING
THIS LIGHTLY,

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,666
I WOULDN'T BE COMING TO YOU.

44
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,916
YOU CAN SAY
YOU DON'T LIKE IT, KOKO,

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,666
BUT I KNOW YOU'LL HELP.

46
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,666
- PLEASE.
"AN INVISIBLE MAN?"

47
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,166
IF YOU WANT TO DISCUSS BUSINESS,
THEN SPARE ME THE HYPERBOLE.

48
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,208
- SO LET'S SAY
I DO PROVE THEY'RE BEHIND THIS.

49
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:40,041
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO TO THEM?
- CRUSH THEM, OBVIOUSLY.

50
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,625
I'M HOPING YOU'LL MAKE
THESE GHOSTS EASIER TO SEE

51
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,625
WHEN IT'S TIME
FOR THE CROSSHAIRS.

52
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:45,958
- THERE HE IS.

53
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,125
THE MAN WHO LIVES
FOR DESTRUCTION.

54
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,166
YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.
AND HE WON'T EITHER.

55
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,083
HINOKI'S AS STEADFAST
AS TWO TONS OF SOLID ROCK.

56
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,583
THIS OPERATION WON'T RUN
AS SMOOTHLY AS YOU THINK.

57
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,666
- ( laughs )
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

58
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,541
YOU MUST'VE BEEN A VERY TALENTED
OPERATIVE FOR THE S.R. UNIT.

59
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,291
BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME
WHEN YOU LEFT,

60
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,833
THEY WEREN'T EVEN AFFECTED?

61
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,916
TRUE-- A MAN
CAN'T BE CHANGED SO EASILY.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,166
BUT A GROUP
IS A DIFFERENT STORY.

63
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,916
THE AGENCY COLONEL
HINOKI IS WORKING

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,666
SO HARD TO KEEP STRONG.

65
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,625
MAY BE A CASTLE
BUILT OUT OF SAND.

66
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:28,916
- TALKS HIS HEAD OFF,

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,291
THEN JUMPS RIGHT
BACK ON A PLANE.

68
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,958
- THE S.R. UNIT'S STRONGHOLD.

69
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,416
IT'S AN OLD DUMMY CORPORATION
BASED IN JAKARTA.

70
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,250
KASPER WANTS TO GO THERE
TO DISTRACT THEM WHILE WE WORK.

71
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,000
- MM-HMM.

72
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,416
WE SIBLINGS
LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER.

73
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,333
HAVE EVER SINCE WE WERE LITTLE.
THAT'S HOW HE KNEW I'D HELP.

74
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,250
IF WE SUCCEED,

75
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,625
MY BROTHER CAN REGAIN HIS TRADE
ROUTES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.

76
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,916
THE BOATLOAD OF CASH
HE PROMISED WON'T HURT, EITHER.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,333
BUT THERE'S RISK.
YOU MAY HAVE TO FIGHT

78
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:59,500
AGAINST YOUR OLD TEAM AND BOSS.
YOU FEEL TORN ABOUT THAT?

79
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,375
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,416
HEY, DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE I'M A HEARTLESS BASTARD.

81
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,166
'CAUSE I'M NOT.  LOOK,
I CAN'T DRIVE MYSELF CRAZY.

82
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,583
IT'S TRUE
HINOKI WAS MY MENTOR.

83
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,208
HE POUNDED ALL SORTS
OF INVALUABLE CRAP INTO MY SKULL

84
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,208
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG OFFICER.
I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT.

85
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,125
BUT I'M A PRO,
AND I WORK FOR YOU NOW.

86
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,125
IT'S JUST LIKE HINOKI
TAUGHT ME--

87
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,500
I CAN'T BEAT AN ELITE ADVERSARY
IF I LET FEELINGS GET INVOLVED.

88
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,291
BESIDES--

89
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,916
- NOBODY PUTS A MISERABLE LOOK
ON MY KOKO'S FACE!

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,833
- ( thinking ) MY NECK IS IN
HELL, BUT MY BACK'S IN HEAVEN.

91
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,833
WHAT A SLEEPER HOLD.

92
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,416
IT'S A BIG WORLD,

93
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,333
BUT KOKO'S UNIT
IS THE ONLY PLACE

94
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,291
I CAN EXPERIENCE
A MOVE LIKE THIS.

95
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,750
I'M SO LUCKY.
NO, WAIT, I CAN'T BREATHE.

96
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,333
UNCLE.  UNCLE!
I GIVE.

97
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,625
- OH, MAN.

98
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,875
TOJO REALLY PUT HIS FOOT
IN IT THIS TIME.

99
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,000
- Lehm: OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.
WE STILL THE NEED GUY.

100
00:05:56,291 --> 00:06:00,166
- ( vibrating )

101
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,416
- HMM.
DON'T RECOGNIZE THE NUMBER.

102
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,666
- Tojo: COLONEL HINOKI,
GOOD AFTERNOON.

103
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,333
I KNOW
THIS IS OUT OF THE BLUE,

104
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,166
BUT DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT
TO TALK?

105
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,708
IT'S AKIHIKO TOJO.
- HUH?

106
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,416
OH.  TOJO, WOW.

107
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,458
DIDN'T THINK
I'D HEAR YOUR VOICE TODAY.

108
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,625
IT'S BEEN AGES.
SO HOW ARE YOU?

109
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,416
I TAKE IT YOU'RE IN JAPAN?

110
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,416
HANG ON A MINUTE,
I'M DRIVING.

111
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,958
- OH, I'M SORRY.
I CAN CALL BACK LATER.

112
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,000
- NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMEWHERE

113
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,208
I CAN PULL OFF THIS STUPID
HIGHWAY FOR A MINUTE.

114
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,250
AH, SCREW IT,
I CAN TALK AND DRIVE.

115
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,166
I'VE DONE MORE DANGEROUS THINGS.
( laughs )

116
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,625
SO I GUESS THIS MEANS
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

117
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,708
- YUP, ALIVE AND KICKING.
I'M IN JAPAN FOR WORK.

118
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,750
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

119
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,541
- DON'T CHANGE WHAT'S WORKING,
RIGHT?

120
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,166
I'M IN GOOD HEALTH.

121
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,208
THOUGH I HAVE REACHED THAT AGE
WHERE I START PONDERING

122
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,166
THE HEAVY SHIT
MORE THAN I'D LIKE. ( laughs )

123
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,875
SO WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

124
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:55,958
HEARD YOU QUIT WORKING FOR
KASPER AT H.C.L.I. A WHILE BACK.

125
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,708
YOU STILL USING THE SKILLS
I TAUGHT YA?

126
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,708
I'D HATE TO THINK
I WASTED MY TIME.

127
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,583
- NO WORRIES THERE.
I DID QUIT WORKING UNDER KASPER,

128
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,708
BUT I'M STILL WITH H.C.L.I.

129
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,333
THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING,
ACTUALLY.

130
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,458
- OH? THEN MAYBE
WE SHOULD CUT TO THE CHASE.

131
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,500
- I'D LIKE YOU
TO PULL OUT OF THE CONFLICT

132
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,916
CONCERNING KASPER'S
SOUTHEAST ASIAN TRADE ROUTE.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,750
H.C.L.I. IS TAKING MEASURES
TO ELIMINATE THE S.R. UNIT.

134
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,750
- WELL,
ISN'T THAT INTERESTING?

135
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,166
AND HOW HAS KASPER
BEEN DESCRIBING US?

136
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,125
- HE'S CALLING YOU GHOSTS.

137
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,291
- THAT'S A PRETTY
DEAD-ON DESCRIPTION.

138
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,791
AN INVISIBLE FIST
LANDS THE MOST DAMAGING BLOW.

139
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,500
SO NOW YOU'VE GOT ME CURIOUS,
TOJO.

140
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,541
HOW DOES HE PLAN TO DEFEAT
A GHOST HE CAN'T SEE?

141
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,833
- WELL, A PERSON WHO'S SERVED
UNDER BOTH YOU AND KASPER

142
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,541
KNOWS HOW TO SEE THE GHOST.

143
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,958
THAT'S THE ROLE
I'VE BEEN GIVEN IN THIS DANCE.

144
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,916
- ( laughing ) HEY, IT'S NOISY
ON YOUR END. AT THE AIRPORT?

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,916
- I BEG YOUR PARDON?
- THIS CONVERSATION'S OVER.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,708
WE MAY NEED TO TALK AGAIN,

147
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,916
SO HOLD ON
TO THAT PRE-PAID PHONE.

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,916
- ( phone clicks )

149
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,458
- PHEW.

150
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,583
- AW, JEEZ.
YOU ACTUALLY SAID "PHEW."

151
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,541
MOST PEOPLE JUST EXHALE, TOJO.

152
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,083
- DAMN IT!
DON'T EAVESDROP, YOU OLD FART.

153
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,583
- I FIGURED YOU'D MAKE A BREAK
FOR THE NEAREST EXIT

154
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,250
AFTER GETTING PUT
IN AN AWKWARD SPOT LIKE THIS.

155
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:14,000
- YEAH, LIKE I'D EVER RUN.
IT'S A JOB, NOTHING MORE.

156
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,375
- ( laughing )

157
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,458
- YOUR SENSE OF
HUMOR'S MESSED UP.

158
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,250
- ( Hinoki laughing )

159
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,666
POOR KID. HE ALWAYS REVEALS
A LITTLE TOO MUCH

160
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,708
WHEN HE'S ANXIOUS
ABOUT A MISSION.

161
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,458
THAT HASN'T CHANGED.

162
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:32,083
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE HAD A GOOD LAUGH.

163
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,583
- Tojo: I FISHED AROUND.

164
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,291
LONG STORY SHORT, KOKO,
YOUR BROTHER'S RIGHT.

165
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,166
THE S.R. UNIT'S BEHIND THIS.

166
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,458
- THAT WAS SOME QUICK WORK.
WELL DONE.

167
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,833
FILL THE REST OF US IN
ON THE S.R. UNIT.

168
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,833
TRY AND KEEP IT SHORT AND SWEET
SO IT'S AT JONAH'S LEVEL.

169
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:50,250
- JONAH'S LEVEL?
( groans )

170
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,541
THEY'RE THE SELF-DEFENSE FORCE'S
SECRET TEAM.

171
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,500
MAIN FOCUS,
INTEL AND ESPIONAGE.

172
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,083
SIMPLY PUT, THEY'RE SPIES.

173
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,166
THEY WORKED
IN THE THICK OF THE COLD WAR

174
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,708
AT THE REQUEST OF THE D.I.A.--

175
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,541
AMERICA'S DEFENSE
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.

176
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,375
HISTORICALLY
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT

177
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,916
FOR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES
TO OPERATE IN JAPAN.

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,166
THE POLICE FORCE
HAS ALL OF THE POLITICAL POWER.

179
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,750
AND THE GOVERNMENT
HAS NEVER PRODUCED

180
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,375
CONSISTENT
INTERNATIONAL POLICY.

181
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,916
NOTHING STABLE.
IT'S TOUGH TO DO YOUR JOB

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,958
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE RULES ARE.

183
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,041
IN RECENT YEARS,
YOU COULD HARDLY CONSIDER

184
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,833
THE J.S.D.F.'S COUNTER
OR CENTRAL

185
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,166
INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONAL.

186
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,000
SINCE THE WAR, A NUMBER OF
AGENCIES HAVE SPRUNG UP,

187
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,541
BUT NONE OF THEM LASTED LONG.

188
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,166
THERE WAS ORGANIZATION F,
THE KAWABE AGENCY,

189
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,750
THE GROUND STAFF.
THEY ALL COLLAPSED.

190
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,833
VIETNAM
BROUGHT NEW OPPORTUNITY.

191
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,375
THERE WERE AREAS AMERICA
COULDN'T INFILTRATE,

192
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,958
BUT JAPAN COULD.

193
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,000
THE S.R. WAS ONE OF THE GROUPS
CREATED TO GATHER INTEL THERE.

194
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,625
THE ORIGINAL DIRECTOR
STATIONED THEIR BASE

195
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,041
IN JAKARTA, INDONESIA.

196
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,458
AND SELECTED 50 ELITE SOLDIERS
FROM THE ARMED FORCES

197
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,458
FOR HIS TEAM.

198
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,166
BUT LIKE THE GROUPS
BEFORE THEM,

199
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,291
THEY LACKED THE FUNDING
TO STAY AFLOAT.

200
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,708
AS A TOP-SECRET UNIT,
THEY COULDN'T EXACTLY MARCH

201
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,250
INTO THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE
AND DEMAND MORE MONEY.

202
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,875
SO THEY DEVISED A WAY
TO SUPPLEMENT THE S.R.'S BUDGET

203
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,541
BY MEDIATING ARMS DEALS
BETWEEN AMERICA AND THE J.S.D.F.

204
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,625
THE S.R. SET UP
A DUMMY CORPORATION,

205
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,458
GANVILLE TRADING,
AS THE FACE FOR THEIR DEALS.

206
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,041
EVEN AFTER VIETNAM,
THEY KEPT USING GANVILLE,

207
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,833
LIKE A PEA CRAB HIDING
IN ANOTHER CREATURE'S SHELL.

208
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,583
THEY THRIVED IN THE ARMS TRADE,
SEPARATE FROM JAPAN,

209
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:26,541
WHILE WAGING INFORMATION WARFARE
AGAINST COMMUNIST POWERS.

210
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,416
THEIR ARMS BUSINESS
WAS SO SUCCESSFUL,

211
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,416
THEIR S.R. BUDGET
BECAME UNNECESSARY.

212
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,041
THAT'S ABOUT THE TIME
THEY GOT THEIR FIFTH DIRECTOR,

213
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,541
COLONEL HINOKI,
MY OLD BOSS.

214
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,500
IN '97, THE D.I.H.,

215
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,500
JAPAN'S DEFENSE
INTELLIGENCE HEADQUARTERS,

216
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,666
UNDERWENT
SIGNIFICANT REORGANIZATION,

217
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,291
AND THE S.R. SLIPPED
EVEN DEEPER BETWEEN THE CRACKS.

218
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,166
WITH ITS BASE IN INDONESIA
AND ABILITY TO FUND ITSELF,

219
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,875
HIDING WASN'T HARD.

220
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,958
TODAY, ONLY A HANDFUL OF STAFF
AND ASSEMBLYMEN

221
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,333
EVEN KNOW IT EXISTS.
- ( yawns )

222
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,458
- IN SOUTHEAST ASIA'S
UNDERWORLD,

223
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,958
THE S.R. IS FREE TO EXERCISE ITS
OWN AUTHORITY IN IDEAL SECRECY.

224
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,333
WITH KASPER QUICKLY EXPANDING
H.C.L.I.'S INFLUENCE THERE,

225
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,958
CONFLICT WAS INEVITABLE.

226
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,250
AND NEITHER SIDE
WANTS TO BACK DOWN.

227
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,000
THE ECONOMIC, RELIGIOUS AND
CULTURAL TENSIONS IN THE REGION

228
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,500
CREATE A PERFECT CHAOS
FOR THE ARMS TRADE.

229
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,791
THERE'S SIMPLY TOO MUCH MONEY
AT STAKE.

230
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,250
- TELL US ABOUT HINOKI.
- HIS COVER IS THAT HE WORKS

231
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,750
AS THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
OF GANVILLE.

232
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,208
HE'S GOT A SHAM MARRIAGE
WITH SOME THAI WOMAN.

233
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,208
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW HOW
HE KEEPS ALL HIS LIES STRAIGHT.

234
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,291
THE TRUTH-- HE'S A WARRIOR
WITH A LONG MILITARY CAREER

235
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,833
WHO FOUND HIS GREAT PASSION
IN ESPIONAGE.

236
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,041
STARTED YOUNG--
JAPANESE ARMY.

237
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,083
HE STUDIED
AT THEIR UNIVERSITY.

238
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,000
TRAINED AS A RANGER
WITH THE WESTERN ARMY INFANTRY,

239
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,416
THEN ENROLLED IN COMMAND SCHOOL
AND BECAME AN OFFICER

240
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,750
IN THE AMERICAN DEFENSE
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.

241
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,666
HE WORKED HIS WAY
INTO THE S.R. UNIT,

242
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,583
AND QUICKLY
DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF THERE.

243
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,083
HE IMPRESSED THE AMERICANS

244
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,125
WHEN HE POSED
AS A JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN,

245
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,291
SMUGGLED HIMSELF
INTO AN IRANIAN FACTORY

246
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,541
FOR HIGHLY-ENRICHED URANIUM,

247
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,791
AND GATHERED INTEL
ON THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

248
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,791
HE WAS KNOWN AS
JAPAN'S ONE AND ONLY SPYMASTER.

249
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,083
WHEN IT COMES TO RUNNING
A SECRET UNIT,

250
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,541
HE'S OLD SCHOOL.

251
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,583
ONCE YOU'RE IN THE DARK,
YOU STAY THERE

252
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,708
AND DRAW YOUR TARGET
INTO THE SHADOWS.

253
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,125
HE'LL GO TO A LOT OF TROUBLE
TO KEEP THINGS NEAT AND QUIET.

254
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,458
AS I TOLD KOKO,
HE'S STEADFAST AS A ROCK,

255
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,250
AND WON'T DEVIATE
FROM HIS M.O.

256
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,666
HE WON'T ATTACK HEAD-ON.
SO WATCH YOUR BACK.

257
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,708
- SINCE WHEN DO I NOT?

258
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,708
SEEMS WE ACTUALLY
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON,

259
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,458
IT'S A SHAME
WE CAN'T GET ALONG.

260
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,375
OH, WELL, THAT'S LIFE.

261
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,875
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M LOOKING
TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS OR ANYTHING.

262
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,791
OH!

263
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,416
HE'S ASLEEP.
JONAH'S ASLEEP STANDING UP!

264
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,833
- Valmet: TO BE FAIR,
I ALMOST NODDED OFF MYSELF.

265
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,916
- Lutz: YEAH. DUDE, HOW WAS THAT
THE SHORT AND SWEET VERSION?

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
- ( Tojo laughs )

267
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,458
- Man:
KUROSAKA, YOU'RE UP NEXT.

268
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,833
YOU HAVE A REPORT
FROM THE SCENE

269
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,625
OF THE KORWIT NUALKHAIR
INCIDENT?

270
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,458
- Kurosaka: THE ROBBERY
HAPPENED DURING A BLACKOUT,

271
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,916
CAUSED BY A TYPHOON.

272
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,416
THE TARGET AND THREE OTHERS
WERE SHOT--

273
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,208
ONCE IN THE HEAD,
TWICE IN THE HEART.

274
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,250
I SAW PHOTOS OF THE BODIES,
AND THE EVIDENCE IS CONCLUSIVE.

275
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,041
THIS WAS A PROFESSIONAL JOB.

276
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,625
MOST LIKELY DONE BY--
- YEAH, IT WAS KASPER.

277
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,208
HIS SQUAD WAS BEHIND IT.

278
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,041
I'M SORRY
TO INTERRUPT YOUR REPORT.

279
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,041
- COLONEL?
- Man: WHAT DID YOU FIND, SIR?

280
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,083
- WHILE I WAS DRIVING,

281
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,500
I HEARD A CLEAR
ADMISSION OF GUILT.

282
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,125
NOT FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH
EXACTLY, BUT CLOSE ENOUGH.

283
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,125
- Man: MY GOD.
- Kurosaka: WHAT NOW, SIR?

284
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,375
- BASTARD'S GUNNING FOR US.
- PLEASE, WE'RE IN CONTROL.

285
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,666
IN RESPONSE,
I'VE INITIALIZED PLAN K,

286
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,375
BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO ALTER THE PLAN SIGNIFICANTLY.

287
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,125
OUR TARGET'S YOUNGER SISTER,
KOKO HEKMATYAR,

288
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,875
IS IN JAPAN WITH HER TEAM.

289
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,791
WE'LL CALL THIS OPERATION
DOUBLE K,

290
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,000
AND WE'RE MOVING
BEYOND COVERT OPS.

291
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,166
KOKO EMPLOYS HIGHLY
TRAINED MERCS

292
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,541
IN WAR ZONES ACROSS THE GLOBE.

293
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,916
THEY'RE EXPECTING US,
AND THEY KNOW HOW I THINK.

294
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,625
SO WE CONFUSE THEM.

295
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,875
OUR DAYS
AS THE FORGOTTEN UNIT ARE OVER.

296
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,833
WE'LL LAUNCH
A MULTI-PRONGED ATTACK,

297
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,291
FULL COMBAT SITUATIONS.
IT WILL GET MESSY.

298
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,291
- Both: YES, SIR.
WE HOPE IT DOES, SIR!

299
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,583
- I THOUGHT AS MUCH.

300
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,750
THANK YOU ALL
FOR BEING ON BOARD.

301
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,875
NOW LET'S CUT LOOSE.

302
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,625
- D.I.H.,

303
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,333
S.R. UNIT,

304
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,208
INVISIBLE GHOSTS AN' STUFF.

305
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,208
- KOKO,
IF YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP,

306
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,916
IT MIGHT BE EASIER
IF YOU CLIMB INTO BED FIRST.

307
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,166
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRINK
TO RELAX.

308
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,250
- WHAT?
JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE TALL,

309
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,333
YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
I CAN DRINK.

310
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,500
ACTUALLY I THINK
I'M GOOD AT IT.

311
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,291
AND BESIDES, WINE
TASTES, LIKE, AWESOME.

312
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,208
- OKAY, YOU'RE CUT OFF.
I KNOW YOU'RE A BADASS,

313
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,000
BUT YOU'VE STILL GOTTA
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

314
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,791
LET'S GET YOU A SHOWER.

315
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:34,250
WHAT?
WE SHOULD SHOWER TOGETHER?

316
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,125
IF YOU WANT TO.

317
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,541
I MEAN YOU'RE THE BOSS.
WHAT?!

318
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,250
WE SHOULD SHARE A BED
AFTERWARDS?

319
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,125
WELL, IT WOULD BE WARMER
THAT WAY.

320
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,791
AND A MASSAGE?!

321
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,250
SURE, I KNOW
ALL THE RIGHT TECHNIQUES.

322
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,791
YOU ARE IN GOOD HANDS, KOKO!
AND OTHER PARTS.

323
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,333
- IT'S CRAZY, JONAH.

324
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,000
THIS TRIP TO JAPAN
HAS ME FEELING NERVOUS

325
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,541
ONLY CARRYING A HANDGUN.

326
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,625
IT'S NOT SO EASY
TO PATROL AGAINST GHOSTS.

327
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,500
- LEHM SAID THIS COUNTRY'S SAFE.
I THINK PACKING HANDGUNS

328
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,458
IS ALL THE CRAZY
WE'RE GONNA NEED.

329
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:05,166
IF YOU ASK ME, KOKO'S THE
CRAZIEST PART OF THIS SITUATION,

330
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,625
MAKING SO MANY ENEMIES WE HAVE
TO BE ARMED TO THE TEETH

331
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,708
ALL THE TIME.

332
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,750
- IT DOES MAKE
FOR AN INTERESTING LIFE.

333
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,541
BUT WHEN YOU'RE WORKING
IN HELL,

334
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,916
YOU'RE BOUND
TO MEET A FEW DEVILS.

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,666
- WELL, KASPER MAY BE AN ASS,

336
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,333
BUT HE WOULDN'T BRING
HIS OWN SISTER HERE

337
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,833
IF HE DIDN'T THINK
WE WERE SAFE

338
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,291
WITH THE RESOURCES
AT OUR DISPOSAL.

339
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,458
HE KEPT HIS PROMISE,
SO I TRUST HIM.

340
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,875
- ( thinking ) IT'S FUNNY.
WHEN HE'S TALKING ABOUT KASPER,

341
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,333
SUDDENLY THE KID'S
A MOTOR-MOUTH.

342
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,750
- PLUS YOU SAID
THESE GUYS WORK IN THE SHADOWS,

343
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,708
SO THERE'S ZERO CHANCE
OF A SHOOTOUT.

344
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,083
- WELL YEAH, THOUGH I WOULDN'T
PUT ANYTHING AT ZERO.

345
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,541
- SEE? SO I CAN RELAX.

346
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,416
I WON'T EVEN HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THOSE KIDS.

347
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,750
- UH-HUH.

348
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,666
( thinking ) HE'S THINKING
MORE ABOUT THOSE KIDS

349
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,708
THAN HE LETS ON.

350
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,583
BUT MORE SHOCKINGLY,
I CAN'T BELIEVE

351
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,375
I MADE A BUSINESS DEAL
WITH KASPER.

352
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,083
- ( phone vibrating )

353
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,041
- YES?

354
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:55,375
RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND.
I'LL TELL HER FIRST THING.

355
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,791
- WE'RE GONNA LOOK
LIKE A GROUP OF BACKPACKERS,

356
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,125
JUST WITH A FEW
TOO MANY BATTLE SCARS.

357
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,666
- ( Koko laughing )
YEAH, AND ARMED TO THE TEETH.

358
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,875
- SORRY, KID.

359
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,375
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED
IN ME.

360
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,125
- JONAH, TOJO WASN'T RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS ONE.

361
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,958
I'M THE ONE WHO MADE
THE DECISION

362
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,458
TO BRING THE HEAVY GUNS.

363
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,916
BUT I PROMISE YOU, A SHOOTOUT
IS THE LAST THING I WANT.

364
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,625
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT JAPAN
BEING SAFE,

365
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,958
AND THERE'S PROBABLY NO NEED
FOR US TO WORRY.

366
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,083
BUT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH HAVING A LITTLE FIREPOWER

367
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,625
JUST IN CASE.

368
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,958
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE I SELL
THIS STUFF OR ANYTHING, RIGHT?

369
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,833
( chuckles )

370
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,250
NOW ABOUT TODAY,

371
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,833
SEEMS THE ILLUSTRIOUS S.R. UNIT
WANTS A MEET-UP.

372
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,333
COLONEL HINOKI
CALLED TOJO LATE LAST NIGHT

373
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,041
AND EMAILED ME TO CONFIRM.
HE WANTS TO PARLAY.

374
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,750
THE LOCATION IS THE PARKING AREA
AT UMIHOTARU.

375
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,708
WE'RE MEETING
UNDER THE PRETEXT

376
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,791
OF DIVIDING UP THE TRADING
TERRITORY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.

377
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,583
LIKE THAT'LL HAPPEN.

378
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,208
THE S.R. MADE IT CLEAR
TALKING WOULDN'T RESOLVE THIS

379
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,416
WHEN THEY PULLED
THE FIRST TRIGGER.

380
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,166
SO WHAT'S THE POINT?
AND WHY NOW?

381
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,041
WHY LEAVE THE SHADOWS

382
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,083
INSTEAD OF MANEUVERING
COVERTLY TO KILL MY BROTHER,

383
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,666
LIKE TOJO ANTICIPATED?

384
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,291
USING A MEETING TO GET CLOSE
IS A COMMON TACTIC,

385
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,833
BUT NOT FOR THEM.

386
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,625
OUR OPPONENTS
HAVE BECOME ERRATIC,

387
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,583
AND INCREASINGLY
HARD TO READ.

388
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,541
HOW ARE WE TO REACT WHEN A GHOST
STOPS BEHAVING LIKE A GHOST?

389
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,583
AND WHAT'S THE S.R. UNIT
REALLY HOPING TO ACHIEVE?

390
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,916
WELL, THERE'S NO POINT
IN BROODING.

391
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,416
THIS IS BAIT WE HAVE TO TAKE.
THEY DON'T HAVE A BASE HERE,

392
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,125
SO WHEN THEY NEED
TO HOLD MEETINGS,

393
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,375
THEY USE RANDOM SERVICE AREAS
OFF THE HIGHWAY.

394
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:40,041
IF WE MISS THIS CHANCE, FINDING
THEM AGAIN WON'T BE EASY.

395
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:44,583
LET'S MOVE OUT.
- All: 'KAY.

396
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,000
- SO HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO UMIHOTARU BEFORE?

397
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,208
- NO. THEY DIDN'T
FINISH BUILDING IT UNTIL '97,

398
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,416
AND I'D ALREADY LEFT JAPAN
BY THEN.

399
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,583
- MMM.

400
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,041
- ( thinking ) HARD TO BELIEVE,
BUT SHE'S RIGHT.

401
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:01,041
HINOKI'S METHODS HAVE CHANGED.

402
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,500
BUT WHY?

403
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,791
- OPERATION IS A GO.

404
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,708
- ( elevator dings )

405
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,750
- ( knocking )

406
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,708
- YOU HAVE A PROPOSAL

407
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,750
TO SPLIT THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN
ROUTE, MISS KUROSAKA?

408
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,000
- YES, I DO.
IT'S ONLY A PRELIMINARY DRAFT,

409
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,916
AS I'M SURE
YOU'LL WANNA WEIGH IN.

410
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,083
AND LET ME APOLOGIZE
ON BEHALF OF GANVILLE TRADING

411
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,291
FOR NOT SENDING A MORE
WORTHY REPRESENTATIVE

412
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,500
IN THIS FIRST MEETING.

413
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,583
IF WE'RE ABLE
TO REACH A COMPROMISE TODAY,

414
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,791
OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR,
MISTER HINOKI,

415
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,791
WILL MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
TO MEET WITH YOU IN PERSON

416
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,625
TO HAMMER OUT
THE FINAL DETAILS.

417
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,458
AS YOU KNOW, WE ALSO FUNCTION
AS AN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY,

418
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,500
AND SO MUST TAKE PRECAUTIONS.

419
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,666
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND,

420
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,708
OUR RUDENESS IS
NECESSARY FOR OUR SAFETY.

421
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,583
- IT'S FINE.
I REALLY DON'T CARE.

422
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,875
CAN I SEE THIS PROPOSAL?

423
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,916
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR
UNDERSTANDING, MR. KASPER.

424
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,500
THAT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU.

425
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,458
IN THAT CASE, WE'LL MOVE
RIGHT TO THE DOCUMENTS,

426
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,000
AS YOU'VE REQUESTED.
LET ME JUST FISH THEM OUT.

427
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,333
- WAKE UP, SIR. YOU SPACED OUT.
SHE'S AN ASSASSIN.

428
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,625
THE S.R. UNIT'S
MOVING AGAINST US.

429
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:29,708
- YEAH, I NOTICED.

430
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,041
NEARLY HAD
A GODDAMN HEART ATTACK.

431
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,750
MAN, SHE WAS FAST.

432
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,416
- NOT FAST ENOUGH, I GUESS.

433
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,041
SHE HAD THAT IN HER BELT, POE.
YOU MISSED IT.

434
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,583
- IT'S AN ULTRA-THIN KATANA.
THAT'S SO AWESOME.

435
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,333
- YET IT WAS STRONG ENOUGH
TO CARVE THROUGH MY BOOT

436
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,708
ALL THE WAY
TO THE STEEL SOLE GUARD.

437
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,583
I THINK I LIKE THESE GUYS.

438
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,416
- Kasper: THEY STILL COMING?
- Alan: UNKNOWN.

439
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,000
- HOW MANY?
- Poe: UNKNOWN.

440
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,166
- ORDERS, SIR?
- WE CAN'T SECURE THIS HOTEL.

441
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,375
WE'RE PULLING OUT.
KILL ON SIGHT.

442
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,375
I WANNA SEND A MESSAGE
TO THESE BASTARDS.

443
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,791
WE'LL HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE LOCAL POLICE.

444
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,166
MAN, WHAT A PAIN.

445
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,333
( laughing )
TOJO?

446
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,541
YOU WERE WAY OFF THE MARK
ON THIS ONE.

447
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,500
WELL, I WON'T HOLD IT
AGAINST HIM.

448
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,041
HONESTLY, I WAS CAUGHT
WITH MY PANTS DOWN TOO.

449
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,791
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE--
THIS PLAY.

450
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,000
THEY SHOULD KNOW WE CAN DEFEND
AGAINST CRUDE ASSAULTS.

451
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,416
IS THE S.R.
