1
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,083
- Jonah: I'VE WATCHED
EVERY DAY FOR TWO YEARS,

2
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,083
WAITING FOR KOKO
TO THROW THE SWITCH,

3
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,958
BUT SHE HASN'T.

4
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,875
JORMUNGAND'S STILL A DREAM

5
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,125
AND THE SKY'S STILL
OPEN FOR BUSINESS. 

6
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,583
AND JUST LIKE KOKO WARNED US,

7
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:38,791
THE LAND AND THE SEA
HAVE BEEN SET ON FIRE.

8
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:42,416
WATER, FOOD, MONEY,
TERRITORY, RACE, RELIGION...

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,458
THE FIGHTING STARTED
FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS.

10
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,375
KASPER KEEPS SAYING WE'RE
ON THE BRINK OF WORLD WAR III.

11
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,833
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
WHAT KOKO WOULD SAY.

12
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:56,458
- SEE, JONAH, 700,000 LIVES 
GONE IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

13
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,750
- ( phone beeping )
- YO!

14
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,000
SEEMS LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD'S
COOKING NICE AND HOT, ISN'T IT?

15
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,625
YOU RAKING IN THE DOUGH?

16
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,000
- Koko: YOU REALLY
HAVE TO ASK?

17
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,916
- HAHA!

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
- ( theme music plays )

19
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,791
- ( singing in Japanese )


20
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,291
- Kasper: HONESTLY,
THE ARAB PENINSULA

21
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,708
HAS BECOME TOO STICKY

22
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,083
WHAT WITH PLUNGING THEMSELVES

23
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,958
INTO THE SIXTH
MIDDLE EASTERN WAR.

24
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,625
ONLY ONES MAKING MONEY THERE

25
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,041
ARE YOUNG DEALERS
WILLING TO RISK

26
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,833
THEY CAN GET OUT FAST.

27
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,916
SO, HOW IS IT
IN NORTH AFRICA?

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,458
- Koko: IF YOU BEELINE
FROM SOMALIA TO MAURITANIA,

29
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,791
YOU'LL BE IN DANGER
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

30
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,125
ULTIMATELY, EVERY

31
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,291
"SUCH-AND-SUCH SPRING"
UPRISING FAILED.

32
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,125
AT LEAST THEY
DON'T HAVE DICTATORS,

33
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,041
BUT THEY SURE AS HELL
DON'T HAVE PEACE.

34
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,666
HOW ABOUT SOUTHEAST ASIA?

35
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,958
- I HAD GREAT CUSTOMERS
IN INDONESIA,

36
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,708
BUT IT'S WAY
TOO HOT FOR ME NOW.

37
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,375
SINCE THEY GOT A NEW
ADMINISTRATION TWO YEARS AGO,

38
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,125
ONE MORE STATE JOINED
THE INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT,

39
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,083
BUT FIVE VANISHED.

40
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,250
AND ALL THE LEADERS
WERE EXECUTED.

41
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,750
MEANWHILE, FRICTION WITH

42
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,833
THE CHINESE IMMIGRANTS
KEEPS GETTING WORSE,

43
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,916
TERRORISTS SET OFF
BOMBS EVERY DAY.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,208
WITH ALL THE CHAOS,
THE STRAIGHT OF MALACCA'S

45
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,083
BEEN CLOSED
TO AMERICAN SHIPS.

46
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,083
SPEAKING OF TERRORISTS,
I HEAR LONDON LOST BIG BEN.

47
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,291
PEOPLE ARE SAYING
IT BLEW SKY-HIGH.

48
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,791
- Koko: ACTUALLY, THE OPPOSITE.

49
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,000
THEY TOPPLED IT.

50
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,750
COMPLETELY
DISINTEGRATED ITS BASE.

51
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,916
ALL THE COUNTRIES
IN THE OLD EURO-ZONE

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,666
HAVE BECOME NESTS
FOR TERRORIST GROUPS.

53
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,625
THE LOWER CLASSES ARE TARGETING
CIVIL SERVANTS NOW.

54
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,291
- Kasper: SOUNDS LIKE
A CIVIL WAR BREWING.

55
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,291
AT LEAST
IT'S NOT SOUTH AMERICA.

56
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,708
THEY'VE GOT CIVIL WAR
DOWN TO AN ART FORM. 

57
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,875
THANKS TO DRUG CARTELS AND
THE RIGHT-WING GUERRILLAS,

58
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,250
ATTACKS THERE ARE AS ROUTINE
AS DRIVING A CAR.

59
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,750
- Koko: IT'S A SIMILAR STORY
IN EAST AND WEST AFRICA.

60
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,791
THEY'RE FIGHTING OVER WATER
IN THE EAST

61
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,416
AND MINERAL MINES
IN THE WEST.

62
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,000
ALTHOUGH THE REASONS THEY GIVE
TO RALLY THE TROOPS

63
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,875
ARE NEVER THAT
STRAIGHTFORWARD, OF COURSE.

64
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,750
- Kasper: NATURALLY.

65
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,541
AMIDST ALL THAT,
AMERICA AND THE NEW SOVIET UNION

66
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,166
HAVE GOTTEN BACK TO THEIR
OLD PRECARIOUS BALANCING ACT.

67
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,916
AND POLAND HAS SHUT DOWN
THEIR MISSILE DEFENSES. 

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,750
- Koko: THE NEW SOVIET UNION--
( laughs )

69
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,125
BECAUSE THE COLD WAR WAS
SO MUCH FUN THE FIRST TIME.

70
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,583
ANYWAY, I HEARD YOU'RE ON BOARD
A SHIP IN THE SEVENTH FLEET.

71
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,125
AREN'T THEY GETTING READY 
TO AIR RAID INDIA?

72
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,416
- JUST A LITTLE HEAT
TO KEEP PEOPLE HONEST.

73
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,833
THE FAR EAST
IS IN NO SHAPE FOR WAR.

74
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,541
THE YUAN'S WORTH ABOUT
AS MUCH AS TOILET PAPER,

75
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,250
SO THE CHINESE FEDERATION
IS TOO BUSY WITH THEIR ECONOMY.

76
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,375
AND UNITED HONG KONG STILL
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A PRESIDENT.

77
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,375
BUSINESSES IN JAPAN ARE
ON THE EDGE OF A CLIFF, TOO.

78
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,208
DEPENDING ON WHETHER
THEY BUILT FACTORIES

79
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,250
IN THE SOUTH OR NORTH,
THEY'RE EITHER IN HEAVEN

80
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,083
OR THE PITS OF HELL.

81
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,916
SPEAKING OF, HAS THAT
COMPANY YOU SAVED

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,416
WITH NEW STOCK SURVIVED?

83
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,625
KISARAGI PHOTOCHEMICAL
ENGINEERING, RIGHT?

84
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,625
- THEY DIDN'T BUILD
ANY FACTORIES ABROAD,

85
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,083
SO THEY'RE DOING FINE.
- YOU DON'T SAY?

86
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,458
NOW, TELL ME,
WHEN DO I GET TO SEE

87
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,875
THIS NEW WORLD YOU'VE BEEN
SO CAREFULLY PLANNING.

88
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,875
YOU'VE BEEN BUSY, KOKO.

89
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,541
- OH, YOU NOTICED.

90
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,083
( laughs )

91
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,833
- I'VE BEEN WORKING IN
THIS BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME.

92
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,291
I CAN USUALLY TELL
WHAT SOMEONE'S THINKING

93
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,708
JUST BY READING THEIR FACE.

94
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,875
SO, IN DEFENSE OF
THE KID'S HONOR,

95
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,750
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT HE NEVER TOLD ME

96
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,916
WHY HE LEFT YOUR TEAM.
NOT ONE WORD THE WHOLE TIME.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,458
- WHY ARE YOU SAYING
IT LIKE THAT?

98
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,875
JONAH'S STILL WITH YOU, RIGHT?

99
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,375
- WELL, FOR NOW, YEAH.
BUT LIKE I SAID,

100
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,416
I CAN READ FACES.
JONAH'S GONNA QUIT.

101
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,208
COULD BE AS SOON AS TODAY.

102
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,875
HE'S A HIGHLY
SKILLED OPERATIVE,

103
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,833
SO LOSING HIM IS GONNA HURT.

104
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,666
YOU KNOW HOW HE IS.
HE HASN'T COMPLAINED ONCE.

105
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,458
BUT I CAN TELL HIS
FRUSTRATION'S BEEN BUILDING.

106
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,208
HE DOESN'T AGREE
WITH MY METHODS.

107
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,791
- MARATHON PHONE CALL.
- OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S NO SURPRISE.

108
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,666
- STOP IT.
- OH, RELAX.

109
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,625
- Koko: SO, HOW DID
YOU FIGURE OUT MY PLAN?

110
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:16,083
- ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO,
SCARECROW STARTED PESTERING ME.

111
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,583
- ( whimpering )

112
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,541
- WHAT ARE YOU AND
YOUR DAMN SISTER

113
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,708
PLANNING THIS TIME, HUH?

114
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,750
MY BOSS SEALED KOKO'S FILES!

115
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,125
HE WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING!

116
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,833
WHY, KASPER?

117
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,125
- ( thudding )
- ( grunts, coughs )

118
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,958
- I'M IN THE DARK.

119
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,458
I'D SAY YOU SHOULD
ASK KOKO.

120
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,125
- Scarecrow: SHUT UP!
OR SO HELP ME,

121
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,375
I WILL THROW YOU
IN THE SLAMMER! 

122
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,333
- IF I WAS IN THE DARK,

123
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,416
THEN I KNEW
YOU WEREN'T ACTING

124
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,541
UNDER H.C.L.I's DIRECTION.

125
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,291
ALSO, JONAH QUIT
WORKING FOR YOU.

126
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,333
AND WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING
WAS BIG ENOUGH

127
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,375
TO MAKE THE HEADS
OF THE C.I.A. CLAM UP.

128
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,958
THOSE WERE THE PIECES.

129
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,166
I JUST HAD TO
ASSEMBLE THE PUZZLE.

130
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,750
- YOU KNOW I'M NOT 
GONNA TALK ABOUT IT

131
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,416
ON A SATELLITE PHONE.

132
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,208
- OH, SO I DID
CONNECT THE DOTS!

133
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,583
AND THAT'S WHY YOU CHOSE ME
FOR YOUR NEXT MISSION.

134
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,458
ME AND MY TEAM
PROTECTING BABY SISTER.

135
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,750
- ( gasps )
- I UNDERSTAND.

136
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,958
WE'RE HEADING THERE NOW.

137
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,333
- UH...
- YUP, YOU HEARD ME.

138
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,458
WE'LL TALK LATER, KID.
LET'S MOVE.

139
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,625
CALL IN THE TEAM.

140
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,875
IT'S LOOKING NASTY.

141
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,000
- IT'S THE SAFEST LAUNCH SITE
WE COULD GET.

142
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,666
ALL WE CAN DO
IS HOPE A STRAY ROUND

143
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,125
DOESN'T HIT THE ROCKET.

144
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,333
TUCKED INSIDE THAT
BABY'S PAYLOAD FAIRING

145
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,041
IS A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED
QUANTUM COMPUTER.

146
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,750
IT'S JORMUNGAND'S SECOND BRAIN.

147
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,708
- OH, THE MIDGARD SERPENT.
- Woman: T-MINUS 20 SECONDS.

148
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,250
19...
- OUR GLOBAL NETWORK

149
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,333
18...
- OF INFORMATION--

150
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,083
- 17...
- IT CAN ALL BE CONTROLLED

151
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,416
-  16, 15...
-BY A SATELLITE IN SPACE--

152
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,750
SAFE FROM HUMAN INTERFERENCE.
- SECOND SEQUENCE.

153
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,333
- THAT'S WHY IT'S FLAWLESS--
- SUPERCHARGER CABLES LINKED.

154
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,208
- BECAUSE NO ONE
CAN GET IN ITS WAY.

155
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,791
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT...
- TELL YOU WHAT, KASPER.

156
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,666
I'LL GIVE YOU THE SHORT VERSION.
- BLENDED FUEL ENGAGED

157
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,125
IN PRE-FLAME REACTION.

158
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,250
HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
INJECTED INTO GENERATOR.

159
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,625
THREE, TWO, ONE...

160
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,416
LIFT OFF.
- ( engine roars )

161
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,750
- BLAST OFF! YEAH!
- ( both cheer )

162
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,375
- ( laughing )
- Leila: GOOD SHOW, EVERYONE.

163
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:27,041
- Minami: YOU MUST
BE THRILLED, KOKO.

164
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,791
- ( sighs ) SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH.
THAT'S QUITE A RELIEF.

165
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,541
- WOW, THE JORMUNGAND
I SHRUNK DOWN IS IN SPACE.

166
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,000
ASTOUNDING.

167
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,375
- WOW! I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SEEING THIS!

168
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,875
( giggles )
LOOK, BABS, SHE'S CRYING.

169
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,333
MISS STONE-COLD LEILA IS CRYING.
NOT SO TOUGH AFTER ALL.

170
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,916
- I SUPPOSE NOT.
- SINCE WHEN AM I STONE COLD?

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,750
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO AGREE WITH HER, BABSIE.

172
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,208
- Koko: IT'S SAID JORMUNGAND
ONCE ENCIRCLED THE EARTH,


173
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,833
BLOCKING THE LIGHT
OF THE SUN AND THE STARS

174
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,291
AND FORCING THE LAND
TO SINK INTO THE SEAS.

175
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,875
HOW WILL JORMUNGAND
CHANGE THE WORLD THIS TIME,

176
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,208
NOW THAT IT
CONTROLS THE SKY?

177
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,916
- ( laughs )

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,250
YEAH, WHO THE HELL KNOWS?
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

179
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,541
WHAT? YOU THOUGHT YOUR PLAN
WOULD UPSET ME?

180
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,541
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S GONNA
DEAL A HEAVY BLOW TO

181
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,458
H.C.L.I. IN THE SHORT TERM.

182
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,875
AND THE GLOBAL GRID
COULD BE WIPED OUT ENTIRELY,

183
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,541
BUT IN THE LONG TERM,
PROFITS WILL ONLY GO UP.

184
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,625
IF YOU SHUT DOWN THE SKIES,

185
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,250
WE'LL BE LIMITED TO
LAND AND WATER DISTRIBUTION.

186
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,541
THAT'S WHAT THE COMPANY
WAS FOUNDED ON.

187
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,500
FLOYD WILL BITCH
AND MOAN FOR A WHILE,

188
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,000
BUT IN THE END,
HE'LL BE HAPPY.

189
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,916
I WON'T TELL HIM THAT,
OF COURSE.

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,500
IT WOULDN'T BE FUN.

191
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,250
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
OUR WORLD

192
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,041
WILL EVER BE FREE
OF WEAPONS, KOKO?

193
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,208
COME ON.

194
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,875
IF I DON'T HAVE
AERIAL WEAPONS,

195
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,958
I'LL SELL NAVAL ONES.

196
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,416
IF I DIDN'T HAVE BATTLESHIPS,
I'D SELL TANKS.

197
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,208
I'D SELL FIREARMS. I'D SELL LONG
SWORDS. I'D SELL HATCHETS.

198
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,583
YOU COULD RID THE WORLD OF IRON
AND I'D SELL WOODEN CLUBS.

199
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,333
THERE IS ALWAYS
A BIGGER STICK.

200
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,875
- HM-HMM.

201
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:10,166
- Kasper: AFTER ALL THAT TALK,
SHE LEAVES ON A PLANE.

202
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,583
( snickers )

203
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,375
- WHAT'S THAT?
- NOTHING.

204
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,083
JUST THINKING OUT LOUD.

205
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,541
GUESS SHE WON'T
BE ACTIVATING IT JUST YET.

206
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,166
- EXCUSE ME, KASPER.

207
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,166
WOULD YOU MIND
PULLING OVER FOR A MINUTE?

208
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,000
I'M GRATEFUL
FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE,

209
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,916
BUT I'M LEAVING.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,083
THIS IS FINE.

211
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,458
CAN YOU
LET ME OUT HERE?

212
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,166
YOU'VE BEEN
A GOOD EMPLOYER, REALLY.

213
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,083
I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS,
BUT I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

214
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,583
- WAIT, THAT'S CRAZY TALK.
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

215
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,541
- POE, STOP THE CAR, WOULD YOU?
- Poe: YES, SIR.

216
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,250
ALAN, WE'RE STOPPING.
- Alan: TEN-FOUR.

217
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,666
- YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN
ABOUT BUSINESS, JONAH.

218
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,625
YOU DON'T JUST SAY
YOU QUIT AND WALK.

219
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,625
TWO WEEKS NOTICE
IS THE STANDARD.

220
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,666
BUT TO BE FAIR,
IT'S HARDLY ACCEPTED PRACTICE

221
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,625
TO EMPLOY MINORS
AS ARMED SECURITY.

222
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,958
AM I RIGHT?

223
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,666
IF SOMEONE CHARGED
ME WITH VIOLATING 

224
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,291
CHILD LABOR LAWS,
I'D BE UP THE PROVERBIAL CREEK.

225
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,750
I FIGURED OUT A LONG TIME AGO
IF YOU EVER QUIT,

226
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,291
I COULDN'T STOP YOU.

227
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,541
SO THAT'S HOW
IT'S GONNA PLAY OUT.

228
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,625
FACT IS, IN A STRANGE WAY,
YOU AND I ARE EQUALS.

229
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,625
- WE'RE WHAT?

230
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,375
- YOUR SKILLS AS A SOLDIER

231
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,166
AND MINE AS AN ARMS DEALER
MAKE US EQUALLY STRONG.

232
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,666
AND THAT MEANS I HAVE
TO HANDLE YOU CAREFULLY.

233
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,541
YOU SEE, FOR MY OWN SAKE.

234
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,375
YOU ALSO KNOW
A DANGEROUS AMOUNT

235
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,083
ABOUT HOW
I CONDUCT MY BUSINESS.

236
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,458
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO STAY QUIET ABOUT THAT.

237
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,791
- I'M NOT A TALKER.
- GOOD.

238
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,416
- NOW ON TO THE MATTER OF

239
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,125
THE THREE ORPHAN KIDS
IN JAPAN.

240
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,041
- WHAT ABOUT THOSE KIDS?

241
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,625
- Poe: SHOULD'VE KNOWN
KASPER WOULD

242
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,125
BRING UP THE KIDS LIKE THIS.

243
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,458
HE'S TELLING JONAH
WHAT'LL HAPPEN

244
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,958
IF ANY SECRETS GET OUT.

245
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,041
- THE TWO OF US WILL
SUPPORT THEM TOGETHER,

246
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,833
TILL THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH
FOR COLLEGE.

247
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,041
THEY'LL GET ONE SHOT
AT THEIR ENTRANCE EXAMS.

248
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,208
HOW'S THAT SOUND?
- THANKS, KASPER.

249
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,958
- ( laughs )
DON'T THANK ME!

250
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,500
LIKE I SAID,
YOU ARE SHELLING OUT

251
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,708
HALF OF IT YOURSELF.

252
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,708
BUT DON'T WORRY.
EVEN MINUS THAT,

253
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,708
YOU'RE STILL PRETTY RICH.

254
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,833
THESE ARE YOUR SWISS
BANK ACCOUNT PAPERS 

255
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,333
AND YOUR PASSPORT.

256
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,041
THESE ARE CRITICAL
FOR YOUR NEW LIFE, JONAH.

257
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,000
DON'T LOSE 'EM.

258
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,000
YOU WORKED OUT BETTER
THAN I EVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED.

259
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,916
THE CHILD SOLDIER
WITH A HEART OF GOLD.

260
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,083
- HUH? WHAT THE--
- ( door closes )

261
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,541
- ( gun cocks )

262
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,250
- WHY DID I TAKE MY GUNS?

263
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,583
KASPER SHOULD HAVE
SAID SOMETHING.

264
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,958
- Chequita: KASPER!

265
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,250
( growls )
- AH!

266
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,625
KNOCK IT OFF, CHEQUITA!

267
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,750
THIS CAN'T BE VERY GOOD
FOR MY SPINE.

268
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,458
AND LIKE I TOLD JONAH,
IT WAS THE BEST OPTION I HAD.

269
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,375
IT'S UNUSUAL FOR YOU
TO GET THIS UPSET ABOUT STUFF.

270
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,625
YOU MUST HAVE REALLY TAKEN
A LIKING TO HIM OR AM I WRONG?

271
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,000
- OF COURSE I DID!
HE WAS SO STRONG AND SO CUTE!

272
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,750
- SHEESH, SHE ACTS AS IF
SHE JUST LOST HER FAVORITE PET.

273
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,791
- DAMN IT, JONAH,
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

274
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,583
AND WHERE WILL YOU GO?
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE ALONE.

275
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,458
- YOU'LL SEE HIM AGAIN.

276
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,541
EVEN I FEEL SORRY
FOR THE KID.

277
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,250
HE'S DEVELOPED A TASTE
FOR WEAPONS AT AN EARLY AGE.

278
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,750
HE TRIES TO REJECT THEM,

279
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,041
BUT CARRIES THEM
WITHOUT EVEN THINKING.

280
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,750
IT'S A BIG WORLD. WHEN
YOU PART WAYS WITH SOMEONE,

281
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,625
YOU MAY NEVER
SEE THEM AGAIN.

282
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,291
BUT FOR THOSE
WHO'VE TAKEN UP ARMS,

283
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,750
THE WORLD IS
A MUCH SMALLER PLACE.

284
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,500
AND IT'S ONLY
GONNA GET SMALLER NOW.

285

( sighs )

289
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,875
I CAN'T.

290
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,750
NO.

291
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,666
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

292
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,125
DO SOMETHING, KOKO!

293
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:25,791

YOU'VE SURVIVED WAR,

355
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,875
BUT YOU CAN'T GO
INTO A RESTAURANT ALONE?

356
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,208
- WHOA.  LUTZ?

357
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,791
- THAT'S RIGHT, KID.
IT'S ME.

358
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,500
JUST CALL ME
YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

359

HERE'S A TRAVEL TIP.

360
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,333
THE INTERNATIONAL GESTURE
FOR FOOD,

361
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,666
LIKE THIS, SEE?

362
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,375
THEN GIVE THEM
A COUPLE OF DOLLARS.

363
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,041
IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH,
YOU GET TO WASH DISHES.

364
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,000
HEY, CHECK OUT WHAT
THE CAT DRAGGED IN.

365
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,041
- ( gasps )

366
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,375
YOU'RE ALL HERE?

367
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,000
- WE WERE NEARBY WHEN WE HEARD
YOU QUIT ON KASPER,

368
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,416
SO WE CAME TO GET YOU.

369
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,041
THOUGH IT'S YOUR
CHOICE, OF COURSE.

370
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,333
HONESTLY, THESE GUYS
HAVE BEEN A REAL PAIN IN MY ASS

371
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,708
WITHOUT YOU BEING AROUND.

372
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,708
WE COULD USE
ANOTHER DECENT HUMAN.

373
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,750
HOW ABOUT IT?
- YOU'RE HERE FOR ME?

374
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,083
- YOU'VE GROWN A LOT
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, KID.

375
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,291
WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN
FEEDING YOU OVER THERE?

376
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,000
AS FOR ME, WELL,
I GUESS I JUST HAVEN'T HAD

377
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,291
THE SAME APPETITE WITHOUT YOU
BEING PART OF THE TEAM.

378
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,583
- THANKS, UGO.
- SEEMS YOU'VE

379
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,125
FALLEN BEHIND ON YOUR
LANGUAGE TRAINING, JONAH.

380
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,500
NOT MUCH FUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T

381
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,333
COMMUNICATE WITH
THE LOCALS, HUH?

382
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,333
I'M NOT TOTALLY FLUENT HERE,
BUT I KNOW ENOUGH TO GET BY.

383
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,458
IT'S BEEN BORING
THE LAST TWO YEARS

384
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,458
WITHOUT SOMEONE TO TEACH.

385
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,416
- HEY, WILEE.

386
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,375
- COME ON, GUYS,
WHAT THE CRAP?

387
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,125
NOBODY TOLD ME WE WERE
ALL GIVING MINI-SPEECHES.

388
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,125
I THINK YOU SHOULD
MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND, JONAH.

389
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,166
BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU AROUND.

390
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,625
I'M BORED WITH TEASING LUTZ.
- YEAH, I BET.

391
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,916
- I TRIED MY BEST NOT
TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OF IT

392
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,916
WHEN YOU LEFT. I LIKE TO
KEEP THINGS PROFESSIONAL.

393
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,500
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
IT HASN'T BEEN THE SAME.

394
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,375
- HI, MAO.
- HEY, JONAH.

395
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,791
I NEVER DISCHARGED YOU,

396
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,291
SO TECHNICALLY
YOU'VE BEEN "AWOL"

397
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,291
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

398
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,083
- I'M IN TROUBLE.

399
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,083
- SO, YOU FINALLY GOT SICK
OF KASPER'S CRAP, HUH?

400
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,750
I ALWAYS KNEW
YOU'D COME BACK EVENTUALLY.

401
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,166
I TEND TO BECOME RATHER ATTACHED
TO MY COLLEAGUES

402
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,875
AND I DIDN'T LIKE
YOU BEING GONE.

403
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,791
NOW EAT UP, KID,
BEFORE YOU PASS OUT.

404
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,833
- THANKS, VALMET.

405
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,083
- Koko: ENOUGH, GUYS.
I'M GONNA CHOKE ON

406
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,041
ALL THIS KUMBAYA CRAP.

407
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,791
JONAH, DID YOU CROSS
THE CASPIAN SEA

408
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,208
ALL BY YOURSELF?
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

409
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,500
( chuckles ) 
HAVE A DRINK.

410
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,416
OFFICER JONAH, I WOULD SAY
YOU'VE EARNED IT.

411
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,125
- KOKO.

412
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,833
- I KNOW. IT'S
A TOUCHING REUNION,

413
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,458
BUT THERE'S
NO TIME TO WASTE.

414
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,125
THERE'S A REASON WE'RE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

415
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,458
AND THE TEAM'S GOT
THEIR HEAVY GEAR. 

416
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,416
THIS IS DANGEROUS TERRITORY

417
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,625
AND IT COULD GO
FULL-ON WAR ZONE ANY MINUTE.

418
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,708
BAKU, AZERBAIJAN...

419
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,500
THE NEW SOVIET UNION
HAS THEIR HEARTS SET

420
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,958
ON THE OIL FIELDS HERE.

421
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,875
THEY'RE GATHERING
AT THE BORDER.

422
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:37,125
BUT I'M THE KIND OF WOMAN
WHO DELIVERS ON HER PROMISES.

423
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,291
TOOK SOME TIME, BUT JORMUNGAND
IS FINALLY COMPLETE.

424
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,750
I JUST HAVE TO SEND
THE ACTIVATION SIGNAL.

425
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,666
AND ONCE I DO,
I CAN PREVENT

426
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,708
THE NEW SOVIET ARMY
FROM INVADING.

427
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:50,708
YOU'VE HAD TWO WHOLE YEARS
TO THINK IT OVER, JONAH.

428
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,291
SO, WHAT'S THE VERDICT?

429
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,458
WHO'S MORE CRAZY,
ME OR THE WORLD? 

430
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,500
- WILL ACTIVATING JORMUNGAND

431
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,041
REALLY BRING PEACE
TO THE WORLD?

432
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,250
- ( cackles )

433
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,791
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NO FORTUNE-TELLER,

434
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,791
BUT I DO LIKE MY ODDS.

435
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,958
THE HEAVENS ARE
ABOUT TO EXPERIENCE

436
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,208
OVER A CENTURY
OF RETROGRESSION.

437
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,333
BUT WE'RE WIRED
TO MOVE FORWARD, NEVER BACK.

438
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,250
AND THE SKY THAT USED
TO SYMBOLIZE

439
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,250
ULTIMATE ACHIEVEMENT AND FREEDOM
WILL BE CLOSED TO US.

440
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,666
WHEN WE SEE THE DAWN
OR A SOARING BIRD,

441
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,708
WE'LL BE REMINDED OF WHAT
WE WERE TOO RECKLESS TO KEEP.

442
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,375
THE HUMILIATION OF HUMANITY

443
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,250
WILL CONSTANTLY
HANG OVER OUR HEADS.

444
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,041
DO YOU THINK THE HUMAN RACE
WILL KEEP FIGHTING THEN?

445
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,916
PERSONALLY, I DON'T
BELIEVE THEY WILL. 

446
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,708
HUMANS CAN'T
STAND HUMILIATION.

447
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,916
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT SEPARATES US FROM THE APES.

448
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,625
- BUT SHOULD I TRUST
YOUR INTUITION?

449
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,416
- WELL, I AM
A FORMER ARMS DEALER.

450
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,666
AND I DID GET YOU ALL
MIXED UP IN THIS TO BEGIN WITH.

451
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,833
- I THINK THAT BOTH YOU 
AND THE WORLD ARE CRAZY.

452
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:52,500
THAT SAID, I'M TAKING
MY CHANCES WITH YOU. 

453
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,583
- I'M GLAD.

454
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,125
THEN I'LL GIVE YOU
A FRONT-ROW SEAT, JONAH.

455
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,875
LOAD UP.
LET'S GO!

456
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:03,291
- ( rapping in French )

457
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,416
( rapping ends )

458
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,666
- AND SO IT WAS.

459
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,708
I TRAVELLED WITH
AN ARMS DEALER. 

460
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,875
NOW, I WILL TRAVEL
