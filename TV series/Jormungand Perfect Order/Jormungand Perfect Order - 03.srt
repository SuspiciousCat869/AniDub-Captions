1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,500
- Lutz: JONAH, WRONG SPOT.
- OH, SORRY.

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:13,458
- RUN THE DRILL AGAIN.
- ( tires squeal )

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,500
- AW, COME ON.
- ( gunshot )

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:20,666
- Koko: R, YOU KNOW A C.I.A.
AGENT? PEOPLE CALL HIM BOOK MAN?

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,291
- YEAH, I'M FAMILIAR WITH HIM.

6
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,625
MET HIM IN BOSNIA
WHEN I WAS STILL ITALIAN ARMY.

7
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,083
DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT THOSE HIT MEN SAID?

8
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,416
DIDN'T THEY MENTION
SOMETHING ABOUT THE C.I.A.?

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,291
- NO.  BOOK MAN CAME UP
IN SOME OTHER RUMORS.

10
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,250
I THINK THE HIT-MAN STUFF
IS A COINCIDENCE.

11
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,333
I CAN'T SEE SOMEONE AS
HIGH UP

12
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,041
AS THE EURO BRANCH CHIEF
PLAYING THAT CARD.

13
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,875
EVER HEAR OF ANOTHER AGENT
WHO GOES BY HEX?

14
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,750
A PARAMILITARY OPERATIONS
OFFICER? YOU KNOW, P.O.O.?

15
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,500
- SORRY.
DON'T KNOW HIM.

16
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,375
DOES HIS FACE HAVE SIX SIDES
OR SOMETHING?

17
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,916
- SHE'S A SHE.
HEX AS IN WITCH.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
- R: I THINK HEX IS
THE ONE BEHIND

19
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,583
ALL THE RECENT ATTEMPTS
ON OUR GROUP.

20
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,583
ARE YOU OKAY
WITH SOME ROGUE AGENT

21
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,791
SCREWING OPERATION UNDERSHAFT?

22
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:11,291
- R, YOU ARE MY RIGHT ARM
AND HEX IS MY LEFT.

23
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:15,375
SHE'S STAYING.
FOR THE LONG HAUL.

24
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,458
ESPECIALLY SINCE THAT LEFT ARM

25
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,083
IS ATTACHED TO A FIST
THAT SMASHES TERRORISTS.

26
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:24,583
IF SHE WANTS A SACRIFICE,
WE MAY HAVE TO GIVE IT TO HER.

27
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,333
EVEN IF IT'S THE LIFE

28
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,958
OF A SINGLE CHILD.

29
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,291
- NO WAY.

30
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,958
I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN, SAW.

31
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,791
I WON'T LET HEX KILL JONAH.

32
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:42,750
- ( theme music playing )


33
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:10,041
- ( cell phone ringing )

34
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,958
- Koko: HELLO?  HEY, R.

35
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,291
MM. MM-HM.

36
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,916
JUST WALKING AROUND
TOWN WITH JONAH.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,791
YEAH.  YEAH.

38
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,666
WE'RE RIGHT BY THE HOTEL.

39
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,333
THANKS FOR CALLING
AND CHECKING IN, R.

40
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,625
YOU SOUND WINDED.
HAVE YOU BEEN RUNNING?

41
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,208
- YEP, MY MORNING JOG.
CIAO.

42
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,250
YOU REALLY WANNA GIVE JONAH
OVER TO HEX?

43
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,583
I WON'T DO IT.

44
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,500
DAMN IT,
YOU LISTEN TO ME, SAW.

45
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,708
IF YOU ALLOW THAT CHILD
TO BE KILLED,

46
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,208
YOU'LL BE FLUSHING OPERATION
UNDERSHAFT DOWN THE DRAIN.

47
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,208
- YOU DON'T SAY.
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

48
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,625
- WHY DO YOU THINK KOKO
TOOK IN JONAH?

49
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,833
WHY INVITE A KID INTO A GROUP
OF ARMS DEALERS?

50
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,833
SHE'S ALWAYS LOGICAL,
CAUTIOUS.

51
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,166
BUT SHE'S TAKING
AN INTENTIONAL RISK WITH HIM.

52
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,791
SURE, AS AN EX-CHILD SOLDIER,
HE HAS HIS USES,

53
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,541
BUT THAT
DOESN'T MAKE IT SMART.

54
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,208
- ALL GOOD POINTS.
SO WHAT?

55
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,666
- HE CALMS HER.

56
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,625
JONAH ACTS LIKE A LIMITER
ON HER EMOTIONS.

57
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,375
- ( cell phone ringing )

58
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:12,458
WING COMMANDER SIMUNEK.
HOW ARE YOU THIS FINE MORNING?

59
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,375
THAT'S GOOD.

60
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,375
NO, THE PLEASURE IS ALL MINE.

61
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:21,208
I'M QUITE LOOKING FORWARD
TO OUR MEETING THIS AFTERNOON.

62
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,291
RIGHT NOW?
WELL, YOU DON'T WASTE TIME.

63
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,000
I MEAN I'D LOVE TO.

64
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,541
I'M REALLY NOT DRESSED
FOR BUSINESS, THOUGH.

65
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,500
I'M DOING THE TOURIST THING
AROUND TOWN.

66
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,541
SURE.

67
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,583
LONG AS YOU DON'T MIND.

68
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,166
HA.

69
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,041
HE JUST INVITED ME OUT TO TEA.

70
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,708
- YOU SHOULD
LET THE SQUAD KNOW

71
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,333
WE'LL BE LATE
GETTING BACK TO THE HOTEL.

72
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,875
- A "LIMITER," HUH?
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

73
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,958
THINK OF HIM LIKE A GOVERNOR
ON AN OLD CAR,

74
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,750
KEEPING THE LITTLE LADY
FROM OVERHEATING.

75
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,875
SHE'S GOT HUGE PLANS
THAT ONLY SHE KNOWS ABOUT.

76
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,958
BY BRINGING IN A BOY WHO'S
HAD TO FIGHT JUST TO SURVIVE,

77
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,916
SHE'S CREATED A PATH
TO RE-CONNECT WITH HER HUMANITY,

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,250
AND MAYBE A PATH
TO ABANDON THOSE PLANS

79
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,500
AND HER ENTIRE LIFE
AS AN ARMS DEALER.

80
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,250
BENEATH KOKO'S IRON MASK,

81
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,875
SHE STILL HAS THE SAME DESIRES
OF ANY GIRL HER AGE.

82
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,416
- STOP PLAYING SHRINK.

83
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,625
I EXPECT ACTUAL INTEL FROM YOU.
CLEAR?

84
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,291
SHE'S GOT YOU IN HER POCKET.

85
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,916
AT LEAST TRY TO RESIST
DANCING TO HER TUNE.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,041
- HA, HA.  I'LL ADMIT, I HAVE A
GOOD TIME HANGING OUT WITH THEM.

87
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,041
HELL, RUNNING GUNS IS FUN.
BUT COME ON.

88
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,625
IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WANTS
TO DANCE WITH THE LITTLE LADY,

89
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,750
IT'S TOTALLY YOU, SAW.

90
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,375
"I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
BECOME A MONSTER," YOU SAID.

91
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,250
SO DON'T LIE.

92
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,666
PART OF YOU IS DYING TO SEE
EXACTLY WHAT HER PLANS ARE,

93
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,958
AND HOW THEY WORK OUT.
- ( elevator dings )

94
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,875
- HA!
YOU KNOW ME TOO WELL, R.

95
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,833
( laughs )

96
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,458
- Woman:
IS DIRECTOR BLACK LAUGHING?

97
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,375
- PLEASE, SAW,

98
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,208
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME
HEX'S LOCATION.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,375
- I SUPPOSE I DO.

100
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,500
HEX IS 2.5 KLICKS
SOUTHEAST OF YOUR HOTEL,

101
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,083
IN THE PRAGUE B MARKET.

102
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,833
10 HEAVILY ARMED,
WELL-TRAINED MEN

103
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,458
SHOULD BE LYING IN WAIT THERE,

104
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,041
ALL OF THEM
ACTING UNDER HEX'S AUTHORITY.

105
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,416
THEIR OPERATION AGAINST KOKO
AND THE BOY IS ALREADY UNDERWAY.

106
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,541
THE CALL SHE GOT FOR A MEETING
WITH AIR FORCE OFFICER SIMUNEK

107
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,875
IS PART OF A TRAP
TO LURE HER TO THEM.

108
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,458
I'LL STOP IT.

109
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,375
I'M PLACING A CALL
TO THE LOCAL POLICE.

110
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,291
- ( dings )

111
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,666
- HEY, R,
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

112
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,958
WHATCHA BEEN UP TO?
YOU OUT JOGGING?

113
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,875
- YEAH, WHERE WERE YOU, LUTZ?
GOTTA STAY FIT.

114
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,291
- HEY, I WORK OUT.
I JOG.

115
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,250
- I'VE GOTTA HEAD BACK OUT
IN A MINUTE.

116
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,916
I'M OFF DUTY TODAY.
- ROGER THAT.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,208
I ALWAYS WORK OUT.

118
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,500
- PRETTY NICE WEATHER
THIS MORNING.

119
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,458
- Man: TARGET IN SIGHT.

120
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:03,791
- ABOUT TIME.
LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

121
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,625
AND PROMISE YOU WON'T
GO EASY ON THE TARGET

122
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,166
JUST 'CAUSE HE'S A KID.

123
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,916
- ( thinking ) PRAGUE P.D. CAN'T
HANDLE A PARAMILITARY SQUAD.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,708
DO I CALL THE LITTLE LADY?

125
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,208
TELL HER TO GET THE
HELL OUTTA THERE?

126
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,000
NO,
SHE'D FIGURE OUT I'M A MOLE.

127
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,375
- Black's voice: R, YOU ARE MY
RIGHT ARM AND HEX IS MY LEFT.

128
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,250
- BUT SHE'S A LEFT ARM
WHO DOESN'T LISTEN TO HER HEAD.

129
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,416
I WON'T GET A BETTER CHANCE
TO STOP HER.

130
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,791
AND IF I GOTTA BLOW COVER,
I'M GONNA DO IT KILLING HEX.

131
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,333
I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE KOKO'S CREW,
BUT SO BE IT.

132
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,875
- KOKO, THIS IS BAD.
CONTACT THE REST OF THE SQUAD.

133
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,958
TOO MANY EYES IN THE CROWD
ARE ON US.

134
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,541
WE'RE SURROUNDED.
- YEAH, I'M ON IT.

135
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,125
UNTIL LEHM AND THE REST
GET HERE, WE'LL HIDE BY THE--

136
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,833
- HIDING IN A CROWD ISN'T
ALWAYS THE SAFEST MOVE, GIRLY.

137
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,458
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!

138
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,000
- HEAD'S UP.

139
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,333
- JONAH!

140
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,958
- ( gunshots )
- ( people screaming )

141
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,625
- WE HAVE SHOTS FIRED!
- ( all shouting )

142
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,416
- WHAT'D I SAY?
DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

143
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,791
- JONAH.  JONAH!
- GET DOWN, KOKO!

144
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,791
- HA HA! YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD,
KID, TO DROP BOTTS LIKE THAT.

145
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,958
- YOU'RE NEXT.
- ( grunting )

146
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,750
- EXCUSE ME, MA'AM, YOU'RE--
- WHOOPS, YOU'RE IN MY WAY.

147
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,541
- R?

148
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,333
- YOU GUYS
GET BEHIND THE CAR!

149
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,333
- DAMN IT.
CAN SOMEONE THROW ME A WEAPON?

150
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,333
- JONAH, YOUR GEAR.

151
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,833
- WOW,
HER CREW MOVES FAST.

152
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,666
I WASN'T EXPECTING KOKO
TO HAVE BACK-UP HERE ALREADY.

153
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,625
- R: KOKO.

154
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,416
THIS WHOLE TIME
I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR BOOK MAN.

155
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,875
I'M A SPY.
I AM SO SORRY, LITTLE LADY.

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,166
AFTER I TAKE OUT HEX,
I'LL DISAPPEAR.

157
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,333
YOU'LL NEVER SEE
OR HEAR FROM ME AGAIN.

158
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,750
- THAT CAN'T BE.  R!

159
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,416
- Man:
A FIREFIGHT HAS BROKEN OUT.

160
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,916
- GOOD LUCK, RENATO.

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,625
- ( gunshots )

162
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,041
- DAMN IT, HEX,
I'LL KILL YOU!

163
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,375
- COME ON.

164
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,333
JONAH!

165
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,416
- SEAL THEIR EXITS.
NO ESCAPE.

166
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,291
- THAT GUY WHO JUST SHOWED UP,

167
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,791
IS THAT THE ONE KOKO CALLS R?
- YEAH.

168
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,375
THAT'S FUCKIN' HIM,
ALL RIGHT.

169
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,583
- THEN LET'S TAKE HIM OUT
RIGHT NOW

170
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,458
BEFORE HE CAN COVER
THEIR RETREAT.

171
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:51,166
SNIPERS A,
POWELL AND STYLES,

172
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,583
SNIPERS B,
GODUNOV AND RICKMAN,

173
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,625
YOUR TARGET, R.

174
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,458
HE'S--
- ( cell phone vibrating )

175
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,083
- AH!
- ( laughing ) 

176
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,208
YOU MORON.
- HE'S GOOD.

177
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,958
AND THERE'S EIGHT MORE
JUST LIKE HIM.

178
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,875
BUT I LIKE
MY FRIENDS' CHANCES BETTER.

179
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,541
BOSS, CALL FOR BACKUP.

180
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,375
- ( gunfire continues )

181
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:25,791
- Jonah: KOKO.  KOKO!
- JONAH.

182
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,041
- I-- I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS.

183
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,833
MUSTA BEEN THAT SHOT.

184
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,791
FORGET ME, JUST RUN AWAY.

185
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,833
- JONAH!

186
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,500
- HEY, SAW,
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

187
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,916
- ABORT THE OPERATION
IMMEDIATELY.

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
THAT'S AN ORDER, HEX.
- ( Hex laughing )

189
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,875
SORRY, THAT TRAIN'S ALREADY
LEFT THE STATION.

190
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,666
IT'S A LITTLE LATE
TO STOP IT NOW.

191
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,500
IN FACT, I DON'T THINK
YOU EVER COULD HAVE STOPPED ME.

192
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,125
EVEN IF YOU CAME IN PERSON,
BEGGING ON YOUR KNEES.

193
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,625
UNDERSHAFT'S
ABOUT MAKING HER YOUR PUPPET.

194
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,666
BUT I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING
ABOUT KOKO.

195
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,583
NO MATTER HOW MUCH ENERGY
YOU SPEND

196
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,250
TRYING TO BRING HER
INTO YOUR FOLD,

197
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,958
EVENTUALLY
SHE WILL BECOME A MONSTER.

198
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,375
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO DANCE
WITH A MONSTER, CHIEF?

199
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,041
YOU MARK MY WORDS--

200
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,791
OPERATION UNDERSHAFT
WILL NEVER TRULY SUCCEED.

201
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,000
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE TERRORIST MIND.

202
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,708
- ARE YOU FINISHED?

203
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,458
YOU REVEALED YOUR TRUE LOYALTIES
TOWARD ME AND UNDERSHAFT

204
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,250
THE SECOND YOU DECIDED
TO TARGET MY RIGHT ARM.

205
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,958
WATCH YOURSELF.

206
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,833
- ( cell phone vibrating )
- R: SAW!

207
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,333
I NEED A REMOTE START
ON THIS SILVER SEDAN.

208
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,541
- SOMEONE HACK
THAT CAR'S AUTO-START.

209
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,416
- ( car starts )

210
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
- THANKS.
ONE MORE THING--

211
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,875
FIND A WAY TO GET LEHM
AND THE OTHERS HERE.

212
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,041
- DON'T WORRY,
I ALREADY TOOK CARE OF IT

213
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,750
BY WAY OF AN ANONYMOUS CALL.

214
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,375
- R-- R?

215
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,750
IT'S OKAY THAT YOU'RE A SPY.
I WON'T TELL THE OTHERS.

216
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,291
I PROMISE YOU.

217
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,791
- STOP THAT.

218
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,791
I NEED THE LITTLE LADY BACK.
GET IT TOGETHER.

219
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,000
FIRST THING I NEED YOU
TO DO IS GET JONAH

220
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,166
TO A HOSPITAL, OKAY?

221
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,791
- ALL RIGHT,
ARE WE TAKING HIM OUT OR NOT?

222
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,541
COME ON, BOSS, WHICH IS IT?

223
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,833
- JONAH, COME ON!

224
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,958
( grunting )

225
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,208
BASTARD!

226
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,125
- Man: SHIT, HE GOT ICO!

227
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,833
AND THEY GOT
THAT CAR STARTED.

228
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,791
WHAT THE HELL'S GOIN' ON?

229
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,333
- THERE WERE 10 TOTAL.

230
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,500
A FEW MUST BE
IN SNIPER POSITIONS.

231
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,208
HIT 'EM
WITH EVERYTHING YOU GOT.

232
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,208
- R, NO.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

233
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,916
- WHEN THE OTHERS GET HERE,

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,833
I'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE CHAOS AND HIGHTAIL IT.

235
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,916
SO THAT'S IT.
KOKO HEKMATYAR, SEE YOU SOON,

236
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,791
IN THE NEXT LIFE.
NOW GO!

237
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,083
- NOW I SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

238
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,041
YOU'RE A VERY BRAVE AGENT, R.

239
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,708
- ( tires squeal )

240
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,958
- R!

241
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,541
- WHOA, YOU'RE WAY HOTTER
THAN I EXPECTED.

242
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,500
COME ON,
LET'S DO THIS.

243
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,583
SHOW ME WHAT YA GOT!
- ( both firing )

244
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,541
- R: GUYS.

245
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,416
- THAT'S THEIR CAR.
OPEN FIRE!

246
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,333
- ( bullet zinging )

247
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,541
- SNIPER TEAM A,
NEUTRALIZED.

248
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,708
- ( tires squeal )

249
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,208
- SNIPER TEAM B, NEUTRALIZED.

250
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,166
- YOU GAVE THEM
MY GUYS' LOCATIONS?

251
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,833
HOW COULD YOU?

252
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:52,041
YOU DOUBLE CROSSED ME
FOR SOME TERRORIST SYMPATHIZER?

253
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,833
DAMN YOU, BOOK MAN.

254
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,750
DON'T THINK I WAS TRYING
TO KILL THEM OUT OF VENGEANCE.

255
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:00,291
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO DO WHAT
WAS BEST FOR THE COUNTRY I LOVE.

256
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,750
KOKO HEKMATYAR
WILL BECOME A MONSTER.

257
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,083
SHE WILL THREATEN OUR HOMELAND.

258
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,250
AND THE DAY SHE CHOMPS DOWN
ON YOU,

259
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,208
I HOPE YOU REMEMBER
I WAS RIGHT.

260
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,708
- HEY, BOSS,
WE'RE LOSING HERE.

261
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,250
JUST THREE OF US LEFT.

262
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:21,166
WHAT'RE YOUR ORDERS?  HEX?

263
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,375
- Hex: WE'RE RETREATING.

264
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,791
- Lehm: YOU DONE REAL GOOD
SAVING KOKO AND JONAH.

265
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:45,208
BUT DAMN, IT HURTS
LOSIN' A GOOD MAN LIKE YOU, R.

266
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,375
KOKO, R'S DEAD.

267
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,375
- UNDERSTOOD.

268
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,875
FOR NOW,
REGROUP THE REST OF THE SQUAD.

269
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,666
JONAH'S GONNA BE OKAY.
BYE.

270
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,041
- ( phone beeps )

271
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,000
- R.

272
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:24,166
- ( ringing )
- Man: H.C.L.I. HEADQUARTERS.

273
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,250
- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE TRACKING HER.

274
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,958
- YES, MA'AM,
WE HAVE A LOCK ON THE TARGETS.

275
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,458
- DON'T LOSE HER.

276
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,458
IF YOU DO,
I'LL COME DOWN THERE

277
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,833
AND BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT
MYSELF.

278
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,833
ECHO TOLD ME
I SHOULD ALWAYS BE SMILING.

279
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,958
BUT R ALWAYS SAID

280
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,291
HE COULDN'T TELL
WHAT I WAS THINKING,

281
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,708
THAT I WAS HIDING MY FEELINGS
BEHIND A CHESHIRE GRIN.

282
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,208
AND HE TOLD ME
THAT IT WASN'T NECESSARY.

283
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,208
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

284
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,083
- DOESN'T MATTER,
YOU'RE STILL A GOOD PERSON.

285
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,583
- I'M AN ARMS DEALER.
HOW THE HELL AM I A GOOD PERSON?

286
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,333
I'M SORRY, VALMET.

287
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,458
- YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE
NOT GOOD. YOU'RE GREAT.

288
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,041
SOMEDAY IN THE FUTURE
YOU'LL REALIZE YOUR DREAM.

289
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,416
TRUST ME.
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY HEART.

290
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,708
R FELT THE SAME WAY
ABOUT YOU.

291
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,916
IT'S WHY HE GAVE HIS LIFE
IN BATTLE.

292
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,083
DON'T YOU SEE THAT?
COME ON, KOKO.

293
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,291
LET'S GET BACK TO THE OTHERS.

294
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,250
- OH, VALMET,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL HEALED.

295
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,791
- THANKS,
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.

296
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,708
JUST ONE THING, KOKO,

297
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,333
IS THERE A REASON
WHY YOU'RE GROPING MY BOOBS?

298
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,750
I LOVE IT, OF COURSE,
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR STYLE.

299
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,458
- IN REMEMBRANCE OF R.

300
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,625
- WHY ME?

301
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,916
WHY SHOULD A PATRIOT
BE FORCED TO HIDE IN CAVES

302
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
LIKE THE SCUM SHE HUNTS?

303
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,208
WHAT KIND OF GOVERNMENT
TURNS ON THOSE

304
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,625
WHO WOULD DIE TO DEFEND IT?

305
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,291
I AM JUSTICE.

306
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,458
- WE'RE BACK
FROM THE SUPPLY RUN.

307
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,458
WE GOT YA SOME FRESH FOOD
AND CLEAN BANDAGES FOR YOUR EYE.

308
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,541
- WHAT'S THAT SOUND?
- ( jet hissing )

309
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,250
- IT'S A B52,
A BOMBER FROM OUR OWN COUNTRY.

310
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,916
I REALLY PISSED YOU OFF,
DIDN'T I, KOKO HEKMATYAR?

311
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,333
VERY WELL.

312
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,166
I LOOK FORWARD
TO OUR NEXT BATTLE IN HELL.

313
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,708
- THE DEED IS DONE.

314
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,250
- ( phone beeps )

315
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,250
- JONAH BROUGHT YOU FLOWERS, R.

316
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,541
- I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SAVED BOTH OF OUR LIVES.

317
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,958
SO BRAVE.
- HE SURE WAS.

318
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,416
- SO, THANK YOU, R.

319
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,416
- Tojo: KOKO.

320
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,166
- IT'S NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU,
MISS HEKMATYAR.

321
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,250
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND ME
NOT BRINGING FLOWERS.

322
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,083
IN MY LINE OF WORK,
YOU LEARN NOT TO GET EMOTIONAL.

323
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:02,083
- WELL, IT'S CHIEF BLACK
OF THE N.C.S.'S EUROPEAN OFFICE.

324
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,791
YOU'RE HERE ALONE?
AND UNARMED, I HOPE.

325
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,375
- I'M UNARMED.

326
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,583
DO I LOOK LIKE I'M HERE
FOR A SHOOT-OUT?

327
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,250
CALL ME BOOK MAN.

328
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,375
ADEEB IF YOU PREFER,
OR BURRATINAIO.

329
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,291
IN FACT, YOU CAN CALL ME
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

330
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,833
BUT YOU
DON'T GET TO CALL ME SAW.

331
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,541
- BOOK MAN, THEN.

332
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,208
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP
WITH THE GUNFIGHT IN PRAGUE.

333
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,125
- SURE.
IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

334
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,791
BUT YOU CAN SKIP
THE FALSE GRATITUDE.

335
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,500
I'M IMPRESSED
THAT YOU COULD FIND THIS PLACE.

336
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,083
IT'S A REAL NICE SPOT.

337
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,916
R, REST IN PEACE.

338
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,125
LIMITER. HUH.
- WHAT'S THAT?

339
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:50,416
- THE BEST P.O.O.s MAKE
THEMSELVES IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.

340
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,166
AS YOU CARRY ON WITH YOUR WORK,

341
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,208
I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE WARY
OF HEX'S SHADOW.

342
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,458
- THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
I'LL BE CAREFUL.

343
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,041
- I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO GO.

344
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,125
KOKO HEKMATYAR,

345
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,875
HOW MANY ROCKETS
HAVE YOU LAUNCHED?

346
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,833
- WHAT?  NO IDEA.

347
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,041
SAYONARA.

348
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,541
( laughs )

349
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,916
SO THAT'S YOUR PAL,
THE BOOK MAN.

350
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
SEEMS LIKE HE'S A REAL STICK
IN THE MUD.

351
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,625
I'M SURE YOU HAD WAY MORE FUN
WITH ME.

352
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,708
'SPECIALLY
THE DRINKING PARTIES.

353
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,458
THANK YOU,
AND GOODBYE, RENATO.

354
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,041
WE'LL MEET AGAIN.

355
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,166
- ( theme music playing )


356
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,166
- ( cell phone vibrating )
- THIS IS BLACK.  WHAT IS IT?

357
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,125
- Man: BOOK MAN, YOU ALONE?

358
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,166
YOU MIGHT WANNA
SIT DOWN FOR THIS.

359
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,166
- CALM DOWN, SON.
WHAT'S WRONG?

360
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,708
- THERE WAS AN AIR RAID
ON A MOUNTAIN RANGE

361
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,125
ALONG THE TURKEY-IRAQ BORDER.

362
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,875
WE THINK KOKO WAS BEHIND IT,
SIR.

363
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,208
SEEMS SHE USED
A RECONDITIONED HEAVY BOMBER.

364
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,458
IT DROPPED ENOUGH TONNAGE
THAT THE DEBRIS PLUME

365
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,666
SHOWED UP ON OUR SATELLITES.

366
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,500
THE GROUND TEAM
SAYS THEY FOUND TINY TRACES

367
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,791
OF THREE BODIES.

368
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,666
D.N.A.
MATCHED ONE OF THEM TO HEX.

369
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,666
- Black: I'VE LOST MY RIGHT
AND LEFT ARMS.

370
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,875
KOKO IS A MONSTER.

371
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,458
- SHE'S CREATED A PATH
TO RE-CONNECT WITH HER HUMANITY

372
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,083
AND ABANDON HER LIFE
AS AN ARMS DEALER.

373
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,791
- FROM ALL I'VE LEARNED
ABOUT HER,

374
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,958
SHE DOESN'T WALK AWAY
FROM ANYTHING.

375
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,583
- OPERATION UNDERSHAFT
WILL NEVER TRULY SUCCEED.

376
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,250
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE TERRORIST MIND.

377
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,208
- OH, YOU JUST SIT BACK
AND WATCH.

378
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,708
I'LL HAVE THE LITTLE LADY
DANCING TO MY TUNE

379
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,916
UNTIL SHE'S GASPING
FOR BREATH.

380
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,791
I'D ALWAYS PLANNED
TO JOIN THE MILITARY

381
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:03,791
AND GET MY HANDS DIRTY
IN THE FIELD, LIKE YOU.

382
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,333
- YOU DON'T SAY?

383
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,250
WELL,
KNOWING WHAT I KNOW NOW,

384
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,666
YOU CLEARLY
MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

385
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,333
- WELL, MY DREAMS
OF BEING A MARINE

386
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,500
WENT DOWN THE DRAIN FAST.

387
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,750
INJURED MY BACK
RIGHT OUT OF ANNAPOLIS.

388
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,250
THOUGH I'M BEGINNING TO SEE

389
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,333
THAT SOME OF THE METHODS
I USE IN MY CURRENT POST

390
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,750
AREN'T ALL THAT DIFFERENT.

391
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,291
AH, LISTEN TO ME
RATIONALIZING.

392
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,875
- R: HA HA! I THINK IT WAS
YOUR BODY WARNING YOU

393
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,000
THAT YOU JUST WEREN'T BUILT
FOR THAT KIND OF STUFF.

394
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:35,333
- ( laughing )
SHUT UP.

395
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,000
