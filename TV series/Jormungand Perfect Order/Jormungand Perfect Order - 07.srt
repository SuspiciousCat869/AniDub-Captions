1
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:11,083
- ( gunfire )

2
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:27,750
- Lehm: YO, WILEE!
LOOKING FOR A WILEE COYOTE.


3
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,916
ANYBODY SEEN A WILEE COYOTE?


4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
MAJORED IN ARCHITECTURE
AT UVA?


5
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:35,291
SAPPER IN THE 20th ENGINEER
BRIGADE, 18th AIRBORNE CORPS.


6
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,750
WHERE THE FUCK IS
LIEUTENANT WILLIAM NELSON?

7
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,458
- I'M WILLIAM NELSON.
YES, SIR.

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,041
- AH-HA, SO YOU DO EXIST.
CAPTAIN LEHMBRICK,

9
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,958
FIRST SPECIAL FORCES
OPERATIONAL DETACHMENT, DELTA.

10
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:49,375
MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD OF US.

11
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,750
IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU.

12
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,916
- SIR, IT'S AN HONOR
TO MEET YOU.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,125
- I'M GONNA PUT YOUR PARTICULAR
SKILL SET TO WORK, CAVALIER.

14
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,458
- DELTA FORCE.

15
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,750
WHAT COULD THEY POSSIBLY WANT
WITH ME?

16
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,666
IF YOU GUYS ARE DELTA FORCE,
DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE GOING

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,583
ON A SCUD HUNT?  ARE WE GONNA
BLOW UP SOME OF SADDAM'S TELS?

18
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:12,000
- Lehm: SOMEBODY'S GOT
A HARD-ON TO SEE SOME ACTION,

19
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:15,666
BUT THIS AIN'T THAT BIG A JOB.
NO NEED TO GET TOO WORKED UP.

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,291
THERE'LL BE FOUR OF US,
PLUS YOU.

21
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,666
WE'RE DEMOLISHING
A CHEMICAL WEAPONS PLANT.

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,875
ONE OF OUR SPY SATELLITES WAS
ABLE TO LOCATE THE PLANT

23
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,375
AT THE FOOT OF A MOUNTAIN
IN NORTHERN IRAQ.

24
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:27,041
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FLATTEN THE
PLACE WITHIN THE NEXT 40 HOURS.

25
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:30,333
WE GOT NO PICTURES OF THE INSIDE
OF THIS THING.

26
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,375
SO THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN
WITH YOUR EXPERTISE

27
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:36,000
IN EXPLOSIVE DEMOLITION.
I'M COUNTING ON YOU TO LEVEL IT

28
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,666
WITH ONLY A LIMITED SUPPLY
OF FIREWORKS.

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,875
- SIR, THIS SOUNDS LIKE
A BIG JOB TO ME.

30
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:45,000
I'VE ONLY EVER WRITTEN A THESIS
ON STRUCTURAL DEMOLITION.


31
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,541
- WELL, YOU GOT EXPERIENCE AS
A COMBAT ENGINEER, DON'T YOU?


32
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,208
EASE UP, YOU'LL BE FINE.

33
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,041
- Echo: CAPTAIN,
IS THIS THE FAMOUS WILEE?

34
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,208
WILEE, THIS HERE IS
SERGEANT FIRST-CLASS ARKIN.

35
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,625
- GOOD TO MEET YOU, SOLDIER.

36
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,250
- AND BEHIND THE WHEEL'S
SERGEANT HOWE.

37
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,291
- S'UP, MAN?
- RIGHT, ALMOST FORGOT,

38
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,333
I'M LIEUTENANT ECKHART,
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME "ECHO."

39
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,458
- NICE TO MEET YOU.  NELSON.

40
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,541
- I TOLD ECKHART TO DROP THE
NICKNAME SO WE DON'T CONFUSE IT

41
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,875
FOR THE ICAO WORD FOR "E,"
BUT HE'S STUBBORN.

42
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:13,000
ALLOW ME TO FORMALLY INTRODUCE
LIEUTENANT WILEE NELSON,


43
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,541
OUR HASTY EXPLOSIVES FREAK.
BE GENTLE ON HIM, BOYS.


44
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,500
- ( all laughing )

45
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,500
- Echo: "CAPTAIN LEHMBRICK"
CAN BE A MOUTHFUL,

46
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,208
SO YOU CAN JUST CALL
HIM "LEHM."

47
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,875
"CAP'N" OR "OLD FART" WORK, TOO.

48
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,250
- I'M NOT THAT OLD A FART, AM I?
- ( laughs )

49
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,416
OH, WILEE, ALMOST FORGOT.
- YES, SIR.

50
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,416
- SORRY, BUT THIS IS ALL WE GOT
TO GO OFF OF.

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,125
- ( engine sputters )
- ( shouting )

52
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,916
- GUESSING THE PILLARS
WERE BUILT HERE.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,291
- Echo: CHILL OUT, DUDE,
IT'S ALL GOOD.

54
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,291
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE GUARDS.

55
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,000
GIVING YOU PLENTY OF TIME
TO PLANT YOUR EXPLOSIVES.

56
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,541
WAIT, BOTH YOUR PARENTS

57
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,166
AND YOUR GRANDPA
ARE ARCHITECTS?

58
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,291
THEN YOU WENT TO SCHOOL
TO STUDY ARCHITECTURE

59
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,666
JUST SO YOU COULD JOIN THE ARMY
AND BLOW BUILDINGS UP,

60
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,291
INSTEAD OF DESIGNING 'EM?
HOLY SHIT, DUDE.

61
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,833
YOU'RE EVEN CRAZIER THAN WE ARE.
- ( all laughing )

62
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,125
- Lehm: ALL RIGHT, LADIES, LET'S
START CLIMBING DOWN THIS ROCK.

63
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,791
- THEY'RE LIKE COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PEOPLE

64
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,833
THAN A MINUTE AGO.

65
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:26,208
SO THIS IS DELTA FORCE.
THESE GUYS ARE GOOD.

66
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,208
WHILE WE WERE JUST SHOOTING
THE SHIT UP THERE,

67
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,541
WHILE ECHO WAS DRAWING ME
INTO CONVERSATION,

68
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:34,458
WE REACHED THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS PLANT.

69
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,916
THEY'RE MACHINES.
- OH!

70
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,250
THEY'RE LIKE FREE-MOVING TURRETS
THAT HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED ONLY

71
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,416
TO SEEK AND DESTROY THE ENEMY.

72
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,000
- ALL CLEAR.
- HE'S SO CALM.

73
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,958
HE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THEY'RE
JUST CLEANING HOUSE.

74
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,416
- YOU CAN COME OUT, WILEE.
FOLLOW US.

75
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,750
- ( grunting )

76
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,416
NOT LIKE I HAVE A CHOICE HERE.

77
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,166
- WE WASTED MOST OF THE GUARDS,
BUT REINFORCEMENTS

78
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,166
WILL BE HERE SOON.
YOU'RE UP, CAVALIER.

79
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,958
WORK FASTER THAN
YOU'VE EVER WORKED BEFORE.

80
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,541
- YES, SIR!

81
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,500
I EXPECTED SOMETHING LIKE THIS,
BUT DAMN IT,

82
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,541
HOW MANY OF THESE STUPIDLY HUGE
SUPPORT PILLARS ARE IN HERE?

83
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,416
ALL FIVE OF US CARRIED
IN EXPLOSIVES,

84
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,958
BUT IT'S NOWHERE
NEAR ENOUGH.  UNLESS...

85
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,958
- FUCK.  WILEE!

86
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,875
- THAT IS SOME INTENSE
FOCUS YOU GOT THERE.

87
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,208
YOU ARE ONE CRAZY
DAMN COYOTE.

88
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,083
- ECHO, I NEED A HAND.

89
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,041
- YOU GOT IT.
WHAT'S UP?

90
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,875
- Wilee:
THIS SHOULD BE FAR ENOUGH.

91
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,416
PLUS, THAT'S ALL
THE DET CORD WE GOT.

92
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,125
- HIT IT.
- YES, SIR.

93
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,833
HOLY SHIT.
IT ACTUALLY WORKED.

94
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:32,583
- WHOA!  WE FLATTENED THAT
THING LIKE A DAMN PANCAKE.

95
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,125
AND HERE I THOUGHT

96
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,708
IT WAS GONNA BE MORE
OF A BIG KABOOM, YOU KNOW?

97
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,208
BUT THAT LOOKED SO CLEAN
AND PROFESSIONAL.

98
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,041
- IT WAS AWESOME.
- SHORT AS WE WERE ON EXPLOSIVES

99
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,833
IT WAS PRETTY DAMN CLEVER
TO RIG WHAT LITTLE WE HAD

100
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,500
TO THE 250-GAUGE CHEMICAL BOMBS
IN THERE.

101
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,916
I'D SAY THAT'S WORTHY
OF ADMIRATION.

102
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,500
- WINTER, 1991.

103
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,125
I HAD THE PRIVILEGE
OF WITNESSING FIRSTHAND A TEAM

104
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,458
OF ELITE SOLDIERS IN ACTION.

105
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,166
THEY WERE BOTH TERRIFYING

106
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,791
AND AWE-INSPIRING.

107
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,500
AND AFTER EARNING THEIR PRAISE,
I HAD ONLY ONE GOAL.

108
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,416
- ECHO.
- HUH?  WILEE.

109
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,958
FANCY SEEING YOU HERE IN
FAYETTE-NAM.  IT'S BEEN FOREVER.

110
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,083
SO I HEAR YOU'VE BEEN
KILLING IT IN YOUR OTC.

111
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:28,333
COME COP A SQUAT.
YOU ACED THE FINAL EXAM, HUH?

112
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,541
CONGRATULATIONS, I GUESS THAT
MAKES US COLLEAGUES NOW.

113
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,250
- THANKS, YEAH, I GUESS IT DOES.

114
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,583
MEET EXPLOSIVES EXPERT
WILEE COYOTE.

115
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,500
- OH, COOL, LIKE THE CARTOON?

116
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,291
- SO HOW'S CAPTAIN LEHM DOING?

117
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,625
- WELL, IT'S MAJOR LEHM
AND HE RETIRED.

118
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,083
- HUH?
- YOU WANNA SEE HIM?

119
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,875
I CAN GIVE YOU HIS CONTACT INFO.

120
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,083
- THAT'D BE COOL.
- WAIT A SEC.

121
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,375
DID YOU ALWAYS HAVE THOSE LINES
SHAVED ABOVE YOUR EARS?

122
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,125
- Woman: OOH, THAT'S HOT.

123
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,958
- THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT SHOT BACK
IN THE GULF WAR, RIGHT?

124
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,416
DON'T TELL ME,
THE HAIR WOULDN'T GROW BACK

125
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,250
SO YOU SHAVED THE OTHER SIDE
TO MATCH?

126
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,708
YOU'RE AS CRAZY
AS EVER, WILEE.

127
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,958
- ( all laughing )

128
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,541
- Wilee: SO I WENT TO FIND LEHM,
THE MAN I'D SO ADMIRED

129
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,333
AND THAT'S
WHEN I FIRST MET KOKO.

130
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,833
ENCHANTED BY HER CHARISMA,

131
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,708
I LEFT THE ARMY
TO JOIN HER, TOO.

132
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,000
- NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
HE TELLS IT,

133
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,208
WILEE'S STORY IS ALWAYS A HIT.

134
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,458
- Jonah: GOOD STORY ABOUT
WHY WILEE SHAVES THOSE STREAKS.

135
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,708
- ( laughing )
- Koko: OH, JONAH.

136
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,916
IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY THING
YOU GOT OUT OF WILEE'S STORY?

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,375
- YOU HAVE MEN ON YOUR SQUAD
WHO SERVED IN THE GULF WAR?

138
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,125
- ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO,
THEY CAME HERE TO FIGHT,

139
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,958
BUT NOW THEY'VE RETURNED TO HELP
US BUILD A SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN.

140
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,500
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW
MUCH THIS WARMS MY HEART.

141
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,500
- OH, NAZAL.  WE'RE NOT HERE
BECAUSE WE WANNA BE.

142
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,500
IT'S JUST BAD FOR MY IMAGE IF
ALL I EVER DO IS SELL WEAPONS,

143
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,708
SO THIS COSTLY PR STUNT IS
ABOUT REPAIRING MY REPUTATION,

144
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,083
NOT YOUR COUNTRY'S
CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE.

145
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,916
- THAT IS ONE BLUNT WOMAN.

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,333
- I'VE GOT MY OWN GROUP

147
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,875
OF HIGHLY SKILLED
PERSONAL BODYGUARDS,

148
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:08,041
SO I DON'T NEED SOME LAME-ASS
BRITISH PMC LIKE EXCALIBUR,

149
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,250
OR AN INTERPRETER LIKE YOU,
FOR THAT MATTER.

150
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,333
I SPEAK ARABIC AS WELL
AS YOU DO.

151
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,583
- I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE,
MS. HEKMATYAR,

152
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,208
BUT PLEASE TEMPER
YOUR FRUSTRATION.

153
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,750
FOR A CONVOY OF TEN TRUCKS,

154
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,666
YOU NEED A MINIMUM OF 20 GUARDS
TO ENSURE SAFE PASSAGE.

155
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,458
THAT IS COMMON PRACTICE
AMONG ALL PMCs IN IRAQ.

156
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,833
SO YES, YOU DO NEED THEM.

157
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,708
AS TO MY NECESSITY,

158
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:33,625
IT SEEMS NO ONE
IN EXCALIBUR UNDERSTANDS ARABIC.

159
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,541
- DAMN, I WANNA SHOOT SOMETHING.

160
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,250
- HELL, YEAH, I GOT WAY
TOO MUCH PENT-UP ENERGY.

161
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,958
- NEVER MIND THAT.  YOU SEE
THE JUBBLIES ON THAT ONE BIRD?

162
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:44,500
BLEEDIN' MASSIVE.
- RIGHT?  CAN'T MISS 'EM.

163
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,833
I'D THROW MYSELF
ON THOSE GRENADES.

164
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,125
- JEEZ, THEY KNOW IT'S
AN OPEN CHANNEL, RIGHT?

165
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,208
FUCKING MORONS.

166
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,625
- KOKO, CAR APPROACHING
FAST FROM BEHIND.

167
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,833
IT MIGHT TRY TO PASS.
- COPY, JONAH.

168
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,750
WHOEVER'S IN BACK,
CHECK IT OUT.

169
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,875
- Tojo: AN OLD MAN BY HIMSELF.
SHOULDN'T GIVE US ANY TROUBLE.

170
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,958
- Mao: NOT SEEING ANY WEAPONS.

171
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,166
- HE'S HOSTILE.
LET'S TAKE HIM DOWN.

172
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,875
- OH!
- ( laughing )

173
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,750
- Lutz: WHAT THE FUCK?!
CEASE FIRE.  CEASE FIRE!

174
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,250
- IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

175
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,125
- ( tires screeching )

176
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,083
- WHOO!
DAMN, THAT FELT GOOD.

177
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,083
- Lehm:
THESE GUYS ARE INSANE.

178
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,750
- IF WE STOP THE CONVOY OVER
EVERY LITTLE BUMP IN THE ROAD,

179
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,500
IT'LL TAKE US DAYS
TO GET THERE.

180
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,541
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
KIND OF CAKEWALK 

181
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,000
SUNDAY-IN-THE-PARK PLACES
YOU BEEN SELLING YOUR SHIT,

182
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,750
LADY, BUT THIS IS I-FUCKIN'-RAQ.

183
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:45,083
- I'M AWARE, BUT YOU DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT HOW LONG

184
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,958
IT'S GOING TO TAKE US
TO GET THERE,

185
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,125
BECAUSE I'M FIRING YOUR ASSES.
- HUH?

186
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,958
- WHAT, ARE YOUR EARS FULL
OF CRAP, TOO?

187
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,625
AND DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT

188
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,333
LAYING SO MUCH AS
A FINGER ON MY WARES.

189
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,291
NOW GET THE HELL OUT
OF MY SIGHT,

190
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,833
YOU LIMEY THUGS!

191
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,166
SORRY ABOUT THAT, GUYS.

192
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,333
I WENT BARGAIN SHOPPING
FOR ESCORTS.

193
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,958
I DIDN'T KNOW THE PAY SCALE WAS
DIRECTLY RELATED TO THEIR IQ.

194
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,833
- ( laughing )

195
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,666
- BY THE WAY, I'VE ASKED
EXCALIBUR'S INTERPRETER NAZAL

196
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,791
TO STAY ON AND
DRIVE TRUCK SEVEN FOR US.

197
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,291
AND HE AIN'T CHEAP
BY ANY DEFINITION OF THE WORD.

198
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,083
- ( all laughs )

199
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,541
- I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED A PMC
QUITE LIKE THIS ONE BEFORE.

200
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,208
- VALMET,
IT'S BEEN FOREVER

201
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,458
SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU DRIVE
A SEMI LIKE THIS.

202
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,958
YOU LOOK SO COOL.
- ( gasps ) DO YOU THINK SO?

203
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,375
DOES THIS MEAN
YOU'RE FALLING

204
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,541
EVEN DEEPER IN LOVE WITH ME
THEN BEFORE?

205
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,500
I WAS IN THE MECHANIZED
JAEGER SQUAD,

206
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,000
SO MY BODY STILL REMEMBERS HOW
TO DRIVE ALL KINDS

207
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,291
OF ARMORED CARS AND TRANSPORTS.

208
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,708
KOKO, YOU WANNA LEARN HOW?

209
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,250
I COULD GUIDE YOUR HANDS
AND FEET,

210
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,541
PUTTING THAT ON HOLD A MOMENT,
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

211
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,916
- SURE ABOUT WHAT?
DITCHING EXCALIBUR?

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,250
- NO, WE'RE MUCH SAFER
WITHOUT THOSE SCUMBAGS.

213
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,333
WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT
IS KEEPING NAZAL WITH US.

214
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,458
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN USE HIS HELP,
SINCE WE'RE SHORT A DRIVER,

215
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,958
BUT THAT WHOLE, "I HAVE SOME
FREE TIME NOW THAT EXCALIBUR'S

216
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,875
BEEN DISMISSED SO I WANNA GO
HOME, WHICH JUST SO HAPPENS

217
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,500
TO BE NEAR YOUR DESTINATION SO I
MIGHT AS WELL LEND A HAND" THING

218
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,458
SOUNDS PRETTY SUSPICIOUS TO ME.

219
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,625
I BET THEY LEFT HIM BEHIND TO
REPORT OUR LOCATION.  HE'S A--

220
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:23,833
- DRINK UP,
IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAY HYDRATED.

221
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,750
- IT IS KIND OF SHADY THEY
DIDN'T PUT UP MUCH OF A FIGHT.

222
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,666
JUDGING BY PAST EXPERIENCE,
MACHO THUGS LIKE THAT

223
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,875
RARELY LEAVE JUST
'CAUSE YOU TELL 'EM TO.

224
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,583
HEY, GUYS, THESE GOODS AREN'T
EXACTLY WORTH MILLIONS,

225
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,208
SO FEEL FREE TO DITCH THE CONVOY
IF THEY COME BACK.

226
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,250
- KOKO, DO WE REALLY WANNA GET
STUCK OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE

227
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,916
OF THE DESERT WITHOUT WHEELS?
- HMM GOOD POINT, MAO.

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,708
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

229
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,916
IF THOSE CLOWNS FIRE SO MUCH AS
ONE SHOT, WE EXTERMINATE THEM.

230
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,416
- All: ROGER THAT.

231
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,416
- Valmet:
WAY TO ISSUE A BADASS ORDER.

232
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,750
- WOW, THESE PEOPLE ARE PRETTY
DAMN CRAZY THEMSELVES.

233
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:58,333
- IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE
THOSE GUYS RETURN AND ATTACK US.

234
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,208
- FUNNY.  I WAS JUST THINKING
THE SAME THING.

235
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:05,583
NOWADAYS JOKERS LIKE THEM
ARE EVERYWHERE.

236
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:09,250
I SWEAR, THE WAY WARS ARE
FOUGHT CHANGES OVERNIGHT.

237
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:13,208
JUST KEEPS GETTING NASTIER
AND NASTIER.

238
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,625
CRIPES, WHEN WE FOUGHT OUT
HERE ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO,

239
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,541
PEOPLE WERE SAYING,
"IT LOOKS LIKE A VIDEO GAME."

240
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,083
CUT TO TODAY AND YOU GOT
FUCKING BUSINESSMEN MIXED IN

241
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,041
WITH THE SQUADS OUT THERE
FIGHTING.

242
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,875
- YOU SAID YOU WERE HERE
20 YEARS AGO.

243
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,416
YOU MEAN IN THE GULF WAR, RIGHT?

244
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,250
- WELL, LOOK WHOSE MATH
IS GETTING BETTER.

245
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,750
- I HEARD WILEE TALKING EARLIER
ABOUT HOW MUCH HE ADMIRED YOU

246
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,250
AS A SOLDIER BACK THEN.
- IS THAT SO?

247
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,541
I ASSUME HE USED THE WORDS
"MAJESTIC" AND "DIVINE"?

248
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,291
- YEAH, NO,
HE DIDN'T GO THAT FAR.

249
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,833
- I MUST'VE MISSED THIS

250
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,583
WHILE I WAS MONITORING
EXCALIBUR'S CHANNEL.

251
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,291
WHAT'S GOING ON, WILEE?

252
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,041
TURN NOSTALGIC THE SECOND
WE TOUCHED DOWN IN IRAQ?

253
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,791
HE'S GETTING UP THERE
IN YEARS HIMSELF NOW.

254
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,750
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, JONAH?

255
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,666
WHILE IT'S A GIVEN THAT
I'M A SUPER SOLDIER,

256
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,958
WILEE'S A DAMN IMPRESSIVE
WARRIOR IN HIS OWN RIGHT.

257
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,625
IN FACT, I'D GO SO FAR AS TO SAY
HE'S DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS.

258
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,750
- REALLY?
- LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY.

259
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:06,291
TWO MEMBERS OF OUR CREW HAVE
SPOTS ON THE FBI'S BLACKLIST,

260
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,708
THE BOSS LADY AND WILEE.

261
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,416
- HOLD ON A MINUTE.

262
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,416
THE AUTHORITIES CONSIDER HIM
JUST AS DANGEROUS AS KOKO?

263
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,291
- DAMN STRAIGHT.  LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING ABOUT WILEE.

264
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,916
THE REASON HE'S DRIVING
THE TRUCK UP AT THE FRONT,

265
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,291
IT'S 'CAUSE HE CAN
SNIFF OUT BOMBS.

266
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,666
COMES FROM HIS EXPERIENCE
AS A FORMER COMBAT ENGINEER.

267
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,416
NOT TO MENTION HE'S A CERTIFIED
EXPLOSIVES EXPERT

268
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,833
WHO'S BEEN ON TONS OF MISSIONS.

269
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,416
HE'S GOT A SIXTH SENSE

270
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,916
FOR KNOWING WHERE AN AMATEUR'S
PLANTED A BOMB.

271
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,041
EVER SINCE KOKO FIRST EMERGED
ON THE SCENE AS AN ARMS DEALER,

272
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,083
WE'VE HAD TO FEND OFF
BOMB THREATS.

273
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,000
WHEN YOUR DAD'S THE KING
OF INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING,

274
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,208
PEOPLE TEND TO TRY AND ABDUCT
OR KILL YOU ON A REGULAR BASIS.

275
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,625
YOU KNOW, "IF YOU DON'T WANNA
BE BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS,

276
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,250
GIVE US WHAT WE WANT."

277
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,541
WILEE MANAGED TO RENDER
ALL THOSE THREATS IDLE.

278
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,083
SEE, AFTER HANGING AROUND KOKO
LONG ENOUGH,

279
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,333
WILEE'S SKILLS GREW TO SURPASS

280
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,500
EVEN THE VERY
BEST BOMB-MAKERS OUT THERE.

281
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,291
HIS THING IS TO GIVE IT RIGHT
BACK TO THE WOULD-BE BOMBERS,

282
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,958
WHICH I BET CONFUSED
THE HELL OUT OF THE POLICE.

283
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,583
ALL THESE ASSASSINS
WHO WERE AFTER KOKO

284
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,916
STARTED BLOWING
THEMSELVES UP LEFT AN RIGHT.

285
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,916
WILEE WAS AN OBVIOUS SUSPECT,
BUT THEY WEREN'T HIS HANDIWORK.

286
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,125
AND THE ONLY PEOPLE
DYING WERE TERRORISTS.

287
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,625
THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME
IN TURKEY OR GREECE,

288
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,333
SOME GRIMY HOTEL PACKED
WITH ENOUGH EXPLOSIVES

289
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,791
TO BLOW IT SKY HIGH.

290
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,375
ARE WE GOOD?
- YEAH, PIECE OF CAKE.

291
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,708
- WHEN THE BOMB DIDN'T GO OFF,
THE CULPRIT WENT BACK INSIDE

292
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,833
TO SEE WHAT WAS WRONG.
- ( clicks )

293
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:31,166
- Lehm: THAT SIX-STORY HOTEL
BECAME FIVE STORIES.

294
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,958
- THAT SOUNDS PRETTY HORRIBLE.
- DON'T IT?

295
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,875
BLASTING THINGS TO BITS
IS LIKE A GAME TO HIM.

296
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,458
I BET ALL THE COMPLIMENTS
WE HEAPED ON HIM

297
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,958
DURING THE GULF WAR HELPED
TO FUEL THAT FIRE.

298
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,875
SUDDENLY,
ALL HE WANTED WAS TO SEE

299
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,375
COOLER AND COOLER EXPLOSIONS.

300
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,750
AND KOKO JUST ENCOURAGED HIM.

301
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,750
SHE WAS A SULLEN LITTLE BRAT
AT THE TIME,

302
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,708
BUT WILEE'S "ART" PUT HER
IN A BETTER MOOD.

303
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,375
FROM THERE, IT JUST KEPT GOING.

304
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,166
THE NEXT INCIDENT TOOK PLACE
IN A NORTH AFRICAN--

305
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,666
- THERE'S MORE?

306
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,791
- Koko: ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
TAKE A LOAD OFF.

307
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,250
- DAMN, I AM STARVING.
- STRETCH MY LEGS.

308
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,208
IT'S GOOD TO GET OUT
OF THERE FOR A MINUTE.

309
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,666
- PARDON, MS. HEKMATYAR,

310
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,666
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
FOR ME TO CALL MY WIFE?

311
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,750
- OH, BY ALL MEANS.
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

312
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,916
- JONAH, WANT AN ICE COLD
GRAPE SODA?

313
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,500
- OKAY, THANKS.

314
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,000
- ARE YOU SCARED OF ME?

315
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,041
AW, LEHM, I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'VE BEEN FILLING

316
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,750
THE KID'S HEAD
WITH STORIES ABOUT ME?

317
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,875
- SORRY, SOLDIER, 
THAT'S CLASSIFIED.

318
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,375
- ( all laughing )

319
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,416
- OH, THAT LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE.

320
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,041
THIS IS TRUCK ONE TO KOKO.

321
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,208
I'D LIKE US TO SLOW TO A STOP
IN ABOUT 60 SECONDS.

322
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,750
- NO PROBLEM, WILEE.
YOU SENSING A TRAP?

323
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,500
- YEP, CAN'T SAY
ANYTHING FOR SURE,

324
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,958
BUT THE TURN IN THE ROAD UP
AHEAD JUST SCREAMS AMBUSH TO ME.

325
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,250
I'LL DO A SWEEP TO SEE
IF THEY'VE PLANTED ANY BOMBS

326
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,958
- ( groaning )
- WHAT WAS THAT?

327
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,416
- WELL, IF THAT'S WHAT
YOUR GUT'S TELLING YOU,

328
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,208
EXCALIBUR IS BACK.

329
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,375
THEY'VE CONTACTED THE GROUP
THAT WENT AHEAD OF US

330
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,208
AND ARE PLANNING
A PINCER ATTACK.

331
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,500
THAT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
WE'LL HIT THEM FIRST.

332
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,833
ALL TRUCKS HALT!

333
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,291
LEHM, LUTZ, RIFLES.

334
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,125
- ( groaning )
HERE WE GO.

335
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,916
- NAZAL, ALL PHONE COMMUNICATION
IS NOW OFF-LIMITS, GOT IT?

336
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,083
- UNDERSTOOD.
VERY IMPRESSIVE, HCLI.

337
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,666
YOU IDENTIFIED THE AMBUSH POINT
BEFORE YOU EVEN GOT CLOSE.

338
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,666
WAS IT INSTINCT?  EXPERIENCE?

339
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,125
EXCALIBUR DOESN'T
STAND A CHANCE.

340
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,750
- MOVE, MOVE!

341
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,291
- Man: WHY ARE THEY ALL GETTING
OUT OF THEIR LORRIES?

342
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,000
- CONTACT NAZAL.
- I TRIED.

343
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,958
SON OF A BITCH AIN'T
PICKING UP.

344
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:01,833
- THEN CALL THE BLOODY TEAM
COMING FROM BEHIND.

345
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,291
- DAMN, IT'S HOT.
- WHAT'S THIS ONE UP TO?

346
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,625
- YOU WANT I SHOULD SNIPE HIM?
- YOU TWAT.

347
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,666
THAT WOULD DEFEAT THE WHOLE
PURPOSE OF STAGING THIS AMBUSH.

348
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,916
- THIS FEELS RIGHT.

349
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,625
LEAST IT'S WHERE
I'D HAVE PLANTED 'EM.

350
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,541
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

351
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,166
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, I'D SAY
THERE'S MORE ACROSS THE ROAD.

352
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,416
- Man: WHAT THE FUCK?

353
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,541
IS HE MESSING AROUND
WITH OUR IED?

354
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:29,083
- WHOA!  DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
THE PINCER ATTACK.

355
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,916
THEY ARE SO DEAD.

356
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,333
OI, WE SHOULD KIDNAP
THAT ARMS DEALER.

357
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,958
BET SHE'LL FETCH
A PRETTY RANSOM.

358
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,291
- YEAH, WE'LL ALL GET RICH OFF
THAT STUCK-UP BINT.

359
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,958
- WE GOT A PROBLEM

360
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,958
NEITHER THE AMBUSH TEAM
NOR NAZAL'S RESPONDING

361
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,958
AND THE CONVOY'S
STOPPED UP AHEAD.

362
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:48,166
- WORTHLESS FUCKING TWITS.
WE'LL JUST KILL THEM, TOO.

363
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,791
HUH?  WAIT, IS THAT THEM
RIGHT THERE--

364
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:52,916
- OH!

365
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,958
- WE'VE GOT INCOMING FIRE.

366
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,750
- Koko: LOOK OUT FOR THAT
M2 AUTO-CANNON.

367
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,750
DON'T LET 'EM USE IT.
- ON IT.

368
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,791
- SHIT'S HITTING THE FAN NOW.

369
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,375
- OI, WHERE'D THAT ONE
GET OFF TO?

370
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,250
- COVER FIRE.  WASTE HIM
AS SOON AS YOU SEE HIM.

371
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,708
- COME ON, DON'T TELL ME YOU
JOKERS ARE ALL JUST TALK.

372
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,083
- AH.  FOUND HIM.  RIGHT THERE.

373
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:30,083
- BLOW HIS ASS TO KINGDOM COME.
SO LONG, PRICK.

374
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,833
- ( laughs )

375
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,541
- WE LOST ALL CONTACT
WITH THE AMBUSH TEAM.

376
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,416
- IT'S ALL GONE TITS UP.
- IS HE STILL ALIVE?

377
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,208
SEND HIM OUT.

378
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,708
- THE GUYS BEHIND US HAVE
STOPPED SHOOTING

379
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,666
WILEE, THEY HAVE A HUMAN BOMB.

380
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,875
- ROGER, I'M ON MY WAY.  JUST
WHEN I THOUGHT THESE LOWLIFES

381
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,750
COULDN'T GET ANY SCUMMIER.

382
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,375
- Koko: HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
EXCALIBUR.  MUST BE A LOCAL.

383
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,458
WE ALMOST SHOT
THE POOR MAN DOWN.

384
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,833
- HAVE YOU GUYS FULLY SECURED
THIS SIDE OF THE ROAD?

385
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,000
- SURE HAVE.
- THAT'S GOOD.

386
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,958
( sighs ) DAMN THIS HEAT.

387
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,291
MAO, UGO, I NEED YOU TO RUN OVER
TO THAT MOUNTAIN

388
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,041
AND BRING BACK SOMEONE
WHO STILL HAS A PULSE.

389
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,625
- Both: ROGER THAT.
- ALLAH.

390
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,166
WHY IS IT YOU PUT ME
THROUGH THIS TRIAL?

391
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,583
- FALL DOWN.  TRIP AND ROLL
IN THIS DIRECTION.

392
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,416
- WHAT?  ARE YOU CRAZY?

393
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,333
THIS BOMB WILL EXPLODE
IF I DO THAT.

394
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,208
- YOU'LL BE FINE.
JUST DROP AND ROLL NOW.

395
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,583
- Ugo:
MAN, IT'S A TOTAL BLOODBATH.

396
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,666
- Mao:
THINK THERE ARE ANY SURVIVORS?

397
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,750
NOT TO BE RUDE, NAZAL,
BUT WHY ARE YOU HERE?

398
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:47,750
- THAT MAN RIGHT THERE
IS STILL BREATHING.

399
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,333
HE'S EXCALIBUR'S PRESIDENT.

400
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,000
I BELIEVE HE COULD BE EFFECTIVE.

401
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:57,000
NOW WOULD YOU BE SO KIND AS TO
LET ME HAVE THE MAN TO HIS LEFT?

402
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,791
HIS FATHER WORKS
IN ENGLAND'S HOME OFFICE

403
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,208
AND THE FAMILY IS RICH.

404
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,958
- DUMB BASTARD.
FELL ON HIS ASS.

405
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,208
- FUCK ME!  THIS SUCKS.
WHAT HAPPENED?

406
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,416
THESE BLOKES WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE EASY MARKS,

407
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,541
BUT THEY PRETTY MUCH WIPED US
OUT IN MINUTES.

408
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,416
NOW WE'RE STUCK IN THE DESERT
WITH NOWHERE TO RUN.

409
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,833
- WELL, DON'T BITCH
TO ME ABOUT IT.

410
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,416
- MAKE THE CALL.
DETONATE THE BOMB.

411
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,791
- ( rings )

412
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,291
- ( laughs )
LEAVE A MESSAGE.

413
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,791
- IT AIN'T GOING OFF.

414
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,041
FUCK!

415
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,916
- ( footsteps approaching )

416
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,625
- SOMEONE'S COMING.
- AW, BOLLOCKS.

417
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,375
WAIT, THAT'S THE BOSS MAN?

418
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,125
- NEED A HAND HERE, MATES.

419
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,041
COULD YOU GET THIS VEST OFF ME?

420
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,833
- Wilee: DAMN IT.
THAT TOTALLY FREAKED JONAH OUT.

421
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,625
WHY DO I ALWAYS LOSE CONTROL
WHEN IT COMES TO PYRO?

422
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,375
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T TAKE

423
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,166
MY LANGUAGE LESSONS
SERIOUSLY ANYMORE?

424
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,875
- I'VE REALLY GOTTA START TAKING
WILEE'S TUTORING MORE SERIOUSLY.

425
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,833
GUY IS DANGEROUS.

426
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,958
- ( theme music playing )


427
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,000
- Nazal:
THE PAST TWO WEEKS

428
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,833
SPENT INFILTRATING
EXCALIBUR PAID OFF.

429
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:55,333
YOU HAVE MY GRATITUDE,
MS. HEKMATYAR.

430
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,458
NOW WOULD YOU MIND TERRIBLY

431
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,416
IF I ABANDONED MY POST
AS TRUCK DRIVER?

432
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,791
- OF COURSE, YOU'RE FREE TO GO.
WE'LL BE JUST FINE WITHOUT YOU.

433
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:07,041
THEIR HUMAN BOMB WAS SOME RANDOM
TRUCK DRIVER THEY KIDNAPPED.

434
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,791
- I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

435
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,833
YOUR DESTINATION IS NOT MUCH
FARTHER, BUT USE CAUTION.

436
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,250
SO LONG.

437
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,250
- THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY

438
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:36,250
DO POSSESS QUITE
THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT.

439
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:43,666
- ♪ HER NAME IS KOKO, SHE IS
LOCO, I SAID, "OH, NO!" ♪


440
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,791
♪ HER NAME IS KOKO, SHE IS LOCO,
I SAID, "OH, NO!" ♪
