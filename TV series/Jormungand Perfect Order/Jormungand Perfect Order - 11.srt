1
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,708
- NO MATTER YOUR REASONS,
KOKO, YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

2
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,916
- JUST SO YOU KNOW, JONAH,

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,958
ENDING MY LIFE HERE WILL DO
NOTHING TO STOP JORMUNGAND.

4
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,083
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I WOULD DANGLE MY PLAN

5
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,750
IN SUCH A PRECARIOUS POSITION

6
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,458
THAT IT COULD
BE BROUGHT CRASHING DOWN

7
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,250
WITH THE MERE PULL
OF A TRIGGER?

8
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,875
THE FACT THAT I'M TELLING YOU
ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THIS

9
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,916
MEANS THAT NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,166
FROM THIS MOMENT ON,
JORMUNGAND WILL BE EXECUTED

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,083
AND THE NEW WORLD WILL DAWN.

12
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,500
- YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T RIGHT!
- WHY NOT?

13
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,625
IF IT'S ABOUT THOSE 700,000
FALLING FROM THE SKY,

14
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,333
THEY'RE COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

15
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,833
YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT THIS WORLD IS PERFECT

16
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,291
AND DOESN'T NEED CHANGING?

17
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,250
GRANTED, THE CHANGE
REQUIRED IS RADICAL

18
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,791
AND, YES, MAYBE A BIT
RUTHLESS EVEN.

19
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,333
YOU TOLD ME
YOU STILL LOVE THE WORLD,

20
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,958
EVEN THOUGH
IT MAY HATE YOU.

21
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,375
THINK ABOUT
HOW NAIVE THAT SOUNDS.

22
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,666
"OH, IF EVERY
SINGLE PERSON ON EARTH

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,375
JUST TRIED TO BE
A LITTLE BIT NICER,

24
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,625
WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD
IT WOULD BE."

25
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:14,291
( chuckles ) IT DOESN'T
WORK THAT WAY. SO SORRY.

26
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,333
I'VE WALKED THROUGH
MANY BATTLEFIELDS

27
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,291
AND IF THINGS CONTINUE
AS THEY ARE,

28
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,833
MY GUT TELLS ME
A MASSIVE WAR WILL BREAK OUT

29
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,666
WITHIN THE NEXT 10 YEARS.

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,875
THIS NEW WAR WON'T BE OVER OIL,
BUT OVER WATER.

31
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,458
IN SOME PLACES,
IT'S ALREADY BEGUN.

32
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,750
HUMANS CANNOT SURVIVE
WITHOUT CLEAN DRINKING WATER.

33
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,375
THEY WILL FIGHT
BECAUSE THEIR LIVES

34
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,916
WILL LITERALLY
DEPEND ON IT.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,583
THE FIRST WORLD WAR CLAIMED
THE LIVES OF 40 MILLION PEOPLE.

36
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,500
WORLD WAR II WIPED
ANOTHER 66 MILLION

37
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,750
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

38
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:48,750
HOW MANY DO YOU THINK
WOULD DIE IN A THIRD?

39
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,291
- THIS WORLD HATES
ALL OF US, JONAH,

40
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,000
AND I HATE IT RIGHT BACK.

41
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,833
- ( theme music playing )

42
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,666
( singing in Japanese )

43
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:28,083
- EVERYWHERE I GO,
I ENCOUNTER NOTHING BUT WAR.

44
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,833
I HATE THE SIGHT OF BODIES PILED
UP ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

45
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,583
I HATE WEAPONS.

46
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,958
JUST REMEMBERING THE SENSATION
OF SOMEONE POINTING

47
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,166
ONE OF THOSE VILE TOOLS AT ME
GIVES ME A MIGRAINE.

48
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,833
I HATE SOLDIERS,
ESPECIALLY THE ONES

49
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,375
WHO SHUT OFF THEIR BRAINS
AND BLINDLY FOLLOW ORDERS.

50
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,666
THEY REEK WORSE THAN
THE BLOATED CORPSES

51
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,916
THEY LEAVE IN THEIR WAKE.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,375
A PARENT IS WROUGHT
WITH GRIEF OVER LOSING

53
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,583
THEIR CHILD TO WAR,

54
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,666
SO WHAT DO THEY DO?
POP OUT ANOTHER AND VOW,

55
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,250
"I'LL TURN THIS BOY
INTO A SOLDIER."

56
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,583
CAN YOU IMAGINE
ANYTHING MORE IDIOTIC?

57
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,750
I HATE PEOPLE.
I FIND THE THOUGHT

58
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,625
THAT WE'RE FROM THE
SAME SPECIES DEPRESSING.

59
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,250
ONLY THOSE WHOSE DEATHS
HAVE BEEN DELIVERED

60
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,583
BY THE WEAPONS I'VE SOLD
HAVE EARNED MY PITY AND REMORSE.

61
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,125
I HATE
THAT I'M AN ARMS DEALER--

62
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,333
I COULDN'T ESCAPE
THAT FATE--

63
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,208
BUT IT SEEMS
I HAD A KNACK FOR IT,

64
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,958
AND THE CASH JUST POURED IN.

65
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,333
AND THEN ONE DAY IT HIT ME!

66
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,583
I COULD USE ALL THIS BLOOD
MONEY TO FOSTER PEACE.

67
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,833
THE ONLY WAY THE SOULS
OF THOSE KILLED

68
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,791
BY MY GUNS WILL EVER FORGIVE ME

69
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:32,875
IS IF I CAN TELL THEM,
"YOUR DEATHS WERE NOT IN VAIN."

70
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,125
THEY DROVE ME
TO BRING ABOUT WORLD PEACE!

71
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,041
THIS GODFORSAKEN PLANET'S
IN LUCK!

72
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,375
DESPITE MY BURNING HATRED
FOR IT,

73
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,333
I'VE DECIDED I'M GOING
TO HEAL THE FUCKING THING

74
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,875
RATHER THAN DESTROY IT!

75
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,166
AND WITH
NO MORE WEAPONS IN IT,

76
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,875
I MIGHT EVEN COME
TO LOVE THIS WORLD AGAIN.

77
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,583
BE AT MY SIDE
ON THIS, JONAH.

78
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,166
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I LOVE, JONAH.

79
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,083
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME.

80
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,750
WE SEE EYE TO EYE.

81
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,208
- ( hip-hop music playing )

82
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,541
- YOU KNOW
YOU HATE IT ALL, TOO--

83
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,291
WEAPONS, DEALERS, VIOLENCE--

84
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,375
BUT YOU'RE
A FIERCE BOY SOLDIER.

85
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,208
WHEN MY BROTHER
FIRST TOLD ME ABOUT YOU,

86
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,208
MY HEART DANCED
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

87
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,250
YOU WERE MY...
- Both: LIMITER.

88
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,750
- NO.

89
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,083
- I'M WORRIED HE'S GOING TO
TURN YOU INTO A BIG SOFTIE.

90
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,416
- ( humphs )

91
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,000
- Koko's voice: THAT MAY BE
CLOSER TO THE TRUTH.

92
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,375
- IN EXCHANGE
FOR THE USE OF YOUR TALENTS

93
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,583
TO GUARD MY LIFE AND SAFETY,

94
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,625
I'M OFFERING YOU
A FRONT-ROW SEAT

95
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,041
TO HISTORY IN THE MAKING.
YOU'LL WITNESS THE MOMENT

96
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,833
I DESTROY THE SYSTEM THAT'S
TAKEN SO MUCH FROM YOU--

97
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,166
THE DAY WE ACHIEVE
WORLD PEACE.

98
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,791
COME, JONAH.

99
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,125
LIVE TOGETHER WITH ME
IN OUR NEW WORLD.

100
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,750
- ( sighs )

101
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,875
- UHH...
- GOODBYE, KOKO.

102
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,625
- OH, JONAH.

103
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,333
NO, COME BACK!  WAIT!

104
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,750
WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M DOING?

105
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,125
DON'T LEAVE ME!

106
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,333
- Jonah's voice:
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

107
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,041
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
I'M NOT SMART,

108
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,583
BUT I CAN'T REALLY
GIVE HER AN ANSWER.

109
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,458
IS KOKO RIGHT?
IS SHE WRONG?

110
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:23,666
I KNOW I DON'T LIKE IT, BUT I
DON'T KNOW WHY I DON'T LIKE IT.

111
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,625
SO MY ONLY CHOICE...

112
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,166
IS TO RUN AWAY.

113
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,083
- ( Kasper chuckles )
A BIT CHILLY

114
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,500
TO BE TAKING A DIP IN
THE OCEAN, JONAH.

115
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,958
MY, WHAT A HAPPY COINCIDENCE,

116
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,333
MEETING YOU HERE.  YEAH?

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,750
- COINCIDENCE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, KASPER?

118
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,833
- WELL, IT'S NOT
LIKE I WAS SPYING

119
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,375
ON YOUR
SQUAD OR ANYTHING.

120
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,458
IT'S JUST THAT MY INTUITION
IS USUALLY SPOT-ON,

121
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,541
AND IT TOLD ME
THAT IT WAS ABOUT TIME

122
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,208
FOR SOMEONE
TO ABANDON KOKO'S UNIT.

123
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,833
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

124
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,000
- CAN'T SAY.

125
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:11,916
- YOU ABOUT READY TO
GET OUT OF HERE?

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,250
- YEAH.
- Kasper: ALL RIGHT THEN.

127
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,416
- ( beeping )
- HOP IN.

128
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,750
- ( shudders )

129
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,458
( gasps ) WHAT?

130
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,125
- WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT?

131
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,958
ALL THIS TIME
I HAD YOU PEGGED

132
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,041
AS FULLY LACKING
IN THE EMOTION DEPARTMENT,

133
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,041
BUT YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE RANGE
OF EXPRESSIONS GOING ON.

134
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,375
OF COURSE, MOST OF 'EM
ARE IN THE RANGE OF SAD.

135
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,500
- BETWEEN THAT AND A
MAN WHO ALWAYS SMILES

136
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,666
FOR NO REASON,

137
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,333
I'D TAKE THIS DISPLAY
OF SORROW ANY DAY.

138
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,458
- ( laughs )
QUITE THE LADIES' MAN, JONAH.

139
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,041
BUT IF LEAVING
UPSETS YOU THIS MUCH,

140
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,208
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK?
I IMAGINE YOU STILL CAN.

141
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,041
- NO, I CAN'T.

142
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,125
- SO TELL ME,

143
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,125
MR. FORMER-CHILD-SOLDIER
- WHO-POSSESSES-

144
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,166
UNCANNY-FIGHTING-SKILL-
DESPITE-HATING-WAR,

145
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,458
WHERE DO YOU PLAN
ON GOING FROM HERE?

146
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,708
- YOU HAD TO DECIDE WHICH WAS
THE BETTER COURSE--

147
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,291
KILLING ME OR USING ME.

148
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,041
- KASPER SIR,

149
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,250
IF THERE IS ANY WAY,
CAN I PLEASE COME WORK FOR YOU?

150
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:25,000
- YEAH... YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BOW TO ME, JONAH.

151
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,958
WHEN YOU GOT
ALL QUIET BACK THERE,

152
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,458
I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS
RUNNING THROUGH YOUR HEAD.

153
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,125
YOU TRULY ARE A KIND
YOUNG MAN, AREN'T YOU?

154
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,000
TO THE POINT
IT ALMOST WORRIES ME.

155
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,083
AND DROP THAT "SIR" CRAPOLA.

156
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,625
YOU AND I ARE
EQUALS HERE, OKAY?

157
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,083
ANYWAY, SURE, I'LL HIRE YOU.
WELCOME ABOARD.

158
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,625
- GLAD YOU'RE HERE, MISHKA.

159
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,666
- Men: YEAH!
- Kaspar: EDGAR, ALAN AND POE

160
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,000
ARE SUPER LAID BACK,

161
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,416
BUT CHEQUITA'S STRICT AS HELL,
SO WATCH YOURSELF.

162
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,083
- HEY, WHY ARE YOU MAKING
ME OUT TO BE THE BAD GUY?

163
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,458
- Jonah: UM, THANKS.

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,041
- Miami: I SEE.
SO JONAH LEFT YOU, HUH?

165
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,375
THAT SUCKS,
BUT DIDN'T YOU PREDICT

166
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,833
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
WOULD HAPPEN WITH HIM?

167
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,458
IT WAS INEVITABLE, REALLY.

168
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,791
JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

169
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,500
IT'S LIKE A RITE OF PASSAGE.

170
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,375
I MEAN, THIS IS A LOT
FOR A KID HIS AGE TO PROCESS.

171
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,208
AT LEAST ALL THE GROWNUPS
DECIDED TO STICK WITH YOU.

172
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,166
THE BOY JUST NEEDS
SOME TIME

173
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,416
TO THINK THINGS
OVER. YOU'LL SEE.

174
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,125
OKAY, NOW GO AND WIPE
THAT GLOOMY LOOK OFF YOUR FACE.

175
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,958
- I DO NOT LOOK GLOOMY.

176
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,833
- SO ANY IDEA
WHERE YOUNG JONAH WENT?

177
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,166
- TURNS OUT
MY BROTHER PICKED HIM UP.

178
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,625
I JUST HEARD THAT PART.

179
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,250
KASPER KNOWS
YOU'RE IN SOUTH AFRICA?

180
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,291
- ( sighs )
YOU KNOW HOW HE WORKS.

181
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,500
BETWEEN THE NOSEY
NELLIES AT H.Q.

182
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,583
RAISING SUSPICIONS
ABOUT MY ACTIVITIES

183
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,958
AND HIS GUT FEELING THAT
SOMEONE WAS ON THE VERGE

184
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,166
OF DITCHING MY TEAM...

185
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,791
- HUH?
- ...HE TOOK A CHANCE

186
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,791
AND CAME OUT HERE
JUST TO CHECK THINGS OUT.

187
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,791
- HMM. LIKE ME, YOU'LL
BOTH TRAVEL AROUND

188
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,541
THE WORLD ON A WHIM.

189
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,416
NOT TO SOUND RUDE,
BUT I DOUBT JONAH

190
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,541
WILL BE ABLE TO STAND
KASPER FOR VERY LONG.

191
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,875
- ( chuckles )
- IN FACT, I'M SURE.

192
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,916
JONAH WILL FIND
HIS OWN ANSWERS SOON.

193
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,041
AND THEN HE WILL MAKE
HIS WAY BACK TO YOU.

194
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,541
THAT ONE'S A SMART KID,

195
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,583
EVEN IF, FROM WHAT I HEAR,
HE TOTALLY SUCKS AT SCHOOLWORK.

196
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,583
- YEAH, TRUE.
HE IS PRETTY SMART, ISN'T HE?

197
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,250
AND I THINK THE WAY HE'S
SO TERRIBLE AT HIS STUDIES

198
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,958
IS ADORBS.
- ( laughs )

199
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,541
OH, SPEAKING OF TERRIBLE,
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU ABOUT...

200
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,208
( British accent )
DR. LEILA FAIZA.

201
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,208
( normal voice )
YOU KNOW, CHATTY RABBIT'S FOOT?

202
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,708
SHE'S IMPRESSIVE,
BUT WHEN I FIRST MET HER,

203
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,833
SHE DIDN'T EVEN
SAY HELLO! JUST...

204
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,791
- WHERE DO YOU KEEP
THE QUANTUM COMPUTER?

205
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,041
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

206
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,041
IT'S RIGHT HERE IN FRONT
OF YOUR FREAKING FACE.

207
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,750
YOUR JOB IS
TO SHRINK IT ALL DOWN

208
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:38,000
SO IT FITS COMFORTABLY INSIDE
A 10-FOOT CONTAINER.

209
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,750
SHE'S THE EXACT
OPPOSITE OF JONAH--

210
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:44,166
BOOK SMART, BUT NOT A LICK
OF COMMON SENSE IN HER HEAD.

211
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,375
I CAN STILL USE HER,

212
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,125
GONNA TAKE SOME EXTRA
TRAINING, THOUGH.

213
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,708
- SHE KIND OF REMINDS ME
OF YOU IN SOME WAYS, MINAMI.

214
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,416
- OH PLEASE,
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

215
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,041
REMINDS YOU OF ME.

216
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,875
SO WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW?

217
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,041
- I'M GONNA CONTINUE
MY JOB AS AN ARMS DEALER,

218
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,500
THOUGH I EXPECT
I'LL BE CHECKING IN WITH YOU

219
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,250
HERE A BIT MORE FREQUENTLY.

220
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,291
- REALLY? IN THAT CASE,
YOU SHOULD COME TAKE A DIP

221
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,875
IN THE HOT SPRING TO RELAX.

222
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,041
- YEAH?  OKAY.
I'LL INVITE THE OTHER GIRLS TOO.

223
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,375
- GREAT IDEA!

224
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,208
VALMET IS
SUCH SWEET EYE CANDY!

225
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,625
- UH...
- AND THAT BABS HAS

226
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,791
A PRETTY NICE SET
OF MELONS ON HER, TOO.

227
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,125
- FOR REAL?

228
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,291
- Jonah's voice:
ALL WE EVER SEE ANYMORE

229
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,166
IS WAR AND CARNAGE.

230
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,000
I GUESS FIGHTING IS
THE ONLY THING

231
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,875
I'M ANY GOOD AT, KOKO.

232
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,916
- Koko: WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE?


233
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,916
YOU CAN'T JUST
SEND ME SOME RANDOM CHART

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,958
AND EXPECT ME TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT ALL MEANS.

235
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,916
- Miami:
JEEZ, DID YOU EVEN LOOK AT IT?

236
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,500
IT'S THE RECORD
OF A COUPLE OF GUYS

237
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,916
WHO HAVE BEEN
THOROUGHLY COMBING OVER

238
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,416
YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS.

239
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,250
THERE ARE TWO IN PARTICULAR
WHO HAVE BEEN GETTING CLOSE

240
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,125
TO THE CORE OF YOUR FINANCES.

241
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,333
FIRST ONE'S SCARECROW,
A C.I.A. OPERATIVE FROM LONDON.

242
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,500
- AH.

243
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,833
- THE OTHER'S TORY PLAME
OF THE S.C.S., G2.

244
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,875
HE ACCESSED YOUR ACCOUNT

245
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,583
FROM BOTH BELTSVILLE
AND FORT MEADE.

246
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,958
- HUH?
- ANY IDEA WHO THIS PLAME IS?

247
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,583
- I KEEP TELLING YOU
I CAN'T KEEP TRACK

248
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,958
OF EVERYONE I'VE PISSED OFF
OVER THE YEARS.

249
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,666
THEN AGAIN, THE AMOUNT OF
EFFORT HE'S PUT INTO THIS

250
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,375
MIGHT MEAN
HE'S A SPECIAL CASE.

251
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,541
THE N.S.A. IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED
OF HIGHLY-SKILLED TECHIES.

252
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,666
THE SPECIAL COLLECTION
SERVICE IS THE ONLY DIVISION

253
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,041
WITH ACTIVE SPIES.

254
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,166
SINCE THE N.S.A. DOESN'T HAVE
A UNIT OF IT'S OWN,

255
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,083
IT HAS TO PARTNER
WITH THE C.I.A.

256
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,250
WHEN CARRYING OUT
SECRET OPERATIONS.

257
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,875
- EH, YOU KNOW I DON'T CARE
ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT.

258
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,041
- ( gasps )
- FIGURE IT OUT?

259
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,750
- UPTIGHT FOUR-EYED DOUCHEBAG--

260
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,708
FROM THE RABBIT'S FOOT JOB.
THAT MUST BE WHO PLAME IS.

261
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,250
SOMEBODY ORDERED
A TEAM OF NAVY SEALS

262
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,083
TO COME AFTER US.

263
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,916
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL.

264
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,750
- Koko's voice:
I BET YOU'RE IN A TIGHT SPOT

265
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,083
AFTER LETTING SUCH
A BIG FISH GET AWAY,

266
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,833
AREN'T YOU, MR. PLAME?

267
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,500
SEEMS YOU CAN'T COMPREHEND
JORMUNGAND'S MAGIC.

268
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,541
BUT IF YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT,

269
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,625
HOW WILL YOU RESPOND TO IT?

270
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,625
- MINAMI, SEE IF YOU CAN CONNECT
THIS PLAME GUY TO GEORGE BLACK,

271
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,541
C.I.A. CLANDESTINE SERVICE.

272
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,916
HE'S THE BRANCH CHIEF
OF THEIR EUROPEAN OFFICE.

273
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,833
- Minami: OKEDOKE.
- HMM.  MMM.

274
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,250
WHOA!  THAT'S SOME
DAMN GOOD CHOCOLATE.

275
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,041
- Tojo:
YEAH?  WHAT KIND IS IT?

276
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,750
- SO WHAT DOES
EVERYBODY THINK ABOUT IT?

277
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,333
THE BOSS LADY'S PLAN?

278
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,291
- JEEZ, LUTZ, YOU'RE LIKE
A BROKEN RECORD.

279
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,541
ASK US AGAIN WHY DON'T YA?

280
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,458
- WELL, I'M NOT JUST ASKING.

281
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,916
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT
SOME THOUGHTS OF MY OWN

282
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,583
I'D LIKE
TO CONTRIBUTE THIS TIME.

283
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,958
- YEAH?  THEN BY ALL MEANS,
PLEASE ENLIGHTEN US.

284
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,750
- OKAY, SO RECENTLY
IT STARTED SEEMING TO ME

285
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,291
LIKE THE LITTLE LADY WAS GROWING
MORE AND MORE AGGRESSIVE--

286
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,500
YOU KNOW,
ABDUCTIONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

287
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,916
REMEMBER?

288
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,875
- I REMEMBER YOU WHINING
ABOUT IT ALL THE DAMN TIME.

289
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,791
- Lutz:
I ASKED VALMET HER OPINION,

290
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,708
BUT HER ANSWER
DIDN'T QUITE HELP.

291
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,333
HOWEVER, WHEN I HEARD

292
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,208
THE LITTLE LADY
EXPLAIN HER PLAN,

293
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,958
EVERYTHING FINALLY
CAME TOGETHER

294
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,833
AND MADE A WHOLE
SHIT-TON MORE SENSE.

295
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,916
- ( door opens )

296
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,750
- I MEAN,
IT ALL MADE PERFECT SENSE.

297
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,625
- Tojo:
WHY THE SUDDEN CHOIRBOY ACT?

298
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,000
- KOKO'S ON A PHONE CALL.

299
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,500
PLEASE DON'T STOP
BECAUSE OF ME.

300
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,833
- OKAY, SO I'VE DECIDED
I'M GONNA THROW

301
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,958
MY FULL SUPPORT BEHIND KOKO,

302
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,416
BUT I WAS CURIOUS
HOW YOU GUYS FELT.

303
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,708
- SHE'S GOT MY BACKING.
I THINK IT'D BE COOL

304
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,625
TO BE ONE OF THE LAST
SOLDIERS ON EARTH.

305
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,250
PLUS I'D KINDA LIKE TO LIVE
IN A WORLD WITHOUT WEAPONS.

306
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,625
- HUH?  ME?

307
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,625
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WORKING FOR KOKO

308
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,041
I'VE COME
TO REALIZE SOMETHING--

309
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,583
IT TURNS OUT I HAVE
THE SPIRIT OF A TRUE ARTIST.

310
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,000
I WANT TO KEEP SERVING
KOKO ALL THE WAY,

311
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,458
UNTIL SHE NO LONGER REQUIRES
MY PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS.

312
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,291
- YEAH, I SECOND EVERYTHING
WILEE JUST SAID.

313
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,625
DO I BACK HER PLAN?
WHO CARES?

314
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,875
I BACK HER.
- AS FOR ME,

315
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,166
WELL, HEY,
BUSINESS IS BUSINESS.

316
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,041
SO YEAH, MY FEELINGS
HAVEN'T CHANGED.

317
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,541
BUT THEN THERE'S THE KID.

318
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,166
I CAN'T QUITE
WRAP MY HEAD AROUND

319
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,333
HOW JONAH COULD JUST
UP AND LEAVE THE WAY HE DID.

320
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,000
I WONDER WHAT LEHM'S TAKE
IS ON ALL OF THIS.

321
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,125
- WELL, I THINK--
- Men: YES, VALMET,

322
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,500
WE ALL KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.

323
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,458
- ( cellphone buzzes, beeps )

324
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,250
- Koko: BOOK MAN!
LONG TIME, NO SPEAK.

325
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,708
YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS, RIGHT?
- ( gasps )

326
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,833
- ( laughs )
I KNOW, I KNOW, YOU'RE SHOCKED.

327
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,916
I HAVE SOME WORK
TO GET TO IN A MINUTE,

328
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,541
SO I WON'T HESITATE
TO HANG UP ON YOU

329
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,958
IF YOU GIVE ME ANY TROUBLE.

330
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,458
THOUGH I MUST SAY YOU HAVE
EVEN LESS TIME THAN I DO.

331
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,291
SOMEONE OUT THERE
HAS BEEN CONNECTING THE DOTS

332
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,916
BETWEEN YOUR
"OPERATION UNDERSHAFT"

333
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
AND ME AND A LITTLE HICCUP

334
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,375
IN A RECENT MISSION INVOLVING
SOME VERY SPECIAL SOLDIERS.

335
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,625
- ( laughs )
YOU REALIZE YOU JUST IMPLIED

336
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,166
YOU WERE ENTWINED
IN AN ASSAULT AGAINST MY NATION.

337
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,750
- LISTEN OR DON'T,
IT'S UP TO YOU.

338
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,125
BUT AT THIS RATE, BOOK MAN,
YOU'LL BE SWEATING IT

339
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,125
ON A WITNESS STAND
WITHIN THE WEEK.

340
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,541
IF YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS
THIS FURTHER AND IN PERSON,

341
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,625
GET YOUR ASS TO DULLES
AND ONTO THE FLIGHT

342
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,958
I'VE ARRANGED.

343
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,625
YOU SHOULD ARRIVE
IN NORTH AFRICA BY THIS EVENING.

344
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,666
( laughs )
GOOD LUCK.

345
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,916
- ( hangs up )
- WHAT'S HER ANGLE?

346
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,250
WHATEVER IT IS,
I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO.

347
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,333
- DAMN, THAT TOOK
WAY TOO FREAKING LONG.

348
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,083
I CAN'T KEEP
THE COLONEL WAITING.

349
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,458
- HAVE A GOOD DAY, TORY.

350
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,708
- THANKS, HONEY. YOU TOO.

351
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,916
- THINK YOU'LL BE HOME
AT A REASONABLE HOUR?

352
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,416
- YEAH, I DON'T HAVE
ANY MEETINGS SCHEDULED

353
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,916
AND I'M NOT INVOLVED
IN ANY MAJOR OPERATIONS, SO--

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,916
- ( coos )
- OH, SEE YOU SOON.

355
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,708
- ( cellphone rings, beeps )

356
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,625
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- DID YOU NEED

357
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,583
TO TAKE THAT CALL,
MISS HEKMATYAR?

358
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,041
PLEASE DON'T
IGNORE IT ON MY BEHALF.

359
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,958
- NO BIG DEAL.
REALLY, IT CAN WAIT.

360
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,875
BESIDES, I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

361
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,250
MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW
THAN MY CONVERSATION

362
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,583
WITH YOU, COLONEL.

363
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,583
- ( laughs ) GOODNESS,
YOU'RE QUITE THE CHARMER.

364
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,458
- Man: CAPTAIN, WE JUST GOT
NEW ORDERS FROM H.Q.


365
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,083
- Captain: REALLY?
FROM OUR GLORIOUS LEADER?


366
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,041
WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE,
READ IT.

367
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,500
- "MY BROTHERS,
A VILE UNWELCOME AMERICAN SPY

368
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,541
TRESPASSES
ON OUR SACRED LAND.

369
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,208
YOU MUST CAPTURE THIS DEVIL
AND ENGRAVE OUR RIGHTEOUS ANGER

370
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,083
INTO HIS ODIOUS BODY.
I EXPECT YOUR GROUP,

371
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,541
SHIVERING IN A NEW DAWN,

372
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,250
TO ACT SWIFTLY AND EFFICIENTLY."
- GET EVERYONE READY!

373
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,041
- Man #2:
THIS IS A RESCUE MISSION

374
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,750
FOR A TOP-VALUE ASSET!

375
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,916
A HIGH-RANKING MEMBER
OF THE C.I.A.


376
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,625
HAS BEEN STRANDED
IN A NORTH AFRICAN WAR ZONE.


377
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,708
YOU WILL INFILTRATE VIA HELO!


378
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,583
GET HIM BACK HERE ASAP!

379
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,958
IF YOU ENCOUNTER
ARMED HOSTILES,

380
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,875
YOU HAVE
PERMISSION TO OPEN FIRE!

381
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,833
- Men: SIR, YES SIR!

382
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,708
- ( chuckles )

383
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,750
- ( trucks approaching )

384
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,250
- Black: OH CRAP.

385
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,625
SHE SET ME UP.

386
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,625
- ( tires screech )
- ( grunts )

387
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,375
- ( grunts )
- ( gunshot )

388
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,583
- ( tires screech )
- ( guns firing )

389
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,333
- SHIT!  SNIPERS!

390
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,458
WHO THE FUCK?

391
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,750
WERE WE SET UP?

392
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:05,000
- ( whimpers )

393
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,583
LIGHT 'EM UP!
- ( guns cocking )

394
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,083
- THIS MAKES NO SENSE!

395
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,416
- HEY, ARE YOU GEORGE BLACK?
U.S. MARINE CORPS.

396
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,333
- HUH?  UH, YEAH.

397
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,916
- Black's voice: AN ENTIRE
PLATOON SENT TO RESCUE JUST ME?

398
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,541
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

399
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,791
COME ON, PULL IT TOGETHER
AND THINK THIS THROUGH.

400
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,416
THE TIMING OF IT ALL
IS PRETTY SUSPICIOUS,

401
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,875
A LOCAL ARMED MILITIA
JUST HAPPENS TO SHOW UP,

402
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,000
GUNS A'BLAZING,
AS SOON AS I ARRIVE?

403
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,291
AND THEN THE MARINES
COME IN TO SAVE MY HIDE

404
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,833
JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME?

405
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,916
IT FEELS ALMOST TOO PERFECT,
LIKE IT WAS CHOREOGRAPHED.

406
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,083
- SIR, THE PACKAGE IS SECURE.

407
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,333
SIR, OPERATION UNDERSHAFT
WILL PROCEED AS PLANNED.

408
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,375
- THAT'S YOUR
MISSION'S CODENAME?

409
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,083
- YES, THAT IS CORRECT.
THIS MISSION HAS BEEN GIVEN

410
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,958
THE DESIGNATION
"OPERATION UNDERSHAFT," SIR.

411
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,041
- ( laughing )

412
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,583
- DID I SAY SOMETHING
TO AMUSE YOU, SIR?

413
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,000
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT I FIND PRETTY AMUSING?

414
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,791
WEARING A SUIT IN A WAR ZONE.

415
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,875
- NO, I JUST REALIZED
I'D BEEN HAD

416
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,750
BY A GIRL HALF MY AGE.

417
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,375
WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS GAME
AS LONG AS ME,

418
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,125
IT'S BOUND
TO HAPPEN EVENTUALLY.

419
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,500
- FOR REAL?

420
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,250
- Black's voice: IF SHE USED
THAT QUANTUM COMPUTER

421
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,541
OR WHATEVER SHE'S GOT,

422
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,958
IT'D BE A PIECE OF CAKE
FOR HER TO ISSUE

423
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,833
OPERATION ORDERS
OR FORGE EMAILS

424
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,250
FROM A TERRORIST NETWORK.

425
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,583
SHE PROBABLY KNOWS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW.

426
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:46,666
KOKO HEKMATYAR HAS MORPHED
INTO THE GODDESS OF INFORMATION.

427
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,208
SHE SKIPPED RIGHT PAST
THE MONSTER STAGE

428
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,666
AND BECAME THE MOST POWERFUL
PERSON ON THE PLANET.

429
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,583
SO WHY DOESN'T
SHE JUST CONQUER IT?

430
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,500
- Koko:
HERE'S A HYPOTHETICAL.

431
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,833
A UTOPIA APPEARS.

432
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:04,791
- OF COURSE! SHE ACTUALLY
AIMS TO CREATE A NEW WORLD.

433
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,250
GOD HELP ME,
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT.

434
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,416
SHE EXPECTED ME
TO FEEL THIS WAY.

435
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,166
SHE SOMEHOW KNEW
THAT I'D BE ON HER SIDE,

436
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,958
DESPITE MY WORKING
FOR THE C.I.A.

437
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,833
THE LITTLE LADY HAD ME
FIGURED OUT A LONG TIME AGO.

438
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,208
THAT'S WHY SHE DIDN'T
HAVE ME KILLED BACK THERE.

439
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,625
SHE THINKS SHE CAN USE ME.

440
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,916
WELL, THAT'S FINE.
GO AHEAD AND USE ME.

441
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,250
COME TO THINK OF IT,

442
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,875
I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE
SHE ENSNARED IN THIS TRAP.

443
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,875
WHATEVER POOR SAP
SHE SET UP TO TAKE THE FALL

444
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,541
FOR ORDERING THAT HIT ON ME

445
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,416
IS GONNA BE IN IT DEEP.

446
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,166
( humphs )
I DON'T ENVY HIM.

447
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,541
- ( door opens )
- ( gasps )

448
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,000
- Man:
N.S.A. POLICE.

449
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,291
G2 SECTION CHIEF TORY PLAME,
SPECIAL COLLECTIONS,

450
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,833

00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,958
THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE
SURVEILLANCE ACT.

452
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,666
WE NEED YOU TO COME WITH US.

453
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,708
- UH, WHAT?

454
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,125
- PLAME, THESE GENTLEMEN
ARE SAYING YOU CONTRACTED

455
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,333
AN ARMED MILITIA

456
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,833
THE ASSASSINATION
OF A HIGH-LEVEL C.I.A. OFFICIAL.

457
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:04,833
- ( gasps )

458
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,500
- ( laughs )

459
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,250
- THAT'S A WRAP.
- MY MY, KOKO.

460
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,458
YOU ARE SIMPLY HORRIBLE,
AREN'T YOU?

461
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,750
- OH, I'LL LET PLAME
WRIGGLE FREE SOON ENOUGH.

462
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:15,875
- ( chuckles )

463
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,666
- WHAT CAN I SAY? I'M A BAD GUY.

464
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,125
THOUGH THESE DAYS,
THERE'S ALL KINDS

465
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,500
OF BAD GUYS IN THE WORLD.

466
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,208
- AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

467
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,875
- I'M JUST WONDERING WHICH KIND

468
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,458
YOU-KNOW-WHO WILL CHOOSE
IN THE END.

469
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,208
- Kasper:
MAN, WHAT A PAIN IN THE ASS,

470
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,708
BUT THANK GOD
THOSE SPARKS FINALLY IGNITED.

471
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,583
IT MADE SELLING
ALL THOSE CUTTING-EDGE WEAPONS

472
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,041
TO EVERYONE WORTH MY WHILE.

473
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,750
AND IF BOTH ARMIES END UP
WIPING EACH OTHER OUT,

474
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,458
IT GIVES ME THE OPENING
TO BUILD THAT PIPELINE.

475
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,083
- Jonah's voice: OUR PATH IS
SO OVERRUN WITH WEAPONS

476
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,291
THAT SOMETIMES I WONDER
IF THE WHOLE WORLD

477
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,708
IS MADE UP OF NOTHING
BUT IRON AND GUNPOWDER.

478
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,833
AS I CLENCHED THAT TOOL,

479
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,833
DESIGNED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE
OF TAKING LIVES...

480
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,875
I'D FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH
I USED TO HATE WEAPONS.

481
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,416
- JONAH, LET'S GO.

482
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,291
- Jonah's voice:
HERE I AM...

483
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,791
TRAVELING WITH
ANOTHER ARMS DEALER.

484
