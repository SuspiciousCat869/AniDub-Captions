1
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:38,804
The semester was over at last.

2
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:41,601
We'd finished finals and started summer vacation.

3
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:00,497
Huh...?

4
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:15,840
Can't you take a hint? I don't want to talk to you.

5
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:16,873
Horikita.

6
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,250
What now?

7
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:20,246
Listen, do you want to go swimming with me?

8
00:02:59,131 --> 00:03:00,548
This is the worst.

9
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:02,361
Where the hell is he?

10
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,089
My apologies for being late.

11
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:12,023
I thought I said to make sure you got here on time, dude!

12
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:12,767
Whatever.

13
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:14,785
Did you at least bring everything we need?

14
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:16,601
Yeah, of course I did.

15
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,571
Better make sure you set it up right.

16
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:21,898
Time to implement Operation:

17
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:23,930
Peep on the Girl's Dressing Room.

18
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:27,754
This ought to help alleviate our frustration a little bit.

19
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,473
I've got a bad feeling.

20
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,669
Oh? Hey, look! It's Horikita!

21
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,738
Man, it's been forever. What's up?

22
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:53,590
Wow, Suzune, there were rumors you had died or something.

23
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:56,746
No one in school had seen a trace
of you since summer break started.

24
00:03:56,881 --> 00:03:59,385
I had no real reason to see any of you people.

25
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:01,606
Kei Karuizawa.

26
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:04,302
Kushida leads one of the two cliques in Class D.

27
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:05,893
Kei leads the other.

28
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:11,027
Dating Hirata has increased her influence over
our class exponentially, and it's easy to see why.

29
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,131
And as far as Yosuke Hirata goes...

30
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:16,631
He's a central figure among the Class D boys.

31
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,715
He's an above-average athlete,
and his grades are decent enough.

32
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,258
He's gregarious, too.

33
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:25,219
I haven't yet figured out how he ended
up in the loser class in the first place.

34
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:27,593
Look, Horikita.

35
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:30,103
Why don't you hang out with the D Class peeps sometime.

36
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:31,715
It wouldn't hurt to give it a shot.

37
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:33,031
I'll pass, thanks.

38
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:35,298
I have no need to, "give it a shot," as you say.

39
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,579
My time would be better spent studying or reading.

40
00:04:37,604 --> 00:04:39,661
Well, that's just fine with us, then.

41
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:41,181
Let's get going, Hirata.

42
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:44,343
She doesn't think we're worth her
time, so why should we bother with her?

43
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,859
'Kay, let's go. Later, Horikita.

44
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:49,276
I don't need friends.

45
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,971
I've made it this far without
them, why should I change my tack now?

46
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,087
So, then...

47
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:58,227
What the heck am I even doing here with these idiots?

48
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:02,681
I'm so excited that you decided to come, too, Horikita!

49
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:04,981
Kikyo Kushida.

50
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:06,843
She's the picture of benevolence.

51
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:09,333
Liked equally by both girls and guys alike.

52
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,754
And yet, I suspect that she hates me.

53
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:13,644
I have a strange feeling about her.

54
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:18,301
Honestly, I hope that this trip is
what finally leads us to friendship! Yay!

55
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,739
She's an enigma.

56
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,962
Who doggedly pursues friendships
with the people they hate?

57
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,477
I don't get it.

58
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:26,531
What's the matter?

59
00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:29,465
Are we still waiting on Ike, Yamauchi, and Sudo?

60
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:30,981
I thought they were coming with us.

61
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:32,580
Yeah, me, too. I don't know.

62
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,590
Hey, you guys. Sorry we're late!

63
00:05:34,673 --> 00:05:36,828
We all just overslept. Can you believe it?

64
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,921
You overslept?

65
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:41,340
But you three're coming from the direction of the pool.

66
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:44,856
Uh, yeah.

67
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:46,856
It's super not important or anything, okay?

68
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:49,881
Right, don't worry about that.
Hadn't we better get going now?

69
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:52,578
Yeah, time's wasting. Let's go!

70
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:13,673
Oh, my gosh!

71
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:15,056
Hey, you guys!

72
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,207
Are you all headed to the pool, too?

73
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,031
Today's the last day the pool's open,
so we'd better make the most of it.

74
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:26,778
Yeah. Some other people might be coming, too.

75
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:29,308
How long has your chest been that big?

76
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,800
What?! That's awkward.

77
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:34,543
I guess it started in the third year of middle school.

78
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:36,273
Then, they just kept getting bigger.

79
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:38,371
Why do you ask?

80
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,581
Oh, no particular reason.

81
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:44,233
But I see why you always seem to have
more on your plate than you can handle.

82
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,840
Hey, I just realized!

83
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:48,506
This is the first time you've
hung out with all of us, Sakura!

84
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,589
Exciting!

85
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:51,092
Do you like to go swimming?

86
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:52,503
Um. No.

87
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:54,128
I'm not really a fan of it.

88
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:57,215
I'm only here because Ayanokoji invited me.

89
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,573
Oh, I see now!

90
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,965
You came along because you have a crush on him, then!

91
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:03,061
No. I-It's not like that.

92
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,658
It's interesting.

93
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:08,173
I've noticed a lot more people
hanging around Ayanokoji lately.

94
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:11,786
He and Ichinose seem to have
gotten really close. Have you noticed?

95
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:12,845
I have.

96
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:15,295
Honami Ichinose.

97
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:17,737
The central female figure in Class B.

98
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:21,056
She came through for Class D
during an incident in the first term.

99
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,424
But I find her hard to read.

100
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:28,042
What do you think, Horikita? I
bet that makes you nervous, huh.

101
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:30,789
Ayanokoji's social habits make no difference to me.

102
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,949
I have no feelings whatsoever on the matter.

103
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,180
Uh? Oh, really?

104
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:54,590
Operation Young Lust: Phase Two.

105
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:58,002
This is HQ, operatives. Let's get this party started.

106
00:07:58,215 --> 00:08:00,028
Time limit is the end of the day.

107
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:01,827
We've got until the targets go home.

108
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,798
Argos-One here. Roger that.

109
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:13,318
--Ah! You got me! --Take that!

110
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:17,548
All right, it's time to have some fun!

111
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:22,131
Sakura, are you wearing a wet
suit so you don't get sunburned?

112
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:25,256
No, I just don't like showing too
much skin in front of other people.

113
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,820
Ow!

114
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:29,167
I got a brand new swimsuit, you like?

115
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,941
Oh yeah, we like!

116
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:33,881
Uh? Hey, guys. Where did Yamauchi go?

117
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:38,869
How did we lose him so soon?

118
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:40,117
Maybe we should go look for him.

119
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,400
It's okay, there's no need! Don't worry!

120
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:44,673
I bet he's in the bathroom. Let's focus on having fun!

121
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,923
Oh! Look, there's a volleyball court over there!

122
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:49,024
Let's go play! We should go play right now!

123
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:51,803
Fine. But, like, why are you freaking out about it?

124
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:08,054
Listen.

125
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,190
I'm not very good at sports, so maybe I shouldn't play.

126
00:09:11,215 --> 00:09:12,548
No, you should play!

127
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:15,559
We have some strong boys on our team, so don't worry!

128
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:17,055
Okay, here we go!

129
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:19,175
Take that!

130
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:22,423
I hope it's not too crowded.

131
00:09:22,547 --> 00:09:24,756
I left my sunscreen. Can I use yours?

132
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:27,767
Hey, what's this about?

133
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,653
Where are we supposed to change?

134
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:36,356
Damn it! The camera won't cooperate with me at all.

135
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:38,256
What am I supposed to do now?

136
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,711
Uh? What's going on over there?

137
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:43,006
It's the line for the bathroom.

138
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,673
You think something bad happened?

139
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,006
I guess we should go check it out.

140
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,465
No! Stay right here!

141
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:49,881
Who even cares about the stupid line for the bathrooms

142
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:51,528
when we've got a game to win?!

143
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,850
Huh. What's wrong with Ike?

144
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:56,781
I don't know.

145
00:09:56,884 --> 00:09:58,958
Maybe he's just always been this weird.

146
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:02,814
HQ here, come in.

147
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:03,850
Argos-two.

148
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:05,041
Awaiting your report.

149
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:10,559
You there, Argos-two? What's happening?

150
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:14,696
I'm having major trouble.

151
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,072
A failure like me just isn't
cut out for this kind of work.

152
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:19,872
I don't think I can do it.

153
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:21,798
You must keep the faith.

154
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:27,290
Faith in yourself, and in your allies
who have placed their faith in you.

155
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:30,323
Don't stop believing in the cause.

156
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,400
Boo-yah!

157
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,711
I can't!

158
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:37,837
Hey, Yamauchi's been gone a really long time.

159
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:40,423
I think we should go out looking
for him now, don't you agree?

160
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,610
Uh. No way!

161
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:44,048
Don't worry, Kushida. I'm sure he just got distracted!

162
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:46,006
But something bad could've happened to him.

163
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,965
Aren't you at least a little bit concerned?

164
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,965
No, no! I'm sure he's just fine!

165
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:53,820
But, Ike. He's your friend, isn't
he? Shouldn't you be worried about him?

166
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:55,360
Uh. Wait.

167
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:57,562
She'll think I'm shallow if I keep hiding things!

168
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:58,773
If manga's taught me anything,

169
00:10:58,798 --> 00:11:00,452
it's that chicks love male friendships.

170
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:02,815
I can't! If I'm not concerned, she might hate me!

171
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:06,365
No, no, no, I can't give up the cause just for her sake!

172
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:27,584
HQ here, checking in.

173
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:30,312
Argos-two. You're out of time.

174
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:32,446
You must abandon the mission.

175
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,133
Return to the base at once.

176
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:35,762
Forgive me.

177
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:37,427
I am incompetent.

178
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:38,701
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,000
Apologizing is not going to fix anything now!

180
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:45,469
I'm sorry. But I didn't want Kushida
to hate me over this!

181
00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:47,548
Seriously, guys, let's go look for him!

182
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:49,548
Let's all play some volleyball!

183
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:50,828
Yamauchi's back!

184
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:53,007
Wow, the line for the bathroom was insane!

185
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:55,107
It was?

186
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,445
Still, I'm relieved you're back. I was so worried.

187
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,173
So, um, now that Yamauchi's back in the game,

188
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:01,548
do you think it would be okay--

189
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:03,881
Ah! My stomach's killing me!

190
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,506
I've gotta go to the bathroom right now!

191
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,982
...rotate out.

192
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:17,481
Huh? Get this out of my way.

193
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:18,619
Sure thing, boss.

194
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,063
Let's go.

195
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:25,131
HQ reporting!

196
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,090
Enemy-R is approaching quickly!

197
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:29,256
Ah... But I'm just about done with Phase Two.

198
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,206
I can finish it!

199
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:33,131
You don't have time! Argos-one, you have to withdraw!

200
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:34,406
Withdraw, now!

201
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,526
Argos-one! Retreat!

202
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,673
My leg is cramping! I've gotta go!

203
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:11,548
That must be an intense muscle cramp.

204
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:12,631
You're down to five.

205
00:13:12,715 --> 00:13:15,673
Do you want to continue playing,
or should we call it quits for now?

206
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:16,715
Uh...

207
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:17,587
Listen.

208
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:20,312
I think we should call it and
forfeit this one to you guys.

209
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,340
That way we can go take care of Ike and Sudo.

210
00:13:22,423 --> 00:13:24,436
Don't ever give up on your dreams!

211
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,950
I'll play hard enough for both of them combined.

212
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:29,537
So, you better not even think of quitting!

213
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,962
Or are you saying that our beach volleyball
memories never meant anything to you at all?!

214
00:13:34,076 --> 00:13:38,965
Come on, everybody, show me all the passion
and grit you can muster to win this thing!

215
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:39,730
Huh...?

216
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,838
Has Yamauchi always been this passionate about sports?

217
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,398
I never knew that he had a distinct personality.

218
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:50,393
To be honest, I've always had considerable
difficulty telling him and Ike apart from each other.

219
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:56,222
Huh? There's no one cleaning these bathrooms.

220
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:57,338
Setup complete.

221
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:59,048
Now I've just gotta get out of here!

222
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,273
It's too soon to let your guard down just yet,

223
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,036
Argos-one. There are two women there with Enemy-R!

224
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,043
Do you read?

225
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:07,554
I repeat, two women with the approaching enemy!

226
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,220
Ouch, that hurt.

227
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:13,313
Oops. I couldn't stop it.

228
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,605
It's okay. Don't worry!

229
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:15,690
It's cool!

230
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:17,163
This isn't cool!

231
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,518
You can't just come barging in here!

232
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:21,812
The sign clearly says this place is off-limits!

233
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:23,448
Then what are you doing here?

234
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,249
You seriously think I care?

235
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:26,803
I go where I want.

236
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:28,231
Uh...

237
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:31,183
What an unsightly scene.

238
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:35,003
A fight between two bottom-feeders is just pathetic.

239
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:36,927
Sakayanagi?

240
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:38,761
You weren't invited.

241
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,102
Take your mangy dogs and get out of here.

242
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,573
No thanks.

243
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,914
Perhaps I should domesticate you, too.

244
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:48,454
What's all this fuss about here?

245
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,502
--Mm? --Huh?

246
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:56,673
I am aware that this place is a recreational facility.

247
00:14:57,202 --> 00:14:59,798
But, that doesn't mean school rules don't apply.

248
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:02,058
Don't forget you're all still on campus.

249
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:06,080
So the Student Council President decided to show up.

250
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:10,579
I can tell you're holding back.

251
00:15:11,697 --> 00:15:13,849
No, I'm just not very good at sports.

252
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:14,973
You're athletic.

253
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:17,181
I've seen you show your skill, remember?

254
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:23,238
Why do you hide what you're capable of?

255
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,688
Why, does it irritate you?

256
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,437
Or is it that you just don't want to lose at anything?

257
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:28,993
Not in the least.

258
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,423
I admire that.

259
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:34,447
What's the point in playing a game if
you're not committed to winning it at all costs?

260
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:39,486
Being vulnerable and letting your emotions
show would help you make friends, too.

261
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:42,587
I've told you, I don't need any friends.

262
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:45,618
Hey, what's happening in the locker rooms?

263
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:48,478
HQ checking in.

264
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,598
Argos-one. What's your status?

265
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:52,823
I'm ready to withdraw, but I can't.

266
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,476
Help me. With all of the obstacles outside,

267
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:57,610
I'm stuck in here!

268
00:15:58,506 --> 00:16:00,957
It's all over. We made it so far.

269
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:03,514
You can't give up now, when we're so close!

270
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:06,353
Hey, look. I have to ask you.

271
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:11,018
Do you think that this whole thing was a mistake?

272
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,575
How can you say that?

273
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:19,048
Listen. If I don't end up making
it out of this place alive...

274
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:21,412
You must not abandon hope, soldier!

275
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:23,406
Sotomura.

276
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:27,298
You're to refer to me as HQ, Argos-one.

277
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:28,511
And that's an order.

278
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:32,950
Even as you suffer in there for the cause,
you've got comrades out here waiting for you,

279
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:34,300
depending on you.

280
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:36,489
So, do not abandon hope.

281
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:38,301
Heh.

282
00:16:40,904 --> 00:16:43,383
Argos-one? Argos-one!

283
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:44,863
I'm sorry, bud.

284
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:46,533
Almost lost my nerve.

285
00:16:46,976 --> 00:16:48,069
Argos-one!

286
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,881
HQ, you'd better contact Argos-four.

287
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,256
Tell him it's a go. Execute Phase Extra.

288
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:02,426
"Draw attention away from the locker rooms?

289
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:08,040
Student council president, Ryuen, and others, too?"

290
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:12,849
This is getting ridiculous.

291
00:17:13,237 --> 00:17:14,100
Horikita.

292
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,209
I need you to help me with something important.

293
00:17:19,381 --> 00:17:21,239
Look, I have a terrible leg cramp!

294
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:22,900
Stay away from me!

295
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,356
It doesn't look that way to me.

296
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:26,048
Something's going down over there!

297
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:27,881
Isn't that Horikita from Class One-D?

298
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,844
Horikita?

299
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,761
Give me the names of who did this, and Al will go easy.

300
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:36,184
The girl's name is Horikita.

301
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:52,148
What do you think's come over Horikita?

302
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:54,348
I'm just as confused as you.

303
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:57,368
Why do I even have to get involved in this?

304
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:03,872
Allow me to begin by saying

305
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,387
we are Class-D, year one!

306
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:09,388
We've been labeled the defective students at this school.

307
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:11,211
We're the problem children.

308
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:14,886
We're fools, and we fall for the
schemes of other classes pretty easily.

309
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:17,465
So, to the students of Class C,

310
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:20,776
you made a bold move in trying
to sabotage our class before.

311
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:22,190
But now...

312
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,703
...I am grateful for all of your efforts.

313
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,823
Thanks to you, everything is clearer.

314
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:30,318
A class full of defectives will
have a rough time if we aim high.

315
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,756
But now I see that all classes, A to D, aren't
separated by anything as simple as pure academic prowess

316
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,256
or athletic ability.

317
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,548
That's good news.

318
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:41,433
Especially for loser Class D.

319
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,465
It means we could become Class A.

320
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:45,863
We can beat you all and ascend to the top.

321
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:49,261
I promise you this: We will make it to Class A!

322
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,095
Uh?

323
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:55,048
We love you, Horikita!

324
00:18:55,073 --> 00:18:56,006
You're incredible!

325
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,305
You rock!

326
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:05,471
Oh, really, Class D?

327
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:16,755
You better watch it!

328
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,847
Tidal wave, comin' atcha!

329
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:19,965
Ow, ow, ow.

330
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:21,004
What a bunch of perverts.

331
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,330
Hm?

332
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:26,713
There really were cameras set up
in the dressing room, like you said.

333
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:40,208
Seriously.

334
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:41,895
Do you wanna go to the pool with me?

335
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,025
Absolutely not.

336
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,460
Look, to be frank, I need a huge favor from you.

337
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:47,410
Class D's future is on the line.

338
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:48,833
How so?

339
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,534
Ike's the one who suggested we go to the pool.

340
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:54,306
He's planning to set up cameras
in the women's dressing room.

341
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:57,193
 So he and the guys can spy on you all changing.

342
00:19:57,548 --> 00:19:58,238
Uh?

343
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,510
If I had tried to stop them,

344
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:04,023
they probably would have gone behind my back.

345
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:05,864
Found a way to go forward with it.

346
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:09,461
It was better to let them do it and foil them secretly.

347
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:11,949
I hate to admit it, but you were right.

348
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:13,774
Their plan was to set up the cameras,

349
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:17,256
then retrieve them later tonight
after everyone had gone home.

350
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:18,881
But that's not gonna happen now.

351
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:20,356
We beat them to the chase.

352
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:22,590
We could have stopped them earlier.

353
00:20:22,673 --> 00:20:24,522
If we'd removed the cards in advance.

354
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,189
Then they would have gotten nothing.

355
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:28,929
Yeah, that was the initial plan, actually.

356
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:32,939
But the interference from other
classes made things a lot more difficult.

357
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,640
Is that why you made me give that stupid speech?

358
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:37,871
To divert people's attention away from them?

359
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:41,230
But you got such thunderous applause.

360
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,966
Sudo and the others were moved to tears by your words.

361
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:47,895
More importantly, did you have fun at the pool today?

362
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:49,752
You spent your whole summer alone.

363
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,216
So, was getting out refreshing?

364
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:53,649
I didn't come to this school to have fun.

365
00:20:54,006 --> 00:20:55,340
Besides, people bore me.

366
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,962
I have much more fun by myself.

367
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,098
Sure you do.

368
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:00,689
Well, we've got some time before the pool closes.

369
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:08,890
What is your problem?

370
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:10,380
Sorry, I had to do it.

371
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:16,141
Uh!

372
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:20,292
That's payback.

373
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:22,617
Hey! I wanna join in the fun!

374
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,807
Kushida, stop!

375
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,206
We're not playing!

376
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:27,662
Take that! And that!

377
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,750
Hey, Horikita, check it out!

378
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:31,445
Wa-hoo!

379
00:21:32,756 --> 00:21:35,156
You idiots stop splashing my face!

380
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:41,048
Oh. I'm sorry about that.

381
00:21:59,631 --> 00:22:01,387
Uh? What's this?

382
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,930
It's less of a risk to be by myself.
