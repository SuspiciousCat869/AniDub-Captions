1
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,782
Wait, come back!

2
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,738
American Anthropologist Edward Hall divided the
concept of personal space into four general zones.

3
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:29,418
He named one of these the "intimate space" zone.

4
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:31,987
With the "close phase" contained therein.

5
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,370
The latter is near enough for someone to hug them.

6
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:38,363
Many resist letting others into this zone.

7
00:00:39,618 --> 00:00:43,710
However, some people seem to enter
into everyone's close phase easily.

8
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,532
Kushida's one of those.

9
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:50,273
Even if she enters someone's close phase,
she manages not to trigger an aversive reaction.

10
00:00:51,696 --> 00:00:55,223
Even so, Sakura resisted Kushida.

11
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,090
For some unknown reason, she ran away from her.

12
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:05,667
She couldn't even look her in the eye.

13
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:09,997
Why does she fear contact with others?

14
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,300
Um. I'm so sorry!

15
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:44,948
You two are very kind to agree to come with me for this.

16
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,090
No, this whole thing is my fault!

17
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:50,414
I'm the one who owes you an
apology for breaking your camera!

18
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:53,047
Thanks, but I should have been more careful.

19
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:58,273
So, you're going to the electronics store
where you got your camera to get it fixed.

20
00:02:58,523 --> 00:03:00,102
I understand that part.

21
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:02,633
But why did I have to come?

22
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,607
I need you, too.

23
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,832
Man, what a bummer.

24
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:10,457
This is no good. I see what's wrong here.

25
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,865
Looks like a power issue if you ask me.

26
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,715
Mm. Definitely.

27
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,502
Do you have a warranty with you?

28
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:19,851
Should be covered.

29
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:22,181
You did remember to bring it with you, right?

30
00:03:22,357 --> 00:03:23,649
Mm-hm.

31
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:29,469
It hasn't expired, yay!

32
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:33,690
You could have the broken part,
uh--replaced. Completely free of charge.

33
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:39,148
I see. Sakura's scared of strangers.

34
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,155
Of course, this guy would freak her out.

35
00:03:41,444 --> 00:03:43,987
I'm here because she wanted strength in numbers.

36
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:47,874
Um. Do you know how long the repairs will take?

37
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:49,699
Two or three days max, I think.

38
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:51,008
But don't quote me.

39
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:54,370
I need you to fill out this form, but not the whole thing.

40
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:57,023
Fill out your name here, home address,

41
00:03:57,214 --> 00:03:59,570
and your cell phone number.

42
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:08,065
Are you all right?

43
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:11,120
Uh, yeah.

44
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:20,310
Let me do it.

45
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,273
When the repairs are complete,

46
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:25,466
please contact me instead of Sakura.

47
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:26,982
What?! Hey, wait a minute!

48
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:29,026
The camera belongs to her, doesn't it?

49
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:30,858
I don't think we can do that.

50
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:33,966
I'm not comfortable with this.

51
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:35,650
You saw the warranty.

52
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,212
It notes the time and location of purchase
so you shouldn't need her information.

53
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:41,603
I understand that it's store policy,

54
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:43,236
but you won't get in trouble.

55
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:45,857
I can't imagine there being a legal issue.

56
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,093
You don't have to worry.

57
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:49,442
Well. Are you sure about that?

58
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,228
I guess we can do that this time.

59
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,316
By the way,

60
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:03,915
thank you very much for coming to my aid.

61
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,886
No problem. It was the least I could do to atone!

62
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,413
But, listen, Sakura. We're the same age.

63
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,482
You don't have to speak to us so formally.

64
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,190
I'd like to think we're friends!

65
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:15,415
Yes, you've been acting like we're your elders.

66
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,065
Um. Yeah.

67
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:19,126
Makes sense.

68
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,903
I will try.

69
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,523
I mean, I'll do my best.

70
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,665
No need to force anything, either!

71
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,248
Um. Right, I won't.

72
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:26,948
Mm-hm!

73
00:05:28,273 --> 00:05:29,519
I'll be back in a bit.

74
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,167
I'm gonna go freshen up.

75
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:40,117
Being alone with her is awkward.

76
00:05:42,004 --> 00:05:42,322
Hm?

77
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:47,405
Is something on your mind?

78
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:48,788
Do you not feel comfortable with the--?

79
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,943
Listen. What do you think I should do?

80
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,763
I can't figure out what would be best for everyone.

81
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,669
Oh, you mean about Sudo?

82
00:05:58,126 --> 00:06:00,264
The best thing would be to do what you want.

83
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:02,291
"Do what I want"?

84
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:03,372
That's right.

85
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,779
If I keep quiet,

86
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:08,614
I know I'm going to regret it.

87
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:11,297
Why are you talking to me about this?

88
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:14,179
Your eyes. There's nothing scary in them.

89
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:16,004
Eyes?

90
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,711
Never mind.

91
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:19,533
It's... hard to...

92
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:21,482
If you need some advice,

93
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:24,107
I think Kushida's more versed in this kind of stuff.

94
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,815
She showed up for you today.

95
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,179
That's interesting.

96
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:35,703
I can tell that she's grateful,

97
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:38,273
but she doesn't seem to fully trust Kushida.

98
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,879
Maybe she's more perceptive than most.

99
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:45,407
You said you'd regret it if
you kept silent about the fight.

100
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,306
Yeah.

101
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:50,764
Well, I think you already know what to do.

102
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:53,750
Don't do it for Sudo,

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,488
or Kushida, or for any of our classmates.

104
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:58,793
Push all of those thoughts out of your mind.

105
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,912
They don't serve you.

106
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:02,023
Serve me? What do you mean by that?

107
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,872
Thinking that way will only convolute
things and make the choice more difficult.

108
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:10,065
You should trust your instincts,
and testify for your sake alone.

109
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:13,110
You mean do the right thing... for me?

110
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:15,438
That's motivation enough.

111
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:21,308
Sorry for taking so long in there!

112
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:22,898
Oh. Welcome back.

113
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:25,761
All right. Do you guys think
that we should call it a day now?

114
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,362
It is getting pretty late.

115
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:32,206
You're right. Hey, would you mind terribly
if I swung by your room a little later tonight?

116
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:33,268
Huh?

117
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,316
Thanks for having me!

118
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:42,953
You just had to come to my room?

119
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:43,722
What's this about?

120
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:47,434
I found some stuff online that I
thought you might be interested to see.

121
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:50,048
Does this girl look familiar to you?

122
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:57,758
Hold on. Is that Sakura?

123
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,157
It's hard to say if it's her.

124
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:02,328
I can't tell just from the pictures alone.

125
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:04,915
But this one was definitely
taken in one of the dorms here.

126
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,648
Do you think it's her, then?

127
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:07,965
Well, it could be.

128
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:10,314
I thought it was strange that
she was wearing fake glasses,

129
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,107
but now it makes perfect sense.

130
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,416
They're fake?

131
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:16,042
There was no distortion behind the lenses.

132
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,511
So you think she's wearing them to disguise her face?

133
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:21,721
Could that be why she didn't want to testify?

134
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:25,498
It's a message from Sakura.

135
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:27,063
Let's see here...

136
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:29,357
You're not gonna believe this.

137
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,690
She might be willing to help us defend Sudo!

138
00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:33,988
I guess going with her today was worth it.

139
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:38,922
I'm glad she decided she could trust us, but I wonder why.

140
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,336
Hey.

141
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:48,390
Ayanokoji, are you sure you're not
trying to hide anything from me? For real.

142
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:58,732
I've sent out the notification.

143
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:00,797
All in classes C and D were invited.

144
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:03,329
The arbitration hearing is set to take place tomorrow.

145
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,449
Is that so?

146
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:10,021
Class D.

147
00:09:12,898 --> 00:09:13,917
What's wrong?

148
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,482
Did you spend your entire day off with Kushida?

149
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:19,045
Yeah, because of the thing with Sakura.

150
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:21,596
Though we couldn't get her to commit to testifying.

151
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,096
Not definitively.

152
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,523
I see.

153
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,036
What's the matter with you?

154
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:27,805
What do you mean, "What's the matter?"

155
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:30,966
Well... You are epitomizing "that-face" at the moment.

156
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,031
Really? And what do you mean by "that face"?

157
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:35,489
This is just my face.

158
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:36,336
Although...

159
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:39,427
I am amazed at how self-serving
you've been acting recently.

160
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:43,891
You hesitate when I ask for a favor, but
when Kushida does, you gladly jump for her.

161
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:48,722
I'm analyzing, rationally, and precisely,
what factors account for the disparity.

162
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,373
Doesn't matter.

163
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:54,732
Could've fooled me.

164
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:59,860
More importantly. The student council has
decided on the time of Sudo's arbitration hearing.

165
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:01,002
When is it?

166
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:03,616
It's today, after school.

167
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:11,078
We will now begin the deliberation proceedings
regarding the violent incident that occurred last Tuesday.

168
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:13,189
Your presence is appreciated.

169
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:15,065
Now, first of all,

170
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:18,011
I will preside today, as Student Council Secretary.

171
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:22,897
The student council president, attending
arbitration over a little brawl such as this one?

172
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,748
I never dreamed I would see this day.

173
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:30,062
My extremely busy schedule often prevents me from
being present at proceedings I would prefer to join.

174
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,596
As a rule, though, I try to attend.

175
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:35,026
Oh, of course. A coincidence.

176
00:10:35,106 --> 00:10:36,146
Indeed...

177
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:41,592
Horikita wasn't expecting her brother to be here.

178
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,638
It seems like his presence might throw off her game.

179
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:49,582
Let's begin. The object here is to ascertain the truth.

180
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,958
Which version of the events is factual.

181
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:53,873
Is that acceptable, sir?

182
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:55,954
Yes, you may proceed.

183
00:10:56,537 --> 00:10:59,648
Komiya et al, you allege that Sudo summoned you to

184
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:02,440
the special annex last Tuesday,
where he then attacked you.

185
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,023
Sudo denies your claim.

186
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,063
He insists that Komiya summoned him to the annex.

187
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:09,877
Your versions of these events are contradictory.

188
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,158
We can be certain of only one thing.

189
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,398
Sudo attacked and injured you three.

190
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:17,857
Komiya, Kondo, and Ishizaki are the victims here,

191
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:21,256
and we will proceed under the
agreement that they are the plaintiffs.

192
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:23,736
Sudo's the defendant in this case.

193
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,332
I'll admit that I beat them up!

194
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:28,567
But these jerks are the real attackers!

195
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:34,239
Putting the focus on their injuries and giving
Sudo free reign here will do nothing but harm our case.

196
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:35,741
Horikita.

197
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:38,945
...you're jealous that I
got bumped up to first string!

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,079
You always try to sabotage me at practice, but it--

199
00:11:41,104 --> 00:11:43,023
Silence, please. Return to your seat.

200
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:45,117
Without any new evidence or testimony,

201
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,398
we will proceed under the aforementioned assumptions.

202
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:48,889
Is this acceptable?

203
00:11:57,284 --> 00:12:00,035
It's quite apparent there was no need for adjudication.

204
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:03,107
Judging by the severity of the plaintiffs' conditions,

205
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,454
it's clear that the violence was one-sided.

206
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,474
I believe this is sufficient evidence
to allow me to make my decision.

207
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:16,478
Class D's self-defense claim lacks credibility due
to Sudo's absence of injuries. And the plaintiffs'...

208
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:22,337
Hey! Stop it!

209
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:23,288
Uh...

210
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,901
When someone's spacing out,

211
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,976
a strong physical stimulus can often snap them out of it.

212
00:12:33,357 --> 00:12:36,056
The stakes are too high for me to do nothing.

213
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:37,271
...come on! Uh!

214
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:47,436
If you don't start fighting
now, we're going to lose this case.

215
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,138
I beg your pardon.

216
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,644
Before we break, I would like to question the witnesses.

217
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:58,819
Would that be acceptable?

218
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:00,145
President?

219
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:01,603
I will allow it.

220
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,013
The first question.

221
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:09,139
What were the circumstances under which Sudo summoned you?

222
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,740
I need an answer.

223
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:13,373
Uh, when practice was over,

224
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:15,346
he just said he wanted to talk to me.

225
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:16,312
I see.

226
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:20,315
And what was your reasoning for bringing
Ishizaki with you to the special annex?

227
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:22,695
He's not on the basketball team, as far as I know.

228
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,773
There was no reason for him to be present.

229
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,717
I brought him 'cause I wanted extra protection.

230
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:28,654
Protection?

231
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:32,023
Everyone in school knows what a violent guy Sudo can be.

232
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:33,660
And he's pretty big, too!

233
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:36,636
So you're saying you thought he might attack you, right?

234
00:13:36,786 --> 00:13:37,711
That's right!

235
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:40,289
That sounds like a studied response.

236
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:46,646
If I understand, you claim you brought Ishizaki as
a bodyguard, because of his reputation as a fighter?

237
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:48,773
Yeah, I did it to protect myself!

238
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,090
Understood.

239
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:52,730
I have some knowledge of
martial arts, as a matter of fact.

240
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,353
Sudo faced multiple adversaries which
is exponentially more difficult to do.

241
00:13:57,982 --> 00:13:59,732
For him to beat you so soundly,

242
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:03,482
especially with Ishizaki at your back
defending you, doesn't quite add up.

243
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:05,440
Uh! It does!

244
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,123
He only beat us because we
didn't want to get into a fight!

245
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:11,643
If you didn't want a fight, why would
you go, knowing Sudo's propensities?

246
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:15,565
And if you weren't fighting back, how would
all three of you end up with such severe injuries?

247
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:18,301
Common sense tells me Horikita has a good point.

248
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:20,357
You can't use common sense with Sudo!

249
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,190
He doesn't operate that way!

250
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:24,386
He's a violent, unpredictable psychopath!

251
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:25,396
Well, you're in luck,

252
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:27,376
because someone witnessed the entire fight.

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,795
Would the witness please step forward?

254
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:42,898
Welcome, Miss.

255
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,749
Would you state your name, for the record?

256
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:48,607
Yes. Airi Sakura.

257
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:50,489
I'm from Class One-D.

258
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:52,574
Please take a seat, Miss Sakura.

259
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,514
Okay...

260
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,770
Sakura.

261
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:05,594
I did see it. I witnessed the whole thing.

262
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:08,243
Sudo has been telling the truth this whole time.

263
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:10,857
The Class C students attacked him first, like he said.

264
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:13,259
I'm sure of it. They're lying.

265
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,982
Your name's Sakura, is it not?

266
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:20,860
If you did see the fight, then why didn't you
come forward with your knowledge before this point?

267
00:15:20,905 --> 00:15:23,273
Well, you see... Because...

268
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,244
Honestly, Class D students are all the same.

269
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:30,148
I promise this is the truth.

270
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,048
I'm not lying, I swear.

271
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:35,235
Oh, Sakura. Miss Airi Sakura.

272
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:36,792
Let's be honest now.

273
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:38,857
Are you sure they haven't coerced you?

274
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:42,023
The stakes are high, and they'd do anything to save Sudo.

275
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:44,732
This could go badly.

276
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,958
Spin it how you wish.

277
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:48,308
The fact that she's here proves
that she witnessed the fight.

278
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:49,831
I mean, think about it.

279
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:53,883
If she hadn't, why would she show up
today, even if we tried to coerce her?

280
00:15:54,398 --> 00:15:55,401
Oh?

281
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:57,815
If all we needed was someone who'd lie,

282
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,873
why would we choose a girl like
Sakura, who hates to speak up?

283
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:03,533
Perhaps to lend an air of credibility to your case,

284
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:06,065
you specifically chose someone who is well-behaved.

285
00:16:06,323 --> 00:16:07,607
That's all you've got?

286
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:09,648
You're the ones with the burden of proof,

287
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,023
and from where I sit, the facts--

288
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:13,498
It's immoral of you to take advantage of this girl.

289
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:15,957
She's weak-willed, so you manipulate her.

290
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,577
That is not what's going on!

291
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:20,195
Just look at how hard she's trembling over there!

292
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:21,698
You put such a burden on her.

293
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,565
I have real proof!

294
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:27,194
I saw the fight. I'll prove it.

295
00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:29,795
You are only digging yourselves a deeper hole.

296
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,755
Here it is.

297
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:34,479
The proof that I was there. In the annex last Tuesday.

298
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:36,096
See for yourself.

299
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:39,476
Let's see it.

300
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,159
Yes.

301
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:49,107
I was there that afternoon,

302
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,107
looking for a place to take pictures.

303
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:52,558
I don't like to take them around people,

304
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,287
and I knew the annex would be empty.

305
00:16:54,324 --> 00:16:55,929
The photo is dated, too.

306
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:59,082
Dates on digital photos are relatively simple to alter,

307
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:02,070
Miss Sakura. Your proof is rather insubstantial.

308
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:03,878
Just a minute, Mr. Sakagami.

309
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,648
This photo is sufficient proof after all.

310
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:08,607
Hm? Ah.

311
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:14,536
Thank you, sir.

312
00:17:15,294 --> 00:17:16,982
I hope this one will be proof enough.

313
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:19,115
I told you that I was telling the truth.

314
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:21,215
Thank you so much, Sakura.

315
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:29,065
I'll grant you that much.

316
00:17:29,107 --> 00:17:33,221
It seems that you were indeed present in
the special annex on the day in question.

317
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:37,196
But your photo still does nothing to
prove that Sudo didn't start the fight.

318
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:41,023
It also doesn't provide evidence that you
really witnessed everything that happened.

319
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:42,338
But I did.

320
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:45,452
So then, I propose a compromise.

321
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:48,291
A compromise? What kind?

322
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,735
Despite the "evidence" you provided,
you still don't have any definitive proof.

323
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:56,572
However, it appears that Class C may indeed
bear some responsibility in this debacle.

324
00:17:58,948 --> 00:18:01,475
I recommend a two-week suspension for Sudo.

325
00:18:01,738 --> 00:18:04,343
And a one-week suspension for the Class-C students.

326
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,068
Is that acceptable?

327
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,482
The difference in length is commensurate
to the severity in harm done to each party.

328
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:15,323
If Sakura hadn't come forward with her testimony,

329
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:18,467
Sudo would have been suspended
for a month, at the very least.

330
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,416
It is a good bargain, actually.

331
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:25,228
Ms. Chabashira, does that idea sound satisfactory to you?

332
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,634
It would appear we have reached
an agreement that will suffice.

333
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:33,079
Sakura, you did everything you could.

334
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:39,408
Then, that's it.

335
00:18:39,815 --> 00:18:42,607
Miss Horikita, as representative of Class D,

336
00:18:42,883 --> 00:18:45,741
what's your opinion of the agreement?

337
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:48,023
This is my final word.

338
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:49,919
Sudo has a problem.

339
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,421
I think he contributed to this, ultimately.

340
00:18:52,518 --> 00:18:54,825
Even if he's not the one who threw the first punch.

341
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:57,517
He has no sense of how he affects others.

342
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,430
Actions have consequences, but he doesn't see that.

343
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,678
Incidents like this will not stop.

344
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:03,846
What?!

345
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:05,607
You need to see the truth of the matter.

346
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:08,197
Your poor attitude is what started all of this, really.

347
00:19:09,077 --> 00:19:11,023
He does need to reflect on his actions.

348
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:14,225
But not the missteps you claim
he took in fight last Tuesday.

349
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:18,423
I mean that he should reevaluate the
person he has been this whole school year.

350
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:19,948
Horikita?

351
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:22,458
In regards to the incident we're discussing right now,

352
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:23,626
that's different.

353
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:26,989
I truly believe Sudo is free of all guilt in the matter.

354
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:35,857
The truth is, I know that Sudo didn't
stumble into that fight of his own accord.

355
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:40,869
This was a premeditated set-up, instigated
by Class C, and that is truly heinous.

356
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:43,209
I will not back down.

357
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:45,536
I assert that he is innocent.

358
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:50,213
Premeditated set-up?

359
00:19:50,764 --> 00:19:52,511
That's hilarious, young lady.

360
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,060
I think the president's sister is a--

361
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:55,898
As the witness testified earlier,

362
00:19:55,982 --> 00:19:57,763
Sudo's not guilty in this.

363
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:00,662
I implore you to make the appropriate decision.

364
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,421
We've been victimized by him! He's guilty!

365
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:05,273
You shut your mouth! Jerk!

366
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:07,273
I'm innocent, and all of you know it!

367
00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:10,273
You're just trying to sabotage me
and usurp my place on the team...!

368
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:11,837
Just as I predicted.

369
00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:14,273
This hearing was a waste of everyone's time.

370
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:17,252
I'm appalled at the pathetic
behavior on display right now.

371
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:20,315
Nothing can be settled unless the liars come forward.

372
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,449
I agree. This is pointless.

373
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:24,336
Therefore, I ask you, Class C.

374
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,064
Can you honestly say right now that the statements
you've made today are the unadulterated truth?

375
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:31,232
What? Of course they're true!

376
00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:32,829
What about Class D?

377
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:33,995
Certainly.

378
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,797
Very well, then. I will announce
my decision tomorrow at four o'clock.

379
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,011
If I receive no amended statements,

380
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:43,603
as in admission of guilt, nor proof
of your opponents' guilt by then,

381
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:46,638
I will be putting expulsion on the table as well.

382
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:49,011
That is all.

383
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:53,900
Do we have a chance?

384
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:58,348
Well, I don't intend to lose, and I never give up, either.

385
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:01,036
I'm sorry.

386
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:05,320
I should have just spoken up from
the very beginning about what I saw.

387
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,732
I'm not... I'm not brave.

388
00:21:09,913 --> 00:21:11,762
You did just fine. It's okay.

389
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:13,383
But it's not!

390
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:21,161
Why are you two still here?

391
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:23,523
When you showed up with Suzune today,

392
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,232
I assumed you had a strategy.

393
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:28,098
But, I suppose I grossly overestimated the both of you.

394
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:30,773
I never claimed to be some star detective,

395
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:33,023
and I'm not a trial lawyer, either.

396
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:35,190
So, no, I don't have a strategy.

397
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:37,357
You mean Suzune went out on a limb today?

398
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:39,398
She truly believes he's innocent?

399
00:21:39,621 --> 00:21:41,430
I guess it's a radical idea.

400
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:43,251
Interesting.

401
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:45,921
Your name's Sakura, right?

402
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:48,666
Yes.

403
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,885
If you can't provide evidence to corroborate your claims,

404
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,545
they're nothing but lies, and
your mask will become your prison.

405
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:58,187
But... It's not a lie.

406
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,961
I swear. I was telling the truth.

407
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,901
I believe every word.

408
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:10,451
I see. Well, in that case...

409
00:22:20,094 --> 00:22:22,240
Do you have what it takes to prove her right?

410
00:22:22,982 --> 00:22:24,720
I guess you'll find out tomorrow.
