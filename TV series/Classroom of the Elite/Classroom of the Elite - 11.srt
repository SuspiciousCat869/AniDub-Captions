1
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:16,864
We need to segregate the girls' and boys' areas.

2
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:21,322
We should move the boys' tent somewhere else,
and then make the girls' off-limit to the boys.

3
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:22,281
I don't know.

4
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:23,364
What would that solve?

5
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:24,531
If that's what you want,

6
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:26,114
then you guys should move it yourselves.

7
00:00:26,197 --> 00:00:27,739
'Cause I'm sure as hell not gonna!

8
00:00:27,822 --> 00:00:30,322
We weren't even asking for your help, jerk!

9
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:33,054
Hirata, you would help us move it, wouldn't you?

10
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:35,474
Yeah, of course.

11
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,137
I'll do it, but I think that
it's gonna take a little while.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,199
I have no objections to
separating the boys from the girls.

13
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:48,147
But, while he's in the process of moving it,

14
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,502
Hirata would have access to both
the boys' and girls' areas, right?

15
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:53,197
Yeah, and what's your point?

16
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:55,256
I don't think he can be trusted to do it by himself.

17
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:56,967
Hirata isn't like that!

18
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,180
Well, he is a boy, nevertheless.

19
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:02,712
We should add another guy to the tent detail.

20
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:05,127
That will double the manpower effectively,

21
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:08,717
and the other benefit is that the
two boys can keep an eye on each other.

22
00:01:08,947 --> 00:01:10,441
But, that won't work.

23
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,098
There's no way we can trust
any of the boys besides Hirata.

24
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:15,919
There's someone else.

25
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:21,062
And it's him. Ayanokoji.

26
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:59,559
Well, that's wonderful. Trusted by default.

27
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:02,572
Look at it this way, it's a compliment from Horikita.

28
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:04,989
And Karuizawa thought it was a good idea, too.

29
00:03:05,072 --> 00:03:07,006
Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that.

30
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:09,806
Your girlfriend said that I was pretty much invisible.

31
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:11,629
I didn't raise any red flags.

32
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:14,471
Hirata!

33
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:18,227
Sorry, could you come here for a minute?

34
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,964
Uh, yeah, I'll be right there.

35
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:21,781
I can handle the rest of this.

36
00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:22,833
You go ahead.

37
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:24,866
Sorry. Thanks for your help.

38
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,573
The boys' tent is officially moved.

39
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:37,186
Can you talk for a sec?

40
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:40,359
Class D seems to be having trouble.

41
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:42,781
I guess we've all got our fair share of problems.

42
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:47,208
Regardless of the reason behind it, as
a girl, I can't abide underwear theft.

43
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:49,489
It's perverted. Unforgivable.

44
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:53,431
Who do you think was responsible for it?

45
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:57,169
You thought it was me, didn't you?

46
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:00,131
I'm an outsider, so naturally, you all suspect me.

47
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,566
Sudo's not the only one.

48
00:04:04,023 --> 00:04:07,064
That's the truth. Just look at them.

49
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:08,950
They're over there, glaring at you.

50
00:04:09,156 --> 00:04:10,443
Of course he is.

51
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:13,016
Why shouldn't they all be wary of me?

52
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:15,781
If I were in the same position,
I wouldn't trust me, either.

53
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:18,258
For what it's worth, I trust you.

54
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,974
Wow. Thank you.

55
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:27,369
That was honestly the last thing I expected you to say.

56
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:29,376
I was only telling you the truth.

57
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,670
Looks like I'll be dining by myself tonight.

58
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,670
How's it feel, getting forced into menial labor?

59
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:03,449
You've got some nerve.

60
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,868
If it weren't for you butting in, it wouldn't
have happened, and I could have lived today in peace.

61
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:09,393
What was I supposed to do?

62
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,739
I couldn't trust Hirata by himself.

63
00:05:11,822 --> 00:05:13,526
I needed you as insurance.

64
00:05:14,072 --> 00:05:15,072
You know what?

65
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:17,259
Not everyone is hiding some evil side.

66
00:05:17,406 --> 00:05:18,881
Some people are open books.

67
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:20,096
I guess that's true.

68
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,657
Take me for instance: I have nothing to hide.

69
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:24,512
But, still.

70
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:29,051
Most people'd do anything to keep the
world from knowing their innermost thoughts.

71
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:31,070
I know that's how you work.

72
00:05:33,822 --> 00:05:36,746
And, because the virtuous are
often the most hypocritical,

73
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:38,806
I think I'm wise not to trust him.

74
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:43,943
Then why don't you just come clean, already?

75
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:46,603
I don't know what you're talking about.

76
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:47,469
Come on.

77
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:49,835
You haven't been feeling well since the test began.

78
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:51,822
You don't have to hide it from me.

79
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:55,347
I feel perfectly fine.

80
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,607
Hypocrite.

81
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,017
You better get your hand off me.

82
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:15,700
Just stop moving.

83
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,814
Almost 38 degrees Celsius. Huh.

84
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:27,407
What are you, a thermometer?

85
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:33,996
When we all met up on the ship before the test,

86
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:36,628
I asked where you'd been. Remember what you said?

87
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:42,702
Yeah, I told you that I'd been in my room, reading.

88
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:45,863
You weren't resting in your room because you felt sick?

89
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:49,301
This could hurt our score.

90
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:51,080
Do you plan to tell the others?

91
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:56,361
I've already held out for five days at this point.

92
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:59,926
If I tell them about it now, it'd be for nothing.

93
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:12,864
I thought it might rain overnight,
but those clouds look ominous.

94
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:14,761
I wish we had a boat or something.

95
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:16,989
A break from the sun is kinda nice, though.

96
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:20,527
There are some dark storm clouds
coming in fast from the southwest.

97
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:22,388
Weather's gonna get bad.

98
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:24,688
Get ready for things to take an ugly turn.

99
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:25,508
Huh.

100
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:27,327
What?

101
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,240
Oh. It's nothing.

102
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:33,140
We'd better hurry up and gather
food before it starts to pour. Right!

103
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:36,477
And I'm about to gather up a storm, uh, no pun intended.

104
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:38,777
Ike's become pretty reliable.

105
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:41,416
You'd better step it up if
you wanna prove your usefulness.

106
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:42,976
Yeah, same to you.

107
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,567
We've got a lot to gather.

108
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,672
If we're gonna secure a day's rations
for everyone, we've gotta work fast.

109
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:48,389
Duh.

110
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:51,532
So, why are we still standing around talking?

111
00:07:57,697 --> 00:08:00,281
Let's see. Fruit, fruit, fruit.

112
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:01,612
Where's the fruit?

113
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:05,281
Is there something bothering you, Kushida?

114
00:08:05,364 --> 00:08:07,822
I'm just thinking about Ayanokoji and Horikita.

115
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:09,743
They've always been close, haven't they?

116
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:13,586
I wonder what it is about the two of
them that lends itself to such intimacy.

117
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:15,791
That's true, now that you mention it.

118
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:20,260
Are you ready to do this?

119
00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:22,228
Okay, let's spread it out.

120
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:29,302
Hey, Horikita.

121
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:31,075
What is it now?

122
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,314
This is important.

123
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,382
It's about the class's key card.

124
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:37,182
What are you doing to take care of it?

125
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:39,452
I keep it on me at all times.

126
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:41,422
Then, when it's time to renew the spot,

127
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,656
I do it with the other students surrounding me.

128
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:44,995
As was agreed upon.

129
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,861
As for Ibuki and the other classes,

130
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:50,667
there's no reason that they would be able to identify me.

131
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,613
Would you mind if I took a quick look at it?

132
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:55,254
Here? Seriously?

133
00:08:55,656 --> 00:08:58,005
It would actually be best for us to do it here.

134
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:00,268
Taking it out at base camp is risky.

135
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:01,988
I guess, but still.

136
00:09:02,364 --> 00:09:03,447
Why do you want to?

137
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:04,656
What's the point of it?

138
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:09,531
Here's the truth: on the first day of the test, I saw
a student holding what I thought looked like a key card.

139
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:11,063
A Class A guy.

140
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:13,376
The thing is,

141
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:16,497
I have no way of knowing if it
was, in fact, a real key card or not.

142
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,383
'Cause I've never actually
seen one of them up close before.

143
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:21,608
That's true.

144
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:23,864
What you saw wouldn't be positive proof

145
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,434
if you didn't have a reliable point of reference.

146
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,092
Well, then?

147
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:37,199
Dunno. I still can't say.

148
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:40,322
I thought I'd know for certain after I saw it myself,

149
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:42,678
but the color might be
different. I'm not sure.

150
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:47,822
It's also possible that the school gave
each of the classes different color cards.

151
00:09:47,906 --> 00:09:48,623
Yeah.

152
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:50,589
Hey, check this out!

153
00:09:50,614 --> 00:09:52,031
Having a little private chat?

154
00:09:52,114 --> 00:09:53,888
You're a bit too close!

155
00:09:54,197 --> 00:09:56,241
Why you gotta leave the rest of us out of it?

156
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:03,425
Welp, I guess now I have to call you Muddykita!

157
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:07,240
Hey! Why would you do something like that?

158
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,989
C'mon. Now her boyfriend's
supposed to defend her honor. Y'know?

159
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:12,438
Right, Ayanokoji?

160
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:16,443
Ow. Hey, what--?

161
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,039
That hurt!

162
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:29,557
Oh, Horikita. You're covered in mud!

163
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:32,078
We should get you cleaned off right away!

164
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:35,469
Yeah, you're right, I can't stay like this, can I?

165
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:37,984
Horikita.

166
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:41,156
Were you trying to kill him?

167
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:44,820
If I hadn't reacted, you could
have split Yamauchi's head wide open.

168
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,103
Only two fish?

169
00:11:27,156 --> 00:11:28,642
I can't believe you survived that!

170
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,484
Man, she's terrifying.

171
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:34,183
Maybe we should take a dip in the river,
since we're such a mess from working.

172
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:36,906
We won't be able to use the shower for a million years.

173
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:40,662
Yeah, the girls from the foraging team
have called dibs on it for a while, huh?

174
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:41,881
Who knows when they'll be done.

175
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:44,600
Dang, look at that line, man!

176
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:48,523
Huh.

177
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:01,781
Horikita?

178
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:04,507
Um, Ayanokoji.

179
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:11,276
Uh. Do you think you could come
take a walk with me for a minute?

180
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:13,368
We can't talk freely here.

181
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,307
What is this about?

182
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:25,518
You wanted me to go into the forest with
you and search for more food, or something?

183
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:37,980
Horikita?

184
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:45,240
Listen. I was careless.

185
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:48,099
I tell you this with full knowledge of my mistake.

186
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,513
Is that clear?

187
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:51,000
Mistake?

188
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,642
Something was taken.

189
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,221
Wait a minute.

190
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:58,443
You're not telling me that your
underwear was stolen, too, are you?

191
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:01,235
No, it's much worse than that.

192
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:03,503
What I'm telling you is...

193
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:09,479
The class key card was stolen.

194
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:14,760
I don't think we should tell anyone.

195
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:16,739
For right now, let's keep it to ourselves.

196
00:13:16,822 --> 00:13:18,930
Just until we know the extent of things.

197
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:19,710
Yes.

198
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:22,742
If everyone else found out, it
would throw them into a panic.

199
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:25,043
And that's the last thing we need to happen now.

200
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:27,428
I have two suspects in mind already.

201
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:31,184
It's either Karuizawa, or Ibuki, which is more likely.

202
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:33,988
Are things really that bad
between you and Karuizawa?

203
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,269
In ways someone like you would never see.

204
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:38,084
Ways that were inevitable.

205
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:41,572
If you say so, but I seriously doubt it was her.

206
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:44,762
She's been in line for the shower
since before you went to clean up.

207
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:46,342
You're sure about that?

208
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:48,777
Yeah. Saw her with my own eyes.

209
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:51,451
Well, then. Ibuki's the culprit.

210
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:57,463
We should find the right time, and then ask her flat out.

211
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:01,086
Worst case scenario would be if
she took it and ran off with it.

212
00:14:01,614 --> 00:14:02,888
That's true.

213
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:04,688
I'm so sorry.

214
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:07,218
I think it's best if you head back first.

215
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:09,617
I can catch up with you a little later.

216
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:10,664
Sure.

217
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:18,774
It's an unbelievable failure.

218
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:21,836
I bet she's so miserable she wants to crawl off somewhere.

219
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:22,503
Huh.

220
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:55,643
Hurry, someone bring us some water, quickly!

221
00:14:55,668 --> 00:14:56,115
Good idea!

222
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,915
Damn!

223
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,761
She looks shocked. Does this
mean she didn't do it, after all?

224
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:17,868
Someone set the manual on fire?

225
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:20,406
Who would do something like this?

226
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:21,989
I found a fire extinguisher!

227
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:23,697
Step back. I'll put it out!

228
00:15:28,364 --> 00:15:30,572
If it's not one thing, then it's another.

229
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:32,822
Why does this keep happening around here?

230
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:35,781
Does it mean we have a traitor
in class who's turned against us?

231
00:15:35,864 --> 00:15:37,739
Why do you keep assuming it's one of us?

232
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:39,805
This is nothing like the stupid panty theft thing.

233
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,072
We don't know that!

234
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:43,239
Maybe you set it on fire to distract us from it!

235
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:44,506
Don't be stupid!

236
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:46,131
We'd never do something like that!

237
00:15:46,156 --> 00:15:48,381
We're not dumb enough to start a fire in the forest!

238
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,697
--Everyone, just calm down. -- Why would we ever

239
00:15:49,753 --> 00:15:53,175
believe the lies out of the mouth of
some nasty, underwear-stealing pervert?

240
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,864
None of us stole your underwear!

241
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:57,239
Obviously, the perverts stick up for each other.

242
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:58,381
What's wrong with you?

243
00:15:58,406 --> 00:15:59,989
You keep calling us perverts,

244
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:01,531
but maybe you're projecting!

245
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,722
Looks like it's about to start pouring.

246
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,558
I hate this. You people are the worst!

247
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:13,243
I can't believe I have to be in class
with a panty thief and an arsonist!

248
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:14,922
What, are you deaf or something?

249
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:17,156
No one in this class took that stupid underwear!

250
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:20,180
Hey, has anyone seen Ibuki lately?

251
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:23,493
What? She isn't here, either?

252
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:26,965
Huh? She was just here a minute ago, I swear.

253
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:29,073
That sure seems suspicious, right?

254
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,322
Yeah, it's definitely suspicious.

255
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:33,197
Are you saying that she started the fire?

256
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:35,297
Do you think that means this whole time she was...

257
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:38,214
I knew she was a spy this entire time!

258
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:40,763
And now she ran away? Damn that girl!

259
00:16:41,864 --> 00:16:42,798
Not good.

260
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:44,825
Anyway, we can deal with that later.

261
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:46,706
Now, Hirata, what should we do?

262
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:50,069
Uh... Hirata?

263
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:53,080
How could... this happen?

264
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:55,881
I've done nothing to deserve this.

265
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:57,858
How could someone...

266
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:01,651
Who would be so vindictive?

267
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,376
This is just malicious.

268
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:07,735
Hirata. Ike asked you a question.

269
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:12,337
Raining.

270
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:14,125
You should help the others out.

271
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:16,433
The clothes are still hanging on the clothes line.

272
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:18,981
Yeah, you're right.

273
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:20,674
We need to go put them away.

274
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:22,906
And we'd better get out of the rain, too.

275
00:17:22,989 --> 00:17:25,237
Girls, start bringing all the clothes in from the line.

276
00:17:25,364 --> 00:17:27,156
Boys, you go cover up the firewood.

277
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:28,714
It's useless if it's soaked through.

278
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:30,191
Come on. Let's hurry!

279
00:17:30,322 --> 00:17:31,089
Right!

280
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:36,905
That just leaves...

281
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,509
She couldn't have gotten very far.

282
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:40,496
Took you long enough.

283
00:18:45,656 --> 00:18:48,385
The underwear theft and the arson-induced panic.

284
00:18:48,864 --> 00:18:51,120
It's odd how much trouble Class D has now.

285
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:52,559
What of it?

286
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:55,697
Don't play dumb with me. You're a hostile outsider.

287
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:57,383
You know we suspect you.

288
00:18:58,614 --> 00:19:00,464
Do you have the proof to back that up?

289
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:03,589
Unfortunately, I don't have any solid evidence.

290
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:05,547
I can't tie you to the underwear theft.

291
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:06,614
But I'm not dumb.

292
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,306
We both know that you're the culprit.

293
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:10,631
That's not a very nice thing to say.

294
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:13,292
Why don't we settle this the easy way, right now.

295
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:15,605
Give me back what you took from me.

296
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,614
I don't know what you mean.

297
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:23,659
My limbs feel so heavy, and I'm hot.

298
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:27,363
No, am I cold?

299
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:30,175
Things aren't looking very good for me.

300
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:31,930
But I don't care.

301
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,298
I'm gonna tell you one more time.

302
00:19:35,697 --> 00:19:37,364
Give it back to me right now.

303
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:39,177
Take whatever you want.

304
00:19:50,114 --> 00:19:52,280
Hey. You're fast.

305
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:54,613
You could get disqualified for doing that.

306
00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:59,322
Disqualified by whom? No
one's here to see it. Anyway.

307
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,906
I think you came looking for a fight!

308
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:10,399
Nice. You've done this before, haven't you?

309
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:14,658
If I can't get it back, I'll let
Class D down in the worst possible way.

310
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:17,545
I looked down my nose at all of them.

311
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,954
Called them worthless and stupid.

312
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:23,782
When, all along, at the end of the day, I'm useless.

313
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:27,723
A failure, resorting to violence. It's pathetic.

314
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:33,352
Just admit it was you.

315
00:20:33,907 --> 00:20:35,738
You're the one who stole the key card.

316
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:48,397
Since you've worked so hard, I guess I'll tell you.

317
00:20:48,771 --> 00:20:52,063
Yes. I'm the one who stole your precious card.

318
00:20:57,136 --> 00:20:59,802
I expected to have to work a
lot harder to get it out of you.

319
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,284
You can't say I used violence.

320
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:04,263
There's no proof. That's too bad.

321
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,415
If I got that card,

322
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,668
I could analyze your fingerprints.

323
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:12,807
And then I could prove that you stole the underwear, too.

324
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:18,840
If I can just get her off balance.

325
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:31,826
I've been convinced of this for a while.

326
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:34,748
I thought for sure you were involved in it somehow.

327
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:38,548
The fire at the camp earlier.

328
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:43,158
Why do you think I would be
so evasive when talking to you?

329
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:45,973
I just wanted to confirm my suspicions about you first.

330
00:21:46,895 --> 00:21:48,648
Do you mean...?

331
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:00,206
I've gotta go.

332
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:02,779
I have another appointment now, you see.

333
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:05,783
This was a nice talk. But it's over.

334
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,923
Oh, the item that you requested?

335
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,597
I got it for you.
