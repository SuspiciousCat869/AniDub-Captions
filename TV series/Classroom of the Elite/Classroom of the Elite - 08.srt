1
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:19,281
Earth and water might impede us in our
escape from this wretched labyrinth prison.

2
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:21,376
But, the sky is free!

3
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:23,601
You see, even in the darkest depths,

4
00:00:23,626 --> 00:00:26,203
there remains a glimmer of hope.

5
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:27,649
Oh, Father.

6
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,882
You've built such splendid wings.

7
00:00:30,418 --> 00:00:32,126
But will they carry my weight?

8
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:35,754
Can I soar freely?

9
00:00:35,918 --> 00:00:37,600
Above everything?

10
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:40,647
My Icarus. You must listen to me.

11
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:45,084
Freedom can addle the mind, bring delusions and fears,

12
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:48,383
and arrogance can lead one to death.

13
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:50,626
Even the birds fly with...

14
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:53,753
Now, this is an egregious waste of tax dollars.

15
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:59,277
A few days ago, a man, whose name I
won't mention to you, contacted the school.

16
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:03,925
"You must expel Kiyotaka Ayanokoji immediately," he said.

17
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:06,740
Well now, I wonder what his angle might have been.

18
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:09,321
I hope I'm not supposed to know who it was.

19
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:12,669
But we both know you can't
expel me without good reason.

20
00:01:13,293 --> 00:01:14,164
You're right.

21
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,694
As long as you remain a student at this school,

22
00:01:16,793 --> 00:01:19,276
the rules protect you from that injustice.

23
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:22,664
Of course, if you were to cause any trouble...

24
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,163
That's a different matter altogether.

25
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,155
Watch me, Father!

26
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:31,104
Sorry to inform you.

27
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:34,385
But, unlike our arrogant hero, Icarus.

28
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:37,142
I do not intend to challenge
the sun. The sun. It's so near!

29
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:40,084
Your intentions are irrelevant in this case.

30
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:42,584
If I decide that you've become a problem,

31
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:44,695
then a problem is what you are.

32
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:47,716
Is that a threat? Because it sounds like one.

33
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:49,966
Not a threat; it's a trade.

34
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:53,372
If you don't wanna get expelled,
then try to ascend to Class A.

35
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:57,256
And as long as you do your best,
I will cover for you, unilaterally.

36
00:01:57,793 --> 00:02:00,015
A good deal by anyone's standards.

37
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:01,459
Icarus!

38
00:02:01,543 --> 00:02:03,678
Maybe, but I'm not going to take it.

39
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,624
In that case, Ayanokoji.

40
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:11,396
You're going to lose all of your freedom.

41
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:15,032
You're going to be expelled.

42
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,894
Gods of Olympus.

43
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:21,378
I beg of you, put a curse upon me!

44
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:23,670
How dare you.

45
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:25,743
You call yourself a teacher?

46
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:28,862
It would be wise to make your decision with haste.

47
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,432
Will you try to make it to
Class A, or will you get expelled?

48
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:38,593
Curse me! I beg of you!

49
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:48,407
Trying to manipulate me is not gonna work.

50
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,026
You're going to regret your actions.

51
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,228
Don't worry about me.

52
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:57,052
My life is so filled with
regrets that one more won't hurt.

53
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,217
Throw away my freedom,

54
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,188
to protect my freedom?

55
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,793
The eternal summer ocean!

56
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,412
The wide blue yonder!

57
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,251
On a ship, in the middle of the Pacific!

58
00:04:57,334 --> 00:05:02,386
Now this is what I call cruise paradise!

59
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:04,251
Look at that view!

60
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,501
Makes your heart race and steals your breath, doesn't it?

61
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:08,709
It truly is an incredible sight!

62
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:11,121
Aren't you glad you didn't get expelled after all?

63
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,969
Yeah. This trip feels like a dream.

64
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:19,156
I can't believe we go to a school that's so generous
they take us on a nice cruise for no reason at all!

65
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:20,107
Yeah!

66
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:28,009
The luxury cruise ship <i>Speranza</i> .

67
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,810
Onboard, you'll find a four-star restaurant.

68
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,300
A live theatre venue.

69
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:39,355
Pools and other various amusement facilities.

70
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:42,022
There's even a first-class spa.

71
00:05:44,293 --> 00:05:47,017
If I were to purchase a ticket as a private citizen,

72
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:49,363
it would cost me a few hundred thousand.

73
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:50,330
Wow!

74
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:53,226
We can borrow any of these cute swimsuits for free?

75
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:54,630
Hey, Kikyo!

76
00:05:54,802 --> 00:05:56,927
Wouldn't this bikini look so fierce on you?

77
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:59,209
Um, it's a little revealing, don't you think?

78
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,918
Aw, come on, we're on vacation.

79
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:02,086
Live a little!

80
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:07,053
Heads up, Kikyo! Coming at ya now!

81
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:09,377
Got it!

82
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:17,414
I'm doing it.

83
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,834
I'm finally gonna tell Kushida how I feel!

84
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,102
What?! A-Are you serious?

85
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:27,200
If I don't, I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

86
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:29,859
Can't have that.

87
00:06:30,251 --> 00:06:31,126
Ike.

88
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:32,847
Go do it, then.

89
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:35,262
Okay! Here goes nothin'!

90
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:41,290
So, what is it? You okay?

91
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:44,948
I was wondering.

92
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:45,744
Hm?

93
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:48,277
May...

94
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,575
May... May... May...

95
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:56,127
May I please have the extreme honor
of calling you by your given name?

96
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,239
Well. Please don't keep me waiting.

97
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:02,459
Would you allow me to call you Kikyo?

98
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:06,829
Yes, but only if you allow me
to call you Kanji, in return!

99
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:10,645
Uh, Kanji?

100
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,543
Kikyo! Kikyo!

101
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:20,168
Kanji, please!

102
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:22,435
Whaddaya know. He pulled it off.

103
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:24,918
All he did was call her by her first name.

104
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,363
Ayanokoji!

105
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,459
You've got to tell me Horikita's given name!

106
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:30,137
Huh?

107
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:33,343
Tell me Horikita's first name
right this second, or I'll go crazy!

108
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:35,043
I think it's Suzune.

109
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:39,101
Suzune. It's beautiful. Lovely.

110
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,201
All right!

111
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:42,680
I'm gonna go find her and call her Suzune.

112
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:46,588
Hi, Suzune.

113
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,918
Suzune, can you talk for a sec?

114
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,543
Suzune, you wanna take a walk with me?

115
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:56,793
Airi. Airi. Airi. Airi. Airi. Airi. Airi.

116
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,700
What is their problem? This is weird.

117
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:11,427
Heh. I'm beautiful.

118
00:08:15,543 --> 00:08:18,009
Whoa, is this place free to everyone, too?

119
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:20,218
Do ya think they would send us a bill for it later?

120
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:24,143
Well, people from all the other
classes are eating, so it's probably fine.

121
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:26,267
I think we should go somewhere else.

122
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,404
Okay, where should we go?

123
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,424
Welcome.

124
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:31,681
Would you gentlemen like a table for four?

125
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:33,678
Uh. Sure.

126
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,909
Hey, what kind of food is this, anyway.

127
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,035
Look, they have French: "Fro-mage de teh-teh?"

128
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:43,151
With a delicate, aromatic herb reduction?

129
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:44,809
Look. No worries.

130
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:47,751
Let's just order whatever, 'kay? Hey, over here!

131
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:48,709
S'cuse me!

132
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:50,376
Can we order some food already?

133
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,470
Hey, dudes!

134
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:53,921
You're all from Class D, aren't you?

135
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:57,809
Yeah. And what about it, buddy?

136
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,056
A bit of advice.

137
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,434
This fine establishment isn't
intended for garbage like you.

138
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,554
What?!

139
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:05,959
Trashy people should be eating trashy food.

140
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:08,121
Get yourselves some burgers and fries.

141
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:11,621
What the hell do you have
against burgers, you little punk!

142
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:12,800
Yahiko.

143
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:17,334
Cease with these ridiculous provocations now.

144
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:18,912
But, Katsuragi...

145
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:24,326
Despite the fact that we're on vacation, we
could still lose points for unsavory behavior.

146
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:28,791
Please conduct yourself in a
manner befitting a Class A student.

147
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,322
Uh. Yes, sir.

148
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,645
You lot would also do well to mind your manners,

149
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:36,602
and stop being a nuisance to those around you.

150
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:39,228
Huh? What did we do, exactly?

151
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:40,481
Uh!

152
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:43,834
He's the one who assaulted
those poor guys from Class B.

153
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:45,688
He's got crazy eyes!

154
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,876
I hear he's actually killed people.

155
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:48,776
Really?

156
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:50,184
Gimme a break, you guys!

157
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,129
Repeating your mistakes?

158
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:54,994
Do you intend to get yourself into trouble again?

159
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:57,838
Don't get worked up. Let's go.

160
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:04,498
Katsuragi, from Class A.

161
00:10:14,793 --> 00:10:16,772
Yeah, there we go.

162
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:19,543
Um, Ms. Hoshinomiya?

163
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:22,697
Sorry, sorry. Go on. You were saying?

164
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,501
I think Sakayanagi and Katsuragi from Class A,

165
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,674
and also Ryuen from Class C--

166
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:30,217
they're the ones we should be keeping an eye on.

167
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,283
And what about in Class D?

168
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:35,745
Well, Horikita and Hirata, for sure.

169
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:39,474
I feel like there's someone
else from Class D, too, though.

170
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:42,218
I've heard rumors that
Koenji has really good grades,

171
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:45,509
and his athletic abilities are
apparently amazing, but I don't know.

172
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:47,209
No, it wasn't Koenji.

173
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:48,515
I know that much.

174
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:51,001
Are you thinking of Ayanokoji?

175
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,475
Yeah! There's something about him.

176
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:57,019
My gut says to watch out. He's on my list for sure.

177
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:01,709
But, Ms. Hoshinomiya, I can't
just go on your gut instincts alone.

178
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:04,043
You're such a meanie!

179
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:17,995
A few days ago, a man I won't
mention, contacted the school.

180
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:23,060
"You must expel Kiyotaka Ayanokoji immediately," he said.

181
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:29,396
Hirata?

182
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:31,644
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

183
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:32,672
No.

184
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,050
Good, I'm glad.

185
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:37,171
I'm about to go hang out with
Karuizawa and a couple of her friends,

186
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,349
so do you wanna come with me?

187
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:40,748
Karuizawa?

188
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,049
I'll pass, thanks.

189
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,077
I don't really know her, or any of her
friends, now that I actually think about it.

190
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,068
This might be a good opportunity.

191
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,608
No better time than the present.

192
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:57,628
Does he honestly care about my social
life that much? Or is it something else?

193
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:04,210
Ayanokoji.

194
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:07,903
The truth of it is, there's something
I wanted to ask you to help me with.

195
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:09,299
You want my help?

196
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:14,207
Would you be willing to act as
a liaison for me and Horikita?

197
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:17,264
I think if we want to unite
Class D and make progress,

198
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,872
well, she'll be an integral player in making that happen.

199
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:23,067
So that's what this is about.

200
00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:24,751
I've heard she's great.

201
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:28,276
That she's the one who proved Sudo's
innocence, and that was no small feat.

202
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:30,267
If we could work togeth--

203
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,290
Shouldn't you answer that?

204
00:12:36,543 --> 00:12:38,918
Sorry. I guess I'd better get going.

205
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:41,453
If you change your mind and wanna join,

206
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:43,483
just call me and I'll let you know where we are.

207
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:45,123
I'll do that.

208
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:46,533
Cool, later, then.

209
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:48,168
Hello?

210
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,748
Sorry. I'm on my way.

211
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:52,126
Sir! Please wait!

212
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,684
We'd prefer that you dry off before
walking on the carpet if you don't mind!

213
00:12:57,097 --> 00:12:58,584
Sorry to break protocol,

214
00:12:58,668 --> 00:13:01,434
but I've never toweled off
after swimming in my entire life.

215
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,171
Sir, please listen to me!

216
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:06,392
So, would you say that I am,

217
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:09,449
"dripping with beauty" or "manliness"?

218
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:11,959
Beautiful!

219
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:13,920
Sir, I'm begging you!

220
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:33,514
This is exactly what I deserve.

221
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:46,126
You sure got here quickly.

222
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,626
I did. What did you summon me for?

223
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:49,987
To ask you a question.

224
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,430
Do you believe they'd just give us a holiday?

225
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,761
I'm sure there's some kind of catch.

226
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:56,780
Go on.

227
00:13:57,584 --> 00:13:59,248
I think we're heading to an island.

228
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:03,145
The school owns it, and there's a boarding
house on it big enough for all the first-years.

229
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,067
When we get there...

230
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:08,028
We can't let our guard down for a minute.

231
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:09,311
They're watching us.

232
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:11,076
It would appear that I have found you at last.

233
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:18,723
You set up decoy cameras in the special annex.

234
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:21,255
That was a clever little prank you pulled, missy.

235
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:23,257
Sorry, I don't know who you are.

236
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:27,924
There's a special place in my
heart for women like you, Suzune.

237
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:30,939
I don't know how you accessed that information,

238
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:34,320
but I've never given you permission to use my given name.

239
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,451
That's a nice expression.

240
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,721
I think it's incredibly sexy.

241
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:41,668
Like I said, I don't know you, and I don't want to.

242
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:43,893
I find your presence repulsive at best.

243
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:46,439
I'm just one of your devoted fans.

244
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:48,249
How dare you!

245
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:52,151
Next time, I'll deal with you personally.

246
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:54,554
I'm so looking forward to it.

247
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:56,156
Ryuen!

248
00:14:58,001 --> 00:14:59,251
Oh, Ibuki, it's you.

249
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:01,434
I need to have a talk with you right now.

250
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:03,281
Heh, heh.

251
00:15:03,543 --> 00:15:06,043
Missed me so much you had to see me?

252
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:07,584
Don't be ridiculous!

253
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:10,285
I'm fed up with the way you
operate, and I won't stand for it!

254
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:12,784
I see. That's all right.

255
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,381
We can talk about it later in my room.

256
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,032
Just you and me.

257
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:21,350
Albert!

258
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,567
You're going along with this?

259
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:30,337
I see you've officially become Ryuen's guard dog.

260
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:34,227
Get back here right now, Ryuen!

261
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,168
I'm not finished talking to you!

262
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:40,243
Let me go!

263
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,821
That's enough.

264
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,415
Hey. Are you okay?

265
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:54,088
It's none of your damn business.

266
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:03,216
Class C seems to be on the verge of collapse.

267
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:09,293
That's my full report.

268
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:10,587
I hope it's enough.

269
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:15,370
Thank you for all of your thorough
and diligent work, Ms. Masumi.

270
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,707
What should I focus on now?

271
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:19,398
Good question.

272
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:22,479
I want you to investigate some students.

273
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:24,867
Which ones?

274
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:31,336
That's check.

275
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:50,282
So that's what I've been thinking.

276
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,164
How do you feel?

277
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:56,867
Um, would you ever want, well, um, want to d--

278
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:58,668
d-date--

279
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,251
Sakura?

280
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:02,251
What's wrong?

281
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,934
Um. Hi. Uh.

282
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:05,501
How long have you been standing there?

283
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:06,928
I literally just got here.

284
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:08,057
Did you...

285
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,674
Did you hear what I said before you spoke?

286
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:11,543
No.

287
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:13,551
Thank goodness.

288
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:14,813
Why?

289
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,563
Oh, um, I just...

290
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:18,971
Uh...

291
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:20,501
Is something going on with you?

292
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:21,582
No! No.

293
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,679
Nothing bad is going on with me, exactly.

294
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,968
But I'm having trouble making
conversation with our other classmates.

295
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:34,168
So, I'm sorry for asking for your help with it.

296
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:35,442
Don't be sorry.

297
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,224
If you just need someone to listen,

298
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:39,941
that's something I'm happy to do.

299
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,253
Thank you so much!

300
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:46,190
Sure.

301
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:48,001
It's not like it's that big of a deal.

302
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:51,501
Huh? Is that Ayanokoji and Sakura?

303
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:54,616
See you later.

304
00:17:54,763 --> 00:17:55,847
I'm going back to my room.

305
00:17:55,871 --> 00:17:57,751
Wait, come back!

306
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:00,828
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,300
I wanted to say hi, but I should have left you two alone.

308
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:04,131
'S cool.

309
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,019
I guess Sakura still hasn't
overcome her fear of strangers.

310
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:12,500
What a beautiful, starry sky!

311
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,123
Right? It's pretty. Don't you think so?

312
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:20,001
When Kushida displays behavior like this,

313
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:21,329
it's easy to forget.

314
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:23,610
She was like a different person that night.

315
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:27,633
Well, I'd better get back to my room.

316
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:30,499
Are you done for the night already?

317
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,419
Yeah, I'm gettin' very sleepy.

318
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:33,693
Sounds good.

319
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:35,618
I guess I'll see you tomorrow, then.

320
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:37,411
Have a good night!

321
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,065
Yeah, thanks, same to you.

322
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,138
Hold on.

323
00:18:50,448 --> 00:18:51,457
Kushida?

324
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,896
You're wary of me now, aren't you?

325
00:18:58,631 --> 00:18:59,569
I knew you were.

326
00:19:00,043 --> 00:19:02,190
I can always sense that sort of thing.

327
00:19:08,818 --> 00:19:09,625
Sorry.

328
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,320
When people leave me all by myself, I get kind of lonely.

329
00:19:15,376 --> 00:19:17,214
I thought that maybe you were...

330
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,175
Never mind, it's nothing.

331
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,572
Forget about it!

332
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,688
Good morning, students!

333
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:48,567
Time to rise and shine!

334
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:52,281
Our island destination will soon be in view!

335
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:57,458
We hope you'll take a few minutes to bask in
the sight of this highly significant scenery.

336
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:59,264
Don't let the moment pass you by!

337
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:01,439
Significant scenery?

338
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,484
Dang! Get a load of it!

339
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,355
Good morning! Isn't this so exciting?

340
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:15,481
Yeah. Good morning.

341
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:18,662
It's simply breathtaking.

342
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,097
Don't you think it's beautiful, too, Ayanokoji?

343
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:24,165
The usual Kushida.

344
00:20:24,668 --> 00:20:26,876
By the way, have you seen Horikita this morning?

345
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,751
Why ask?

346
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,581
I thought she would be with you.

347
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:30,535
I haven't.

348
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:33,860
She doesn't quite seem like
the type to revel in a vacation.

349
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:35,622
So she's probably in her room.

350
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,335
I bet you're right.

351
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,501
As we make preparations to disembark on the island.

352
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:58,180
We'll brief you on what you can expect once we dock.

353
00:20:58,205 --> 00:21:00,251
Until then, you're required to wait here.

354
00:21:00,334 --> 00:21:02,958
It's so hot. I wish they'd speed things up.

355
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:04,626
Have you been in your room?

356
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:07,184
Yes. I was reading, what of it?

357
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,626
It was extremely engaging, too.

358
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:14,693
But, since we're not allowed to bring our
personal belongings, I won't get to finish.

359
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:16,918
Anyway, what is this?

360
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:19,929
We'll confiscate your student IDs.

361
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:22,815
In their place, you will wear these wristwatches.

362
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:27,043
Those who take them off without
permission will be severely penalized.

363
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:29,193
They're all acting especially cautious.

364
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:30,919
Like they're on high alert.

365
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:32,190
I agree.

366
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,501
I can't imagine they'd go this far

367
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,150
if we were just here for a little fun on the beach.

368
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:39,954
I'm Mashima, the instructor for Class A.

369
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:44,242
To begin with, I'd like to express my
gratitude that we all made it to the island.

370
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:46,452
Almost all of us.

371
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:49,142
One of you won't be able to join because of an illness,

372
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,644
and that's a real shame.

373
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:55,465
Without further ado,

374
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:59,266
I'm glad to announce the beginning
of this year's special examination.

375
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:00,351
Huh?

376
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:02,307
Special examination?

377
00:22:04,293 --> 00:22:06,575
The duration of the test is one week.

378
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:10,994
You'll live as a group on the picturesque
desert island you see before you.

379
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:14,418
You are your own responsibility from here on out,

380
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,381
so you're expected to behave accordingly.

381
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:21,944
Now! The test of survival begins!

382
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:25,010
Looks like vacation's over.
