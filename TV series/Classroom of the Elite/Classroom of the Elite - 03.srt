1
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:23,047
We owe it all to you, Kushida!

2
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,403
Yeah, you totally saved our butts on this one!

3
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:28,005
You guys, it's not like I took the test for you!

4
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:29,339
You're an angel!

5
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,660
Kushida, you must have been
sent from heaven to help us pass!

6
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:36,401
Ayanokoji.

7
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:39,994
Be honest. What exactly did you do?

8
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,818
Nice serve!

9
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:21,440
You want some? Come and get it!

10
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:24,854
What, do you think you're in some kind
of gangster movie with that thug act?

11
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:27,096
Man, you're ugly inside and out, you pathetic loser.

12
00:02:28,302 --> 00:02:30,172
Say that again, punk!

13
00:02:30,922 --> 00:02:35,865
Kushida asked me to try to get him to
come to her study group, but I don't know.

14
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:43,711
I can't wait to see how many Class D idiots
get expelled after they fail the next test.

15
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,223
I bet I know who will be first.

16
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:03,714
I hope you've said your prayers.

17
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:05,225
All right, that's enough!

18
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:06,755
What? Who're you?

19
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,713
Keep your damn nose out of it!

20
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:14,543
As one of your fellow students, I cannot allow
violence to be perpetrated on this campus, understand?

21
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:17,451
If you all insist on continuing to fight anyway,

22
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:19,541
I'm going to have to call security.

23
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,500
Look, Ichinose.

24
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,548
There isn't even a fight to continue.

25
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:25,355
Sudo's victimizing us.

26
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,483
Is that so?

27
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:30,458
Well, from where I'm standing, you
certainly don't look like victims to me, Ryuen.

28
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,865
And if you don't cut it out, I'm going to
report every one of you to the administration.

29
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:39,130
Hey, monkey.

30
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:40,389
You son of a--

31
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:43,048
I think you're going to make a mighty fine plaything.

32
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:45,379
Hey, punk! You runnin' away?

33
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,703
Answer me!

34
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:49,042
I'm talkin' to you!

35
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:50,086
Relax.

36
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,179
Listen, Sudo.

37
00:03:53,204 --> 00:03:55,571
Don't let him get you all wound up like that, okay?

38
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,666
Shut your mouth. You don't rule me.

39
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:02,820
Sorry for all the drama, guys! Everything's cool now!

40
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:05,050
Thanks a bunch, Ichinose!

41
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:08,732
Okay guys, do your best to stay out of trouble.

42
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:09,572
See ya!

43
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:12,737
Dammit!

44
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,617
Sudo. Are you free for the next hour?

45
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:18,380
Kushida wants you to come to her study group.

46
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:21,122
No way. I've got practice.

47
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:23,937
Ike and Yamauchi are both in it.

48
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:26,354
Hey.

49
00:04:26,523 --> 00:04:28,339
Are you sure you'll be all right on your own?

50
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:30,812
There's no point in cramming for it now.

51
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:32,559
I'll take my chances.

52
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:37,586
Sudo!

53
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:40,380
What's the matter with you today?

54
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:41,700
Sorry!

55
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,511
Hey, Sudo.

56
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,670
Can we talk for a minute?

57
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:56,189
Are you seriously okay with
getting expelled from this school?

58
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:57,909
Just get off my back.

59
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,589
So, you'd give it up, then.

60
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:00,483
Basketball?

61
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:07,151
I've summarized all the information
from class in this notebook.

62
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,205
Just so you know,

63
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:13,468
I'm only doing this
for my own sake.

64
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,436
You really should study for yours,
if you know what's good for you.

65
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:21,073
That way you won't get expelled and you can
keep playing on the basketball team at this school.

66
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:27,755
Ayanokoji. I can't believe you invited me to lunch.

67
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,426
This sure is a first!

68
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:32,147
Did you want to talk to me about something?

69
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,571
Yeah, just promise you won't breathe a word to anyone.

70
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:35,293
Mm-hm!

71
00:05:42,337 --> 00:05:43,346
Let's go.

72
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:49,538
Excuse me. Are you an upperclassman?

73
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,642
I'm Kiyotaka Ayanokoji from Class One-D.

74
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:54,955
You're in the D class for your grade, too, aren't you?

75
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:56,112
Well, yeah.

76
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:59,344
The free food selection is pretty abysmal, isn't it?

77
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:00,743
What do you want from me?

78
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:03,531
I wanna consult with you about something.

79
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:05,866
Don't worry, I will make it worth your while.

80
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,091
About what?

81
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,263
Do you still have any of your class's midterm questions

82
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:11,684
from two years ago?

83
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:14,881
I want you to hand them over to me.

84
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:18,114
Why are you asking me, and not the other upperclassmen?

85
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:19,757
Is it that hard to see?

86
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,143
People like you, who're short on class points, are way
more likely to see the benefit of striking a deal with us.

87
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,093
And don't think I didn't notice how hard you were
struggling to eat that wild vegetable lunch combo.

88
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:35,112
How much will you pay?

89
00:06:35,422 --> 00:06:36,743
Ten thousand points.

90
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:38,068
It's as high as I'll go.

91
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:40,519
I'd be taking a big risk here, too.

92
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:43,014
I would need 30,000 at the very least.

93
00:06:43,238 --> 00:06:44,774
I'm afraid that won't work.

94
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:45,936
Sorry to disappoint.

95
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:47,791
You can forget making a deal with me, then.

96
00:06:47,818 --> 00:06:49,224
Please reconsider!

97
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,115
We're doing this to prevent a friend of
ours from getting kicked out of school!

98
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:55,108
I'm begging you to help us.

99
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:57,576
10,000.

100
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:00,693
No, 25.

101
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,202
10,000.

102
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:05,634
20,000.

103
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:08,351
10,000. That's it.

104
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,172
15,000.

105
00:07:12,255 --> 00:07:14,114
I can't possibly go any lower.

106
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:16,620
I can live with that. You've got a deal.

107
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:20,263
That is, if you include your
quizzes from the first term as a bonus.

108
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:21,885
Okay...

109
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:23,898
I can't ever thank you enough!

110
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,090
But, still...

111
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:29,904
How do you know that it'll be okay?

112
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:31,160
Don't worry about it.

113
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:33,277
This is all well within school rules.

114
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:36,888
I suppose that could be true.
But studying old test questions?

115
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:39,162
That feels an awful lot like cheating.

116
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:40,995
I disagree with you on that.

117
00:07:41,398 --> 00:07:44,392
His reaction to our proposition only confirmed my theory.

118
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,821
Trading old test questions among students
is nothing out of the ordinary at this school.

119
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:51,964
Maybe that's because they're just that: old questions.

120
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:55,290
What if this year's exam isn't
anything like the one from before?

121
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,421
The old test may not contain the exact same questions,

122
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:01,453
but I'm willing to bet it'll still cover the same content.

123
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:02,782
You think so?

124
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:04,610
Try not to worry about it.

125
00:08:04,797 --> 00:08:08,338
This is our first line of defense against
Sudo and the others getting expelled.

126
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:14,760
Here we go. He started with a quiz.

127
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:20,150
It's the same. Identical, down to the letter.

128
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:21,254
Oh, that's great!

129
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:23,218
So, what does that mean about the midterm?

130
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:25,717
It'll prob'ly be the same as last years, too.

131
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,425
We should show that to the whole class,
not just the people in danger of failing.

132
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:30,323
Not yet.

133
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:32,499
We'll hold off on showing it to them for now.

134
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,393
But, why?

135
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:36,292
Say we show them the questions ahead of time.

136
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,955
What do you think they'll do in that knowledge?

137
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:43,601
They'll memorize all the answers instead of study!

138
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:44,939
That's precisely it.

139
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:47,880
Ayanokoji, are you a lot smarter than you let on?

140
00:08:47,964 --> 00:08:50,028
I'd say I'm more cunning than smart.

141
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:54,822
Hey. Do you think you could do me a favor?

142
00:08:56,107 --> 00:09:00,112
When we do this, can you tell the class
that you're the one who got the questions?

143
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:03,928
Sure, if you want, but wouldn't you
like to get credit for your hard work?

144
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:07,047
I don't like to draw attention to myself unnecessarily.

145
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,471
And anyway.

146
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:11,468
I think our classmates trust
you a little more than they do me.

147
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:13,452
Okay, then.

148
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:16,060
If you're positive that's what you really want.

149
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:17,328
I appreciate it.

150
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:21,823
Well. I guess this means you and I
have our own little secret, don't we?

151
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:27,401
Hang on, everyone!

152
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:31,148
There's something I want you to
have before you leave for the day.

153
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:33,246
What, test questions?

154
00:09:33,357 --> 00:09:35,489
Did you make these up, or something?

155
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:38,624
Actually, they're questions that
were on the midterm a couple years ago.

156
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:40,922
I got them last night from one of the third years.

157
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:42,012
Seriously?

158
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,797
Mm-hm. He told me that the tests have been
pretty much identical for the last couple of years.

159
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,880
So, I bet they'll be helpful in
studying for tomorrow's test, too!

160
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,939
Are you freaking kidding me?!

161
00:09:51,964 --> 00:09:55,230
Heck, I wish I'd had these
before I ran myself ragged studying.

162
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:56,634
This is awesome!

163
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,202
Here you go, Koenji!

164
00:09:58,241 --> 00:10:01,955
I beg your pardon, but I don't
need to resort to such tactics.

165
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,579
And I've got a hot date tonight, so excuse me.

166
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,322
Have fun with your studying.

167
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:08,617
Hey, Kushida.

168
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,541
I know things like this might be beneath you,

169
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,130
but I want you to have one, too.

170
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:14,142
Can I ask you a question?

171
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,473
Thanks a million, Kushida!

172
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,198
I shall be forever in your debt!

173
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:27,005
To be honest, I think the only
reason I might have done okay...

174
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:30,105
I can't say I'm surprised. Kushida plays the role well.

175
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,516
That's an insult.

176
00:10:34,297 --> 00:10:36,339
I must say, I'm impressed with you.

177
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:40,326
I never imagined you'd be able to
bring your scores up so much on this exam.

178
00:10:41,326 --> 00:10:43,965
I acknowledge that you must have put in the effort.

179
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:45,529
However...

180
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:53,006
Sudo got a failing grade.

181
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:54,791
Too bad.

182
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,312
What? You've got to be kidding!

183
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:06,145
How could I possibly have failed?!

184
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:10,453
The threshold for failure on
the midterm exam was 40 points.

185
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,709
The average class test score was 79.6.

186
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:17,051
When I divide that by two

187
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:21,356
then round up to 40 points,

188
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:24,591
I get the minimum score needed to pass.

189
00:11:24,922 --> 00:11:26,445
By less than a point?

190
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:30,616
We only knew each other for a
short time, and I know you tried.

191
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:33,830
Your expulsion notice will be issued after class anyway.

192
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,374
So, that's it?

193
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,987
I'm getting expelled?

194
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:38,349
Wait, Miss Chabashira!

195
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:40,271
Is there anything we can do to save him?

196
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:43,047
A failing score is a failing score.

197
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:44,782
Are you sure that's the final word?!

198
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:47,347
We just can't let Sudo get kicked out like this!

199
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:49,024
It doesn't seem right.

200
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:52,691
Rules exist for a reason. Just get over it.

201
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:56,732
Homeroom is over for today.

202
00:11:56,851 --> 00:12:00,758
Sudo, I'll be waiting for you in
the faculty office after school.

203
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,519
Well, are we just gonna let them do this? It's terrible.

204
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,874
Sudo is going to be expelled.

205
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,132
Ayanokoji?

206
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:19,166
Sorry. Gotta go to the restroom.

207
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:40,592
What do you want?

208
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:43,331
You'll be tardy if you don't head back to class.

209
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:44,311
Yeah, I know.

210
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,742
But I have a question.

211
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:47,446
A burning question.

212
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:49,017
Make it fast.

213
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:53,216
Right now, in Japan, do you
believe that our society is equal?

214
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:56,319
That's quite a question for a boy of your age.

215
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:59,567
But is there any point in my answering it this moment?

216
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:01,362
It's important to me.

217
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:03,461
I would appreciate an answer.

218
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:06,709
Well, speaking from my own experience.

219
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:12,714
Our society is definitely not equal. Not in the least.

220
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:14,527
I'm inclined to agree with you.

221
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,042
The word "equality" is a lie that we're told.

222
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,765
But still. Humans are rational.

223
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:22,376
We didn't become social beings for no reason.

224
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:24,766
What are you trying to say?

225
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:28,003
What I'm saying is, for rules to be effective,

226
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:31,245
they have to at least appear
to apply equally to everybody.

227
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:32,209
Huh?!

228
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,536
So, what do you want?

229
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:42,084
Sell me a point on that test, to add to Sudo's score.

230
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,422
You sure are an interesting kid.

231
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:52,649
Do you really expect me to sell you a single test point?

232
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:55,897
Well, why not? It goes along with
what you told us on the first day.

233
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:01,214
To make purchases, you will spend points, which
are tracked using the school's computer system.

234
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:05,521
At this school, you can buy
absolutely anything on campus with these.

235
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:10,613
For rules to work, they must be applied across
the board, even when it comes to the midterm.

236
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:12,026
I see what you mean.

237
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,996
Maybe there is something to your little idea after all.

238
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,373
Okay.

239
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:18,880
However, that doesn't mean you
can afford that single point.

240
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:19,964
It's quite a lot.

241
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:21,629
So, give me a number.

242
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,584
Let me see.

243
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:29,485
If you can cough up 100,000 points, right
here and now, then we'll have an agreement.

244
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:31,800
That's just cruel, Ms. Chabashira.

245
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:33,795
That's part of the rules, too.

246
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,703
I'll help cover it.

247
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,147
We don't know what the punishment is.

248
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:43,154
The price for losing one of our classmates might be high.

249
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:48,051
I've determined that there may be certain
advantages to us keeping Sudo around.

250
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:49,790
Horikita.

251
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:53,658
I thought that you people might keep me on my toes.

252
00:14:54,297 --> 00:14:57,799
Very well then. I'll sell you Sudo's test point.

253
00:14:58,545 --> 00:15:02,218
You can tell him you saved him.
He won't be expelled after all.

254
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:03,846
Are you sure about this?

255
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,185
You made your case and I agreed.

256
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:08,169
I couldn't refuse now.

257
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:18,206
Just so you're aware, never in this school's
history has a D class managed to advance.

258
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:20,798
Do you think you'll be the first?

259
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:24,517
I can't speak for him, but I
will ascend to a higher class.

260
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:26,724
Is that so?

261
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:29,041
And how do defectives such as yourselves,

262
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:30,931
plan to achieve such a goal?

263
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:37,165
From what I've seen "defectives" can sometimes
be fixed with only the slightest of alterations.

264
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:39,262
At least in my experience.

265
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,872
I can't wait to see how that turns out.

266
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:47,829
As your teacher, I sincerely hope that you succeed.

267
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:53,482
Class C is gaining on us.

268
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:55,888
Looks like Ryuen must be at work again.

269
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:00,303
He's dangerous for us.

270
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:07,933
Don't you find it all boring?

271
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,703
Class A has 1,004 points.

272
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:18,149
For some perspective, we only have 87 right now.

273
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,025
To be honest, becoming Class A feels like a pipe dream.

274
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:23,584
I'm not going to give up.

275
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,414
I will advance to Class A, no matter what.

276
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:28,797
If you say so.

277
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:29,714
What's that?

278
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:32,211
Well. I definitely owe ya one.

279
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,128
Thanks for jumping in to help me save Sudo.

280
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:36,894
Didn't I tell you?

281
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:40,147
I did that to benefit myself and for no other purpose.

282
00:16:40,505 --> 00:16:43,627
Hm... Is that really the only reason?

283
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:45,165
What are you talking about?

284
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,544
I think you care more than you let on.

285
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,660
You knew Sudo would get a borderline
score on the English midterm.

286
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:54,520
So you intentionally lowered your score.

287
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,241
That's a very nice thing to do
for someone you once fought with.

288
00:16:58,422 --> 00:17:00,339
Wonder why you changed your mind about him.

289
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:03,339
I told you, I only did it to help us advance to Class A.

290
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,666
Yeah, okay.

291
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,422
Just keep tellin' yourself that.

292
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:09,442
Hey. You've got an attitude.

293
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:12,526
I don't like it very much, Ayanokoji.

294
00:17:12,672 --> 00:17:13,385
Uh...

295
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:16,191
You'll regret it if it causes you to suffer,

296
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:19,134
or you'll regret it if you feel despair.

297
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:23,107
Which of the above experiences would you prefer?

298
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,468
Well, if it's up to me, I think I'll take "neither."

299
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:28,880
But what's she doing with that compass?

300
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:31,184
Ouch.

301
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,403
Cheers!

302
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:39,488
Hey! Why the long face, man?

303
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,625
I have no objections to the fact that we're
celebrating, and I'm glad to be a part of it.

304
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,285
But why does it have to be in my room?

305
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,922
Man, that was a close call, am I right?

306
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:51,407
If Kushida hadn't gotten those old test questions,

307
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:55,033
Ike and Sudo would be long
gone by now, you know what I mean?

308
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,775
Hey. You just barely squeaked by, too, y'know.

309
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,905
I just haven't gotten my act together yet.

310
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:01,130
Sudo, how did you manage to fail...

311
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,964
Hey, Ayanokoji!

312
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:04,512
What is it?

313
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:08,478
How were you able to get them
to take back Sudo's expulsion?

314
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,780
Horikita talked to the administration.

315
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,267
She told them that it wasn't right to expel someone
as they're struggling to learn. She said it's a process.

316
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,143
Hey, wait a minute.

317
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,702
Horikita, is that true?

318
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,107
I've never seen her speak so passionately about anything.

319
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:30,867
It was quite impressive.

320
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:35,008
She presented this carefully constructed
indictment, and none of them could argue with her.

321
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:37,878
That's amazing, Horikita. You're a real hero.

322
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:40,753
Wow, I guess I had the wrong idea about you all along!

323
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:42,903
Can you believe it? All for you.

324
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:45,713
No, I can't. Why would she do that for my sake?

325
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:48,176
Look, I didn't.

326
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:50,887
I was doing it for my own benefit and nothing else.

327
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,922
Wow, beauty, passion, and brains!

328
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:54,722
I'll say!

329
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,166
Thanks for helping me out. I really appreciate it.

330
00:19:02,464 --> 00:19:03,697
I should thank you!

331
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,983
You didn't have to let us have the party in your room.

332
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:07,207
No prob.

333
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:11,801
Hey, can I ask you something?

334
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:13,078
Yeah, what?

335
00:19:13,714 --> 00:19:17,142
Well, would you say that girls
like Horikita are your type?

336
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:19,486
I'm just curious.

337
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:21,192
I always see you two together,

338
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:23,796
and all the girls in class are talking about it.

339
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:27,177
Horikita and I are just friends.

340
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,824
No, she's just my neighbor.

341
00:19:31,464 --> 00:19:32,511
I see.

342
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,150
Okay, then.

343
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:37,430
I guess I should head back to my room.

344
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,584
Right.

345
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,078
Well, goodnight.

346
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,779
Goodnight to you, too.

347
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,327
Uh?

348
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:58,208
I thought the girls were on the higher floors.

349
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:06,721
Where could she be going this late at night?

350
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,131
I don't see why I should be hiding, but...

351
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:18,160
What a pain in the ass.

352
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:19,006
Uh?

353
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:23,005
So, you think you're better than
me just because you're prettier?

354
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:25,628
I hate your guts!

355
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:28,839
I swear to god, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!

356
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:31,339
I wish you would just drop dead, Horikita!

357
00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:33,987
I hate you! I hate you!

358
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:35,547
You stupid cow!

359
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:40,622
Who's there? Is someone spying on me?

360
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:45,700
It's just me.

361
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:47,177
Ayanokoji.

362
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:50,412
I'm sorry. You left your phone in my room.

363
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:53,901
Did you hear me?

364
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:57,903
If I told you that I didn't, would you believe me?

365
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:03,544
If you breathe a word about this to anyone, you'll pay.

366
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,076
How, exactly?

367
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,759
I'll tell everyone in the entire
school you attempted to rape me.

368
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:12,989
But you know that isn't true.

369
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:16,861
You're wrong.

370
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:19,279
I have the evidence to prove it.

371
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,422
Your fingerprints and DNA in a very telling location.

372
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:26,457
That's all the proof I need.

373
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:29,163
I'm deadly serious.

374
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:32,631
I understand. Can I please go back to my room?

375
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,425
You got it?

376
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,267
If you betray me, I'll make you pay.

377
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:48,635
Ayanokoji.

378
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:51,912
I want you to answer just one question.

379
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,137
Can you promise me right now that you
won't tell anyone what you heard me say?

380
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,382
I'm glad to hear it,

381
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:06,516
and I choose to believe you for the time being.

382
00:22:09,697 --> 00:22:10,848
All right, then!

383
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,469
Well, I guess this means we have another secret!

384
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,853
Kushida. I don't understand.

385
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:20,994
Who are you, really?
