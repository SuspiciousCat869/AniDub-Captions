1
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,781
Ah! Hey, stop splashing me!

2
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:23,906
Couldn't help myself.

3
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:25,822
It doesn't hurt to have some fun!

4
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,853
Fine. Bring it on!

5
00:00:28,364 --> 00:00:30,952
Ah, free time during swim class.

6
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,951
People have naturally broken up into
groups, which makes sense, I guess.

7
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:36,952
It's official.

8
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:40,036
I have utterly failed at making friends.

9
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:42,220
I'm destined to be a loner.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,334
What are you brooding about over here?

11
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,387
Oh, I was just embroiled in a painful internal struggle.

12
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:55,864
How can these losers even enjoy themselves?

13
00:00:55,947 --> 00:00:58,246
You'd think that they would be more deflated.

14
00:00:58,364 --> 00:00:59,797
Maybe that's how these guys cope.

15
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:02,143
They wanna have some fun, while they still can.

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,355
You could be right, I guess.

17
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:05,994
Hey, stop it!

18
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:40,889
They sure are having a good time.

19
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:43,515
It's early in the spring for swimming to start,

20
00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:46,128
and they're first years on a free class period.

21
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:49,742
It's normal for them to enjoy themselves, don't you think?

22
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:52,219
They're like a bunch of grade school kids.

23
00:02:52,364 --> 00:02:55,134
Although, I suppose I can't really fault them for it.

24
00:02:56,197 --> 00:02:57,669
But in the S-system,

25
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,583
they're going to suffer for that attitude.

26
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:02,996
But aren't you and I just like them?

27
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:04,341
Maybe.

28
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:06,995
The S-system...

29
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:12,449
Indeed, this is called the S-system.

30
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,156
It evaluates students in real time,

31
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,172
and assigns numerical value.

32
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:22,473
Observe. Class D has thoroughly proven
that you deserve to be ranked dead last.

33
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:25,769
You truly are the worst of the worst.

34
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:28,037
Zero?

35
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:36,178
However, I am rather impressed with this class.

36
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:39,239
Never in the history of this
school has a class blown through

37
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:42,906
all of their points in the first month, not even Class D.

38
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:47,703
Excuse me, will you at least tell us what the
school's criteria is for gaining and losing points?

39
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:51,475
You're preparing for the real world, so figure it out.

40
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:55,556
In the workforce, you're expected to
come to the table knowing what to do.

41
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,822
On the board, I have written the current
scores held by all first-year classes.

42
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:06,728
For every point the class gets, 100 private
points are distributed to each student individually.

43
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:12,360
When the school year began, each first-year
class was allotted 1,000 collective points.

44
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:15,812
To be frank, you people lost every point you had.

45
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:21,987
Teacher. Will we get the chance to earn any points back?

46
00:04:22,114 --> 00:04:23,285
Of course.

47
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:26,631
And in doing so, if you earn more points than Class C

48
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:28,822
you'll be promoted up to Class C,

49
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:31,489
and Class C will be downgraded to D.

50
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:36,756
Your earliest opportunity to do this is coming
up in the midterms. Depending on your scores,

51
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:39,489
you can earn as many as 100 points for the class.

52
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:41,239
A hundred measly points?

53
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,781
Yeah, but it's better than nothing, right?

54
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:45,034
However...

55
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:48,739
...these are the grades from
the most recent quiz you took.

56
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,795
And, as you can see, they are complete garbage.

57
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:55,114
From this point forward,

58
00:04:55,316 --> 00:05:01,747
anyone who receives a failing grade on any
midterms or finals will be expelled immediately.

59
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:12,437
Considering this most
recent development,

60
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:15,694
everyone in class is gonna have
to completely change their habits.

61
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:18,406
And that's only to get us a few meager points.

62
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:21,921
So, if everyone doesn't ace the midterms,
we're all going to be royally screwed.

63
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,281
That's right.

64
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,002
Even more than that, if we're going to measure up

65
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:30,739
and achieve the high college entry and employment rates
they promised us, we're going to have to push ourselves

66
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:33,114
from here on out to overtake Class C.

67
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:36,450
Beating Class C has to be the primary goal now.

68
00:05:36,697 --> 00:05:40,870
'Cause if we can't even do
that, we have no hope of advancing.

69
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,285
Were you just doing an impression of Chabashira?

70
00:05:46,702 --> 00:05:47,759
No, why?

71
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,079
Sounded like her. A little.

72
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,233
I was wondering.

73
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:55,054
Do you play sports or something?

74
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:56,975
No, not at all.

75
00:05:57,281 --> 00:06:00,290
In fact, in middle school, I did nothing extracurricular.

76
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:02,427
That makes no sense.

77
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:05,381
Your forearms are so muscular, I thought you must.

78
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,950
Hey, there, Horikita!

79
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:10,038
Do you maybe wanna come swim with us?

80
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:11,754
Would you please go away?

81
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:13,072
You don't have to be mean.

82
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:14,489
Are you a bad swimmer or something?

83
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:16,864
No, I am an incredibly average swimmer.

84
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:22,239
Back in middle school, I was probably the worst swimmer
in the whole wide world! But then I practiced really hard,

85
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:24,489
and nowadays I don't think I'm that bad at all!

86
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:26,536
Wow. That's fascinating.

87
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:31,374
She's totally aloof, isn't she?

88
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:34,900
I do wish I could find a way to get along with her better.

89
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,297
Hey, guys.

90
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:41,133
Do you have a minute to talk about something?

91
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:44,906
We didn't get any points again
today, and that has got to change.

92
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:48,229
I don't want this problem to haunt us
for the rest of our time at this school.

93
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:50,519
We have to do something to turn this around.

94
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:54,406
There's no way I want to go all the way to
graduation without earning any more points.

95
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:56,684
I agree, we can't let that happen!

96
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:59,543
You're right, and we won't. We'll turn this around.

97
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:02,667
Next month, we're going to get
more points than any other class.

98
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:05,072
I don't know why you keep saying, "we," like that.

99
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:07,439
Seriously. You can leave me out of it!

100
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:20,004
Class D again.

101
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:24,714
You're both in Class A.

102
00:07:24,864 --> 00:07:27,887
Sakayanagi... and Katsuragi.

103
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:30,614
Congratulations are in order.

104
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:34,084
Your class earned a total of 940 points this month.

105
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:35,364
Quite a feat.

106
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,992
I do hope you're both very proud of yourselves.

107
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:41,904
Now, then.

108
00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:44,735
How much do you know about the S-system?

109
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,697
Hey, Doc! You're my best friend.

110
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,029
You gotta help me out!

111
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:51,944
Buy this console from me for 20,000 points?

112
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:53,797
Actually, it's so funny.

113
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:57,335
I spent all my points on
accessories so I'm totally broke now.

114
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,856
I was thinking about borrowing a couple of points
from all the girls in class to buy the essentials.

115
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,489
You're one of my best friends, aren't you?

116
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:05,681
Do you have any plans for lunch?

117
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:09,061
I was wondering if you would be able to join me.

118
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,276
Well, let's eat, then.

119
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:15,709
Thank you for the food.

120
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:20,952
I have to ask... Are you sure it's okay that
I put this super expensive lunch on your tab?

121
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:22,707
I feel awkward.

122
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,185
Yes. I told you to get whatever
you wanted, and I meant it.

123
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:29,188
Lunch today is my treat. So don't feel awkward.

124
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,919
What now?

125
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:33,444
Is something wrong with you, Ayanokoji?

126
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:34,760
Dig in, already.

127
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:36,322
Right.

128
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:40,221
Now, listen, I want you to hear
me out on something important.

129
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:45,394
I'm aware that Hirata and the others
worked out a plan of action earlier today.

130
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:47,827
They're all forming a study group.

131
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,385
Their goal is to make sure they ace the test.

132
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:51,776
A study group?

133
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:54,820
Yes. But three of our classmates refused to join,

134
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:57,982
and it just so happens they're
the ones with the lowest scores.

135
00:08:58,218 --> 00:08:59,385
Sudo, right?

136
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:01,970
Yes, and Yamauchi and Ike, as well.

137
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:03,739
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

138
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:06,459
Those three never did strike me as the studious type.

139
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,822
I don't see how anyone could fail a test.

140
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:11,947
Nevertheless, the fact remains--they did.

141
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:15,236
There are kids out there who don't even
know what it means to be a good student.

142
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,805
I guess some people really are that pathetic.

143
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:20,295
That's cold. Don't you have any sympathy?

144
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:23,305
Would being sympathetic keep it from being true?

145
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:25,072
If we don't do something,

146
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:26,851
they're most likely going to fail.

147
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:29,489
And if we want to overtake Class C,

148
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:32,697
not only do we have to stop our
class from hemorrhaging points,

149
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,388
but we've also got to do everything
in our power to start gaining them back.

150
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:39,234
Are you saying you want to start a study group, too?

151
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:43,447
You're willing to help Sudo, Ike, and
Yamauchi get good grades on the midterm?

152
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:44,330
Yes.

153
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:45,497
Seriously?

154
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:48,756
Of course. If left to their own devices,

155
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:51,704
they'll sink, and bring the rest of Class D with them.

156
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:55,092
I may have to be relegated to the lowest class in school,

157
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:58,546
but not for long. I will claw my way up to Class A.

158
00:09:58,697 --> 00:09:59,810
Hey, wait a minute.

159
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,197
What now?

160
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,789
Did you just say you want to be Class A?

161
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:05,002
You heard right.

162
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:06,822
You sure you didn't mean Class C?

163
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,156
I meant what I said.

164
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:13,279
I find my assignment to Class D utterly
offensive and unacceptable. I intend to change it.

165
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,672
So, step one is to rehabilitate the failures?

166
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:19,029
Since you've grasped that, you can guess what's next.

167
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:20,711
I'd rather not.

168
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:22,284
Do you enjoy your lunch?

169
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:25,281
An extravagant meal like that doesn't come free.

170
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:28,989
Even an idiot could see you're
expected to provide something in return.

171
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:34,529
And don't think I've forgiven you for conspiring with
Kushida and taking me to that café under false pretenses.

172
00:10:34,656 --> 00:10:36,033
That was foul play.

173
00:10:36,322 --> 00:10:37,552
That's not cool.

174
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:41,671
If you want to make it up to me, then you'll
work with me to help save the whole class.

175
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:46,089
Your job will be to round up those three
losers, and convince them to join my study group.

176
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:48,642
Here's my phone number and email.

177
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,930
All right, contact me if you need anything along the way,

178
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:54,356
but don't think you can reach out whenever you want.

179
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:02,287
This is how I get a girl's number for
the first time in high school? Pathetic.

180
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:04,967
I'm not even happy that she gave it to me,

181
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,944
but I'd better save it, anyway.

182
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,906
I guess I have to comply,

183
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:14,342
even though I technically never agreed to this.

184
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:18,544
Well. Here goes nothin'.

185
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:19,793
Leave me alone.

186
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:21,281
Yeah... no.

187
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:23,381
The hell'd you say to me, punk?!

188
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:26,146
I knew it was hopeless.

189
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:31,327
Maybe I could enlist help from someone who can get through
to those three. I should have done that to begin with.

190
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:34,610
I wonder if she's home right now.

191
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:37,104
I can call her room.

192
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,951
Hi, can you connect me to Kikyo Kushida's room?

193
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,717
Yes, from Class One-D.

194
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:47,625
Yes, it is about something school-related.

195
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:48,874
Yes.

196
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:53,858
Um, hello?

197
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:56,114
Hi, this is... Hold on.

198
00:11:56,197 --> 00:11:57,531
What's that weird noise?

199
00:11:57,614 --> 00:11:59,322
Oh, Ayanokoji?

200
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:04,762
Sorry, was it too loud? I just got out of the bath.

201
00:12:05,614 --> 00:12:08,072
I was blow-drying my hair, sorry about that.

202
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:09,656
You caught me a little off-guard.

203
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:13,117
I've never used the dorm's internal
land line before, so I was startled.

204
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,743
I'm amazed you answered.

205
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:17,656
Anyway, rejoice, Kushida.

206
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:20,371
I've selected you as a good will ambassador.

207
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:23,114
It's for the good of the class,
so I know you'll do your best.

208
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:26,616
What do you mean? Uh...

209
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,739
Right. Wow.

210
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:31,861
A second study group for Sudo, Ike, and Yamauchi?

211
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:33,749
Run by Horikita, herself?

212
00:12:34,072 --> 00:12:39,531
Well, when a friend needs help, I always answer the call,
no matter what it might be. I'll do whatever it takes!

213
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:41,131
You don't have to, you know.

214
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:45,781
I think it's cruel that anyone who fails
gets expelled immediately.

215
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:48,194
The thought of having
to say goodbye so soon,

216
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:52,194
especially after we just got to
know each other? I mean, that's awful.

217
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:54,531
Oh! I do have one request.

218
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:56,364
In exchange for helping you guys,

219
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,110
I want to join the study group, too.

220
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,281
Would that be okay?

221
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:01,114
Uh, are you sure that's all you want?

222
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,744
Yeah! I want to help the cause in any way.

223
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:05,291
Let's see... Oh!

224
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:08,531
Why don't I give you my cell phone
number so you can contact me whenever,

225
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:10,531
instead of just when I'm in my room.

226
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:12,009
You're cool with that?

227
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,572
Yeah! I mean, we're classmates, right?

228
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:16,656
Sorry I didn't give it to you until now.

229
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:18,347
I just didn't think of it.

230
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:21,102
You can reach out anytime you want.

231
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:24,049
I've got Kushida's phone number.

232
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:30,259
Uh? Wow, she works like lightning.

233
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:31,705
Good job, Kushida.

234
00:13:36,913 --> 00:13:38,529
And... sent.

235
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,460
--Hel--? --No.

236
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,489
Can you at least hear me out for a minute--?

237
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,281
Are you kidding me?

238
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:16,051
What do you mean "what"?

239
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,906
I thought I was being perfectly clear.

240
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:20,032
You should be glad.

241
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,441
All three of them have agreed to
come to the study group, including Sudo!

242
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,597
Thanks to Kushida, your little plan just might work.

243
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:33,740
I hadn't even sent that yet!

244
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,436
I understand. Is that her final word?

245
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:40,223
Yeah. Even after you helped make it happen.

246
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,698
I'm really sorry.

247
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:45,989
Right! It's okay!

248
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:48,675
You just let me handle her from here on out.

249
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:01,425
Call me incompetent again!

250
00:15:01,572 --> 00:15:06,259
Well, if you don't know how to solve a simple
simultaneous equation, I don't know how to proceed.

251
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,739
I shudder to think of what the future holds for you.

252
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:11,406
Sudo, stop!

253
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:13,575
Who needs algebra, anyway?

254
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:15,614
When am I ever gonna use it, huh?

255
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:20,364
If I wanted to prepare for my future, I'm better off
playing basketball to get ready for a career in the pros,

256
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:22,239
not sticking my nose in some book.

257
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,201
Really?

258
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,593
Delusional.

259
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:26,646
<i>You</i> playing pro basketball?

260
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:30,319
Do you even have an inkling of how
difficult it is to get to that level?

261
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:33,718
It requires commitment and
dedication that you sorely lack.

262
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:36,453
Face it, you don't have what it takes.

263
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:39,416
I didn't skip practice to come here and get insulted.

264
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,739
I knew this was a waste of my time.

265
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:43,377
You know what. I'm out, too.

266
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:47,179
Horikita might be smart, but I don't
want help from someone so condescending.

267
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:49,471
I'd rather fail than
be treated like crap.

268
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,718
Yeah, same here!

269
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:52,906
If you want to get expelled, be my guest.

270
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:54,447
See how much I care.

271
00:15:57,114 --> 00:16:01,805
I left it to you, like you said, Kushida,
and look what happened. Do something.

272
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:08,092
Look, Horikita. No one's going to study with you if
you make them feel stupid when they make a mistake.

273
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:11,084
Yes, I can acknowledge that I was wrong about them.

274
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:14,519
It's clear to me that this is
all a fruitless waste of my time.

275
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,134
What do you mean?

276
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:19,072
I mean that if those idiots are
going to drag us down with them,

277
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:21,871
we're better off without. I say, "good riddance."

278
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:24,816
I see.

279
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:28,072
Okay, then. I'll work it out with them myself.

280
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:29,424
I promise.

281
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,720
I don't think we should give up on our friends so
soon, and it'd be sad if those three got expelled.

282
00:16:34,197 --> 00:16:37,175
I won't abandon them, and I
think you'd rather not, either.

283
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:39,958
That's why you started this group in the first place.

284
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:45,143
If you're being sincere right now,
then I appreciate the sentiment. I do.

285
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:50,107
Tell me, why did you really
agree to help us in this endeavor?

286
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,001
Are you just trying to sabotage me?

287
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:56,281
I can't believe you. Do you really think that?

288
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:57,989
I'm not an underhanded person.

289
00:16:58,072 --> 00:17:01,863
The fact that you would even assume that about me
makes me feel so sad for you.

290
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:05,111
It's awful, and I hope
you don't mean all that.

291
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:28,315
I need to go get some fresh air.

292
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:33,107
Suzune.

293
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:35,697
I'm amazed you had the brains to track me down.

294
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:36,906
Listen, brother.

295
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,156
I'm not the failure that I was in the past.

296
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,614
I followed you because I want to prove that I've changed.

297
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:44,104
That's Horikita, but who's she with?

298
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:45,581
"Brother"?

299
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,572
Prove you've changed?

300
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:52,794
Hardly. After all this time, you clearly have
not come to terms with your own shortcomings.

301
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,989
You're foolish to think you
could succeed here, leave now.

302
00:17:56,072 --> 00:17:58,572
You're wrong! I'm going to be in Class A soon.

303
00:17:58,656 --> 00:17:59,506
Then you'll see!

304
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:00,469
Don't bother.

305
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,056
I promise.

306
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:03,883
I know I can make it.

307
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:06,617
You're an irrational little brat.

308
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:08,712
The student council president?

309
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:13,784
Do you ever stop to think of
the shame you bring this family?

310
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,720
My own little sister in Class D. Pathetic.

311
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:19,364
Withdraw from school if you know what's good for you.

312
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:21,464
Brother, please just listen.

313
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:23,422
You don't have the right to better yourself,

314
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:27,789
nor do you have the ability
to do so. Someday you'll learn.

315
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:32,104
Ayanokoji, don't!

316
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:33,251
Seriously?

317
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:35,610
You really were planning to hurt her, weren't you?

318
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:37,783
You better let her go, now.

319
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:41,676
Go away. This doesn't concern you.

320
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,981
She sounds like a completely different person.

321
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:50,447
Close one.

322
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:57,239
You fight like an expert.

323
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:59,234
Which of the arts do you practice?

324
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:01,329
Piano and calligraphy.

325
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:03,611
Ah. Now I get it.

326
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:09,540
I think I know who you are. I'd heard there was a
student who got 50s on all of his entrance exams.

327
00:19:09,822 --> 00:19:13,474
The other day, you got a 50 on one
of your quizzes in class, as well.

328
00:19:14,427 --> 00:19:19,047
Are you trying to make some kind of statement,
scoring exactly half of what you should at this school?

329
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,542
Wow, that's a strange coincidence.

330
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:25,296
You pride yourself on being unique, I see.

331
00:19:26,102 --> 00:19:26,960
Suzune.

332
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:31,572
I'm surprised you've made a friend,
although I assume you had to bribe him.

333
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:33,637
You're wrong. He isn't my friend,

334
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:37,463
he's just a classmate. I don't
need any friends, you know that.

335
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:42,555
As usual, your immaturity is leading
you to mistake isolation for independence.

336
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:49,593
Anyway. If you truly wish to be in a less humiliating
class, you're going to have to work a lot harder.

337
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:03,940
I'm sorry you had to witness all of that.

338
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:05,413
It's okay.

339
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:09,521
It was sort of a relief to see you acting
like a normal girl and not some kind of--

340
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:11,856
I didn't even say anything.

341
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:15,979
I'm impressed by your skills.

342
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,212
It's just piano and tea ceremony.

343
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:20,373
You said it was calligraphy.

344
00:20:20,572 --> 00:20:22,313
Yeah, I do calligraphy, too.

345
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,969
How did you doctor your scores
on all of the entrance exams?

346
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:28,189
Tell the truth.

347
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:31,157
I told the truth. Coincidence.

348
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,597
I don't get you at all. You're such a weirdo.

349
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:37,890
Huh, sure.

350
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:40,634
So, were you serious about disbanding the study group?

351
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,656
Yes. It's a waste of my time.

352
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:46,339
If those losers wanna fail, that's their prerogative.

353
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:48,427
It makes no difference to me.

354
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:51,048
Even though failing would get them expelled?

355
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:53,787
I don't care what happens to anyone but me,

356
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:56,864
and their exit would motivate the rest of us to be better.

357
00:20:56,947 --> 00:20:59,094
I don't see a downside to any of that.

358
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:02,596
Without them, it will be easier for our class to advance.

359
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:05,422
I don't think I could have asked for a better solution.

360
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:07,281
That sounds like flawed thinking.

361
00:21:07,364 --> 00:21:09,031
Maybe you're just lying to yourself.

362
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:11,735
It's a shortcoming.

363
00:21:12,114 --> 00:21:16,948
You make the assumption that other people hold you back,
so you always keep them at an arm's length as a rule.

364
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:20,868
Have you ever considered that
your isolationist philosophy might

365
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:24,078
be the very thing that landed
you in Class D in the first place?

366
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:27,788
Ridiculous.

367
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:48,604
And so it went.

368
00:21:50,197 --> 00:21:51,979
Everything looked hopeless.

369
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:55,902
Nevertheless, the day arrived.

370
00:21:56,822 --> 00:21:58,075
And all of us...

371
00:22:01,281 --> 00:22:03,427
...we students of Class One-D,

372
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:06,226
every last poor soul...

373
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:13,544
In grammar, math, chemistry, civics, English,

374
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:16,279
and every other classroom subject...

375
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:20,464
...we dodged the bullet

376
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:22,188
with higher scores than ever.
