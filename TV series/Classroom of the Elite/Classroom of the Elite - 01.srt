1
00:00:14,743 --> 00:00:15,697
If I may,

2
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:18,314
I'd like to pose an interesting question:

3
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,057
are all human beings truly equal?

4
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:25,565
These days, everywhere you go,
there's talk about the fight for equality.

5
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:28,793
As a wise man once said,

6
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:32,418
"Heaven does not create one
person above or below another."

7
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:34,678
People like to throw his words around.

8
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,484
But that's not the whole quote.

9
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:39,818
He goes on to say that, while we are all equal at birth,

10
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:42,036
pretty soon, things begin to change.

11
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:44,785
Academic effort is what sets some people apart,

12
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:46,383
to rise above the others.

13
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:51,906
At any rate, humans change
over time based on their actions.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,993
Truth be told, at the end of the day,

15
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:58,743
"equality" is just a fantasy,
and most of us go through life

16
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:01,375
denying the fact that we live in a meritocracy.

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,452
Um, excuse me, sir.

18
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:06,368
Would you be willing to give up your seat?

19
00:01:06,393 --> 00:01:06,866
Mm?

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,868
That is priority seating, after all,

21
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:11,202
so it would only be right for you

22
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:13,037
to let this older woman sit there.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,368
My, my, you're a pretty girl.

24
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:19,285
I understand that this is priority seating, honey,

25
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:21,643
but there's no law forcing me to give it up.

26
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:24,743
You think I should have to stand
up just because I'm still young?

27
00:01:24,827 --> 00:01:27,891
Ha, ha. What a bunch of ageist nonsense.

28
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:30,077
Sure, I'm younger than her,

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,772
but standing uses way more energy than sitting.

30
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,855
Tell me. Why must I sacrifice
my health for this lady's sake?

31
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,716
Because, you'd be contributing
to the greater good of humanity.

32
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:42,410
And just take a look at her,

33
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:44,410
she's having trouble staying upright.

34
00:01:44,493 --> 00:01:49,527
I have zero interest in contributing
to the greater good. And anyway,

35
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:53,614
there are plenty of other jerks on
this bus who could give up their seats.

36
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:57,785
Furthermore, I don't see much difference
between a priority seat and a regular one.

37
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,202
So ask someone else to be a hero.

38
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:01,702
To tell the truth, dear.

39
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:04,091
I don't mind standing, don't worry.

40
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:05,897
But thank you, all the same.

41
00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:09,368
Excuse me!

42
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:13,184
Would anyone on this bus be willing to
give up their seat to this sweet lady?

43
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:22,535
Over here. I'll stand.

44
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:24,250
Thank you very much, ma'am!

45
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,953
Well, this is it. My new school.

46
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:56,640
Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School.

47
00:02:56,785 --> 00:03:01,072
Established by the government to raise students
who have been deemed our country's future leaders:

48
00:03:01,243 --> 00:03:02,927
movers and shakers, if you will.

49
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,743
And it works, too.

50
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:08,034
It boasts 100% college entry and employment rates.

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,743
Using experimental, state-derived teaching methods,

52
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:13,452
they pull out all the stops to
build a bright future for Japan.

53
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:14,867
Hey, you.

54
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,995
I noticed you staring at me on the bus earlier.

55
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:20,442
Why was that?

56
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,596
Oh. I'm sorry.

57
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:29,008
I was just curious, 'cause well, you
didn't want to give up your seat, either.

58
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:32,616
I was wondering if, like me, you'd rather stay out of it.

59
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:34,668
I'm nothing like you.

60
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:38,202
In my case, I stayed silent as a matter of principle.

61
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,258
Uh-huh?

62
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:41,107
That makes her worse than me.

63
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,313
If that's all, goodbye.

64
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:54,098
And now, a few words from
our student council president.

65
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:56,940
Thank you for the introduction.

66
00:03:57,202 --> 00:04:04,789
I'm Manabu Horikita. Newcomers, as a representative
of the upperclassmen, and your student council president,

67
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:07,439
I extend a warm welcome to you all.

68
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:13,285
As I am sure you're aware, our school is known
for its prestige and distinction on all fronts,

69
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:18,285
and boasts impeccable employment and college
entry rates across the board. We take pride in this.

70
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:23,552
In fact, it's our school's number one priority, and we all
work together to uphold this standard of excellence.

71
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,285
Now you are a part of that, too.

72
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:27,155
We expect greatness from all of you,

73
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:28,577
and we know you're capable...

74
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,160
We're even in the same class?

75
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:34,691
...so you alone control your path.

76
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:38,160
Heh! Wow, me, too! So, what's your favorite genre.

77
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:39,493
Romance, I bet!

78
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:41,077
Huh? Romance is my favorite!

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,785
How could you have known?

80
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:45,618
Seriously! <i>Shojo</i> manga is definitely mine.

81
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,993
Uh... My favorite genre is definitely Mystery.

82
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:49,202
Mystery?

83
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:51,452
It keeps me on the edge of my seat!

84
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:53,159
She has the seat next to me?

85
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,785
An annoying coincidence.

86
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:57,285
The feeling's mutual.

87
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:59,707
Hey, guys! Listen up for a sec.

88
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:02,493
We should go around the room and introduce ourselves.

89
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:04,368
Start to get familiar with each other.

90
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:06,164
I'd like to get to know you guys.

91
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,243
Plus, the teacher isn't here yet, so we might as well.

92
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:10,327
Does that sound okay?

93
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,410
I'm in!

94
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:12,993
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

95
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:14,410
I agree.

96
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:16,577
I mean, how else are we all going to get acquainted.

97
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,792
I'm glad to hear it.

98
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:21,577
Well, I guess I'll go first, then. I'm Yosuke Hirata.

99
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,202
But you can just call me Yosuke, if you want.

100
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:26,285
I play every sport imaginable,

101
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,057
and I'm gonna try out for the
school's soccer team, for sure.

102
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:31,535
Thanks! Nice to meet you all.

103
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:32,910
That was great.

104
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:34,993
I bet that guy's going to be the leader in class.

105
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:36,833
Okay, I guess I'll go next!

106
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:39,809
Hi, my name is Kikyo Kushida.

107
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:41,327
My goal is to become friends

108
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,827
with every person in the entire school!

109
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,993
That obviously includes everyone here.

110
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:49,085
So, if you're going out, please consider inviting me!

111
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,758
She'll have no trouble reaching that goal.

112
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:58,243
She's got that "everyone's friend" vibe going on.

113
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:01,305
But I shouldn't be focused on her at a time like this.

114
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:04,410
These introductions are going to determine

115
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:06,952
everyone's standing in class.

116
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,243
Should I try to crack a joke?

117
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,827
Then, in middle school...

118
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,500
I bet I could get a laugh if I acted really hyper.

119
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:15,752
But I'd just end up creeping people out.

120
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:20,630
Anyway, it's not like I have any
real interests or hobbies to speak of.

121
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:23,452
I'm kinda like a free agent, a blank slate.

122
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:26,158
Next up! How about you?

123
00:06:27,202 --> 00:06:29,415
Uh. Who, me?

124
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:34,634
No getting out of this one.

125
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:37,947
I'd better muster up the energy
to stand up and say something,

126
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,785
for the sake of my reputation.

127
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,766
Uh... So, um...

128
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:46,896
I'm Kiyotaka Ayanokoji.

129
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:50,644
Uh... I can't wait to study with you.

130
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:56,618
Uh. Uh... I'm not really good at anything in particular.

131
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:00,679
Uh. I'll do my best to get along with you all.

132
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:06,615
I blew it.

133
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:10,626
Ayanokoji, well it's nice to meet you.

134
00:07:10,787 --> 00:07:12,688
I can't wait to be friends.

135
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:13,909
Hmph.

136
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:16,785
She just laughed at me.

137
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:17,785
Okay, who's next?

138
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:21,544
Introductions are for grade schoolers.

139
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:23,452
What are we, a buncha babies?

140
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:25,868
Get to know each other on your own time.

141
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:27,428
Let's get started.

142
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:29,248
Find your seats, everyone.

143
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:37,641
I'm Sae Chabashira, the homeroom teacher for Class One-D.

144
00:07:38,452 --> 00:07:40,952
At this school, you will not change classes.

145
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:43,144
Ever. For the next three years,

146
00:07:43,202 --> 00:07:45,643
I'll be responsible for you until graduation.

147
00:07:45,993 --> 00:07:48,922
For our first order of business: the school rulebook.

148
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:51,055
Take one and pass them back.

149
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:56,918
We have some rather unique rules at this institution.

150
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,127
First, you must all live in the dorms.

151
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:02,160
Your contact with the outside world will be restricted,

152
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:04,589
as will your time away from the campus.

153
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:06,863
For anyone concerned,

154
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:10,185
the school offers a wide variety of facilities.

155
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,448
Anything you could need or want can be found here.

156
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,323
Including leisure and entertainment.

157
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:21,366
To make purchases, you will spend your points, which
are tracked using the school's main computer system.

158
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:25,892
At this school, you can buy
absolutely anything on campus with these.

159
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:28,952
Points are distributed to you on the first of each month.

160
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,059
Each point is worth one yen.

161
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:33,785
If you'll all check your devices,

162
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:37,077
you'll notice that you've already been allotted 100,000.

163
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,243
We what?!

164
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:39,743
Are you kidding me?

165
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:42,827
I see you're all surprised

166
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,618
by the size of your allotment.

167
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:48,243
This school judges its students
based on their merit alone.

168
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,785
You've all shown immense value
just getting into this school.

169
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:54,743
We've allotted you what we think you are worth.

170
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,240
Thank you very much, come again!

171
00:08:58,993 --> 00:09:01,414
It really does work exactly like money.

172
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:05,824
Twenty-five students per class,
and four classes per grade.

173
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:08,037
That makes 300 of us in all.

174
00:09:08,577 --> 00:09:10,993
If each kid gets 100,000 a month,

175
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:14,182
that's 360 million per year.

176
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:16,998
How can the government afford to pay for all this?

177
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:18,625
Huh?

178
00:09:21,202 --> 00:09:23,618
Another annoying coincidence, it seems.

179
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:25,654
You don't have to be so prickly.

180
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,202
Well, since we have to sit by each other,

181
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:31,873
we should attempt to get along.

182
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,460
What's your name?

183
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,307
Really, you won't even share with me that much?

184
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:41,827
So? You got a problem with that?

185
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,452
No, but it would make things
weird for the next three years.

186
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:46,754
To sit next to ya and never know your name.

187
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,301
It's Suzune Horikita.

188
00:09:53,113 --> 00:09:54,060
"Horikita"?

189
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:56,389
Like the guy who spoke earlier?

190
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:02,763
Why are you buying all cheap stuff?

191
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:04,393
You've got lots of money.

192
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,910
You could stand to buy more expensive--

193
00:10:05,993 --> 00:10:07,297
I don't need all that.

194
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:09,285
--Yeah, but you could-- --I told you.

195
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:10,909
I don't need that stuff.

196
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,035
Right.

197
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:13,882
You're weird.

198
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:16,243
You aren't very good at interacting with people.

199
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:18,243
No conversation skills.

200
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,529
Yeah, I know.

201
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,243
But you don't seem to be much better than I am.

202
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:23,493
That's true.

203
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:25,160
But I'm not the one who said they were going to

204
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:27,975
"work hard to get along" with everyone else.

205
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:30,177
These are free?

206
00:10:30,383 --> 00:10:34,696
Maybe that's for people who use up all their
points before the first of the month, I guess.

207
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:37,118
How could one use up a 100,000 points?

208
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:38,410
This school is too indulgent.

209
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:40,514
You think you're better than me? Huh?

210
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:43,702
Maybe. You are in Class One-D, aren't you?

211
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:46,243
Yeah. What the hell does it matter to you guys?!

212
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:49,077
Hey, now that's no way to talk to your elders.

213
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,827
You better learn some respect, and fast.

214
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,857
Shut up!

215
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,535
Huh? Wait, isn't that guy in our class?

216
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:56,618
Maybe, but I won't get involved.

217
00:10:56,702 --> 00:10:58,446
It's beneath my dignity.

218
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,396
Heh. We'll let it slide this time.

219
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:04,660
Class D has already got it bad.

220
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:06,660
If we knocked you down a peg, you'd fall right off.

221
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:08,243
Don't you run away from me!

222
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:09,160
Go ahead.

223
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:10,868
Scream your head off if you want.

224
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:13,912
You people are already in for a world of pain.

225
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:15,307
"A world of pain"?

226
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,618
Those damn wimps!

227
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:22,079
Hm?

228
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:40,814
Not long after that,

229
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,077
the class began to split up into cliques.

230
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:45,085
Hey, Kikyo.

231
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:46,887
You wanna eat lunch together today?

232
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:49,368
I'm sorry. I can't. I've got too much to do.

233
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:51,829
This beauty was a mere 80,000 points!

234
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,577
We get a 100,000 more soon, so it was a steal!

235
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,493
Yeah, I've bought tons of games! This is awesome!

236
00:11:57,577 --> 00:11:59,702
I saw an adorable pair of earrings!

237
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,535
Wanna stop by after class?

238
00:12:01,618 --> 00:12:03,285
Let's shop for clothes, too!

239
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:04,702
Unlike everyone else,

240
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:06,486
I failed to make any friends.

241
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,827
You're pathetic.

242
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,430
Hm?

243
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:11,827
Yeah, well, you're alone, too.

244
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,154
That's true. But I, for one, prefer to be alone.

245
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,372
I'm gonna hit up the cafeteria.

246
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,175
Um. Your name is Ayanokoji, isn't it?

247
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:28,901
Yeah. And you're...

248
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:30,827
...Kushida?

249
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,285
I'm so impressed!

250
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:34,702
You remembered my name, too! Thanks.

251
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:36,792
Yeah. Guess I did.

252
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:40,976
So, um. Could we talk for a sec?

253
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:49,702
The reason I stopped you is that

254
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:52,077
you and Horikita seem really close.

255
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,474
Well... I wouldn't go that far.

256
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,160
Really?

257
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,906
But, you're the only person in
school that she talks to, ever.

258
00:12:59,814 --> 00:13:02,480
It's my goal to become friends with everyone at school,

259
00:13:02,577 --> 00:13:04,035
even outside our class.

260
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:06,202
So I asked Horikita for her phone number

261
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:10,074
to maybe call her sometime, but she turned me down.

262
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:13,230
She said she doesn't wanna be friends with anyone.

263
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:15,368
Yeah, I think that's just how she is.

264
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:17,202
But I still want to be friends with Horikita,

265
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:18,785
in spite of all that!

266
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:21,118
Do you think that you could help me with her?

267
00:13:21,202 --> 00:13:21,999
Help you?

268
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:23,346
I don't know.

269
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:26,000
You mean... you won't?

270
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,577
The head of the Yamato government

271
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,160
was known as the " <i>O-kimi</i> ."

272
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:34,868
He controlled the powerful families of each region

273
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:36,785
using the <i>uji-kabane</i> system.

274
00:13:36,868 --> 00:13:38,910
" <i>Uji</i> " referred to groups of families

275
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:40,868
who shared the same bloodline,

276
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:44,702
while " <i>kabane</i> " referred to
an individual's post and status.

277
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:48,952
It was a system in which pedigree determined one's place.

278
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:50,743
That's all for today.

279
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:53,239
Look over the material for tomorrow.

280
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:05,779
This school is incredibly indulgent.

281
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:08,493
These kids play around and sleep in class,

282
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:10,993
but the teachers never even bother to do anything.

283
00:14:11,077 --> 00:14:12,993
I can't believe the government has the gall

284
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:14,827
to dub this an elite school.

285
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,338
Maybe they're just trying to
encourage individual autonomy.

286
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:20,351
Perhaps.

287
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,368
Hey. If you're just gonna head home,

288
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:26,580
would you mind coming somewhere with me first?

289
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:28,784
What are you trying to pull?

290
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,492
It's an invitation.

291
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,730
Why would that suggest an ulterior motive?

292
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:35,077
If you'll be honest and tell me what you really want,

293
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:37,017
maybe I'll be willing to hear you out.

294
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:39,807
You know that big café in the mall, the coffee place?

295
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,827
Where all the girls like to hang out?

296
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,525
Would you be willing to go there with me right now?

297
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:46,605
Why me, of all people?

298
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,535
I'm just not brave enough to go in there alone.

299
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:52,584
The place kind of has a "no boys allowed" vibe.

300
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:54,662
And there's no one else you can ask?

301
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:57,002
Well, no, I suppose there isn't.

302
00:14:57,118 --> 00:14:59,904
Hurts to admit it, but... you're right about that.

303
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:14,785
Is it always so packed?

304
00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:17,044
So this is your first time coming here, too?

305
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:19,113
Oh, right, you're a loner.

306
00:15:19,243 --> 00:15:21,855
Trying to insult me? How childish.

307
00:15:21,993 --> 00:15:25,016
Uh. That table just opened up.

308
00:15:28,743 --> 00:15:29,868
Hey, I wonder.

309
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:33,135
You think the other people in here
see us, well, you know, as a couple...

310
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:36,266
Never mind, probably not.

311
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:41,880
The impending confrontation is tying
my stomach into knots. I feel sick.

312
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,623
Huh?! Horikita!

313
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:48,035
What a coincidence! And Ayanokoji, too?

314
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:50,452
So, do you two come here together often?

315
00:15:50,535 --> 00:15:52,410
No, this is our first time.

316
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,618
Oh, that's cool.

317
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,660
Well, I'm here by myself--

318
00:15:54,743 --> 00:15:56,138
I'm leaving.

319
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:59,160
You are? We literally just sat down.

320
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:00,743
But Kushida's here now.

321
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,910
So you don't need me to stay, do you?

322
00:16:02,993 --> 00:16:05,035
I guess not, but Kushida and I

323
00:16:05,118 --> 00:16:06,910
are just classmates, we don't know each other.

324
00:16:06,993 --> 00:16:09,743
And how is that any different than what you and I are?

325
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:11,410
On top of that...

326
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:14,910
Something seems fishy here, and I don't like it.

327
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:16,702
What? Oh, come on!

328
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:18,243
It's a coincidence.

329
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:22,619
Nice try, but the correct response would
have been, "What's that supposed to mean?"

330
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:25,118
The girls who were at this table,

331
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:26,910
and the two at the next one over,

332
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:29,266
is it coincidence they're in our class?

333
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,419
Honestly.

334
00:16:30,785 --> 00:16:32,452
Wow, I didn't even notice.

335
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:34,297
I'm impressed that you recognized them.

336
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,963
You and I came straight here
immediately after class ended.

337
00:16:38,118 --> 00:16:42,966
We came in, and then they left, though they couldn't
have been here for longer than a couple of minutes.

338
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,739
It doesn't make any sense.

339
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:47,187
Well, um...

340
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:53,005
Sorry. Yeah, you're right. We set you up.

341
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:54,492
I thought so.

342
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:58,911
Horikita! Please be my friend.
That's all I wanted from this!

343
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,721
Well, what I want is for you to leave me alone.

344
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:04,368
You two should both know that you're wasting your time.

345
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:09,311
Huh? But I, I don't understand.
Won't you be lonely all by yourself?

346
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:12,575
Being alone is not synonymous with being lonely.

347
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,115
Like I said, it's a waste.

348
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:17,709
Every sound coming out of your mouth repulses me.

349
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:20,237
Hey. Are you sure about this?

350
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,523
Do you really want to spend the
next three years of your life that way?

351
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,792
If you don't make friends, you'll be isolated.

352
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,966
I've been completely alone for the past nine years,

353
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:32,039
so what's another three to me? It hardly matters.

354
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:39,707
Sorry. I kinda think I might have made Horikita
hate you, and that was the last thing I wanted.

355
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,785
Nah, don't worry about it.

356
00:17:43,368 --> 00:17:45,790
Maybe she and I will never be friends.

357
00:17:46,469 --> 00:17:47,663
That makes me sad.

358
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:53,330
If I can't even make friends with all my classmates,

359
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:55,385
my goal seems unattainable.

360
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,833
Personally, I think Horikita's an exception.

361
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:01,243
Uh! That's Ichinose over there!

362
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:03,702
Honami Ichinose is from Class One-B.

363
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:05,671
We became friends yesterday.

364
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,827
You're friends with kids in other classes?

365
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,535
I can't even imagine that.

366
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:14,417
Mm-hm. There are so many really nice people in Class B.

367
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:18,049
You know. This school is pretty amazing, don't you think?

368
00:18:18,285 --> 00:18:22,361
All the different shops, and the fact
that we get a 100,000 yen every month!

369
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:24,077
I don't know.

370
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,452
That amount seems kind of excessive, in my opinion.

371
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,285
Yeah. I'm glad you think so, too.

372
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:32,577
And, calling them points makes
them entirely too easy to spend.

373
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:35,577
To be honest, it's skewing my money sense.

374
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:36,287
Hm.

375
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,410
I'm going to have to budget tightly to avoid overspending.

376
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:44,837
I mean, I'll buy the things I need, obviously.

377
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:48,389
The toiletries I use every day, like soap and toothpaste,

378
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:50,657
and I'll need panties.

379
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:55,077
Yeah. Horikita was saying something similar.

380
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,875
Huh? Oh! So you even know all
about how she spends her money.

381
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:02,472
You two really are friends, aren't you?

382
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:04,700
No, I just happened to be there.

383
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:07,102
Whoa. She's standing so close.

384
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:15,792
Well! We'll just have to leave it at that!

385
00:19:16,077 --> 00:19:17,843
But it happens to be the truth.

386
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,800
One hundred thousand... Huh.

387
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:36,410
Most students decided

388
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:38,493
to make the most of their circumstances

389
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,735
without giving much thought to anything at all.

390
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:44,910
Day in and day out they blew
through their monthly allowance

391
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:47,511
like it was nothing, buying whatever they wanted.

392
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:49,211
The teacher never disciplined,

393
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:55,232
so conversations in class, sleeping on desks,
tardiness, and downright truancy became the norm.

394
00:19:55,743 --> 00:20:00,477
Extravagance, debauchery, and lethargy ran rampant.

395
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:04,569
Then, suddenly, on May first, everything changed.

396
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:07,082
Huh? What's going on?

397
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:09,118
Hold on, yours hasn't, either?

398
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:10,743
What's the deal here?

399
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:15,827
Take your seats, class.

400
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,105
Morning homeroom begins now.

401
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:21,424
Hey, teacher?

402
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:24,202
Nobody here has gotten any more points yet.

403
00:20:24,285 --> 00:20:25,577
It's the first of the month.

404
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,797
Shouldn't they have already been refilled by now?

405
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:32,187
Of course, this month's allotment
has already been distributed.

406
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:33,462
Uh...

407
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:34,873
Mine aren't there.

408
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:37,910
As I said, the points have been allocated.

409
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:39,827
I am certain about that.

410
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,868
And I know for a fact that this class has
not been overlooked by the administration.

411
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,702
What about our points? Nobody in this class got any.

412
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:53,535
A whole class comprised of morons.

413
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:55,160
You're all pathetic.

414
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:59,975
A combined total of 98 tardies and absences,

415
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:03,743
391 documented cases of cell-phone use,

416
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,077
and or talking during instruction.

417
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,164
Impressive figures for the first month of the school year.

418
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:13,583
At this school, your grades and
performance evaluations aren't handed out.

419
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,252
They're reflected in your monthly points allotment.

420
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:19,772
Your unconscionable behavior, and that alone,

421
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:23,118
has resulted in the with holding of
your points allowance for this month.

422
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:27,874
The points allotted to this class for
the month comes out to a total... of zero.

423
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,537
No way. I have to live on no money this whole month?

424
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,618
Hang on. That's not fair.

425
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:36,402
It's just that... You should have told us.

426
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:41,698
Did it never occur to you to question
your circumstances? You're only children.

427
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:44,540
Why would you be given such an extravagant sum?

428
00:21:44,743 --> 00:21:46,933
Didn't you think there'd be a catch?

429
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:48,521
Your assumptions were wrong,

430
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:50,689
and now you must all pay the price.

431
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:54,875
If you did have doubts, why, then,
did you refuse to act upon them?

432
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:59,576
I told you on the first
day of class, didn't I?

433
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,993
I was perfectly clear.

434
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:04,692
This school judges its students on merit alone, so.

435
00:22:05,577 --> 00:22:09,413
As it stands now, we think you're all garbage.

436
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:13,401
You're worth nothing, so you get nothing.
