1
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,675
What the--?

2
00:00:44,622 --> 00:00:45,855
Ibuki, here.

3
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:49,876
I've acquired Class D's card, as directed.

4
00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:53,720
Right.

5
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:55,731
Yes.

6
00:00:57,946 --> 00:01:00,854
Yes, I see. We'll meet up there in a bit.

7
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:08,062
Class A's final score will be 544 points.

8
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:11,422
That's 350 ahead of Class B.

9
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:14,834
And it beats Class D's score by...

10
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:17,244
...an overwhelming number.

11
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:32,004
You're finally awake.

12
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,932
Where are we? How did I get here?

13
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,799
And why are we together?

14
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:40,640
I found you passed out in the forest.

15
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:42,673
I picked you up and brought you here.

16
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:47,891
I chased Ibuki to where you found me.

17
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:49,932
She's the one who took the key card.

18
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:52,127
But I wasn't able to get it back from her.

19
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:53,516
Not in this state.

20
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,582
I see.

21
00:01:57,446 --> 00:02:00,934
Horikita, you have to drop out.

22
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,463
I'll figure out a way to deal
with Ibuki and the stolen card.

23
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:07,714
You can't keep this up any longer.

24
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:09,654
I won't drop out.

25
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:12,671
We'll lose more points if I do, and we can't afford to.

26
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:13,837
Especially not now.

27
00:02:13,862 --> 00:02:14,921
Look, you're sick--

28
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:16,842
I don't have any choice in the matter.

29
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,222
If we want to reach Class A.

30
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:20,928
Don't obsess about that.

31
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:22,449
It doesn't matter.

32
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:25,680
I want to show my brother I'm not a loser.

33
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:27,828
But will that do you any good?

34
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:30,656
Do you think it will change anything?

35
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:35,821
I dunno. But still, this is all my fault.

36
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,927
If I had friends, we could
have carried the card in shifts.

37
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,370
But I don't. No one in class cares about me.

38
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:47,847
It's all my fault. I'm done for.

39
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,483
Do you mean to say that you're starting
to see the value in having allies?

40
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,129
I won't let this define me.

41
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:58,061
I swear to you. I'll make up for it.

42
00:02:58,362 --> 00:03:00,002
I'll do it alone if I must.

43
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:01,807
You won't be able to do it alone.

44
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:04,079
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

45
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,223
but you aren't strong enough.

46
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,612
Are you saying I should give up?

47
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:11,097
No, that's not what I'm trying to say at all.

48
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:12,884
There's no need to give up.

49
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:16,582
If you can't win the battle alone,

50
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:18,555
then look for others who can help.

51
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:20,561
I'll be one of those people.

52
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:22,447
That's not like you.

53
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:28,103
You're usually so cryptic, and you...

54
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:39,227
Excuse me, ma'am?

55
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:43,465
Horikita. What happened?

56
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:47,209
She's had a bad fever, and she
just passed out because of it.

57
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:49,646
She needs to be somewhere she can rest.

58
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:54,149
She'll have to drop out of the exam.

59
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:56,304
Do you accept that loss?

60
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:57,556
Yes.

61
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:02,713
I heard that Horikita dropped out of the test.

62
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:04,571
Ibuki's gone missing, too.

63
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:07,296
Do you think she was responsible for the arson after all?

64
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:08,416
But, why would she be?

65
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:10,308
I mean, what would that even accomplish?

66
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,147
Wait, do you think Ibuki could have been Class C's leader?

67
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:14,446
I have no idea.

68
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:16,737
But everyone else in Class C dropped out, right?

69
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,797
By now, their leader must be gone.

70
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:22,241
Our key card was stolen?

71
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:23,833
Yeah.

72
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:26,452
But I haven't told anyone else anything about it.

73
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:29,279
This confirms that Ibuki was sent to find our leader.

74
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:31,007
As for the underwear theft,

75
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:33,309
we can assume that was also her.

76
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:35,154
Why would she do that?

77
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:39,294
No, there's no use in trying to figure out why.

78
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:41,921
What we need to be concerned with now is tomorrow,

79
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,632
when they name our leader, and we lose those points.

80
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:50,958
The penalty from our drop-outs and having our
leader guessed is a total loss of 110 S-points.

81
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:54,580
The fact that they know our leader
will negate all our bonus points, too.

82
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,826
And that will leave us with only about 50 S-points.

83
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:00,674
After the test results are revealed,

84
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:03,821
it won't take long for people to start blaming each other.

85
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,379
Yeah, might devolve into a bit of a witch hunt.

86
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:08,380
You know.

87
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:12,901
I thought this exam would give us the
chance we needed to bring our class together.

88
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:16,534
I thought that, if we could unify and do our best,

89
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:19,519
that it might help forge bonds between all of us.

90
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,027
But, no.

91
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:25,055
The reverse happened,

92
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:27,635
and this could be the end of Class D.

93
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:33,822
Hirata. I have a little favor to ask of you.

94
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:39,009
Before the test officially ends,

95
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:42,921
take a few moments to name who you
think the other class leaders are.

96
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:48,612
I haven't seen Kaneda...

97
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:49,737
All right, guys.

98
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:53,103
Write down on this form who you
suspect the other class leaders are.

99
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:56,379
If you don't have any idea, then
leave it blank, just to be safe.

100
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:57,737
That makes sense.

101
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:59,321
Should I just leave it blank, then?

102
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:01,764
Each wrong guess costs us 50 points.

103
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:03,446
I don't see any need to risk it.

104
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,654
Good call.

105
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:06,827
We have more than 200 points, anyway.

106
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:11,033
Um, hi.

107
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,156
The test is finally over.

108
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:16,487
Yeah. It's finally over.

109
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:20,434
Do you have any idea what our final
score on the exam will turn out to be?

110
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:22,919
There was that thing with Ibuki, you know?

111
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,331
Right! All remaining classes are here.

112
00:06:28,748 --> 00:06:31,063
I formally declare the test complete.

113
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:34,064
All scores are in, and everything's final.

114
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:35,241
Hey.

115
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:39,196
You wouldn't say goodbye without me, would you?

116
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,779
What's Ryuen doing here?

117
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:42,737
You mean he stayed on the island, after all?

118
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:45,212
Ryuen's here, but Ibuki's not?

119
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,711
Yeah, why is that?

120
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:49,051
You did an excellent job, Ryuen.

121
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:52,821
You helped Class A earn over 500 S-points.

122
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:56,529
Allow me to offer a hand in gratitude for your hard work.

123
00:06:56,612 --> 00:06:58,239
Just wait.

124
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,229
You're all about to witness something very interesting.

125
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:03,753
What do you mean by that?

126
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:10,446
If we hang a curtain over the entrance
to the cave, and hide everything in there,

127
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:13,579
then the other classes won't have a clue what we're doing.

128
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:15,612
This is a bold plan you've conceived.

129
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:16,775
Very risky.

130
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:19,528
And it's the only way I'll apply myself.

131
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:21,312
The school can shove its test.

132
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:24,218
I absolutely abhor hard work.

133
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,251
On the first day of the special exam.

134
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,987
I forged a contract with Class A.

135
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:34,779
Class C would buy and transfer 200
S-points' worth of goods to Class A.

136
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:40,324
And, I would give any information Class C
collected on the other class leaders to Katsuragi.

137
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:45,046
Regarding the other leaders.

138
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:48,044
I will need more than just your word on their identity.

139
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:51,154
I need you to show me a photo of their key card.

140
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:53,856
That, or get me the card itself.

141
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:56,279
Right. Sure thing, man.

142
00:07:56,362 --> 00:08:00,874
One thing though, when you form an alliance
with someone, shouldn't you trust them?

143
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:09,104
That's right. I need you to truly hate me.

144
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:10,696
'Cause If you don't...

145
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,446
...you won't fool anyone.

146
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:21,867
Take a hike.

147
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:25,362
Next, I sent Ibuki and Kaneda to work as spies.

148
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:28,862
Ibuki in Class D, and Kaneda in Class B.

149
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:32,391
Then came the revelry.

150
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:38,760
We spent all 100 of the S-points we
had left after the trade with Class A.

151
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:45,674
Then I had everyone except Kaneda
and Ibuki drop out. I alone remained.

152
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:48,753
I went into hiding, deep in the jungle.

153
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:54,111
You must really hate Katsuragi, am I right?

154
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,321
I was working with Sakayanagi's faction
from Class A, too. One of the guys in that camp

155
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:04,981
was intentionally abusing a spot on the
island to reduce his own class's points.

156
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:08,571
He was human garbage, but remarkably forthright.

157
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:11,279
Enough to tell me who his class leader was.

158
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:17,384
What I hadn't planned for was
Ibuki's digital camera breaking.

159
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:23,816
It was an unfortunate kink in the works, and forced
Katsuragi and me to verify Class D's key card in person.

160
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,217
It's genuine. Good job.

161
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:29,821
Your obligation is complete.

162
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,329
Care to know who Class B's leader is?

163
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,124
Naturally, B holds their cards close.

164
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:37,863
So all evidence is purely circumstantial.

165
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:41,180
Unless you have verifiable proof, I don't care.

166
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,571
Ryuen, you smell like a dead animal.

167
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:47,875
Take a shower, set yourself on fire, whatever works.

168
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:06,541
Ryuen. Are you there?

169
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,029
Is the test finally over?

170
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:17,329
Kaneda and Ibuki have
dropped out as well.

171
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:18,526
I see.

172
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:21,865
Anyway. Let's close this out.

173
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,067
Of course.

174
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,574
Class A's leader is Yahiko Totsuka.

175
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:33,867
B's is Chihiro Shiranami.

176
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:37,225
D's is Suzune Horikita.

177
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,362
Honestly now, you say that you hate it.

178
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:42,612
Any kind of exertion or hard work.

179
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:43,714
But, look at you.

180
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:45,962
You're like a soldier who's just fought an epic battle.

181
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:47,308
You're dirty, injured.

182
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,497
The others talk about your
determination in seeking victory.

183
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:53,254
Why don't you quit your babbling already, teacher.

184
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,487
Now that I've guessed every class's leader,

185
00:10:55,571 --> 00:11:00,363
that will subtract 50 points from each of
their scores and negate their bonus points.

186
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:04,877
Class A will only gain a
paltry 170 points from this test.

187
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:06,879
As for Class C's points--

188
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:09,638
150 just from naming the leaders.

189
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,639
Combine that with the points we gained from
securing spots, and we'll beat Class A, for sure.

190
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:20,410
That means I win again.

191
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:23,862
And now, the time has come.

192
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,879
I will reveal the results of the special examination.

193
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:30,934
Coming in last: Class C, with zero points.

194
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:33,542
What?

195
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:36,532
Next, in third place: Class A,

196
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,825
with 120 points.

197
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:41,219
In second: Class B.

198
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:42,617
One hundred and forty points.

199
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:45,862
Finally, in first place: Class D,

200
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:48,504
with 225 points.

201
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:50,004
First place?

202
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:51,654
Huh, really?

203
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:53,058
We did it!

204
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:03,824
What on earth?

205
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:05,841
How could that have happened?

206
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:18,105
Well then, it looks like you
had a great time on the island.

207
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,171
Shut your mouth, Koenji!

208
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:29,269
You realize that we lost 30
whole point because of you, right?

209
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:31,404
Oh, just calm down.

210
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:33,946
I was laid up with a very nasty cold, my good man.

211
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:35,696
What was I supposed to do?

212
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,654
You damn vain punk. Cut it out!

213
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,039
Dry off and stop glistening!

214
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:48,302
Wait up!

215
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:55,251
You better tell me exactly what's going on here.

216
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:01,658
It all played out more or less
the way I expected it would.

217
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,779
The Katsuragi faction is finished,

218
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,337
or they'll lose a great deal of influence, at least.

219
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:07,423
That's right.

220
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:09,696
And if we're united going into the second term,

221
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,106
then Class A is going to be unstoppable.

222
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:16,046
Katsuragi's here, so I'd better hang up.

223
00:13:16,118 --> 00:13:18,864
Yes. Again, nice work.

224
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:22,196
How are you going to atone for this one, Katsuragi?

225
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:24,421
Signing that contract was an enormous mistake!

226
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:27,017
Don't forget every single one
of you signed off on it, too!

227
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:30,263
This is just pathetic, Katsuragi.

228
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:32,737
Hashimoto.

229
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:37,125
How dare you criticize Katsuragi when
you're probably the reason we failed!

230
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:40,784
I don't know what you did,
but why don't you try going to--

231
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,362
Hashimoto.

232
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:45,585
You spoke to Ryuen, did you not?

233
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:51,404
I know you sold the name of Class A's
leader to that opportunistic scumbag.

234
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:04,753
Second place, huh?

235
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:09,296
Yeah it is still a loss, unfortunately.

236
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:12,948
Class D really was the only clear winner in this exam.

237
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:16,379
Hey. Remember the first day?

238
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,587
What the teacher told us? She said to keep in mind

239
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:22,523
anything in this school can be bought with points.

240
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,071
Yeah. I do recall that.

241
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:26,987
It may be really expensive,

242
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,494
but it can still be bought.

243
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:32,586
You can be in any class you want,

244
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,544
if you pay the price.

245
00:14:44,904 --> 00:14:46,278
I apologize.

246
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:54,014
Well. I've figured it out.

247
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,719
The reason they got that high score,

248
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:01,627
and why our score ended up being zero.

249
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:04,842
It's because we guessed it incorrectly.

250
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,487
Class D's leader.

251
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:07,461
What?

252
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:11,204
Well, you weren't our leader anymore, Horikita.

253
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:13,941
Wh-What? But the card!

254
00:15:17,446 --> 00:15:20,475
What the...? What's your name doing on it?

255
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:22,812
Just before the test ended,

256
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:25,242
I had Class D's leader changed.

257
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:28,696
You can't just change leaders,

258
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:30,914
unless you've got a really good reason.

259
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:35,559
Which obviously means, if you do have a
really good reason, you are allowed to switch.

260
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:38,525
Our leader's health was failing.

261
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:40,753
That's as good a reason as any.

262
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:46,436
Because of that, when Ryuen and Katsuragi
named you class D's leader, they were wrong.

263
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,462
It was me.

264
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:51,468
Wait, you conceived of this
whole plan by yourself, didn't you?

265
00:15:51,987 --> 00:15:53,274
Yeah, I did.

266
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:58,881
I knew Ibuki was a spy, so I
destroyed her digital camera.

267
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:03,760
That meant she would have to steal the key card itself,
which would be much harder than taking a picture of it.

268
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:09,502
Then I waited until your condition
had sufficiently deteriorated.

269
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:14,067
I promise to give you Sakura's email address,

270
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:15,529
but you've gotta do something for me.

271
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:16,560
Ah?!

272
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:22,077
I got you to show me your card while
Ibuki was watching, staged a distraction,

273
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:24,234
got you to go to the waterfall.

274
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:28,459
And thus, Ibuki was lured into stealing your key card.

275
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:32,908
Then, I started the fire to throw the camp into chaos.

276
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:35,568
Giving Ibuki the opening she needed to escape.

277
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:42,341
I knew their plan had always been for her to
sneak away from the camp and show Ryuen the card.

278
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:45,279
Then you convinced me that I should drop out,

279
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:47,161
and made yourself the leader.

280
00:16:47,612 --> 00:16:49,587
Yeah, but that came later.

281
00:16:49,612 --> 00:16:52,868
At first, I'd planned to amass
points by occupying all the spots.

282
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:58,171
But then I saw Katsuragi leaving one of
the spots with Class A's key card in his hand.

283
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:01,587
So, that means Class A's leader was Katsuragi?

284
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:04,878
No. Katsuragi is a cautious person.

285
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:07,029
He would never do anything that careless.

286
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:10,479
He wouldn't even occupy a spot when
someone might be around to see him.

287
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:13,438
It was just a performance to hide the truth.

288
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:17,685
That someone else had occupied the spot,
without checking it in with him first.

289
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:19,821
That's how I was able to infer

290
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:22,446
that Class A's leader was in fact Yahiko,

291
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:25,088
who was with Katsuragi at the time I saw him.

292
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:31,862
And as for Class C, I was well aware that
Ryuen had never actually left the island.

293
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:34,821
When we went to pay Ryuen a visit,

294
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:37,702
he had a two-way radio on the table next to him.

295
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:41,348
Ibuki was in possession of one just like it.

296
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:48,054
If Ryuen was indeed still in contact with Ibuki
that way, it meant he still had to be on the island.

297
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:51,515
After that, I was certain that Ryuen was Class C's leader.

298
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:54,504
That's what made me change my tactics.

299
00:17:54,529 --> 00:18:00,333
I switched from a spot occupation strategy to a
leader identification strategy, and used you as a pawn.

300
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:02,654
But I left Class B alone.

301
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:07,680
I determined eroding our friendly alliance with
them would be detrimental to us in the long run.

302
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:08,779
And, to be honest,

303
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:10,821
there was already a spy in Class B.

304
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:15,404
So, I knew that their leader would be
revealed, even without any action on my part.

305
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:17,257
And you surmised correctly.

306
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,740
Their leader was identified, costing them serious points.

307
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:27,749
Yes, if another class guesses your leader, it costs you
50 points, and all your bonus points are negated, as well.

308
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:31,377
You really put one over on everyone this time.

309
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,827
But, I don't get it. You claim to
have no interest in ascending to Class A,

310
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:37,802
so why did you help me?

311
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,987
I can't figure out what motivates you.

312
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:43,046
Why do you do it?

313
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,726
There she is! Horikita!

314
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:48,362
We've been looking everywhere for you!

315
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:49,769
How did you do it?

316
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:52,806
We heard that you're the only
reason Class D won this thing!

317
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:55,529
Hirata told us everything you did!

318
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:59,796
He said that you're the one who figured out
who Class A and C's leaders were. That's awesome!

319
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:01,712
Thanks to you, we've got tons of points now!

320
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:03,962
You're amazing! What a genius!

321
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:05,296
--You guys, wait. --Ibuki was the one

322
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:08,279
who started the fire, and when she ran
away, you chased her in the rain, right?

323
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:09,504
--Um, well. --And he told us

324
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:10,879
that's the reason you're under the weather!

325
00:19:10,904 --> 00:19:13,446
So cool! You're the best friend ever!

326
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:15,618
Friend? What are you talking about?

327
00:19:21,612 --> 00:19:23,963
Horikita sure is popular, huh?

328
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:25,645
Yeah, I guess so.

329
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:30,204
I really do hate her.

330
00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:32,677
Because, for better or for worse,

331
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:34,632
she has nothing to hide.

332
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:37,698
She and I are opposites. So...

333
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:40,450
Well, most people are more like you.

334
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:42,105
Me, included.

335
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:44,771
Hey, Ayanokoji?

336
00:19:45,237 --> 00:19:46,142
What is it?

337
00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:50,832
If you had to make a choice,
like, who you would be with...

338
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:55,472
You would choose Horikita, wouldn't you?

339
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,207
I don't know.

340
00:19:58,112 --> 00:19:59,002
Meanie.

341
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:15,071
First, please allow me to congratulate you.

342
00:20:15,154 --> 00:20:17,188
I am genuinely impressed.

343
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:19,396
Oh, so now you're satisfied?

344
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:21,233
Then tell me something.

345
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:26,176
Is it true that an outsider attempted to
get me expelled, or did you make that part up?

346
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:26,886
Hm.

347
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,790
I won't play this game, and I refuse to
do anything else for you until I have proof.

348
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:35,987
Have you forgotten that I know every
little thing about you? Come on, now.

349
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:38,142
Don't you think that that's proof enough?

350
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:42,664
Icarus' wings.

351
00:20:42,987 --> 00:20:44,230
What about 'em?

352
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:47,778
Icarus wanted to fly
in order to be free.

353
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:52,495
But he only did it because his father taught him
how to make the wings and take flight.

354
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:54,435
He couldn't have done it alone.

355
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:58,425
The poor boy wasn't flying of his own accord.

356
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:01,688
Now, don't you think that sounds a little bit familiar?

357
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,529
That man who called me,

358
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:07,596
who I am sure you've figured out by now is your father,

359
00:21:07,621 --> 00:21:12,340
said, "Someday, Kiyotaka will choose
to leave the school of his own accord."

360
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:16,834
Fly too close, and you'll burn your
wings, then plunge into the sea and drown.

361
00:21:16,904 --> 00:21:18,900
We both know that won't happen.

362
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,738
Poor, little Icarus.

363
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,533
What will your next move in our little game be?

364
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:27,267
I think you know the answer to that.

365
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:32,359
"Poor" Icarus? He didn't heed Daedalus' warnings.

366
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:39,386
You would have gotten hundreds of thousands
of points every month until graduation?

367
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:43,900
From the very beginning, that
contract was the only thing I was after.

368
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:47,026
The bonus points were just a part of that goal.

369
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:48,765
However,

370
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:52,591
I don't like it when people try
to get in the way of what I want.

371
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:55,843
Class D.

372
00:22:06,196 --> 00:22:09,748
I... I've been looking all over for you.

373
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:11,628
Oh, it's you again.

374
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:13,478
What do you want this time?

375
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:15,476
I heard from Hirata.

376
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:18,374
When you said who Class A and C's leaders were,

377
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:21,529
you also told him I was the one
who figured the whole thing out.

378
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:24,475
And then after the test was over,

379
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:27,563
you asked him to do something
to bring the class back together.

380
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:30,279
Are you trying to use me as some kind of cover?

381
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:33,989
Horikita, remember what I
said to you a long time ago?

382
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:37,029
I told you that you need allies.

383
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,483
Is that why you did all of this?

384
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:43,689
I'm finally starting to see a real change in you.

385
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,237
Why's it always your fault?

386
00:22:47,612 --> 00:22:52,703
Look, I acknowledge that we are allies, but I'll
only do it grudgingly, so don't get any ideas, okay?

387
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:56,362
And you better not act like we're all
buddy-buddy once we get back to school, or trust me,

388
00:22:56,405 --> 00:22:57,811
there'll be hell to pay!

389
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,946
It's just for our goals.

390
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:02,170
We're working together to get to Class A!

391
00:23:03,227 --> 00:23:03,889
But...

392
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:06,193
Despite that, I have to tell you.

393
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,679
Thanks for your help.

394
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:13,862
Not that I need you or anything. I am fine without you!

395
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:15,453
But, Horikita.

396
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:17,854
I've never considered you an ally.

397
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:19,598
Not even for a second.

398
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:26,492
Not you. Not Kushida. Not Hirata.

399
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:29,351
People are nothing but tools to me.

400
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:33,390
All of them. I don't care what I have to do to win.

401
00:23:34,987 --> 00:23:37,786
I don't care what I have to sacrifice.

402
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:42,012
In this world, winning is everything.

403
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:47,099
And in the end, I'm going to win.

404
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,614
That's all that matters.
