The mirror door is handy

for identifying
possible intruders.

Ritsuka? Lindo?

Look here.
There's a vampire chapter.

The book says they don't
have a reflection.

16

So that's how you can tell.

right, Lindo.

[RITSUKA]
I won't cry.

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,333

Um, are you the, uh,
vampire ruler, Nesta?

00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:10,416
Address him as Lord Nesta.
Be more respectful.

35
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,458
So childish.

36
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,416
Who dared injure you?

[gasping, coughing]

What? Resemble who? My mom?

49
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,708
[NESTA]
Marta.

50
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,166
She was your aunt.

51
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,750
And mother to the boy
you call Brother.

52
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:15,583
Your mother is like the sun.
She shines brightly.

53
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,250
Maria gives warmth to everyone
and is beloved by all.

54
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,416
Marta, however,
was like the moon.

55
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,125
Though Marta adored her sister,

56
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,666
she resented the attention Maria
received from their father.

57
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,083
She fell into great despair.

58
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:34,875
Two sisters born of the same
man, yet so different.

59
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,833
Perhaps it's sheer coincidence,
but you seem to share

60
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,541
some features from both
your mother and Marta.

61
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,208
[RITSUKA] You seem to know
an awful lot about my family.

62
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,375
[NESTA] Maybe it's the
blood that's the same.

63
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,625
[gasps]

64
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,250
[VAMPIRES]
Blood.

65
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,833
Blood. Blood...

66
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,833
[RITSUKA whimpers]

67
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,750
Does your brother look like me?

68
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:01,416
I suppose I'm a little curious
since half his blood is mine.

69
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,250
[RITSUKA]
I don't understand.

70
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:07,125
What I'm saying is that Marta
and I had a child together.

71
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,666
Half his blood's mine,
because he's my son.

72
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,083
What?

73
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,458
My father was a vampire.

74
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:20,583
So, I'm half human,
half vampire.

75
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,250
You're his dad.

76
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,958
[NESTA]
Does he ever thirst for blood?

77
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,583
[RITSUKA gasping]

78
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:32,916
Never! Not once!
He's not a monster like you!

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,041
I see. Well, he is
just a dhampir.

80
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,541
He can't help being
so damn weak.

81
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,625
[shrieks]

82

[RITSUKA whimpers]

83
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,333
The boy has no idea what
he's missing out on.

84
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:54,791
I'm a little ashamed that he's
never given in to his heritage.

85
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,083
Marta. Now she gave
into me quite easily.

86
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,125
Seducing that woman
was so effortless

87
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,666
it should have been criminal.

88
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,083
[RITSUKA] What an awful thing
to say. Didn't you love her?

89
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,000
[NESTA]
Love?

90
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,583
[JEK laughs]

91
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,291
[NESTA] I didn't want her love.
I wanted the forbidden grimoire.

92
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,875
The reason I grew close to Marta
was to learn more about it.

93
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,291
She gave me information

94
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:20,000
and I gave her what she wanted
most in the world: Me.

95
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,000
[JEK] Surely there could
be no greater gift

96
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,375
than the attention of
Lord Nesta himself.

97
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:31,375
[RITSUKA] That's terrible,
but I actually feel better.

98
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,291
Because a demented
creature like you

99
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,166
could never be Lindo's father!

100
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,875
He's ten times the man you are,

101
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,208
and I refuse to accept
that he's related to you!

102
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,458
[JEK]
Enough!

103
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,125
You can't be his father
'cause you're a monster!

104
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,625
No, worse!
You ruined both our lives!

105
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,208
I will never forgive you!

106
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,291
I said enough,
you insolent girl!

107
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,083
Get off! Don't think
for a minute

108
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,458
I've forgotten how you
killed Azuna, you murderer!

109
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,791
Excuse me?!

110
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:57,958
[NESTA chuckles] You are
the devil king's daughter.

111
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,416
That temper tantrum was
enough to convince me

112
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,000
that the power of the grimoire
really does slumber

113
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,625
within your body.

114
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,166
I have a question.

115
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,791
How do you plan on
removing the grimoire?

116
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,000
[NESTA] When the full
moon of the 615th year

117
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,708
rises to its highest
point in the night sky,

118
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,916
whoever should take in
your blood will obtain

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,750
the full power of
the forbidden grimoire.

120
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,000
In other words, tonight as you
approach your 17th birthday,

121
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,541
I shall take just the
slightest bit of your blood,

122
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:31,625
and then it will all be over.
Your nightmare will end.

123
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,916
Quickly everyone!

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,416
We must make the preparations
for Lord Nesta!

125
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,791
The ritual will happen when
the moon is at its highest.

126
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,250
Our lord will take in
the power of the grimoire.

Maybe then, things will
go back to normal.

working in her garden.
