I don't have to listen to this.

318
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,791
There you are!

319
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,625
[RITSUKA] Lindo! These weird
people were chasing me...

320
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:44,625
Over there... at that
amusement park...?

321
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,125
Maybe you were just dreaming.

322
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,833
You've been through a lot.
You must be tired.

323
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,041
It was there!

324
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,916
I'm glad I came to get you.
Let's go home.

325
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,583
[RITSUKA]
U-Uh...

326
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,458
[RITSUKA] How did he know
exactly where I was?

327
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,666
Is Urie right about Lindo?

328
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,583
Lindo isn't majoring in
folklore. He's an exorcist.

329
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:16,625
[gasps]

330
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:23,875
[URIE humming]

331
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,541
I love all of my butterflies.

332
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:38,250
But Ritsuka...
You're the special one.

333
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,666
Who smells like roses.

334
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,250
Soon the day will come when
I get to watch you dance.

335
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:48,583
My beautiful and perfect
little butterfly.

336
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,583
Mine and mine alone.

337
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,791
[URIE]
I'll hold you close.

338
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,500
Until you fall apart.

339
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,750
[LINDO]
I have to protect you, Ritsuka.

340
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,500
Please try to understand.

341
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,458
Ritsuka, I just wanna
keep you safe.

342
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:43,041
I'll protect Ritsuka,
no matter what the cost.
