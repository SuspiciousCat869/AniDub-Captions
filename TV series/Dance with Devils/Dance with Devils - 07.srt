1
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,291
[REM'S FATHER]
My son.

2
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,666
[REM]
I'm here.

3
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,125
[REM'S FATHER] Why have you
not come to me sooner?

4
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,875
Please forgive me, Father.

5
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,750
[REM'S FATHER]
Answer my question.

6
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,708
It's complex.

7
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,916
[REM'S FATHER]
Is the human world preferable

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,708
over your devil's pride?

9
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,833
No, the thought is laughable.

10
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,125
[REM'S FATHER] Do not lie to me,
or you shall pay with your life.

11
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,416
I'm not, I would never dream
of betraying you, Father!

12
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,125
I swear it!

13
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,083
[REM'S FATHER]
Silence!

14
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,416
[REM'S FATHER] Actions speak
louder than words, boy.

15
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,250
I do not care for
empty promises.

16
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,791
What I want is the
forbidden grimoire!

17
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,458
[REM grunts]

18
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,291
[REM'S FATHER]
Find a way to make it yours,

19
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:30,416
or else you will not be around
to carry on the Arlond name!

20
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,625
Well that sounds fun.

21
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,875
This is one of those times

22
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,125
I'm thankful not to
be the Arlond heir.

23
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,541
Yeah, tell me about it.

24
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,125
His old man is known for having
a pretty short temper.

25
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,250
It's not as if being shamed once
in a while is going to kill Rem.

26
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,041
Unless it does, in which case
I can practically imagine

27
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:54,583
how much pain he must be in
at this very moment. Ahh!

28
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,333
[MAGE] Nobody asked
for an angel's opinion!

29
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,750
Ouchie!

30
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,958
Whatever, you're both enjoying
this as much as I am!

31
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,250
Perhaps we are.

32
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,875
You're the only one
making it creepy, though.

33
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,666
[SHIKI]
Ouchie!

34
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,291
Oh please, you like it.

35
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,625
You're such a crybaby.

36
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,916
[SHIKI]
Leave me alone!

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,625
You guys always pick on me,

38
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,333
but you're the ones undermining
Rem at every turn!

39
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,708
Speaking of, why are we
wasting a golden opportunity

40
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,333
when Rem's busy
with the old man?

41
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,166
Don't be silly Mage.
That's my butterfly.

42
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,625
Yeah, in your dreams!

43
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,708
I'm gonna get the girl
and the grimoire.

44
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,916
It'll be such a breeze.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,708
[BOTH]
Mm?

46
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,291
[URIE]
Shiki!

47
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,750
[MAGE] Dammit, how the hell did
that worm get the jump on us?

48
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:17,500
[RITSUKA] Let's see, two cans
of spray paint, check!

49
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,625
Anything else?

50
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,125
[RITSUKA]
Yeah, duct tape.

51
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,416
Looks like it's over there.

52
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,833
Hold up missy,

53
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,916
there's no way I'm letting you
wander off by yourself.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,750
Chill out! It's five feet away.

55
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,458
[AZUNA]
I will not chill out!

56
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,625
Listen, those devils could
pop up anywhere, anytime.

57
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,625
They're worse than cockroaches.

58
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,625
[sighs] You're like a girly
version of Lindo.

59
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,166
[AZUNA]
Not one boy in our class

60
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,291
has helped with the
school culture festival.

61
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,625
I swear. I mean, how in
the heck are the two of us

62
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,708
even supposed to get all these
decorations and stuff

63
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,875
back to school?

64
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,791
I think this store
might offer deliveries.

65
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,000
It's worth asking.

66
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,666
Good idea. Okay.

67
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,166
I'll go check out and schedule
the delivery for us.

68
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,958
Stay where I can see you.
At all times. Got it?

69
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,250
Yes, ma'am.

70
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,208
[ROEN panting]

71
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:12,333
Huh? Hey, wait a second.
Isn't that Rem's dog?

72
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,000
What's he doing in this store?

73
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,291
Uh, uh!

74
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,500
[RITSUKA] Azuna, I'm gonna
step outside real quick.

75
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,625
I promise to come right back!

76
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,416
Now I've gotcha!

77
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:58,000
Yep! Just as I suspected,
you do belong to Rem!

78
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,041
But why were you in the store?

79
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,458
We don't want you
to get lost do we?

80
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,500
[barks]

81
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,416
[RITSUKA laughs]
Aw, silly puppy!

82
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,583
Your widdle paws are so cute!

83
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,583
Okay, time to go back.

84
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,708
[RITSUKA laughs]
Hey, that tickles!

85
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,416
[RITSUKA]
Uh?!

86
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,458
What's going on?

87
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,208
Why, it's a pleasure to see
you again, Miss Tachibana.

88
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,250
Well, as a human.

89
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,875
We met once.
I am Roen, remember?

90
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,666
[RITSUKA screams]

91
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,708
[phone rings]

92
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,041
[RITSUKA gasps]

93
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,083
If you could please ignore
your phone for a minute,

94
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,375
I have some info on the
grimoire. I really want to help.

95
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:49,583
[RITSUKA] Uh? The grimoire.
Are you a devil?

96
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,833
I am Cerberus.

97
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,666
I'm more of a dog
than say a devil.

98
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,375
Hell's watchdog, to be precise.

99
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,333
My master is Maksis.

100
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,166
I am his most faithful servant
and right hand man.

101
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,208
If it's clarity you're
seeking, then follow me.

102
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,791
The choice is up to you,
Miss Tachibana.

103
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,875
I'll respect your decision no
matter what path you choose.

104
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,041
[RITSUKA]
Azuna? It's me.

105
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,541
I have a quick errand
I need to run.

106
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,291
Don't worry. I'll go
straight home afterwards.

107
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,875
Lying to your friend?

108
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,250
My goodness, you're
such a naughty girl.

109
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,791
[groans]

110
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,500
You again?

111
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,375
[SHIKI]
Shh.

112
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,541
[AZUNA]
Uh?

113
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,833
Shiki! Where the hell does
a stupid angel like you

114
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,625
get off trying to leave
us behind like that?

115
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:47,416
You got some kinda death wish?

116
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,041
[SHIKI, AZUNA gasp]

117
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,083
[crash]

118
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,375
It seems you're desperate
for the tender caress

119
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,375
of my thorny whip.

120
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,333
[SHIKI laughs]

121
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,708
No, I'll take a raincheck
because what I was

122
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,958
actually trying to do
was help you guys out!

123
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,333
This girl is her best friend!

124
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,083
She'll tell us where
we can find Ritsuka.

125
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,083
Oh, yeah?

126
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:13,708
Excellent.

127
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,291
For sure.

128
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,166
[REM]
Uh?

129
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,333
[RITSUKA]
Hey, um. I wanted to ask...

130
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,500
...what exactly is
the forbidden grimoire?

131
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,583
I know that it's
a book of magic,

132
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,458
but I don't know how
it's supposed to work.

133
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,916
Is it full of magic
spells or something?

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,833
[ROEN]
Magic spells, how cute!

135
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,875
[RITSUKA]
Don't tease me.

136
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,166
We shouldn't linger. Follow me.

137
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:09,666
[RITSUKA]
No. I'm not budging.

138
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,208
I want to know right now.

139
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,958
Either you tell me about
the grimoire, or I'm leaving!

140
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,375
Well, who knew?
You have a backbone.

141
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,250
You've got courage
Miss Tachibana,

142
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,500
just like your father.

143
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,000
[RITSUKA]
Huh?

144
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,833
My lord Maksis finds
his power failing.

145
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,041
But perhaps you know it as the
war between vampires and devils.

146
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,833
Am I correct?

147
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,750
How it relates is the forbidden
grimoire is essential

148
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,875
in order to restore
this weakened power.

149
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,000
So wait, does the
book have a spell?

150
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,833
What I mean is does it tell you
how to revive the devils?

151
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,375
Not quite. Here's the truth:

152
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,833
The grimoire is the great power.

153
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,500
And whoever holds that
power within their grasp

154
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:53,541
will have the ability to
conquer the entire world.

155
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,750
[RITSUKA groans]

156
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,375
[ROEN]
Ah, what an enticing smell.

157
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,875
Hold on. What smell?

158
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,166
Uh?

159
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,416
[ROEN] It's enough to make

00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,500
Leave him alone!

[LINDO growls]

323
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,083
You cut me?

00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,333
Would you destroy Ritsuka, too?

00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,458
[LINDO]
Huh?

329

[LINDO exhales]

330
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,791
Oh, Lindo!

331
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,083
I hurt her. I hurt her.

332
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:37,625
Thank God! It's all okay now!
Everything will be fine!

333
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,541
Where did he go?

334
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,458
[ROEN] Well, I suppose
there's always next time.

335
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,625
I know we'll open
that door together.

336
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,541
The door leading to my
beloved Lord Maksis.

337
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,541
I refuse to fail him
again. He's my world.

338
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:11,750
He's my world.
I'll do whatever it takes.

339
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,375
Uh? It smells great.

340
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,666
Ritsuka. I hurt you. I'm sorry.

341
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,416
[RITSUKA] Did you know the truth
this whole time? That it was me?

342
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,416
Tell me the truth.
I deserve answers.

343
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,375
I knew. Grandpa told
me a while back.

344
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,625
I figured. And, mom knew too?

345
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,041
Remember how she'd always
want you to wear your pendant?

346
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,750
And she'd put vervain in it?

347
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,250
[RITSUKA]
Mm-hm.

348
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,500
It was special.
Home grown by mom.

349
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,291
It was magical and holy.

350
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,791
The grimoire's scent was
hidden by the potpourri.

351
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,291
That's why she insisted upon it.

352
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,541
Something must have
changed, then.

353
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,916
Grandpa died.

354
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,541
It was only natural for you
to become devastated.

355
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,958
But that's when the scent
started to be noticeable.

356
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,541
Because the pendant failed.

357
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,500
Though brief, it was long enough
for them to smell the grimoire.

358
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,166
Within the year they
would make their move

359
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,541
and come looking for our family.

360
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,916
That should bring you up to date

361
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,166
about everything
that's happened.

362
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,750
So, then... I'm the
reason mom's missing.

363
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:26,666
It's my fault.

364
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,500
That isn't true!

365
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,416
But it is!

366
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,625
Ritsuka! Please, listen to me.

367
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,541
All of us just wanted
to keep you safe!

368
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:38,750
Stop protecting me!
Let it be over. Save yourselves.

[gasps]

370
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,375
If handing over this power
will be the end of all this...

371
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:43,916
Fine with me!

372
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,708
No, you can't!

373
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,708
And why not?

374
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,833
Because, you...

375
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,916
Because doing that
would be the end of you.

376
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,708
[gasps]

377
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:59,708
That's it. I can't say more,
but you should know this.

378
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,208
I'll save you.

379
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,833
Even if it costs me my life,
I will protect you, Ritsuka!

380
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,916
Is everyone hiding something?

381
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,208
Lindo was like an entirely
different person.

382
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,041
I don't know who I should trust.

383
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,875
With all these lies,
which one is true?

384
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:29,541
What do I do? I just
feel so lost.

385
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,000
This time. Checkmate.

386
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,333
No, you can't go.

387
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,416

What's wrong with me?
