[AZUNA] Hey! Where's that
brother of yours?

2
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,333
Did he stay home?

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,458
[RITSUKA]
Lindo had to run an errand.

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:17,791
But look at this.
He gave me this huge lunch.

5
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,000
[AZUNA]
Whoa!

6
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,291
He put it in a nice
basket and everything!

7
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:24,541
If that's a normal lunch then
your birthday meal will rock!

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,416
Yeah.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,416
Ooh, maybe it'll be expensive!

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,875
Maybe.

11
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,208
We're still going to hang out
on my birthday, right?

12
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,708
Are you sure?

13
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,791
Of course I am, silly!

We're gonna be late! Come on.

Right.

[RITSUKA]
Uh?

00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,458
What's a bird doing in here?

All right, be free!

[gasps]

In order to prove my strength

22
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,375
and keep my power someone
must be the pawn.

23
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:24,583
And that's the part
you play in all this.

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,750
[RITSUKA whimpers]

U-Uh...

Have I not been clear?

00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,041
You will stop going
behind my back.

28
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,916
I am the Arlond heir.

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,125
Everything pertaining to
the grimoire is in my hands.

30
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,583
Do all of you understand?

31
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,458
Sorry, Mister Heir. Have I
missed part of your genius plan?

32
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,875
What do you mean by that?

33
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,416
You've done nothing.
There's no progress.

34
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,166
Meanwhile, the clock's ticking.

35
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,083
Did you forget about
the damn vampires?

36
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,666
They're not gonna go away.

37
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,541
We need to move now if we want
to beat them to the grimoire.

00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,166
[REM] Those leeches
aren't worth our concern.

Heh.

yourselves for this set back.

Thanks to your foolishness,

00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,291
the girl won't give me
the information we need.

Whatever, she's like
totally hot for me.

44
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,125
Next time that chick
will explain everything,

45
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,541
even if it's by force.

46
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,500
My, what a dismal thought.

47
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,000
Want me to show you
how it's done?

48
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,208
That's enough!

49
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,708
There will be no more
acting out of turn!

50
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,833
Anyway, that little
pawn is essential

51
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,708
if we're going to
find the grimoire.

52
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,333
I won't risk destroying
that chance.

53
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,208
That almost sounded tender.

54
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,458
Yeah it sure did.

Very scary! I'm getting
goosebumps.

It seems there are too
many snakes in one room,

I wonder which one
will come out on top?

There can be only one, you know.

this whole time?

320
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,375
I feel so stupid.

321
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,875
It's to save you!

322
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,625
Oh, you poor little thing.

323
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,083
[RITSUKA, AZUNA grunt]

324
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,291
[SHIKI]
Lying is a sin, y'know.

325
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,458
Looks like I'll
have to punish you!

326
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,666
[RITSUKA, AZUNA yelp]

327
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,250
[AZUNA]
Ritsuka!

328
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,500
So, which punishment
should it be?

329
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,666
By the sacred Name,
you will obey me!

330
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,916
[AZUNA gasping]

331
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,458
[AZUNA screams]

332
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,291
Oh, no!

333
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,166
[AZUNA whimpers]

334
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,208
[SHIKI]
Are you deaf?

335
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,333
I said that wouldn't work on me.

336
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:01,208
[AZUNA groaning]
No!

337
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,083
[SHIKI]
What should I do to you?

338
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,541
It would be a waste
not to savor your agony.

339
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,500
Stop.

340
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,000
[AZUNA groaning]

341
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,875
How about I peel
off your skin?

342
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,500
Yes, that'd be so much fun!

343
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,041
[AZUNA groaning]

344
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,875
[SHIKI] I wonder if you'll peel
as easily as an orange does.

345
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh my.

346
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,958
I bet you'll be deliciously
grotesque.

347
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:22,833
[AZUNA yelps]

348
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,791
Scream for me, Miss Exorcist!

349
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,958
[RITSUKA]
That's enough!

350
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,041
I won't let you
keep hurting her!

351
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:36,166
Come on, she's just a filthy
liar. Why protect that?

352
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,083
[RITSUKA]
She's still my friend!

353
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,208
[SHIKI]
Friends don't lie.

354
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,708
Azuna may have lied,

355
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,083
but she did it in order to
protect me! It was necessary!

356
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,083
Ritsuka.

357
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,375
No more, okay?
I hate all this fighting.

358
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,708
I refuse to stand
around and watch.

359
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,958
Please just stop it!

360
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,625
Ritsuka...

361
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,833
That's so boring.
Total buzzkill.

362
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,458
Wait...

363
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,625
Well. See ya girls!

364
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,166
Hang on a second!

365
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,958
What about us finding my mother?

366
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,625
Were you even telling the truth?

367
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,125
Lies could be true.

368
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:19,333
The truth could be lies.
It's whatever you decide.

369
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,333
[gasps] Rem.

370
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,666
[RITSUKA]
Are you behind all this?

371
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,583
Did you make Shiki lie to me?

372
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,166
Stop!

373
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,541
[REM]
What for?

374
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,083
Why did you even bother to
help me in the first place?

375
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,458
[gasps]

376
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,625
[gasps]

377
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:54,208
I'm not a pawn in some game.

378
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,750
I'm a real person
with actual feelings.

379
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,625
I know we'll open
that door together.

380
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,500
The door leading to my
beloved Lord Maksis.

381
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,500
I refuse to fail him again.
He's my world.

382
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,333
I'll do whatever it takes.

Fantasy and Innocence."
