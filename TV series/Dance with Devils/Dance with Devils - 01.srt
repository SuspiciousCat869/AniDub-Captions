00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:46,041
I already told you,
I don't know anything about it.

317
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,166
Sorry. I'm upset.

318
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,833
My mom's been missing for hours.
I'm worried. I should go.

319
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,875
Maybe now the police
will believe me.

320
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,375
I'll call them on your behalf.

[RITSUKA gasps]

322
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,541
They'll listen to me.

323
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,958
The authorities greatly
respect the Kaginuki name.

Wait.

325
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,708
Thank you so much for this, Rem.

326
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,541
I'm not sure why you're helping,

327
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,333
but I truly
appreciate everything.

[gasps]

329
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:20,041
Don't get the wrong idea.
I'm not doing this for you.

As Student Council President,

331
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,208
it is my responsibility
to maintain order.

Now, where did you come from?

So cute.

So you're familiar with it?

My grandpa's house is there.

341
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,458
This is her phone! That means
she's been in the house!

We'll call this checkmate.
