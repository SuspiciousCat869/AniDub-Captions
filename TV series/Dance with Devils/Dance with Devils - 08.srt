[RITSUKA] The school
festival's almost here,

2
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,333
and I've been really busy
getting ready for it.

3
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,625
So many crazy things
have happened.

4
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,166
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

5
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,125
It's like my heart is
telling me one thing

6
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,916
and my head is
telling me another.

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,250
I know it may not be
the safest place for me,

8
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,750
but I want to go to school.

9
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:22,041
When I'm here, I feel like
I'm closer to finding my mom.

But more than anything,
I can't be afraid of them.

[RITSUKA]
I haven't seen Rem.

12
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,458
Not since that day.

[LINDO] Ye evil ones,
ye who lurk in darkness.

Ye sinister ones.

May the sacred power of
light banish and repel ye.

17

Now listen to me. Be careful.

18
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,708
The festival will be
full of outsiders.

19
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,791
Which means there will
probably be vampires

20

Oh right, I forgot
it's your first one.

The dance is gorgeous.

All right, Fallen Angel,

that's enough creeping
around from you.

Just give it a rest.

Rem can take care of himself.

Not him. I meant Roen.

I have to find that
yappy little fluff ball.

[REM] You won't be seeing
him around here.

He's abused our trust

What does that mean?

58
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,875
[REM] He manipulated us to think
he was an innocent, loyal puppy.

59
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,083
But it was simply a ploy
to help his previous master.

The fallen king, Maksis?
He's still around?

Yeah, cause I coulda sworn
your Dad defeated that dude

and sealed his ass away.

00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,583
Ah yes, but the forbidden
grimoire could change that.

64
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,791
I guess that means
Roen was after it, too.

65
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,791
But, he wanted to use its
powers to revive Maksis.

find the grimoire first.

to begin with.

lead us to the grimoire.

00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,750
Ritsuka, we're gonna
keep you safe.

320
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,541
Be careful.

321
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:05,458
[LINDO] Become thou dust in
sacred light and vanish!

322
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,333
Lindo...

323
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,958
Ye who lurk in darkness, begone!

324
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,208
Now!

[RITSUKA whimpers]

338
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,083
She goes with me.

339
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:03,333
No way! Let her go!

340
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,166
[RITSUKA gasps]

341
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,416
[AZUNA]
Are you okay?

342
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,291
[AZUNA gasps]

343
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,291
[JEK]
You'll pay for that.

344
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:40,958
[RITSUKA gasps]
No!

Please don't cry.

[RITSUKA]
Azuna? Azuna, please!

349
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,125
Stay with me!

350
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:30,083
Azuna, please! I need you!
Please don't go!

351
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:35,708
Azuna, you can't die!
I won't let you! Azuna!

We found it!

355
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,875
The grimoire is ours Lord Nesta!

356
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,166
Don't worry, dear.
I'll be back to get you soon.

357
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,541
When the light begins to fade.

[REM]
Give it up.

359
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,083
You cannot protect
her in this state.

360
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,958
[LINDO] I would rather die
than let you take her!

361
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:42,333
[REM] If that's what you really
want, consider it done.
