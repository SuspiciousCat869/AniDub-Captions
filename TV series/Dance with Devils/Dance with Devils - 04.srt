Oh, c'mon don't cry, sis.

You were just like a prince,

the way you were constantly
watching out for me.

29

Lindo? Did you do this?

00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:09,333
I did. I have to protect
you, Ritsuka.

Please try to understand.

But...

43
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,958
Tell me.

44
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,291
There's a rumor you're
an exorcist. Is it true?

45
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,833
Huh?!

46
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,791
[LINDO] I'm sure you
remember that grandpa

47
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,541
used to study folklores
and demonology.

48
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,000
[RITSUKA]
Yeah.

49
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,875
[LINDO] He was the top
researcher in his field.

50
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,958
Unfortunately, being the
best attracted grandpa

51
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,916
unwanted attention from some
rather nasty creatures.

52
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,583
What kind of nasty creatures?

53
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:54,458
Well. Honestly. They were
vampires and devils.

54
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:58,541
In the end, they
murdered grandpa.

55
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,166
But wait, I thought he
got sick and passed away.

56
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,750
Only because he was stricken
with a fatal curse.

57
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:05,750
What?

58
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,083
Now you know.

59
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,583
That's the reason we kept
you away when he died.

60
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,333
I was there with him
in his final moments.

61
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:18,458
Afflicted by the curse,
he was no longer human.

62
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,916
Grandpa was unbelievably
worried about you and mom.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,333
Before he died,
he made me promise

64
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:28,666
that I would keep our
family safe. No matter what.

65
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,041
[RITSUKA]
I see. But why? Why you, Lindo?

66
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,750
[LINDO]
All this devil and vampire stuff

67
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,083
has been hammered into
me since I was a kid.

68
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,291
The folklore, the
demonology, all of it.

69
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,375
Protecting you,
and mom... our family,

70
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,500
that has been my job for years.

71
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,458
So you became an exorcist.

72
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,166
Did Mom know about everything?

73
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,583
She did.

74
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,291
And that's why she nagged
you to wear your pendant.

75
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,083
[LINDO] Potpourri repels evil.

76
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,541
I don't get it.
Why didn't anyone tell me?

77
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,625
We were planning to soon.

78
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,458
Mom and I were going to tell you
everything before your birthday.

79
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,875
But then, those guys came along.

80
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,208
No way! There's no
way this is true!

81
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,625
But... Uh...

82
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:17,000
Where is the forbidden
grimoire? Tell me. Now.

83
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,250
Red eyes.

84
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,250
[LINDO]
Red eyes means vampire.

85
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,250
Whoever took mom
was probably one.

86
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,083
For real? But then...

87
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,333
...why'd they take her and why
on earth are they after me?

88
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,416
[LINDO] Grandpa had a
pretty good theory.

89
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,625
He believed that the devils'
power is starting to fade.

90
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:37,458
And so, the vampires are just
capitalizing on the opportunity.

91
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,291
And that's where the
grimoire comes into play.

92
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,250
[gasps]

93
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,166
[LINDO]
Do you know what it is?

94
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,416
Only the name.

95
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,833
[LINDO] The grimoire is
extremely powerful.

96
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,083
Whoever possesses it

97
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,416
could potentially control
the entire world.

98
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,916
[gasps]

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,583
[LINDO] These creatures believe
that the Tachibana family

100
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,791
is the key to the grimoire's
whereabouts.

101
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,625
That's why they
targeted you and mom.

102
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,333
But what for?!
I don't know anything!

103
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,875
And I definitely don't
know where it is!

104
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,958
Tell me about the grimoire.

105
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:11,500
I really need to find it, and
you're the key that can help me.

106
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,833
Hold on.

107
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,500
Back when I was at the
amusement park with Urie,

108
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,666
he knew about the book.

109
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,750
All of the student
council know.

110
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,958
Urie Sogami,

111
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,250
Mage Nanashiro,

112
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,000
Shiki Natsumezaka,

113
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,166
and Rem Kaginuki.

114
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,666
They know because
they're devils.

115
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,041
Devils? You've gotta
be joking, right?

116
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,666
Rem has done nothing but go
out of his way constantly.

117
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,083
He even saved my life
twice already!

118
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,833
Oh, and he also said that
it was the devil worshippers

119
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,541
who probably took mom.

120
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,083
You cannot trust him!

121
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,166
Yeah, so anyway.

122
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,541
Do you have any idea
where the grimoire is?

123
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:03,041
No, I don't.
Here's what I do know.

124
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,916
Vampires, and yes
the devils too.

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,416
They're looking everywhere
for the grimoire.

126
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,750
You need to understand
that they'll stop at nothing

127
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:14,458
to get it. They killed
grandpa and took mom.

128
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:23,083
Ritsuka, I just wanna
keep you safe.

129
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,291
Believe me. Everything's
going to be fine.

130
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,875
I promise to protect you.

131
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:36,375
There are devils and vampires.

132
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:41,666
So was that the power
of a devil? But then...

133
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,458
You're all right!

134
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:48,583
