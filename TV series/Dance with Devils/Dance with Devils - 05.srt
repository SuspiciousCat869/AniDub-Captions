The Pope's words proved powerful

What are you talking about?!

317
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,958
That's not true at all!
Now, let go of me!

318
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,000
[LINDO]
I will kill you.

319
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,583
Don't make the mistake of
thinking you can violate her...

320
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,583
...and walk away!

321
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,875
Lindo?

322
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,333
[LINDO growls]

323
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,125
Interesting. All right then.

324
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,958
[MAGE]
You don't fool me.

325
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,416
Your eyes just told me
everything I need to know.

326
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,916
Silence, devil!

327
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,958
[MAGE grunts]

328
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,083
[RITSUKA]
Please. Stop it!

329
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,458
[LINDO]
O ye who lurk in darkness,

330
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,958
obey my voice and pledge
that thou wouldst utter

331
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:58,958
before it only the truth...

332
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,500
Go ahead and say
whatever you want.

333
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,916
It's not gonna stand a chance

334
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,583
against the strength
of my power!

335
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,458
Pledge to me now!

336
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,916
[gasps]

337
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,916
Listen carefully, it doesn't
matter who you are,

338
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,500
I'll crush anyone
that gets in my way.

339
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,875
And I'll do it with the
strength of my bare hands.

340
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,375
Nothing personal,
but you don't have a shot.

341
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:33,500
I'll kill you. You must pay.
I'll kill you.

342
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,250
Lindo...

343
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:41,958
I'll protect her. Always.
Even if it costs me my life.

344
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,333
Stop it.

345
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,291
[MAGE]
Die!

346
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,500
[LINDO]
Be gone!

347
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,916
[RITSUKA]
No!

348
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,125
[BOTH gasp]

349
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,375
[RITSUKA grunts]

350
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,125
[RITSUKA gasping]

351
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,208
[LINDO]
Ritsuka!

352
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,333
I've got you.

353
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,333
I know. You saved me.

354
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,666
[MAGE] This party
turned out to be a bust.

355
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,500
See ya 'round, Ritsuka!

356
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,333
I'll give you some time to see
what your heart really wants.

357
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,250
Then, you'll be
begging to be mine.

358
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,333
[sighs]

359
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,625
Thank goodness. Are you okay?

360
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,375
I'm fine. It was nothing.

361
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,541
What's wrong?

362
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:37,416
[LINDO] Forgive me.
I let my anger take over.

363
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,625
[RITSUKA]
It's okay, really.

364
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,875
You always come
to my rescue, Lindo.

365
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,500
Thank you.

366
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,250
[MAGE sighs] I'm sick of all
these posers getting in my way.

367
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,916
[sniffing]

368
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:07,000
Wow, that scent of hers
just soaked right in.

369
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,833
It tasted so sweet.

370
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,791
[SHIKI laughs]

371
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,541
Uh?

372
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:24,416
Oh! What the hell, Shiki?
Don't sneak up on me!

373
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,458
[SHIKI chuckles]
Mage. You're blushing.

374
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,666
Is it a good look
for you? I think not.

375
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,041
Uh! I am not blushing!
You are so dead!

376
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,625
Maybe one day you'll
follow through

377
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:39,583
on these empty threats, but
alas, today's not that day.

378
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,083
Anyway, I have something coming

379
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,583
that will send shivers
up your spine.

380
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:54,375
[SHIKI] I only hope you
find your way to me quickly.

381
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,875
Then I can lock
you away forever.

382
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:36,083
[SHIKI] The fear on your face.
I simply adore it.

383
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,583
We'll be together always.
Don't try to leave.

384
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,500
Because if you do,
I'll kill you.
