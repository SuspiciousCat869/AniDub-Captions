[RITSUKA]
Uh?

276
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,875
Once upon a time
there was a professor.

277
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,041
A man who was intent
on finding answers

278
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,083
to all the great mysteries of
the world in which we live.

279
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,750
What fascinated the
professor most of all

280
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,708
was the magic of
the forbidden grimoire.

281
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,708
But soon, the devils found out.

282
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,041
Once the professor
possessed that grimoire

283
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,958
and its mysterious power,

284
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,791
those devils knew they
needed it for themselves.

285
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,416
And one devil made
it his mission

286
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,291
to trick the man and get
what he wanted most.

287
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,916
You see, the professor
had a daughter,

288
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,958
both beautiful and wise.

289
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,708
This devil thought if he could
get close to the man,

290
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,708
he could not only take the
grimoire but, also the daughter.

291
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,875
From their union,
a child was born.

292
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,250
She was the first human
born of royal devil blood

293
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,375
in over 615 years.

294
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,416
Within this child lay the power
to rule the entire world.

295
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,750
This was the forbidden grimoire.

296
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,916
The devil was overjoyed.

297
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,083
His daughter contained
the strength to rule

298

but heaven and earth, as well.

[JEK]
It's a power you didn't ask for,

317
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,208
but it claimed you anyway.

318
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:05,833
You had no choice in the
matter. You poor thing.

319
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,000
[RITSUKA]
I'm glad.

320
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,375
[JEK]
Mm? What'd you say?

321
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,708
[RITSUKA]
All this time,

322
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:14,500
I never understood why
this was happening to me.

323
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,750
I mean, I'm supposed to be
a normal high school girl.

324
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,833
But all these crazy
things kept occurring.

325
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,666
The people I loved got hurt.

326
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,958
And I couldn't help but wonder

327
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:28,875
why I had to go
through all of it.

328
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:33,916
But now, now I know it's because
I'm the devil king's daughter.

329
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,166
It was me.
I made everyone suffer.

330
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,166
I wish... I wish I
had never been born.

331
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,416
None of this would've happened.

332
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,833
Uh?

333
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,791
If you trust me, I can
make everything better.

334
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,666
Really? How in the world
could you possibly do that?

335
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,666
It's a secret. One I think
the vampire king himself

336
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,458
would like to tell
you the details of.

337
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,166
Vampire king? What?

338
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,041
The ruler of destruction
and confusion. Lord Nesta.

339
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,333
When the devils started
to oppress the vampires,

340
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,666
he gave us refuge.

341
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,958
But our oppression ends now
and a new day is dawning.

342
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,958
Because the time has
come for Lord Nesta

343
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,541
to defeat the devils
once and for all.

344
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,166
He will release you from
the burden of the grimoire

345
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,458
and use its power to punish
those devils for their crimes.

346
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,833
[RITSUKA]
Uh?

347
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,375
Once he possesses it,

348
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,958
he will be unstoppable,
no one will be his equal!

349
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:34,208
Even the devil king,
Maksis, will live in fear.

350
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,708
But wait. How exactly would
he remove the grimoire?

351
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,875
Beats me. Our king
wouldn't divulge

352
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,041
something that sacred
to underlings.

353
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,166
But you, my dear,
are running out of options.

354
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,708
And the clock is ticking.

355
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,458
I've told you all
you need to know,

356
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,041
and it's up to you do decide.

357
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,583
Either you choose to
surrender the grimoire,

358
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,333
or it's the end of the road.

359
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,708
Both for you and your mother.

360
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:07,791
Come along now, Ritsuka.
Lord Nesta is waiting.

361
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,166
[RITSUKA]
Mm...

[RITSUKA grunting]

00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,916
Please. Ladies first.

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,916
[RITSUKA]
What about my mom?

365
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,500
We'll take good care of her.

366
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:33,666
And I've told you a vampire
would never tell a lie.

367
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,125
All right. I've made
my decision.

368
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,250
Take me to this "Vampire King".

369

[BOAT MAN 10A laughs]

370
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,500
[JEK] Once Lord Nesta removes
the devils from this world,

371
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,083
he'll claim the demon
realm for us vampires.

372
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,875
When that time comes,
we won't care about the humans.

373
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,750
You will be free to live
your lives as you please.

374
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,708
It will be your very own
happily ever after.

375
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:17,041
You know. Just like
out of a fairy tale.

376
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,291
Oh, no.
