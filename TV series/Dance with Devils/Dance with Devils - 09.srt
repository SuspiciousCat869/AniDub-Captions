00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,125
Are you so desperate
to have the grimoire

315
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,750
that you'd take someone's life?

316
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,625
I was wrong. You are a devil!

317
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,291
A horrible, cold hearted, devil!

318
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,166
Why don't you say something?
What are you thinking right now?

319
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,916
I just don't know anymore!

320
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,875
Ritsuka--

321
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,208
[RITSUKA]
It's too late, Rem!

322
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,875
I'm done letting you hurt
everyone I care about!

323
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,666
It's all your fault.
I wish we'd never met!

324
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,958
I hate you!

325
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,708
I'm not done yet, devil!

326
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,666
[REM groans]

327
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,125
Get out of here, Rem,
and leave me alone!

328
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,708
Lindo! You're hurt!

329
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,333
It's nothing. Just a scratch.

330
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,250
I'll call an ambulance!

331
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,833
[LINDO grunts]
No, no hospitals.

332
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,833
If they discovered that
I'm not a normal man,

333
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,000
then things would
get complicated.

334
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,750
[LINDO panting]

335
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,083
I'm so sorry.

336
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,916
[RITSUKA] I don't need
the power of the grimoire.

337
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,500
Azuna.

338
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,041
And Mom. Grandfather.

339
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:11,958
I won't give up.

340
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,125
[LINDO groaning]

341
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,458
[RITSUKA gasps]

342
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,958
Too much has been lost.

343
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,250
I have to live.

344
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,875
For Lindo. For all the
people I care about most.

345
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,375
I'll remain strong.

346
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,500
[RITSUKA]
Goodbye, Rem.

347
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,166
[splash]

348
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,291
[JEK] I'm on my way to seize
the grimoire now, my lord.

349
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,958
[NESTA] I'm counting
on your success, Jek.

350
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,666
And about the young man.

351
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,000
Do you have a particular
plan for him, Lord Nesta?

352
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,125
[NESTA chuckles]
Ah, yes the boy.

353
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,958
I hold his life entirely
in the palm of my hand.

354
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,000
[SHIKI] So then, you won't
mind if I take her?

355
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,166
[MAGE] Ritsuka's gonna
be with me, got it?

356
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,708
[URIE] Sorry, but you
can't have my butterfly.

357
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,333
[REM] None of you will
touch the grimoire!

358
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:46,416

of Desire and Deceit."
