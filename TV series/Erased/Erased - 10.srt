1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,359
Congratulations, everyone.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,030
<i>In 1988, the first time I lived it,</i>

3
00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:12,817
<i>Kayo Hinazuki and Aya Nakanishi disappeared</i>

4
00:00:13,024 --> 00:00:14,691
<i>and their bodies were found later.</i>

5
00:00:15,657 --> 00:00:17,785
<i>I was too helpless to save anyone.</i>

6
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,944
<i>I tried hard to forget, and I did.</i>

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,157
<i>But in the end, I had a big gaping hole in my heart.</i>

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,978
These past six years, we've
experienced success and failure,

9
00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:35,660
happiness and sadness.

10
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:41,029
Good or bad, the experiences we share
fill a void we all have inside of us.

11
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,728
Everyone. Even me.

12
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:47,869
So keep filling it, and you'll
enrich your life, and others' too.

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,915
That’s what life's about. Never forget that.

14
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:31,870
Uh, hey there.

15
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:34,785
Who are you?

16
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:37,197
I'm Satoru Fujinuma.

17
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:38,788
I'm Kenya Kobayashi.

18
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:40,558
I'm Hiromi Sugita.

19
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:42,198
Have we met before?

20
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:44,140
Uh, you're Aya Nakanishi.

21
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,731
I heard you're good at piano.

22
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:48,700
Yeah, I guess.

23
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,357
So, did we meet in piano class?

24
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:52,905
Well, actually, no.

25
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:55,812
So, anyway, what you reading?

26
00:02:55,954 --> 00:02:58,563
Oh, this? Shakespeare.

27
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,781
"King Lear." I've only read "Romeo and Juliet."

28
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,288
Reading this stuff and playing piano are my parents' idea.

29
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,776
I can't hear what they're talking about.

30
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:11,002
Maybe we should try and get a little closer.

31
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:14,193
Wait, now I remember where I've seen you before.

32
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:17,321
You're the kids who are always
sneaking into that old building.

33
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:18,294
Aren't you?

34
00:03:19,102 --> 00:03:22,259
Darn it. So much for having a secret hideout.

35
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,400
Hideout? That's so childish.

36
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:26,969
You...

37
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:29,388
You shouldn't call it childish.

38
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:34,117
Yeah, well, the only ones who sneak around
building forts and secret hideouts are little boys.

39
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,688
I bet you like playing superhero too.

40
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,420
Don't make fun of superheroes!

41
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,954
Easy, Satoru!

42
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,368
Nice meeting you, but I have to go now.

43
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,278
Bye, kids.

44
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:48,575
Hold up!

45
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:49,891
Kazu?!

46
00:03:52,214 --> 00:03:53,272
What do you want?

47
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:54,623
A hideout...

48
00:03:56,224 --> 00:03:58,153
is totally macho!

49
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:01,288
Uh...

50
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:04,422
You should come and see it sometime.

51
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:06,025
You'll get what I mean.

52
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:08,644
You're a bunch of weirdoes!

53
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,479
She’s childish.

54
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:19,150
You were so rad yesterday!

55
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:20,868
<i>It's my gloves,</i>

56
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:23,601
<i>right where I left them 18 years ago.</i>

57
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,645
Leveling up's a pain in the nuts.

58
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,842
That's what makes games fun.

59
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:32,456
Hey, Satoru, Aya's gonna be at the park
soon, so maybe we should start heading over.

60
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:36,250
It's cool. I can see the bench from here.

61
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:37,295
OK.

62
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,566
<i>Yesterday was a wash.</i>

63
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:42,124
<i>I gotta figure out how to get close to her.</i>

64
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:50,122
All right, I'm here to see this macho hideout of yours.

65
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:56,730
Um... thanks for coming, Aya. Can you stay awhile?

66
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:57,929
Mm‐hmm.

67
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,644
See you.

68
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:01,490
Bye‐bye.

69
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,394
You off to see Aya again?

70
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:10,278
Yep. We'll cruise by the hideout later.

71
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:12,615
Well, guys, see you then!

72
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:14,960
Later days, teach!

73
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:16,370
"Goodbye" is more proper.

74
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:19,288
I can't picture Aya and Kazu liking each other.

75
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:23,053
Yeah, me neither, but the good thing
is, she's always got someone with her now.

76
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:23,935
Mm‐hmm.

77
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:29,588
Um, you guys, I... I just wanted to say thank you.

78
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:30,523
Why?

79
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:34,921
I think it's awesome how you're going
around making sure none of us are alone.

80
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:36,796
Both of my parents work,

81
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:40,871
and nothing felt worse than me
getting home and the house being empty.

82
00:05:41,656 --> 00:05:46,369
It's pretty awesome how you kept Kayo and
Aya and me from being alone all the time.

83
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:48,289
So thank you.

84
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:55,921
Hey, guys! We going to the hideout
or what? I'm getting tired of waiting.

85
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:57,794
What's up? Where's Kazu?

86
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,589
He went to go meet Aya.

87
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:00,913
How come?

88
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,877
You're joking, right?

89
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:05,417
It's not like she doesn't know where our hideout is.

90
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:07,254
Maybe you should talk to him.

91
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:09,791
Oh, whatever. Let's get going, already!

92
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:11,255
OK.

93
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,417
Goodbye, Mr. Yashiro.

94
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:19,632
Slow pokes

95
00:06:19,657 --> 00:06:21,078
What's the rush?

96
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:23,613
Wait up, guys!

97
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,496
<i>Aya Nakanishi,</i>

98
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:30,595
<i>Hiromi Sugita,</i>

99
00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:32,477
<i>and Kayo Hinazuki.</i>

100
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,760
<i>They're all still alive,</i>

101
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:37,551
<i>so I guess that means the killer gave up on them.</i>

102
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:40,648
<i>But now that the clues from the bus are gone,</i>

103
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:42,364
<i>how am I gonna find him?</i>

104
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,023
There. Now he really looks like a girl.

105
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:46,455
Whoa!

106
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:51,171
Now what? Are you done? You know, playing detective.

107
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:55,237
Not yet. I'm still on the case.

108
00:06:57,854 --> 00:07:03,089
<i>In 2006, my mom told Sawada she
thought she knew who the killer was.</i>

109
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:08,418
<i>It's possible it's someone she knows now, in 1988.</i>

110
00:07:09,318 --> 00:07:11,504
<i>Maybe like Mr. Yashiro and his candy,</i>

111
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:13,514
<i>the killer needs, a substitute, too,</i>

112
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:16,343
<i>someone to take the place of the kids that got away.</i>

113
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,434
Move it.

114
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,543
Well, me and Kenya are heading
out now to go watch the hockey game.

115
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:36,966
Is Hamada playing?

116
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:37,770
You know it.

117
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:41,036
Wish I could go. When you see
him, tell him I said good luck.

118
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,871
Sure.

119
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,005
See ya later.

120
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,273
Here I am.

121
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:51,385
You notice how Misato's been keeping to herself lately?

122
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:52,767
No. Really?

123
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:55,448
Yeah. People have been avoiding her,

124
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:57,788
ever since that lunch money thing happened.

125
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:02,362
Oh, man. I guess I could try talking to her on Monday.

126
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:03,536
Cool.

127
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,220
Thanks for breakfast!

128
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,818
Oh, yeah, I might be a little late today.

129
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:26,408
Not too late, I hope. When you know what
time, how about you call and let me know, OK?

130
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:29,314
Mm‐hmm, I will. See ya later, Mom!

131
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,850
Have a good day today, Satoru.

132
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:36,461
Mr. Yashiro's gonna take us.

133
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:37,222
Really?

134
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,729
You know who will have to walk over there.

135
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:42,469
Too bad for her.

136
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:43,585
<i>What can I say to her?</i>

137
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,441
Crap! Missed her.

138
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:01,710
Satoru, I heard you're gonna try helping Misato next.

139
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,058
Mm‐hmm, but she just left.

140
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,493
I bet she's going to Wakaba Gym.

141
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:07,588
Really?

142
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:12,107
Yeah, Hamada's playing, so Mr. Yashiro
invited her to go cheer him on.

143
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,333
You know what, she went to last week's game alone, too.

144
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:16,648
Thanks.

145
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:18,040
Want us to go with you?

146
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:22,201
Nah, I think I better do this myself. It's no biggie.

147
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:25,933
OK, but I want a full report tomorrow.

148
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:27,600
Got it, Detective Satoru?

149
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:28,757
Sure.

150
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:31,059
We'll be at the hideout if you need backup.

151
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,850
Mm‐hmm. See you later!

152
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:33,267
Later, dude!

153
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:34,316
See you tomorrow!

154
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:34,933
You got it.

155
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,207
See ya!

156
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:37,457
Bye, you guys!

157
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,554
Saying bye's a big deal with him.

158
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,917
I know, right? He acts like he'll never see us again.

159
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:49,720
Whoa! It's even colder in here than outside.

160
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:52,321
Ohhh! Hamada!

161
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,362
Show 'em who's boss out there.

162
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:56,559
I can't concentrate with you uglies yellin'!

163
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,507
Ah, we can yell if we want.

164
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,559
Watch the attitude, Kouichi.

165
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,028
Otherwise, no dinner for you.

166
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:03,750
What? But they're bugging <i>me!</i>

167
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:12,466
<i>There she is.</i>

168
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:14,293
<i>And she's alone.</i>

169
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:17,828
All right, guys, warm up and get your game face on.

170
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:18,794
Yes, sir!

171
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:23,989
<i>Now the killer's lost two more potential
victims, it makes sense he'd go for her next.</i>

172
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,874
<i>She's a perfect target.</i>

173
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,469
<i>She's going to the bathroom.</i>

174
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:36,920
Game starts in five!

175
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:38,319
You got it, coach!

176
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:41,616
<i>Why is she taking so long?</i>

177
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:53,694
I needed a candy break. What's wrong?

178
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,567
The game's about to start.

179
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,340
Are you standing guard for someone?

180
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,246
Huh? Oh, uh... no.

181
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:02,574
I just wanted to talk to Misato.

182
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:05,175
Misato. Hmm...

183
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,183
Huh.

184
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:11,490
What, did she go outside?

185
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,301
Uh‐huh.

186
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,028
<i>Where did she take off to?</i>

187
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,828
<i>That's Yuuki's dad's truck.</i>

188
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:24,997
Mr. Yashiro, I need to follow someone.

189
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:26,120
Will you drive?

190
00:11:26,414 --> 00:11:26,924
Hmm.

191
00:11:31,977 --> 00:11:33,836
That doesn't even sound legal.

192
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:37,146
It's nothing bad. We're just playing detective.

193
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,673
We pretend there's a kidnapper at large.

194
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,879
Then we try to find girls who seem like
they're lonely and make friends with them.

195
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:47,608
If anything, we could end up stopping a real kidnapping.

196
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:51,501
My God, it might be just a game, but it's a good idea.

197
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:53,403
I'm glad you think so.

198
00:11:54,342 --> 00:11:57,095
Satoru, better buckle up.

199
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:57,980
Oh.

200
00:12:03,344 --> 00:12:06,125
Oh, yeah. I have to get that fixed.

201
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:07,736
There.

202
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:16,232
So, you've noticed Misato's
been keeping to herself lately.

203
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:19,333
Actually, Hiromi told me a little while ago.

204
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:23,889
Well, if you ask me, it's great
you're being so proactive about it.

205
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:25,414
I don't know about that.

206
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:28,582
I couldn't get up the nerve to talk to her before,

207
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:32,129
and, well, I started thinking she might make good bait.

208
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,189
Really? Bait.

209
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,166
So you're out to catch someone.

210
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,842
Now I know why you were working
so hard to be friendly and outgoing.

211
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:42,632
You’re a man on a mission.

212
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:46,692
Mm‐hmm. Everybody has something
that's missing from their lives, even me.

213
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:48,401
If I can fill that void...

214
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:53,092
<i>Crap. I just fed him his own line.</i>

215
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:57,679
You and I have a lot in common.

216
00:12:57,868 --> 00:13:00,362
That happens to be my philosophy in life.

217
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,812
When I teach a sixth‐grade class,

218
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,165
I like to bring it up in my graduation speech.

219
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:07,944
It sort of ties into what you said,

220
00:13:08,027 --> 00:13:09,735
about using Misato as bait?

221
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:13,400
I can tell you regret it, but
in my opinion, you shouldn't.

222
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,361
There's no difference between a good deed and a bad one.

223
00:13:18,645 --> 00:13:22,423
They both have a similar goal,
to satisfy a need within a person.

224
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,903
<i>Well, that's... extreme.</i>

225
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:29,872
For example, lately I've tried all
kinds of things to get closer to someone.

226
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:33,194
Sometimes I'm direct, other times I play coy.

227
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,757
At times, I've even been deceitful.

228
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:38,867
And boy, it's been fun.

229
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:42,152
With who? A girlfriend?

230
00:13:42,244 --> 00:13:45,079
I can see how you'd make that connection.

231
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,975
Hmm. Either way, it's about
filling some kind of emptiness.

232
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:54,083
Um... want a lollipop?

233
00:13:57,061 --> 00:14:01,016
Thank you for asking, but I'm
afraid you won't find any there.

234
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,358
You see, this isn't my car.

235
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:24,300
Where is your car then? In the shop?

236
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,871
Whatever your happiest moment is today,

237
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:29,897
another will eventually come along to replace it.

238
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,425
And thanks to you, mine just got replaced.

239
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:38,375
Nothing compares to the feeling a person
gets when they can finally satisfy their need.

240
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:40,549
You spent all this time searching,

241
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,475
and when you get it, it's like heaven.

242
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:44,649
You know, it's true what they say,

243
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:48,040
the more effort something
takes, the sweeter the reward is.

244
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,188
<i>Where the hell is he going with this?</i>

245
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:53,336
<i>Laxatives?</i>

246
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:56,816
Satoru. You lied to me a few minutes ago.

247
00:14:57,151 --> 00:14:59,604
You said you're just pretending there's a kidnapper,

248
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:02,062
but the truth is, you know there's one,

249
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:03,477
and you're trying to catch him.

250
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:08,327
I've resisted the idea for a while now
because I couldn't believe it was possible.

251
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:11,949
Well, more like I didn't want to believe...

252
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:17,467
the possibility that someone
was anticipating my every move.

253
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,150
If you're still worried about Misato, don't be.

254
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:34,129
The only person in that truck is Jun Shiratori's father.

255
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:44,541
I realized something was up with you
the day I saw you following Aya Nakanishi.

256
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,575
And I was planning to kidnap her

257
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:49,022
the day I gave you and your mom a ride.

258
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,879
Looking back, it's kind of funny.

259
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:57,602
I mean, there you were trying to snatch my
prey and I was the one telling you how to do it.

260
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:02,460
That was the second time you ruined my plans,

261
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:05,612
and I started to suspect it was more than a coincidence.

262
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:08,229
I knew Misato's friends were shunning her,

263
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:10,195
so I asked her to the hockey game.

264
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,569
Then I told Hiromi about it.

265
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:20,002
If you showed up, my suspicions were
correct, that you... you were my enemy.

266
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:21,869
<i>No way.</i>

267
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:26,595
When the time was right, I gave Misato a
drink laced with that laxative you found.

268
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:29,994
And I bought dinner, to place Shiratori at the scene.

269
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:33,174
<i>No. No!</i>

270
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,948
Yes, sir, all the pieces fit together as planned.

271
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:41,616
And in the end, I'm not who you thought I was.

272
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:46,036
Oh, and about the car, I borrowed this one earlier.

273
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,560
I was looking for something specific for today.

274
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:52,376
Generic model, generic paint job.

275
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,193
A car that's so ubiquitous, no one would even miss it.

276
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:59,475
You know, this is the first time
I've put that theory into practice.

277
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:02,016
<i>How could I be so stupid?!</i>

278
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:11,736
<i>It was so obvious.</i>

279
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:14,825
Thanks to you, Kayo's alive.

280
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:17,302
<i>I just couldn't accept the possibility.</i>

281
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,403
<i>Yashiro was on one of Sawada's lists of suspects.</i>

282
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:24,739
<i>But my mom's name was right there with his,</i>

283
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:27,404
<i>so I figured the list was bullshit and blew it off.</i>

284
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,848
<i>I trusted him so much, I couldn't even
think of him as a suspect, let alone the killer.</i>

285
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,587
<i>But...</i>

286
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:40,301
<i>he is.</i>

287
00:17:41,302 --> 00:17:43,849
<i>And now he's got me right where he wants me.</i>

288
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:11,374
It started snowing.

289
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:21,664
Don't. It's stuck for good.

290
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,563
The game's over.

291
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,735
For you and me.

292
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,843
You know, I still can't believe it.

293
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:46,111
You anticipated all my plans
and destroyed them one by one.

294
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:49,878
I'm stunned how easily you
caught me, a little boy like you.

295
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:57,106
It's almost like you can see the future or something.

296
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:02,380
I want to make sure you understand why you have to die.

297
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:07,969
Yes, you ruined my plans, but
this has nothing to do with revenge.

298
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:10,496
Believe me, I do respect you.

299
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,371
But if I can't satisfy my needs the
usual way, I have to find an alternative.

300
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,213
You don't have to do this. You said the game was over!

301
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:27,355
The children of this town are safe thanks to you, Satoru.

302
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:30,091
So congratulations, you got what you wanted.

303
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:35,654
And as for what I wanted, I still get to
kill someone for my sake and on my terms.

304
00:19:35,764 --> 00:19:39,851
Yashiro, I'm not gonna die until I
see you hang for what you've done!

305
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,711
Yes, well, keep telling yourself that.

306
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:48,229
Yashiro! You son of a bitch!

307
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:50,307
I'll get you for this!

308
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:58,886
I wish I could stay, but I have so much packing to do.

309
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:04,299
Yashiro!

310
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,724
I know your future!

311
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:11,527
<i>Shit.</i>

312
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,832
<i>It's cold.</i>

313
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:18,327
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

314
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:30,678
<i>Going numb...</i>

315
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:33,076
Shit...

316
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:45,064
Mom?

317
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:47,052
What's up, kiddo?

318
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:50,037
<i>I looked up, our eyes met...</i>

319
