1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:05,830
I get what you're saying, but before you came
along, I thought I'd always be alone in life.

2
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:08,279
And here I am with my very own family.

3
00:00:08,607 --> 00:00:10,265
You made that possible.

4
00:00:10,504 --> 00:00:11,697
So thank you.

5
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:15,623
<i>She said "thank you."</i>

6
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:18,536
<i>but I can't remember what for.</i>

7
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,183
Uh‐oh, someone’s hungry.

8
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:27,378
OK, OK.

9
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:39,725
<i>I remember now!</i>

10
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,968
<i>I saved Kayo's life.</i>

11
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:46,712
<i>After that, I made sure Misato and Aya were never alone,</i>

12
00:00:46,737 --> 00:00:48,886
<i>to keep them safe from the kidnapper.</i>

13
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,475
<i>And then...</i>

14
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,537
Yashiro...

15
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:04,887
I remember everything, you son of a bitch!

16
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:46,643
No way. Kazu's a carpenter?

17
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,504
He and Osamu look like they're doing great.

18
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:51,314
Mm‐hmm.

19
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:53,867
By the way, Misato said she
was going to come by and see you.

20
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:55,612
What? Really?

21
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:58,935
I thought she hated my guts after what happened in class.

22
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:00,668
Yeah, I remember that.

23
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:03,759
The lunch money thing she pulled was so messed up.

24
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:09,083
It was, but don't forget who started raising
funds to help pay Satoru's medical bills.

25
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:10,603
She did that, too.

26
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:12,546
I had no idea.

27
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:14,783
Tell us about the day you tailed her.

28
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:16,731
You know, when you saw the killer.

29
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:19,835
Knew it. You do remember everything.

30
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,295
But then why didn't you tell us?

31
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,282
I didn't want to get you involved.

32
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:31,767
It's been 15 years.

33
00:03:32,394 --> 00:03:34,997
Whatever evidence there was is gone by now.

34
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,942
And besides, who'd believe me?

35
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:43,479
Like you said, it's been 15 years.

36
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:45,841
Now that you're back, I couldn't be happier,

37
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:48,010
because it's a miracle you woke up at all.

38
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:50,344
That's why I didn't bring it up before,

39
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,386
to spare you from the shock.

40
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,485
The last thing you need is someone digging
up the past when you're trying to recover.

41
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,786
But you remember everything.

42
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,210
So, if you want to catch the killer,

43
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:05,262
you don't have to do it alone.

44
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:07,417
Let us help you.

45
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:12,230
Hiromi's been coming here to visit you all these years,

46
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:14,008
and now he wants to be a doctor.

47
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:15,713
I became a lawyer,

48
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,709
and now I'm working with Mr. Sawada to catch the killer.

49
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,517
Hiromi and I are who we are because of you, Satoru.

50
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,578
You were a hero to us back then.

51
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:28,017
and we want to help you again, just like old times.

52
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:30,386
Just like we helped with Kayo.

53
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:35,091
You trusted me enough back
then, believed in me, you remember?

54
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:36,953
That's why I believed in you.

55
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,580
If someone believes in you, you're not alone.

56
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,632
And if I was in your situation,

57
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:46,310
I'd want someone to believe me.

58
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,104
<i>Airi.</i>

59
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,809
<i>I'm not alone.</i>

60
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:56,620
<i>I have friends I can count on.</i>

61
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,310
The killer is...

62
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:03,882
Yashiro.

63
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:06,282
I knew you remembered.

64
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:11,639
On the way up here, I tapped my
finger on your wheelchair a couple times.

65
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:14,890
I could tell you tried hard not to react.

66
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,718
Fifteen years ago,

67
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:22,634
you figured out what I was doing and ruined my plans.

68
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:33,161
But how?

69
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:37,983
A child isn't capable of such tings.

70
00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:44,694
It's as if you were psychic or something.

71
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:49,757
Yashiro! I know your future!

72
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:56,107
Let's have it. How did you know what I was thinking?

73
00:05:56,435 --> 00:05:59,299
What did you mean, you know my future?

74
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:01,730
What difference does it make?

75
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,923
Soon as I tell you, you'll kill me.

76
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:06,760
Oh, I know what you're up to.

77
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:11,153
You’ve got a phone in your pocket. Are you recording us?

78
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,386
Or is someone listening in?

79
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:15,240
Kenya, perhaps?

80
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:32,398
You have heard of the statute of limitations?

81
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:37,262
Even if I confessed, I can't be
tried for things I did 15 years ago.

82
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:40,719
And I haven't done anything wrong since then.

83
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:45,535
So you see, no matter what you
do, you can never get me, Satoru.

84
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:49,482
Oh, look, Kumi just sent you an email.

85
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:54,467
At 4:30, she'll get her daily IV.

86
00:06:55,362 --> 00:07:01,111
I put a muscle relaxant in her dose and made
sure your fingerprints were all over the bag.

87
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:06,797
That poor little girl who was afraid of her
operation will die peacefully now thanks to you.

88
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:11,668
And feeling guilty, I throw myself
off the roof, isn't that right?

89
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:19,541
There you go reading my mind again.

90
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,706
While that might be an amazing
skill, it won't save your life.

91
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:25,880
But you might save Kumi's if
you tell me what I want to know.

92
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:29,235
If I do, then what? How do I
know you won't kill her anyway?

93
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:31,790
I can't guarantee I won't, naturally.

94
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,153
But there is a possibility.

95
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:37,486
If you don't talk, there won't even be that.

96
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:43,812
I hate to say it. We're out of time now.

97
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:48,595
There was a 50‐50 chance you'd tell
me how you knew about me back then.

98
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:51,439
Oh, well, I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

99
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:56,683
I'm sure it was just a coincidence
when you screamed you knew my future.

100
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:58,301
That was just a bluff.

101
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,925
As for your mother...

102
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:07,389
we should send her an email,
let her know how sorry you are.

103
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:13,562
Hey, kiddo, I have to work the morning shift
tomorrow, so I'll see you in the afternoon?

104
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:16,886
I'll let him sleep.

105
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,580
Mom?

106
00:08:23,758 --> 00:08:24,907
I lied to you.

107
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:25,773
I got my...

108
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,039
Your memory back?

109
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:30,431
I know. It happened when Kayo came by.

110
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:31,974
<i>Yep, she's a witch.</i>

111
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,267
You're right, but how come you didn't
tell <i>her</i> not to bring up the past?

112
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:41,436
After Kenya and Hiromi stopped by,

113
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:45,357
I felt I made a mistake telling
them not to bring any of it up.

114
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:49,244
They couldn't say what they wanted, and that wasn't fair.

115
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:51,642
When Kayo showed up with her baby,

116
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,302
I didn't have the heart to ask her to do the same.

117
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:58,828
After waiting all this time for
you to wake up, who am I to stop her?

118
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:04,927
I got to see your face and talk to
you every day for the last 15 years.

119
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:08,499
Then when I heard you speak, your voice all crackly,

120
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:12,049
it finally hit me, you weren't a kid anymore.

121
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,562
I was happy...

122
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:16,339
My boy grew up.

123
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,568
Mom, I'm gonna take life head‐on.

124
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:28,709
What in the heck are you talking about?

125
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,761
Even when you were a little kid,

126
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:33,151
you always took it head‐on, remember?

127
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,028
Mm‐hmm.

128
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:43,497
Life is about filling up the void in yourself.

129
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,816
Indeed.

130
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:48,218
Whenever I taught sixth grade,
I always told the class that.

131
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:50,528
I remember what your face looked like.

132
00:09:50,743 --> 00:09:53,131
The day they took Kayo from her mom.

133
00:09:53,924 --> 00:09:57,766
The expression you had stuck
with me even after all these years.

134
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:02,685
A little while after I was born, my dad took off.

135
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,331
So I have no idea what he looks like.

136
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:11,501
But that day at Kayo's, you were the
dad I never had and I always wanted.

137
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:15,792
At that moment, you filled the void in me.

138
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:25,330
For the last 15 years, I've
been waiting for you to wake up.

139
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:30,777
When you slipped into your coma,
I lost the impulse that defined me,

140
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:32,797
the thing that gave my life meaning.

141
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:37,349
I've waited a long time. But now...

142
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:39,402
You're not alone anymore?

143
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,707
So, how are we gonna settle this?

144
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:46,574
Are you gonna turn yourself in or kill me?

145
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:47,939
Which is it?

146
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:50,760
It's already settled, actually.

147
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:52,985
You're right, I beat you.

148
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:56,547
I saved all of them from you.

149
00:10:56,993 --> 00:11:00,585
Kayo, Aya, Hiromi, Yuuki.

150
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,066
Even my mom, who you haven't killed yet.

151
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,778
Your mom? Why would I kill...

152
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:11,170
Hold on, are you saying you can I'm
just telling you what you wanted to know.

153
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:15,591
I could screw up all your
plans because I knew your future.

154
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:16,947
That's it.

155
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:20,045
That's how I saved them all.

156
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,651
That's why you weren't able to kill
anyone I was even remotely connected to.

157
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:27,606
Why you couldn't kill me.

158
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:28,961
Wrong.

159
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:31,394
I could have killed you anytime I wanted.

160
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:33,270
Now, for instance.

161
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:35,962
But for 15 years, you let me live.

162
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,367
Why did you do that?

163
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:40,878
Oh, I know, you needed me, didn't you?

164
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:43,510
I was your reason for living.

165
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:45,329
I was your hope.

166
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,995
I was the one who filled the void in you.

167
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,544
I beat you back then, Mr. Yashiro...

168
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:59,959
No! No! No!

169
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,745
Even now, I beat you!

170
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:29,177
You see what I mean? You can't kill me.

171
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:35,411
Fifteen years is a long time.

172
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:40,284
I was asleep, so for me it all went by in a flash,

173
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:43,443
but for you, it must have felt like forever.

174
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:15,452
You're still alive 'cause I'm around.

175
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:18,577
I make you feel alive.

176
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,536
I had to relive a part of my life over and over again,

177
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,473
the part where you killed some of my friends.

178
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:33,452
Funny, I should hate you, but I don't.

179
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:37,375
'Cause right now, I'm the only one who knows you.

180
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:39,959
The real you.

181
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:47,101
You're right.

182
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:53,016
Satoru.

183
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:57,910
I can't live...

184
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:08,183
You're right.

185
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:13,593
I can't go on living without you.

186
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,751
The police are charging him with attempted murder.

187
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,055
Is Kumi OK?

188
00:15:06,412 --> 00:15:08,731
Yeah, but I didn't tell her about him,

189
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:11,001
what with her surgery coming up and all.

190
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:11,937
Good.

191
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:15,577
"I believe in you." What a strange thing to say.

192
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:16,417
Huh?

193
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,494
Well, think about it.

194
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:21,395
If you really believe in someone,
chances are, they already know you do.

195
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:24,074
Saying it's kind of redundant, don't you think?

196
00:15:24,454 --> 00:15:27,662
Not if you mean it, and you want someone to know you do.

197
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:28,921
Yeah.

198
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:32,378
I guess we say it 'cause we want to give someone hope.

199
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,531
Hope to keep fighting.

200
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:37,863
To let them know they're not alone in the world, right?

201
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:54,261
<i>Now my life has a blank spot
between the ages of 11 and 25.</i>

202
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:59,608
<i>But in a weird way, I sort of treasure the time I lost.</i>

203
00:16:00,596 --> 00:16:05,321
<i>In a town without me, my friends lived for themselves</i>

204
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:06,520
<i>and for me.</i>

205
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:09,122
 Where is he?

206
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:10,946
Heroes always show up at the last minute.

207
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:11,717
Right?

208
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:12,958
Here's Satoru.

209
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:13,781
About time.

210
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,124
Where you been?

211
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:14,644
What's up, dude?

212
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:15,648
You're an idiot.

213
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:17,104
Are you ever on time?

214
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:18,612
<i>A town without me.</i>

215
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:20,654
<i>Time without me.</i>

216
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:26,535
<i>It's not my loss, it's my treasure.</i>

217
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,169
Whoa!

218
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:35,865
This is great!

219
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:37,247
Whenever you dig deep,

220
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:40,474
you always come up with the most amazing angles.

221
00:16:40,705 --> 00:16:43,318
Thanks. I guess I'll keep working on it, then.

222
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:46,261
That‐a‐boy. And sorry you had to schlep out here.

223
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,355
So, you heading out today?

224
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,098
Yep. Going back to Hokkaido for a break.

225
00:16:51,306 --> 00:16:52,655
There's some old friends I wanna see.

226
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:54,879
Well, have yourself a great time, then.

227
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,582
Safe travels and have a good weekend.

228
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,274
Oh, almost forgot.

229
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:02,901
Congrats on your anime getting the green light.

<i>In the first part of it,</i>

<i>Wonder Guy had to fight the bad guys by himself.</i>

246

<i>They'd knock him down again and again,</i>

<i>but he had the courage to get back up.</i>

248

<i>He'd say, "If I don't try, nothing will change,"</i>

<i>When it looked like the bad guy was gonna
