1
00:00:12,677 --> 00:00:13,470
<i>I'm scared...</i>

2
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:16,838
<i>scared to dig too deep into myself.</i>

3
00:00:25,738 --> 00:00:26,698
Hmm.

4
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,517
Your work's not bad.

5
00:00:29,204 --> 00:00:30,448
It's all right, but...

6
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:33,463
how do I put this?

7
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:36,224
Readers want to see what makes an artist tick.

8
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:38,670
You gotta dig deep down into yourself.

9
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:39,982
That's what art's all about.

10
00:00:41,283 --> 00:00:42,934
You say you're 29 now?

11
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:46,570
Yeah, our magazine might not be the best fit for you.

12
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:50,991
<i>The 2006 World Cup in Germany is only 26 days away.</i>

13
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:55,952
<i>"If only I'd done things different" is a
phrase that pops into my head every day.</i>

14
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,915
<i>I don't think about it too seriously, though.</i>

15
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,106
<i>It's just words.</i>

16
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:03,470
<i>As soon as they come to mind, they disappear.</i>

17
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:05,919
<i>I'm scared.</i>

18
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:08,918
<i>Scared to dig too deep into myself.</i>

19
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:20,222
Headin' out on a delivery.

20
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:20,695
OK.

21
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:21,892
Drive safe.

22
00:01:22,913 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm heading out on one, too!

23
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:27,031
OK. Drive safe out there.

24
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:31,559
Fujinuma, keep your stomach away from that pizza, ya hear?

25
00:01:31,907 --> 00:01:35,145
<i>Jeez, is that what kids are calling humor these days?</i>

26
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:36,351
I will.

27
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:44,184
<i>Fun Fact. She says that to me every day.</i>

28
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:46,711
<i>It's the only thing she says to me.</i>

29
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:50,707
<i>Far as I can tell, she's got zero feelings for me.</i>

30
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,990
<i>She's so weird. Too weird, too... young.</i>

31
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:55,701
<i>Hmm?</i>

32
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:07,204
<i>There it was.</i>

33
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:09,029
<i>It happened again.</i>

34
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:10,635
<i>Where is it?</i>

35
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:13,771
<i>Something's not right, but what?</i>

36
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:25,793
Hey, you in the truck! Pull over!

37
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:27,946
Yo, stop the truck!

38
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:39,272
Wait, that's Fujinuma. What's he doing?

39
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,835
<i>Goddamn it! I can't believe I'm doing this.</i>

40
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:51,570
<i>Why am I doing this?</i>

41
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:57,403
<i>Come on!</i>

42
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:04,688
Oh, my God!

43
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:05,331
You OK?

44
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:18,985
<i>What... what am I looking at?</i>

45
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,806
<i>Oh, it's my life flashing before my eyes.</i>

46
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,900
<i>This is what happens when you get
involved with other people's problems.</i>

47
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:34,594
<i>Oh, well, if I'm dead, I'm dead. Who cares?</i>

48
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:38,109
<i>Huh?</i>

49
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:44,605
You opened your eyes.

50
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,623
It's about time. You were out for two days.

51
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:50,290
Hmm?

52
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,453
Katagiri?

53
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:58,241
Hiya, sleeping beauty.

54
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:00,678
So, do you know who you are and how you got here?

55
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:04,080
Satoru Fujinuma, I'm 29.

56
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:07,486
I was chasing a truck and... I got hit.

57
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:11,612
Awesome! The doc said it's a
miracle you didn't get hurt more.

58
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:14,828
Do you want me to go call someone for you?

59
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:17,395
Like a friend or girlfriend or something?

60
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:21,449
Huh‐uh. There isn't anyone I want to bother telling.

61
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:25,363
Snip‐snip.

62
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:27,939
I don't get it. That supposed to be funny?

63
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,060
No, I'm just trying to cut
through that thick cocoon you're in.

64
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,763
You come off like the type who
doesn't open up or care about anyone.

65
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,369
The non‐laughing type.

66
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:38,817
But after the other day, I know better.

67
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:42,168
‐How so? ‐You saved that kid's life.

68
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:45,799
I was right there and I saw the whole
thing go down. And you know that truck driver?

69
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:49,014
Well, I heard he had a heart attack and died at the wheel.

70
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,970
I still don't get how you noticed that.

71
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,576
Lucky, I guess.

72
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:57,875
Yeah, well, the truck crashed into a warehouse and
amazingly you and the driver were the only casualties.

73
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,305
<i>What about the damages?</i>

74
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:03,437
I told our manager what happened, and he says
insurance will take care of the bike and the other car.

75
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,263
And then when you get better, come back to work.

76
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:08,549
That's good news.

77
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,338
Hah! I caught you smiling.

78
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:14,845
Hmm. How come you work at the pizza place?

79
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:16,496
It can't be for the money.

80
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:19,184
Wow! Now, there's a personal question.

81
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:20,877
Oh, sorry. Was it?

82
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,433
Mm‐hmm. In fact, you're the
first person to ever ask me that.

83
00:05:24,614 --> 00:05:27,248
I work there 'cause I have a dream.

84
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:30,250
‐That's cool. ‐Don't you wanna know what it is?

85
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:34,764
Well... aren't you worried it would jinx it for you?

86
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:38,296
Besides, if it didn't come true,
people would think you're a loser.

87
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:40,676
Oh, I'm not worried about telling anyone.

88
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:45,013
The more I talk about it, the
better the chance it'll come true.

89
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:46,417
That's what I think, anyway.

90
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,693
<i>Wait, where have I heard that before?</i>

91
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:55,587
You know what? I've decided I'm not
going to tell you about it after all.

92
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:58,185
It's not like we're dating or anything like that.

93
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:02,007
I'm going to let the nurse know
you're awake, and then I'm going home.

94
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:03,166
See ya.

95
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,402
<i>Man, she's weird.</i>

96
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,582
<i>I have a name for what happens to me: Revival.</i>

97
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:17,881
<i>It never benefits me, but I play along with it anyway.</i>

98
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:25,094
<i>When it happens,I go back in time
anywhere from one to five minutes.</i>

99
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,257
<i>Then it always happens before something bad goes down.</i>

100
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:33,548
<i>It's like someone's forcing
me to fix whatever's gone wrong,</i>

101
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,599
<i>so I start looking for the one
thing that seems, you know, off.</i>

102
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:39,799
<i>I've managed to stop a lot of tragedies.</i>

103
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,871
<i>So far.</i>

104
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:44,817
<i>Most of the time, I fix whatever bad's supposed to happen</i>

105
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:46,295
<i>and everything comes out OK.</i>

106
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,435
<i>But sometimes, like this time, things go bad for me.</i>

107
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,431
Oh. Hey there, Satoru.

108
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,759
Hey, Mom.

109
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:12,761
I went to the hospital, but you were out cold.

110
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:16,424
Sorry I didn't stay, but I got bored watching you sleep.

111
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,656
So, how is your head doing, kiddo?

112
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:21,280
It's fine.

113
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:22,420
Yeah, right.

114
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:25,093
They told me you had a head‐on with a car.

115
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,944
I'll be staying for a while.

116
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:31,288
Huh? What do you mean you're staying?

117
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,941
What do you think I mean? I want
to make sure my little guy's OK.

118
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:36,571
A car hit you, for Christ's sakes.

119
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:38,564
You don't have to. I said I'm fine.

120
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:41,173
Anyway, I only have one futon.

121
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:44,398
No worries. I can make do with a
sleeping bag I found in the closet.

122
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:46,316
A hotel's better.

123
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:48,091
Nah, a hotel's too expensive.

124
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:51,262
Oh, then I can pay you back for the hospital.

125
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:53,137
 So keep it and we'll call it my rent.

126
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:57,915
<i>She's 52 but looks the same as when I was a kid.</i>

127
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,531
<i>Same attitude too.</i>

128
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:03,516
Satoru, do I have to change trains to get to Ueno?

129
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:06,392
No, you don't. Wait, you wanna go sightseeing?

130
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,807
Well, I did come all the way from Hokkaido.

131
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:11,746
Besides, if I had to look at
your face all day, I'd get bored.

132
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:15,211
<i>You haven't even been here a whole day yet, Mom.</i>

133
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:16,871
Come on, let's eat.

134
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,349
I took over your futon and TV.

135
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:27,194
Sorry.

136
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:28,720
No, it's cool.

137
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:31,456
<i>This sucks. If I need to use the bathroom later,</i>

138
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:32,738
<i>I'll have to tiptoe around her.</i>

139
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:34,899
Hey, if you need to use the bathroom later,

140
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:36,725
don't worry about tiptoeing around me.

141
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,820
I'm gonna sleep like a log tonight.

142
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:40,516
<i>Witch.</i>

143
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:42,472
<i>And now for our next story.</i>

144
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:47,090
<i>Yesterday evening, we told you about a
first‐grade girl from Saitama who went missing.</i>

145
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,766
<i>Well, I'm happy to report that this morning,</i>

146
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:52,544
<i>she was found walking along a road in Yokohama.</i>

147
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:56,527
Hey, kiddo, you remember back then?

148
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:57,319
Back when?

149
00:08:57,702 --> 00:09:01,100
You were in fifth grade, and something
like this happened in the neighborhood.

150
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,133
Do you remember that?

151
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:05,411
<i>... an unemployed male from the West Ward of Yokohama...</i>

152
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,392
It's OK if you don't.

153
00:09:07,638 --> 00:09:12,398
Us parents got together and decided the best
thing was to try to get you kids to forget about it.

154
00:09:13,615 --> 00:09:16,959
You didn't know, but your life was in danger.

155
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:24,428
<i>When I was in fifth grade...</i>

156
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,701
<i>a kidnapping?</i>

157
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:39,938
<i>I remember... two classmates of mine went missing.</i>

158
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,363
<i>I was a shy kid,</i>

159
00:09:56,507 --> 00:09:59,444
<i>but then I met this local guy, Yuuki.</i>

160
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:00,930
<i>He'd play with me.</i>

161
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:04,745
<i>Yuuki wasn't his real name, but I called him that.</i>

162
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:07,511
<i>He'd always say, "Have courage."</i>

163
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:13,068
I b‐bet I know what the most
popular k‐kid in your class is like.

164
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:13,969
Huh?

165
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:17,665
For starters, I bet he's cheerful and good at sports.

166
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,809
He ain't afraid to speak up for
himself and he can be a goofball, too,

167
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:23,537
but not when it comes to something he's super into.

168
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,335
Wow!

169
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,229
No biggie. Popular folks are always like that.

170
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,231
You could be like that too if you want to.

171
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:33,236
Just follow that kid's lead.

172
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:37,208
And don't be shy, 'cause if you
have courage, you can do anything.

173
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:43,061
<i>Six months after my classmates disappeared,</i>

174
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:47,106
<i>Jun Shiratori was arrested for kidnapping and murder.</i>

175
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:48,917
<i>It was Yuuki!</i>

176
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:56,016
Why'd you have to buy so much?

177
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,430
You got those OK?

178
00:10:57,634 --> 00:11:00,683
I'm gonna make enough curry to last you a whole week.

179
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,980
Oh, honey. See? That's why I told you not to run.

180
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:10,282
Let's go and get you another one.

181
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:11,665
Oh!

182
00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:20,716
Hey, you OK back there?

183
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,568
Huh? Yeah.

184
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,077
You got those OK?

185
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:28,472
I'm gonna make enough curry to last you a whole week.

186
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,519
<i>Another Revival.</i>

187
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:36,314
Oh, honey. See? That's why I told you not to run.

188
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:38,770
Let's go and get you another one.

189
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:41,430
<i>Crap! Where is it?</i>

190
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:44,354
<i>Come on, man, find it, find it!</i>

191
00:11:45,194 --> 00:11:47,737
Hey, Mom, you notice anything weird?

192
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:48,455
Like what?

193
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:49,588
Look around.

194
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,661
Don't you feel like something's off here?

195
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:54,538
I don't know what you're talking about.

196
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,406
Wait, come to think of it,

197
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:00,045
you said the same thing when you were a little kid, too.

198
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:00,916
Did I?

199
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:03,428
Yeah. Remember the fire?

200
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:05,801
Oh!

201
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:10,641
<i>Was that guy looking at me?</i>

202
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:23,765
<i>Nothing happened.</i>

203
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,103
Hey, Fujinuma! Over here!

204
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:38,244
She's your mom? She looks so
young, I thought she was your sister.

205
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,747
Do you believe in witches?

206
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:40,837
I do now.

207
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:43,164
Is she mad at you or something?

208
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:44,319
No.

209
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,338
Um, Airi?

210
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,900
Would you like to come over and have some curry with us?

211
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:53,668
Yes, ma'am, I totally would. Thank you
for the invite. I'll even help you make it.

212
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:54,795
Seriously?

213
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,642
No way. You draw manga?

214
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:08,435
Does that shock you?

215
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,652
Hmm‐mm, not at all.

216
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:11,889
If it's on Wikitanica, it must be true.

217
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:13,022
You looked me up?

218
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:14,642
Of course. Why not?

219
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:17,808
OK, guys, dig in.

220
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,674
<i>Why? 'Cause I don't want you to.</i>

221
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,080
This smells yummy.

222
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:25,653
Wow! It is yummy!

223
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:26,654
You did help.

224
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:30,268
You know, for someone so young, you
really know your way around a curry.

225
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:32,355
So how long have you guys been dating?

226
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,824
Oh, no, it's not like that.

227
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:37,307
He's more like a friend.

228
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:40,273
A friend I have tons of respect for.

229
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:43,543
What? Too spicy for you?

230
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:45,742
No. It's great.

231
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,127
It was super nice meeting you.

232
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,205
I can give you a lift to the station.

233
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,578
It's already so late. You can spend the night if you want.

234
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,928
No, she can't, Mom. She's in high school.

235
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:02,932
Thanks for having me over, and for the ride, Satoru.

236
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:07,099
No worries, just keep an eye out for cops, OK?

237
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:08,124
Mm‐hmm.

238
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:16,147
Welcome home.

239
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:19,630
Let's get something straight, Mom.

240
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:22,939
She's not a potential wife for me, she's my coworker.

241
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:25,093
Oh, please, don't be so dense.

242
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:28,801
You heard her, she respects you.
You totally have a shot with her.

243
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,561
God, she was just being polite!

244
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,106
Don't go blowing a compliment out of proportion.

245
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:37,687
I'm not. She doesn't seem like the
type who'd say that unless she meant it.

246
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:39,497
‐Huh? ‐Oh, by the way,

247
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:42,225
your landlady came over asking about the rent.

248
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,328
Great.

249
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,440
Satoru, about this afternoon...

250
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:47,053
What?

251
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:48,959
In the market's parking lot?

252
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:51,462
Yeah? What's up? What about it?

253
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:54,031
I think you might have stopped
a kid from getting snatched.

254
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:55,340
You're kidding.

255
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,913
You're right, I am kidding.

256
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:11,983
<i>I remember.</i>

257
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:16,130
<i>She was a classmate of mine 18 years ago.</i>

258
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:19,023
<i>She was one of the kidnapper's victims.</i>

259
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,832
<i>Kayo Hinazuki.</i>

260
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,872
<i>We weren't friends or anything.</i>

261
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,416
<i>But I'd always see her alone at the park.</i>

262
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:36,810
<i>That night at the park was the last time I saw Kayo.</i>

263
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:40,745
No, you don't get it, I could have saved her!

264
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:44,952
If I'd have asked her to walk
home with me, she'd still be alive!

265
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:50,060
<i>Back then, all I wanted was to forget how guilty I felt.</i>

266
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:54,946
<i>I know my mom did everything she
could to erase it from my memory.</i>

267
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,709
Readers want to see what makes an artist tick.

268
00:15:57,851 --> 00:16:00,170
You gotta dig deep down into yourself.

269
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:01,813
That's what art's all about.

270
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,078
<i>His car had rental plates.</i>

271
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,219
<i>He was gonna kidnap her for sure.</i>

272
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,553
<i>Did he change his mind 'cause I saw him?</i>

273
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:15,813
<i>He turned away like he was hiding his face.</i>

274
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,170
<i>He definitely knew me.</i>

275
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:21,609
<i>And I know I've seen those eyes somewhere.</i>

276
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:26,137
<i>But on who? And where? When?</i>

277
00:16:32,476 --> 00:16:35,388
<i>That's it! I remember now.</i>

278
00:16:36,523 --> 00:16:40,131
<i>Oh, my God, Shiratori's not the killer after all.</i>

279
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:49,602
Hey, it's Sachiko.

280
00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:51,690
Yeah, it's been a while.

281
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:58,220
<i>The statute of limitations on
those murders ran out a while ago,</i>

282
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:03,995
<i>and God knows how many kids he must
have killed over the past 18 years.</i>

283
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:09,532
<i>The case is anything but closed.</i>

284
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,330
<i>I have to talk to Satoru.</i>

285
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,636
<i>The time's come to set him
straight on what happened back then.</i>

286
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:21,359
Satoru?

287
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:39,651
<i>I was right.</i>

288
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:42,089
<i>Have to call Satoru...</i>

289
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,840
<i>tell him to stay away...</i>

290
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:47,984
<i>tell him... sorry.</i>

291
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,463
I know I could have saved Kayo's life.

292
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:52,613
Yuuki didn't kill her, I know he didn't!

293
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,712
He didn't do it, Mom! He didn't, he didn't!

294
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:59,289
<i>I should have believed you back then.</i>

295
00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:02,069
<i>The police didn't.</i>

296
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:04,548
<i>But I should have.</i>

297
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:06,505
<i>I should have.</i>

298
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:14,025
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

299
00:18:14,898 --> 00:18:16,933
<i>Satoru.</i>

300
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,493
I'm heading home now. See y'all tomorrow.

301
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:31,573
Nice hustle today.

302
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:32,490
See ya tomorrow.

303
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:33,162
Good night.

304
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,795
Wait, before you go...

305
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,403
Huh?

306
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:37,970
I bet I can guess what you had for breakfast today.

307
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,790
What?

308
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:39,686
Curry!

309
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:41,097
You're right.

310
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:42,039
Yes!

311
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:44,503
<i>Obviously. Mom made a ton of it.</i>

312
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:48,230
Ooh, hey, could you ask your
mom to cook some more of her curry?

313
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:50,991
I've never tasted anything so amazing.

314
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:53,613
Yeah, I'll let her know. Later.

315
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:29,034
Jeez.

316
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:31,993
What a slob.

317
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:37,393
Hey, Mom. This isn't Hokkaido, it's the city.

318
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:39,691
You can't just leave the door open like...

319
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:48,583
Hey.

320
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:52,370
Mom? Come on, cut it out.

321
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:55,326
This isn't funny. Come on, say something.

322
00:19:55,947 --> 00:19:58,281
Get up. Mom!

323
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:02,624
I brought back your dish, Satoru.

324
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:04,342
Your mom's curry was...

325
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,993
No, wait!

326
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,083
There was blood all over his hands!

327
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:19,325
Are you Satoru Fujinuma? You're gonna have to...

328
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,853
<i>What the hell? No.</i>

329
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,024
<i>It wasn't me. I didn't do it.</i>

330
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,959
<i>I didn't kill her!</i>

331
00:20:30,393 --> 00:20:31,730
Hey, don't even...

332
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:44,325
<i>Wait. Is this Revival?</i>

333
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:47,673
<i>But... where did I end up?</i>

334
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,691
<i>I've seen this before, but...</i>

335
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:52,422
<i>when?</i>

336
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,812
Hurry up, Satoru, you're gonna be late!

337
00:20:59,837 --> 00:21:01,235
<i>I know that kid.</i>

338
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:03,502
<i>When is this?</i>

339
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:19,553
1988?
