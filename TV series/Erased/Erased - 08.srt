1
00:00:11,384 --> 00:00:13,893
<i>Is that Satoru?</i>

2
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:18,334
<i>No, it's not.</i>

3
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:22,903
<i>Who is that?</i>

4
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:44,008
You're up.

5
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:45,994
Good morning.

6
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:48,280
Why did you get up so early?

7
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:50,371
Isn't it obvious?

8
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:51,833
I'm making breakfast.

9
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:55,019
You are heading off to school early again, aren't you?

10
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:56,070
Yeah.

11
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:58,515
It looks good.

12
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,188
Slow down, kiddo. You'll make yourself sick.

13
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:07,950
Can I ask you something, Satoru?

14
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:09,135
Mm‐hmm.

15
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:12,571
Who are you meeting this early in the morning?

16
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:14,674
Can't tell.

17
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:18,366
You're not doing anything bad, are you?

18
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:21,180
Course not.

19
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,906
OK, then.

20
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,834
See you later, Mom.

21
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:28,524
Hold it.

22
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,680
Take this, too. It's a little something extra.

23
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:34,109
You know, if you get hungry before lunch.

24
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:35,683
Right.

25
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:37,694
Thanks a bunch, Mom.

26
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:55,016
It's me. Morning.

27
00:03:57,706 --> 00:03:59,439
Good morning, Satoru.

28
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,168
I brought you some breakfast.

29
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:03,725
Thanks, but did you eat anything yet?

30
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,794
Yep. This is all yours.

31
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:10,167
Wow! It looks yummy.

32
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,630
How are you doing?

33
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:15,438
You must be bored. Too bad this place doesn't have a TV.

34
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:18,884
It's OK. I'm not as bored as you think.

35
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:21,124
Hiromi brought a ton of books yesterday.

36
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:24,645
That's good. Think you can
hold out for another couple days?

37
00:04:24,912 --> 00:04:25,719
Mm‐hmm.

38
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:30,965
That was so good.

39
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:34,212
See ya later.

40
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:34,760
Mm‐hmm.

41
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,891
<i>Crap! School's about to start at Izumi Elementary.</i>

42
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:00,730
<i>I was at the bus for too long.</i>

43
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:05,035
This grad ceremony's gonna suck.

44
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,929
I have to give the speech.

45
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,411
Please, you'll be great.

46
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:11,472
Oh, you're better at giving speeches than me, Aya.

47
00:05:11,497 --> 00:05:14,410
Not even, Saki. It'll be fine, you'll see.

48
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:19,302
Just have a little courage.

49
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,895
I guess Kayo's absent... again.

50
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,370
You're her friend. Do you know what's up with her?

51
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,152
No. No one was home when I went by there.

52
00:05:32,438 --> 00:05:35,280
Where is she? I mean, if she
was sick, we would have heard.

53
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:39,161
Yeah, but there's been no word yet, from her mom, anyway.

54
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:42,162
I'm starting to get a bad feeling, real bad.

55
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:49,711
Come on, I'm sure she'll show up
sooner or later like she always does.

56
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:51,306
So how about we get started?

57
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:55,496
Really?

58
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:58,045
No one was there this morning either, huh?

59
00:05:58,571 --> 00:05:59,571
Are you worried?

60
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:00,785
Mm‐hmm.

61
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:03,325
You don't look like you're all that worried.

62
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,401
I'm just trying to stay calm.

63
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,863
Like you always say, panicking never helps anyone.

64
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:10,073
You're right.

65
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:14,221
I tried calling Kayo's yesterday
and today, but there's no answer.

66
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:17,623
Also, I tried calling the place where her mother works.

67
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:19,179
They told me she hasn't been in.

68
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:23,599
Well, then call the CPS people or the police!

69
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:26,022
The police, huh? I don't know.

70
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:29,848
I'd hate to open a can of
worms, for someone else, that is.

71
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,515
I called CPS yesterday, though.
They'll visit her house today.

72
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:39,593
And I'm going to meet them.

73
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:43,148
I'm pretty sure if we all show up
there, we'll get to the bottom of things.

74
00:06:43,982 --> 00:06:47,457
It's like I always say in class:
where there's a will, there's a way.

75
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:49,525
You're the best!

76
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:56,444
<i>All right. Yashiro was on it.</i>

77
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,836
Ms. Hinazuki, we're with Child Protective Services.

78
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:07,328
Is she even home?

79
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:10,500
Well, all the lights are on, so someone has to be.

80
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,637
Why don't we have a look around the back?

81
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,696
Ms. Hinazuki are you home?

82
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,015
Kayo?

83
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:24,568
I'm coming in.

84
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:26,074
You can't just walk in!

85
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:28,813
Don't worry. If anyone complains, I'll take the blame.

86
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:33,372
The girl's been missing for
three days now. It's worth a shot.

87
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:45,988
A stove and the lights are on.

88
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,379
There’s a half‐eaten dinner on the coffee table.

89
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:52,272
I don't see Kayo's coat anywhere.

90
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:56,131
By the looks of it, her mom was just here a minute ago.

91
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,302
She left in a hurry.

92
00:07:57,581 --> 00:07:59,116
I bet she saw us pull up.

93
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:01,766
By the time we got to the door, she was out the back.

94
00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:05,688
Damn it, I was hoping we could
take custody of the girl tonight.

95
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:08,917
Look, her mother can't stay out in this cold all night.

96
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:11,294
As soon as we leave, I'm sure she'll come back.

97
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:12,978
We can try again tomorrow morning.

98
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,689
I'm worried about Kayo's safety, though.

99
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:19,143
We could get the police to put an APB out on the mom.

100
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:22,175
Huh‐uh. I have a feeling Kayo's safe.

101
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:24,791
In fact, I'm positive she is.

102
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:26,987
OK, we'll take your word for it.

103
00:08:27,122 --> 00:08:30,343
We'll leave for now, give the
mother a chance to calm down.

104
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:35,776
Mr. Yashiro and Child Protective
Services were just at your house.

105
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:38,853
They were looking for your mom, but she wasn't there.

106
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,722
By tomorrow, all of this might be over.

107
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,539
Kayo, they said they'd take you away from her.

108
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,727
That's OK. I'd be way happier without her.

109
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:52,065
<i>We knew if they took her away from her mom,</i>

110
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:54,360
<i>they'd be taking her away from us, too.</i>

111
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:58,000
It'll be hard to go, but I'll be fine.

112
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,238
Whenever I think of you guys,

113
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:02,060
I'll remember all the fun we had.

114
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:06,988
Satoru, I know it's a little late, but...

115
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:09,973
I finished your birthday present.

116
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,565
Here you go.

117
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,143
<i>I'll give you your present tomorrow, promise.</i>

118
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,485
Thank you.

119
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,920
<i>It feels like...</i>

120
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:35,520
<i>I don't know.</i>

121
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,621
<i>Like I've been waiting for this forever.</i>

122
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:44,730
It doesn't take much to make you tear up, huh?

123
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:46,537
Wh‐What?

124
00:09:47,697 --> 00:09:50,711
Oh, hey, Satoru? Can you spend the night?

125
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:53,139
That’s totally gutsy!

126
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:54,769
Dorks.

127
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,639
Last night someone came in while I was sleeping.

128
00:09:58,183 --> 00:09:59,573
He just walked in.

129
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,722
I don't think he knew I was here.

130
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,929
But it scared me.

131
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:07,601
Maybe it was a security guard or a janitor.

132
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:09,302
It could have been anyone.

133
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:13,315
Some pervy kid stashing his porn, who knows?

134
00:10:13,585 --> 00:10:14,854
It was a grown‐up.

135
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:18,910
Whoever it was was mad. He kicked that box super hard.

136
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:21,089
Let's open it.

137
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:24,338
I hope it's nothing worse than porn.

138
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:39,208
What's that for?

139
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:42,063
<i>I knew.</i>

140
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:45,138
<i>I knew right away what all that stuff was for.</i>

141
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:51,427
<i>Then it hit me. This old bus we were
in was out behind Izumi Elementary,</i>

142
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:56,047
<i>the school where I and Nakanishi,
the killer's next victim, went.</i>

143
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,319
<i>We hadn't escaped the loop of kidnappings and murders yet.</i>

144
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:11,231
<i>March the 2nd.</i>

145
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:13,641
<i>Sometime after 10 that night,</i>

146
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:16,666
<i>Kayo disappeared from the shed behind her house.</i>

147
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:21,166
<i>Tracks found around the shed
were from a pair of rubber boots.</i>

148
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,410
<i>They matched a pair Yuuki owned.</i>

149
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:28,526
<i>The killer put Kayo in a walk‐in
freezer and sprayed water on her,</i>

150
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:30,854
<i>to make her freeze to death faster.</i>

151
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:36,381
<i>Then the killer took her body
back to the shed before dawn.</i>

152
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:41,785
<i>We can't stay here.</i>

153
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,756
<i>This bus is at the center of the killer's routine.</i>

154
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,984
It's not safe here.

155
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:54,641
No. No, it's not.

156
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:57,588
Our plan was to have someone find Kayo here,

157
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:01,599
but now, after seeing this crap, we'd better move her.

158
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:04,916
Mm‐hmm. We don't want some creep to find her.

159
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:08,424
Well, I hope you have a plan B.

160
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,818
I do.

161
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:13,732
Awesome. OK. Let's clear out.

162
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,100
<i>Remember what that footprint looks like.</i>

163
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:24,825
<i>Huh?</i>

164
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:27,840
<i>What's all that black stuff?</i>

165
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:32,865
<i>Charcoal and a stove.</i>

166
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,298
<i>Was the killer gonna use this to...</i>

167
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,646
No! No!

168
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:48,080
Satoru. Flipping out isn't going to help.

169
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:50,765
Yeah, you're right.

170
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,717
<i>I gotta keep a clear head.</i>

171
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:58,309
All right, let's get going.

172
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:00,195
It was such a cool hideout.

173
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:02,993
Right, but not if some weirdo's using it, too.

174
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:03,858
Yeah.

175
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,924
<i>However we do it,</i>

176
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:09,565
<i>we need to make damn sure Kayo
stays out of the killer's range.</i>

177
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:13,445
<i>But now, with Child Protective Services on the case,</i>

178
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:15,454
<i>the future has to change.</i>

179
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:18,910
<i>It's got to.</i>

180
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,910
Wait, this is plan B?

181
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,051
Mm‐hmm. Simple, huh?

182
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,940
There's just one last hurdle.

183
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:30,600
It would have saved us a lot
of hassle if you'd thought of...

184
00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:31,656
I'm home.

185
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:34,518
It's about time.

186
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,364
Um, uh... hello.

187
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:41,493
Hello.

188
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:44,802
All right, what's going on?

189
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:52,612
I'm helping a friend in trouble, that's what.

190
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:05,012
Way to go, guys. Good job.

191
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:07,992
I was hoping you'd be OK with this.

192
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:10,504
For a sec, I thought you were gonna kick my butt.

193
00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:12,462
<i>I did it again.</i>

194
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:15,111
Now, why on earth would you think that?

195
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:17,282
This is exactly what friends are for.

196
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:24,186
What ya cookin'? I could smell it when I came in.

197
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:27,363
Oh, nothing much. Just a big, fat pot of curry is all.

198
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:30,480
I had a feeling you'd be bringing
over a couple of friends tonight.

199
00:14:30,873 --> 00:14:32,649
<i>My mom can read me like a book.</i>

200
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:35,608
Don't just stand there, pull up a chair.

201
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,952
Would you like some curry?

202
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:38,528
Yes, please.

203
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:39,843
It smells yummy.

204
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,430
It's good I brought everyone 'cause you made a ton.

205
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,897
If you didn't, you'd be eating
curry for the rest of the month.

206
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:52,548
Um, Ms. Fujinuma.

207
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:56,073
I brought this back. It was delicious.

208
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:02,050
Well, my job's done for the night.

209
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:04,682
Have fun washing the dishes, kiddo.

210
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,979
Thanks, Mom.

211
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:07,424
See you later.

212
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,158
Bye‐bye.

213
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:09,334
Later, guys.

214
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,040
Mr. Yashiro? This is Satoru Fujinuma's mom.

215
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,066
Actually, I do.

216
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:21,100
Satoru just brought Kayo back to my place and she's OK.

217
00:15:21,195 --> 00:15:23,631
Ah, what a relief. That's good to hear.

218
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:25,533
I knew they were in this together.

219
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:30,033
Yeah, it's great, but what happens to her now?

220
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:32,310
Will she be put in foster care?

221
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,502
<i>Good question.</i>

222
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:37,442
<i>You know, I've been thinking
about it and I might have an idea.</i>

223
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:41,954
No. We tried to, but her mother wasn't home.

224
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,751
Maybe you can help. But only if you don't mind.

225
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,076
Seven a. m.?

226
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:50,259
OK, see you tomorrow.

227
00:15:52,923 --> 00:15:55,227
Hey, Kayo, you want to spend the night?

228
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,182
Mm‐hmm.

229
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:00,832
Hello?

230
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:02,648
I'm sorry to call so late.

231
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:06,277
I'm Gaku Yashiro, a teacher at Mikoto Elementary.

232
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:08,867
I need to talk to you about Kayo.

233
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:12,500
He's called Wonder Guy. Isn't he cool?

234
00:16:13,954 --> 00:16:17,161
OK, guys, bath time. Who wants to go first?

235
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:19,197
I'll go after you.

236
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:23,970
You know what, how about we go together?

237
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:33,267
Hey, Kayo, come here and let me wash your hair.

238
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,135
Um, no, thank you. I can do it.

239
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,049
It's OK, I want to.

240
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,650
How are we doing, miss? Are we feeling fabulous yet?

241
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:49,035
And now it's time for...

242
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:51,762
Tickle‐tickle‐tickle‐tickle!

243
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:55,353
And more tickles!

244
00:16:56,396 --> 00:16:58,898
And more, and more!

245
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,226
<i>Hello! You're 29.</i>

246
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,469
We better dry your hair or you're gonna catch a cold.

247
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:18,393
Um, you guys, like, have a good bath?

248
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,796
Yeah. It was lots of fun.

249
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,120
That's good.

250
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:26,961
Wait... those your pajamas?

251
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:29,031
Now they are. I bought them for her.

252
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:30,798
<i>Witch!</i>

253
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:33,360
These are fresh and ready to go.

254
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,466
They're super soft.

255
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:35,419
Thank you.

256
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:37,825
Have you done this before?

257
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:39,730
You've gotta pull your end tight.

258
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:42,041
This totally reminds me,

259
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:44,500
the class took a trip to Hakodate

260
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:46,947
and the view from the top of the mountain was rad.

261
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:49,791
What? You've never been to Hakodate.

262
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:50,641
Crap!

263
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:53,304
Must have been a photo I saw.

264
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:55,470
O... K.

265
00:17:55,922 --> 00:17:57,250
You ready for lights‐out?

266
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:58,427
Yes.

267
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,277
What's so funny?

268
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,284
My house doesn't have a nightlight.

269
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:07,122
Oh, yeah? I can turn it off if you want.

270
00:18:07,357 --> 00:18:09,464
Uh‐uh. It's fine like this.

271
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:11,521
Why don't we leave it on tonight?

272
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,563
You got it.

273
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:15,167
Thanks, Satoru.

274
00:18:17,036 --> 00:18:18,132
Good night, guys.

275
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:19,379
 Good night, Mom.

276
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,687
I'm not in the way here, am I?

277
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,414
Yep.

278
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:36,524
No, of course not!

279
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:38,994
Oh, there I go again...

280
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:41,637
What'd you do that for?

281
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:41,974
Oops.

282
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:43,300
I meant to do this. And this!

283
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:45,114
Ow! Stop it!

284
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,233
Never!

285
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:48,203
You're an idiot.

286
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:07,544
Good morning.

287
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,917
Morning.

288
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,188
You awake?

289
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:15,928
If you are, shake a leg. Breakfast is gonna get cold.

290
00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:17,405
OK.

291
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,567
I'm starving.

292
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,489
Wait, no curry?

293
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:32,072
That's your dinner, for the next month.

294
00:19:32,257 --> 00:19:34,899
What? There can't be that much left.

295
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:37,505
You'll just have to invite everyone over again.

296
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:56,006
Goddamn little...

297
00:21:00,753 --> 00:21:01,564
Mom?

298
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:11,565
Kayo, you little shit. Where the hell have you been?!

299
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:12,586
I'll show...

300
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,937
I should have known.
