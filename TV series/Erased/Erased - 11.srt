1
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:05,695
<i>I'd like to tell you a little story.</i>

2
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:10,020
<i>It happened a long time ago,
when I was in the sixth grade.</i>

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,746
<i>One day at school, a girl
brought a box of hamsters to class.</i>

4
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:16,831
<i>And she was very upset.</i>

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,781
<i>She said she started with two,
and before she knew it, they'd bred.</i>

6
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:23,763
<i>Now she had more than she could take care of.</i>

7
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,309
<i>I happily took them for her.</i>

8
00:00:26,438 --> 00:00:28,009
<i>When I got home that day,</i>

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,092
<i>I filled a big wine jug with water.</i>

10
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:34,040
<i>Then I dropped the hamsters in one by one.</i>

11
00:00:34,306 --> 00:00:36,697
<i>When I checked on them three hours later,</i>

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,297
<i>I couldn’t believe my eyes.</i>

13
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:42,095
<i>One hamster was still alive,</i>

14
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,890
<i>standing atop the drowned corpse of one of its siblings.</i>

15
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:48,761
<i>And I was thrilled.</i>

16
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:52,722
<i>I named it Spice and decided to keep it for my pet.</i>

17
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:58,659
<i>Why? Because when I saw it in the jug, it
reminded me of a story called "The Spider's Thread."</i>

18
00:00:58,909 --> 00:00:59,909
<i>Do you know it?</i>

19
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:02,641
<i>It's about a sinner in Hell named Kandata</i>

20
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:06,019
<i>who, while alive, once spared a spider's life.</i>

21
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:08,179
<i>Moved by this act of compassion,</i>

22
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,929
<i>the Buddha lowered a spider's
thread from paradise down to him.</i>

23
00:01:12,778 --> 00:01:15,368
<i>Kandata started climbing it, and half way up,</i>

24
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:17,967
<i>he saw his fellow sinners climbing after him.</i>

25
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:20,946
<i>He tried to knock them off, and then...</i>

26
00:01:22,636 --> 00:01:24,129
<i>the thread snapped,</i>

27
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:27,276
<i>sending Kandata back down to Hell.</i>

28
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:32,605
<i>Now, what I'm about to tell you
next might sound hard to believe,</i>

29
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:36,186
<i>but if anyone could understand, it would be you.</i>

30
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:38,977
<i>Ever since I met Spice,</i>

31
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:42,074
<i>I could see the spider's thread on people.</i>

32
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:46,055
<i>Whomever it touched, I was compelled to kill.</i>

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,523
<i>But then a boy came along who disrupted my duties.</i>

34
00:01:50,815 --> 00:01:55,597
<i>And wouldn't you know it, I saw
the spider's thread attached to him.</i>

35
00:01:57,064 --> 00:01:58,926
Yashiro!

36
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:01,993
I know your future!

37
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:06,267
<i>I tried to kill the boy, but he didn't die.</i>

38
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,509
<i>So I nicknamed him Spice,</i>

39
00:02:09,534 --> 00:02:11,662
<i>and I kept a close eye on him.</i>

40
00:02:13,188 --> 00:02:16,158
<i>That boy was you, Satoru!</i>

41
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:53,414
That'll be 987 yen, please.

42
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,069
Thanks for shopping with us.

43
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:48,099
<i>Satoru mentioned something to me once about the train.</i>

44
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:54,215
Remember, you don't have to change trains to go to Ueno.

45
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:56,880
<i>He was right.</i>

46
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:59,794
<i>But why did he point that out to me?</i>

47
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:54,871
Good morning, kiddo. Sleep well?

48
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:07,584
Huh. He's in great shape for someone
who's been in a coma for 15 years.

49
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:10,867
Fifteen years.

50
00:06:11,844 --> 00:06:13,845
Wow! Talking already.

51
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,722
It won't be long before you can start physical therapy.

52
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:22,452
<i>I heard that for the past 15 years,</i>

53
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:26,655
<i>mom spent four hours a day giving
every joint in my body a workout.</i>

54
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:34,912
<i>About three years ago, she got one of those EMS monitor
thingies to let her know when I was conscious again.</i>

55
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:39,408
<i>She got another thing to stimulate my muscles.</i>

56
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:43,973
<i>When I was in fifth grade, I stood about 4½ feet tall.</i>

57
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,709
<i>I'm 5'5" now.</i>

58
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:51,608
<i>Dr. Kitamura said, if it wasn't for my mom,</i>

59
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:54,313
<i>I wouldn't be in as good a shape as I am.</i>

60
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,377
This might be difficult but I think you're ready for it.

61
00:06:58,514 --> 00:07:00,379
Try to answer my next question.

62
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:03,279
What's the last thing you can remember,

63
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,653
before you lost consciousness, that is?

64
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,751
OK. I remember I was...

65
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:16,872
Oh...

66
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,204
Wait.

67
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:20,477
Damn it.

68
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:26,702
<i>It's like these memories, whatever they are,</i>

69
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,322
<i>are locked behind a door.</i>

70
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,804
That's you.

71
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,546
Well, aren't you surprised?

72
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:37,996
Hmm?

73
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:39,891
Your face has changed a lot.

74
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:42,284
The last time you saw it, you were 11.

75
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,934
Well, I guess since your memories are scrambled,

76
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:48,619
it'll take a while before this all
sinks in. It's just a matter of time.

77
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:51,995
<i>That day, I thought maybe the doc was right.</i>

78
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,944
<i>I should have felt weird waking up in this time.</i>

79
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:56,390
<i>But I didn't.</i>

80
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:58,947
<i>But the thing is, I should have.</i>

81
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:04,290
<i>Patience, heart rate monitor, sense of loss, arbitration.</i>

82
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:07,226
<i>I knew those words.</i>

83
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:09,167
<i>But when did I learn them?</i>

84
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:12,411
<i>What the heck happened to me?</i>

85
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:18,616
Good morning, Satoru.

86
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,186
Good morning, Mom.

87
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:24,014
Guess what? You've got some visitors.

88
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,135
Look who decided to wake up.

89
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,010
You look great. How are you feeling?

90
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:32,096
<i>I remember Kenya and Hiromi.</i>

91
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,547
<i>They were two of my very best friends.</i>

92
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:38,235
<i>Kenya's a lawyer now and Hiromi's a doctor.</i>

93
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,067
<i>We talked for hours about this and that.</i>

94
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:46,993
<i>Now and then I got the feeling Kenya
wanted to ask me something, but he didn't.</i>

95
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:49,111
<i>Maybe Mom told him not to.</i>

96
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:52,355
<i>We just talked about trivial things.</i>

97
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,201
See ya later.

98
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:56,417
Take it easy.

99
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:01,553
<i>There was lots of stuff I wanted to ask the guys.</i>

100
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:06,642
<i>But Mom being Mom, I bet she wanted to
avoid that to spare me from the shock.</i>

101
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:11,477
<i>For 15 years, she dedicated herself to keeping me alive,</i>

102
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:13,633
<i>hoping I'd wake up one day.</i>

103
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,038
<i>She doesn't want me to remember what happened.</i>

104
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:19,270
<i>It's probably a good thing I don't.</i>

105
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:29,404
I got ya.

106
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,139
We'll try it again tomorrow, OK?

107
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:41,388
Satoru?

108
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:05,282
Congratulations, Kayo.

109
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:11,386
Yeah, I'm married. My last name is Sugita.

110
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:14,077
No way. So Hiromi's a dad now?

111
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:14,866
Mm‐hmm.

112
00:10:14,943 --> 00:10:18,536
I got the feeling he wanted to tell
me something important: now I know what.

113
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,982
He looks just like him. He's
even got the same long eyelashes.

114
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:25,515
Yep. He's just like his daddy.

115
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:27,195
We named him Mirai.

116
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:29,970
That's a cool name. It means "the future."

117
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,603
You know, we felt weird about getting together.

118
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:39,109
It didn't seem right for us to be happy.

119
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:44,336
We're alive because of what you did
and because of us, you ended up in a coma.

120
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:45,951
It felt like...

121
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:49,310
like we were leaving you behind, I guess.

122
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,780
Kayo, whatever happened to me happened.

123
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,152
So don't go blaming yourself about it.

124
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,658
I don't have any regrets, 'cause in the end,

125
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:00,859
I'm here 'cause it's where I'm supposed to be.

126
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:06,610
After being gone for 15 years,
you're still a smooth talker.

127
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:08,105
Oh, I am?

128
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:11,175
I get what you're saying, Satoru,

129
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:14,704
but before you came along, I
thought I'd always be alone in life.

130
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:17,236
And here I am with my very own family.

131
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:20,515
You made that possible, so thank you.

132
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:24,092
<i>She said... "thank you."</i>

133
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,238
<i>But I can't remember what for.</i>

134
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,663
Uh‐oh, someone's hungry.

135
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:34,069
OK, OK.

136
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,649
Satoru, are you OK?

137
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:46,467
Yeah.

138
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:48,824
I shouldn’t have sprung all this on you.

139
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:50,455
It's a lot to process.

140
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:53,320
Well, we'll see you later.

141
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:55,120
Yeah, see you later.

142
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:14,565
Hey, kiddo, you have a good workout today?

143
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:18,300
Uh‐huh. Kayo came by a little while ago.

144
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:20,669
Mm. I bumped into her outside.

145
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:22,689
She's got the cutest baby.

146
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:27,777
Listen, Mom?

147
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:29,418
What's up?

148
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:32,638
Not those assholes again.

149
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:34,608
What?

150
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:38,164
Paparazzi from the gossip rags looking for a story.

151
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,962
Waking up after 15 years made you a celebrity.

152
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:42,082
Oh.

153
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:43,225
Screw 'em.

154
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,363
Anyway, you wanted to tell me something?

155
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:48,072
No. It wasn't important.

156
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:50,486
Come in.

157
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:54,860
How are we doing?

158
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:56,480
So far, so good, doc.

159
00:12:57,662 --> 00:12:58,811
I was wondering...

160
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:01,536
when do you think I'll be able to walk again?

161
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,433
I don't know. It depends on you.

162
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:07,409
If it's OK, I'd like to do twice as much rehab.

163
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:08,554
Why?

164
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,276
I wanna walk outside again.

165
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:13,441
Uh, sure, I'll see what I can do.

166
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:15,205
Sorry, I have to take this.

167
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:18,196
Yes, Director. Yes, sir.

168
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:20,677
He's doing great, actually.

169
00:13:21,362 --> 00:13:23,547
He should get all his memoires back any time now.

170
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:26,379
I'm sorry, no.

171
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:29,470
Like I told you the other day,
I'm not comfortable with that.

172
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:33,212
With all due respect, he's my patient, not a guinea pig...

173
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:36,766
I have to go.

174
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,292
You're doing great, Satoru.

175
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,355
Your arms and legs have gotten a lot stronger.

176
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:09,974
Congratulations.

177
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:10,952
Way to go!

178
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:12,915
You walked the whole way without our help.

179
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,288
Awesome job!

180
00:14:27,123 --> 00:14:30,377
Hey, Satoru, Kenya stopped by for a little visit.

181
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:32,017
Hi, Kenya.

182
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:34,034
I hope it's OK I stopped by.

183
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,131
Are you kidding? Of course it is.

184
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:37,521
Hello, Satoru.

185
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,520
Have we met before?

186
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:43,397
Matter of fact, we have.

187
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:47,978
Your mom and I used to work together
back before you started elementary school.

188
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:49,037
Oh.

189
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,799
Come on, you honestly think he'd remember you?

190
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,863
That was like 20 years ago now.

191
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:00,590
All right, take care, buddy.

192
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,264
See you later.

193
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:08,828
We've waited 15 years. No reason to get impatient.

194
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:10,542
We should go easy on him.

195
00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:11,544
Yeah.

196
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:22,543
Hi, Kumi.

197
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:29,082
Ah, so the surgery's in two weeks, huh?

198
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:32,706
They're gonna put some of my
big sister's bone marrow in me.

199
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:35,000
They said it will cure me.

200
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:38,819
But even so, I'm scared.

201
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:45,073
<i>You were asleep for 15 years?!</i>

202
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,887
I know you've been at this hospital for a while.

203
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:49,535
What's it been, like three months now?

204
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:50,848
Mm‐hmm.

205
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:54,831
It's gonna be hard to stay motivated
in physical therapy once you leave.

206
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,445
You’re the reason I was working so hard.

207
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,410
Courage...

208
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:12,345
Whenever I need courage, here's what I do.

209
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,040
I picture someone I really care about smiling.

210
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,770
It only works if I smile back, though.

211
00:16:22,262 --> 00:16:24,150
"The time‐traveling pedo.

212
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:26,415
He wakes up an adult, but he's still a kid at heart.

213
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,276
Still hot for little girls.

214
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:31,070
Soon he'll be released. Hide your children."

215
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:31,963
What do you think?

216
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:33,078
Good angle.

217
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:38,178
Taking photos of a civilian without their permission.

218
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:40,372
Slander, trespassing.

219
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:43,459
If I see you again, I'll call the police.

220
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:45,423
Get out of here. Now.

221
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:50,394
They were some of the prettiest flowers I'd ever seen.

222
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:52,808
Oh, hello, Mr. Nishizono.

223
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,672
Hello, Kumi.

224
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:59,015
Satoru Fujinuma.

225
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:01,019
Uh... yes?

226
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:03,689
It's me. Don't you remember?

227
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:08,057
It's OK. I've changed a lot
since the last time you saw me.

228
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:10,759
I was your homeroom teacher once,

229
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:12,469
when you were in fifth grade.

230
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:16,157
I'm Gaku Yashiro.

231
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:18,602
I go by Manabu Nishizono now.

232
00:17:19,056 --> 00:17:21,177
I changed my name a while back.

233
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:24,792
Why did you change it, if you don't mind me asking?

234
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:27,570
Not at all. I got married five years ago

235
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,509
and took on my wife's family's name.

236
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:30,148
Oh.

237
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:34,081
My father‐in‐law was a city
council member for a long time.

238
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:36,633
But he passed away three years ago.

239
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:39,974
I joined the council and took over his constituency.

240
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:42,014
I kept the kanji for my given name,

241
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,797
but I use the more common reading now.

242
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:45,964
Wow. A real‐life politician.

243
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:48,158
Just a lowly council member.

244
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:53,742
Yeah, well, still, I get the feeling you'd
be super awesome at politics, Mr. Yashiro.

245
00:17:55,891 --> 00:18:00,662
Anyway, I met Kumi and her parents at
a charity event for kids with leukemia.

246
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:05,315
I know the director of this hospital,
so I pulled some strings and got her in.

247
00:18:05,406 --> 00:18:06,582
That's nice of you.

248
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:09,929
When I heard you came to, I wanted to come visit.

249
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:13,482
I'm sorry it took me so long, but with work and all.

250
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:17,180
Well, thanks for taking the time.

251
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:22,455
To be honest, I've been looking
forward to this day for the past 15 years.

252
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,375
Yeah, well, me too.

253
00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:27,704
You don't remember how close we were, do you?

254
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,656
I don't. Sorry.

255
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:32,621
No, it's all right.

256
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:37,468
They said it would take a while
before you got your memories back.

257
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:39,905
You'll remember me, in time.

258
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:22,001
Hello.

259
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:25,115
Mr. Yashiro.

260
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:27,128
Were you on your way to see Kumi?

261
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:29,522
Yeah. Her surgery's coming up.

262
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,351
The nurses said today is the
last day she can have visitors.

263
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,767
True. I just left her room.

264
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:38,605
She was asleep, so unfortunately I couldn't talk to her.

265
00:19:38,738 --> 00:19:42,077
Well, that sucks. I guess I'll try seeing her later, then.

266
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:45,765
Uh... since you're here, can I talk to you?

267
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:49,409
Sure, but let's go someplace we can have some privacy,

268
00:19:49,657 --> 00:19:51,317
away from these reporters.

269
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:56,671
Don't worry, I know the perfect spot.

270
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:05,777
OK, here we are. I'll bet you
didn't know about this elevator.

271
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:10,000
Feels like we're going on an adventure, huh?

272
00:20:17,906 --> 00:20:19,818
Would you push the button for the roof?

273
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,449
Hmm. Too bad.

274
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,017
The sunset would have been amazing if it weren't raining.

275
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:48,020
At least we won't be bothered by any paparazzi up here.

276
00:20:48,304 --> 00:20:52,004
But the roof's off‐limits so don't tell on me, OK?

277
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:57,272
It's funny, being up here reminds
me of how you, Kenya and Hiromi

278
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,147
always talked about going to your hideout after school.

279
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:02,278
Yashiro...

280
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:09,462
I remember everything,

281
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,103
you son of a bitch.
