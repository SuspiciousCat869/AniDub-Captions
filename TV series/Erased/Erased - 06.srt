1
00:00:01,326 --> 00:00:05,540
I think my dad left because he couldn't
bear everyone in town thinking he was a thief.

2
00:00:05,997 --> 00:00:11,063
And Mom, I bet her not believing him
either was really what bothered him the most.

3
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:14,693
The whole thing made me want to stop trusting people.

4
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:21,243
I felt like I was being forced to choose sides. I thought,
if I hated my mom or my dad, maybe I'd feel better.

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,917
Then a few years later, I heard my mom say,

6
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:25,943
"Why couldn't I just believe him?"

7
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:28,213
Then I knew she was miserable too.

8
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:34,714
And then, when I heard her say that, I
decided to keep on trusting and loving them both.

9
00:00:36,982 --> 00:00:40,105
I realized that if there's one thing I'm really good at,

10
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:41,676
it's believing in people.

11
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:16,696
<i>Wha... What the hell?</i>

12
00:02:16,696 --> 00:02:18,967
I just saw Airi go inside.

13
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:22,569
Then she might be stuck and can't get out. Hey!

14
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:27,026
Airi!

15
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:29,905
Airi, can you hear me?!

16
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:32,645
Airi!

17
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:41,616
Airi! We gotta go.

18
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:50,892
<i>She's heavy.</i>

19
00:02:57,584 --> 00:03:00,110
Hang on, I'll get you out of here.

20
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:06,274
<i>Crap! I can't lug her down by myself.</i>

21
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:12,285
‐What are you doing? ‐You manga guys
really should hit the gym more often.

22
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:14,752
Let's hurry before we get barbecued.

23
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:23,170
Get going out the back.

24
00:03:23,363 --> 00:03:24,632
I got her from here.

25
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:27,016
Don't get her mixed up in your shit.

26
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,009
Guess I get to be the hero today.

27
00:03:44,904 --> 00:03:46,661
<i>I hope Airi's OK.</i>

28
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:49,491
<i>How did that fire start?</i>

29
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:52,617
<i>Was it an accident or.. the killer?</i>

30
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:54,357
<i>Wait.</i>

31
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:00,267
<i>He</i> was <i>trying to kill Airi with that fire.</i>

32
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:02,556
<i>And he was trying to frame me for it.</i>

33
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:06,793
<i>That's why she gave me her phone,
so the cops wouldn't find the email.</i>

34
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:11,017
<i>He knew where she lived. Maybe he followed her or...</i>

35
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,293
<i>maybe she knows him.</i>

36
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:17,058
<i>Whoever he is, he's close.</i>

37
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,342
<i>I'm gonna find him.</i>

38
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:23,002
<i>And with any luck, I'll get
to him before the cops catch me.</i>

39
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:26,927
<i>This stop Koiwa.</i>

40
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:28,896
<i>Make sure you have your belongings before...</i>

41
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:36,923
Hello? Hello?

42
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,985
All right, who is this?

43
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:41,551
<i>Satoru Fujinuma.</i>

44
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:46,325
If you're who you say you are, then nice to meet ya.

45
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,545
I've been expecting your call.

46
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:52,113
Sure, I'd be glad to. But not here.

47
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:53,932
Someplace public.

48
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:58,102
No, I'm not telling you who I am just yet.

49
00:04:58,258 --> 00:04:59,922
Tomorrow, when we meet.

50
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:04,949
'Cause if you're not who you say you are, then
you're the son of a bitch that killed Sachiko.

51
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:09,816
Sit down anywhere.

52
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,097
Oh, hey, Satoru. Over here.

53
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,881
I'm Sawada.

54
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:18,607
I used to work with your mom at Ishikari TV.

55
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:21,626
Goddamn, you look just like Sachiko.

56
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,666
Yeah, you're her kid, no doubt about it.

57
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,416
<i>It's him.</i>

58
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,410
I bet you're wondering if you can trust me.

59
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:32,237
But there's nothing to worry about.

60
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:34,971
I didn't tell the cops you
called and I didn't kill your mom.

61
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,487
Yeah, well, maybe you think I killed her.

62
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:38,701
Not even.

63
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,254
How can you be sure?

64
00:05:41,713 --> 00:05:45,899
'Cause I knew your mom and I know she
didn't raise the kind of son who'd kill her.

65
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:48,427
Hmm, I see.

66
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,605
Yeah, I remembered I had it in my pocket yesterday.

67
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:54,561
You're in it deep, that's for sure.

68
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:56,511
Tell me about it.

69
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,964
And now I'm on the run 'cause I panicked.

70
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:00,710
I can't stop screwing things up.

71
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:04,418
What happened happened, so it's
pointless to beat yourself up about it.

72
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:08,022
That's something your mom liked to say.

73
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:10,068
It's kind of appropriate, don't you think?

74
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,177
You want me to tell you what
we talked about the other day?

75
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:17,510
Yeah.

76
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,132
Do you remember 18 years ago,

77
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:23,760
when that serial killer was targeting kids?

78
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:28,330
Yeah, sure. Jun Shiratori's still sitting
on death row and still denying he killed them.

79
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,170
<i>Well, Satoru was right about him.</i>

80
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:36,557
<i>Shiratori's innocent, and I think
I've figured out who the real killer is.</i>

81
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:39,310
<i>Can you meet me at Koiwa station tomorrow?</i>

82
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:42,696
I should have asked for the guy's name.

83
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:49,829
Anyway, let's talk about what happened back then.

84
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:52,050
About how Kayo Hinazuki died.

85
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:55,470
We know that on the night of March the 2nd,

86
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:58,870
Kayo's mom and her boyfriend
beat her and locked her in the shed.

87
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,417
That was around 10:00, and she was still alive.

88
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,132
We know she froze to death,

89
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:07,219
and we also know that when the mom and the
boyfriend found her body the next morning,they hid it.

90
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,438
'cause they didn't want to take the fall for the murder.

91
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,608
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

92
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:15,845
The theory goes that Kayo was taken
from the shed sometime after 10 p. m.

93
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,209
At about 12:30, Kayo's mom went
out to get her and found her gone.

94
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:24,472
Then she called your house and asked
your mom if she knew where Kayo was.

95
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,180
When they arrested Jun Shiratori,

96
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:32,205
the only evidence they had that tied him to
the crime was a pair of rubber boots he owned.

97
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,029
The tread matched tracks they found near the shed.

98
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,374
Here's how the police figured the killing went down.

99
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:43,209
First he knocked her out and took some pictures of her.

100
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:48,085
Next, he put her in the walk‐in
freezer at work and sprayed her with water.

101
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:51,731
As soon as her temperature dropped
to 20Â°, she was brain‐dead.

102
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:56,427
He waited around for about 30
minutes to make sure she was gone.

103
00:07:57,224 --> 00:08:00,777
Then, just before dawn, he put her body back in the shed.

104
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:08,269
There's no way Yuuki killed her.

105
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:12,426
Kayo Hinazuki, Hiromi Sugita and Aya Nakanishi...

106
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,532
Just before those three went missing,

107
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:17,909
the same exact thing happened
in the next town over from yours.

108
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,241
Someone was quickly arrested, but he
swore he was innocent, same as Shiratori.

109
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:27,018
You see? Same crime, same pattern.

110
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:29,146
It's beyond coincidental.

111
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:31,712
That means...

112
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:32,397
Exactly.

113
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:34,784
I've been trying to tell people for years.

114
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,492
They called me crazy, but in the end, I was right.

115
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:40,163
These crimes were never really solved.

116
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,525
The killer framed every suspect.

117
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:46,003
So whoever murdered Kayo also murdered Sachiko!

118
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:49,571
He's still on the loose. In this city.

119
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:51,790
This bastard's beyond clever.

120
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,759
He plants a false trail of
evidence at the scene of the crime

121
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:56,668
that leads the cops away from him

122
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:58,720
and straight toward some other poor sucker.

123
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:02,239
And while everyone looks the other way, he kills again.

124
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,275
<i>This is too much.</i>

125
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:21,026
You think he'll try it again?

126
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:23,487
If Fujinuma shows his face here,

127
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,322
I'm gonna take his ass out personally.

128
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:27,559
So what's the story with the high school girl?

129
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:28,915
She was in it with him.

130
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:33,428
Yeah, but he didn't want any loose threads,
so he tried to kill her too to shut her up.

131
00:09:33,996 --> 00:09:37,075
Dragging her into this shit. What an asshole.

132
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:39,313
<i>They're wrong.</i>

133
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:42,541
Please, Airi, you don't have to apologize for anything.

134
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:46,076
Your uncle's right. We didn't
know there was a stalker after you.

135
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,349
You must have been so terrified.

136
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,063
But, Auntie,that's not..

137
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,269
You poor thing.

138
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:54,291
We shouldn't have left you all
alone in the house like that.

139
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,230
You're wrong.

140
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:57,772
The police know who it is and they'll catch him soon.

141
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,786
You have nothing to worry about now.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,366
<i>They're all wrong.</i>

143
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:15,422
<i>Everyone thinks Satoru killed
his mom and tried to kill me.</i>

144
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:17,349
<i>But that's crazy.</i>

145
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:21,317
<i>It doesn't matter what I say, no one believes me.</i>

146
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,417
You sure the message was sent from Sachiko's phone?

147
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,396
Yeah. Before I could get Airi out of the house,

148
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:36,179
she slipped her phone in my pocket.

149
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:37,806
Check it out.

150
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:41,357
You weren't kidding.

151
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:45,468
Looks like he wanted to help the cops
catch you by pinning the fire on you too.

152
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:48,003
But why go to all that trouble?

153
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,250
I'm already a suspect in one murder.

154
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:53,271
Uh‐uh. This wasn't about framing me.

155
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:55,491
He was after Airi for another reason.

156
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:58,837
Do you think he tried to kill her
because she had something on him?

157
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:03,466
To get me to take the fall for my mom's murder,
he had to know when I'd be home to find her.

158
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:05,222
That means he new my schedule.

159
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:09,688
So in the 24 hours between when my mom
saw him try to kidnap that little girl

160
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:13,234
and when he killed my mom, he
must have gone to the pizza place

161
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,157
and had a look at the shift schedule.

162
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:18,538
If that's what happened, I bet Airi saw his face.

163
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,228
He might even be someone I've seen before.

164
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:22,425
It's possible.

165
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,826
All we have to do is find out who got behind
the counter that day and we might have our killer.

166
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:30,923
Hell, it's worth a shot. It might
even break this case wide open.

167
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:32,708
I'm off to the hospital.

168
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:34,506
Uh... OK.

169
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:37,935
There's a report on the murders
from 18 years ago on my computer.

170
00:11:38,242 --> 00:11:39,519
You should check it out.

171
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:46,303
<i>I have a theory that Jun Shiratori
might suspect his father to be the killer.</i>

172
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:50,960
<i>Shiratori's refusal to talk to
authorities did not help his case.</i>

173
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,621
<i>Perhaps he did not want to say anything
that could possibly incriminate his father.</i>

174
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:57,244
<i>That figures. Yuuki loved his dad.</i>

175
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:02,605
<i>Kayo Hinazuki's classmates testified they
had seen her and Shiratori together many times.</i>

176
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,863
<i>The investigators focused on their testimonies,</i>

177
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,247
<i>while ignoring Satoru Fujinuma's.</i>

178
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:11,149
<i>Suspects.</i>

179
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:13,890
<i>I don't know any of them besides Yuuki and his dad.</i>

180
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:15,933
<i>They only had five?</i>

181
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:19,488
<i>The investigators thought Hiromi Sugita was murdered</i>

182
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:21,902
<i>because the killer mistook him for a girl.</i>

183
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:25,936
<i>Based on this assumption, they
made a list of five suspects,</i>

184
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:28,012
<i>none of whom knew Hiromi Sugita.</i>

185
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:31,698
PE today is folk dancing.

186
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:33,508
Eww! That sucks ass.

187
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,702
I don't wanna hold some ugly girl's hand.

188
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,850
But I'd be OK holding Hiromi's.

189
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:39,965
Oh... that's gutsy.

190
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:42,482
<i>I think I know why Hiromi was murdered.</i>

191
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,963
<i>The killer knew he was a boy.</i>

192
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,383
<i>He only killed him to cover his tracks,</i>

193
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:50,094
<i>to keep his name off the list.</i>

194
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:53,675
<i>Jun Shiratori was arrested
after someone in the neighborhood</i>

195
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,663
<i>reported seeing him talking to a third‐grade girl.</i>

196
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:58,934
<i>The girl was alone at the time.</i>

197
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:01,530
<i>In the storage room of Shiratori Foods,</i>

198
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:04,389
<i>police found photos of Hiromi Sugita's body.</i>

199
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:09,778
<i>From these photos, investigators suspected
Jun Shiratori of having pedophiliac tendencies,</i>

200
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:12,939
<i>and magazines popular with
pedophiles were found in his room,</i>

201
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,211
<i>confirming their suspicions.</i>

202
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:15,813
<i>He didn't have that shit.</i>

203
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:19,513
<i>The killer planted that stuff
to keep the cops off his trail.</i>

204
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:22,509
<i>Who were the suspects before Hiromi died?</i>

205
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:25,557
<i>Ten to one, the killer's name's on it.</i>

206
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:29,440
Ms. Katagiri, are you awake?

207
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:34,852
Excuse me, I'm visiting someone, but...

208
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:36,299
Is the bathroom that way?

209
00:13:36,503 --> 00:13:37,218
Yes.

210
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:39,778
<i>Her name wouldn't be listed.</i>

211
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,572
<i>201 is vacant. That's it.</i>

212
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:44,055
She's sound asleep.

213
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,220
Thanks for the update.

214
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:47,560
Oh, one side! I gotta pee like a mother.

215
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:53,362
Ms. Katagiri.

216
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,371
Sorry to barge in on you like this.

217
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:58,992
You wouldn't happen to be be Satoru Fujinuma, hmm?

218
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:03,375
Huh? Uh, no. Actually, I'm a friend of Satoru's.

219
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:07,829
It's nice to meet you.

220
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:09,676
I'm Airi's mother.

221
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:16,151
Satoru didn't do what the police are saying.

222
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:20,143
I know he didn't kill his mom, and
he wasn't trying to kill me either.

223
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:23,712
He didn't set that fire. He
was the one who saved me from it.

224
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:26,542
You're confused, after breathing all that smoke.

225
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:29,150
Your manager got you out of the house in time.

226
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:32,237
I don't know what they've told you, but none of it's true.

227
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,926
They're even saying I helped him kill his mom.

228
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:38,944
The worst part about all this is... no one believes me.

229
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:42,710
No one believes Satoru either, and he's all alone now.

230
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:47,825
Airi, even after all these years,

231
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,615
I still think about your father.

232
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:51,323
I should have gone after him.

233
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:56,664
I believe you, hon.

234
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:59,907
Hurry up now. Go and find Satoru.

235
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:12,680
<i>Oh, crap. I forgot to turn it off.</i>

236
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:22,088
<i>You left it on! Thank God.</i>

237
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:24,344
Airi, are you OK?

238
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:26,566
<i>Oh, yeah, I'm good as new.</i>

239
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:29,822
<i>But I need to see you. Can you
meet me under the you‐know‐what?</i>

240
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:31,508
Wait, no, don't go there.

241
00:15:31,587 --> 00:15:32,898
I got you in enough trouble..

242
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:35,570
Don't worry, I'll make sure no one follows me, promise.

243
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,207
And go!

244
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,901
Yeah, let's follow it!

245
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:45,394
<i>Meeting her isn't a good idea.</i>

246
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,983
<i>I could have asked if she saw
someone peeking at the schedule.</i>

247
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,878
<i>The more she gets involved,
the worse it's gonna be for her.</i>

248
00:15:55,517 --> 00:15:56,726
That sucked.

249
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:59,167
It doesn't fly that far at all.

250
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,783
Yeah, how come?

251
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:02,564
The wings are straight.

252
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:07,079
If you do this, it'll give it more aerodynamic lift.

253
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:10,006
Are you sure that's really gonna help it?

254
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:11,000
Try it out.

255
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:16,385
No way, it worked!

256
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:19,046
Look, it's heading for the river!

257
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,750
What's a grown‐up doing here at this time of day?

258
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,452
Is he out of work? I hope he's not a pervert.

259
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:29,579
<i>Poor Yuuki. I bet he had to hear the same thing back then.</i>

260
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,879
See? I made it.

261
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,674
Yeah.

262
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,220
And I made sure no one followed, like I promised.

263
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,765
Cool. <i>I feel terrible.</i>

264
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,732
For a sec there, I thought
this might be a trap by the cops.

265
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:15,827
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

266
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,948
You better be thinking like that.

267
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,341
You're a fugitive so you can't take any chances.

268
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,619
Anyway, I'm glad you trusted me enough to meet me.

269
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,616
Yeah.

270
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:29,360
At work...

271
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:32,397
I'd say Mr. Nishizono is pretty sketchy.

272
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,572
Nishizono?

273
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,269
I've seen him once or twice.

274
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,398
He's on the city council 'cause he wears that pen.

275
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,711
The boss is always kissing his butt, too.

276
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:42,359
When they meet, it's always been in the boss's office,

277
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:45,099
so he could totally peek at
the schedule and get my address.

278
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,800
Hah, I even said hi to him.

279
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:49,741
<i>The list didn't have a Nishizono on it.</i>

280
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:51,196
<i>Maybe it's a fake name.</i>

281
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,529
<i>No, he couldn't use a fake
name if he's on the city council.</i>

282
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:57,428
I think he came after me 'cause I saw his face before.

283
00:17:58,055 --> 00:18:00,436
<i>That's not coming together. Goddamn it.</i>

284
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:02,296
<i>There's still a piece missing.</i>

285
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:07,554
Satoru, I know how you must be
feeling, but you can't beat yourself up.

286
00:18:08,536 --> 00:18:11,728
I try and try. I can never make things right.

287
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:12,378
Hmm?

288
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:13,617
Oh, nothing.

289
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:15,544
It's an idea for a manga I had.

290
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,565
The Grim Reaper makes a scheduling error

291
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,414
and the kid dies on the wrong day.

292
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,367
He tries to bring the kid back to life, but it backfires.

293
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:26,619
Someone else dies, so he tries again,

294
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:28,607
and someone else suffers.

295
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,311
He just wants to do the right thing,but ...

296
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:33,737
everyone he meets ends up one way or the other,

297
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,699
miserable or dead.

298
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:41,726
So are you saying you're kind of like that Grim Reaper?

299
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:43,936
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.

300
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:46,228
You're an idiot. Do I look dead?

301
00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:50,577
And as for being miserable or whatever,
what does he know? That's his opinion.

302
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:53,594
Your Grim Reaper character should
have a little more faith in himself.

303
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:58,559
I think it's too soon to give up on what
you want 'cause nothing's set in stone.

304
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:01,107
However this ends is still up in the air,

305
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,459
and no one knows what it's gonna be yet.

306
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:08,413
Airi, I'm really glad I got to meet you.

307
00:19:09,846 --> 00:19:11,233
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

308
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:16,256
Satoru Fujinuma.

309
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,541
Run, Satoru!

310
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:21,841
Out of the way!

311
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:22,547
Airi!

312
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:27,649
Satoru Fujinuma, you're under arrest

313
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,685
for murder, attempted murder, and arson.

314
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:38,772
4:50 p. m., suspect apprehended.

315
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:45,068
He didn't do it! Let me go! He's
innocent! He didn't kill anyone! Satoru!

316
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:47,722
<i>I knew me and Airi wouldn't last.</i>

317
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:51,125
<i>Either I'd get caught or Revival would make it disappear.</i>

318
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:54,629
<i>Here it is, the last time I'll ever see her.</i>

319
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,863
<i>I know what I should do.</i>

320
00:19:56,962 --> 00:20:01,235
Satoru! I'm sorry! I didn't tell 'em you were here!

321
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:06,440
I swear I didn't tell 'em! They
followed me! I'm sorry, Satoru!

322
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,783
<i>I have to leave her with some kind of hope.</i>

323
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,833
<i>Just like she did for me.</i>

324
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:15,008
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

325
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:18,797
I'm sorry! This is all my fault!

326
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,863
<i>What would a superhero say at a time like this?</i>

327
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:30,172
Isn't it hard having to fight bad guys by yourself?

328
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:36,761
It's not your fault.

329
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:39,521
I know I'll get through this somehow,

330
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,040
'cause I know you believe in me.

331
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:46,196
So thank you, Airi. I'm glad I trusted you.
