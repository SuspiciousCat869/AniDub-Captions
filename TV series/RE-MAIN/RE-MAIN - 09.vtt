There you are.

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
Hey, you really came!
I didn't think you would!

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.933 position:50% align:center
What other choice did I have?

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.186 position:50% align:center
You've been
harassing me non-stop!

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.103 position:50% align:center
[EITARO]
I'll wait forever.

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:02.979 position:50% align:center
I'm waiting.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.189 position:50% align:center
Still waiting.

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
You coming?
Leaving me on "read," huh?

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.777 position:50% align:center
Oh well. If you're
not gonna show up,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
we can always meet up
in the next life.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.532 position:50% align:center
You realize how that
could be interpreted, right?

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.576 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.
But you wouldn't answer

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:17.786 position:50% align:center
and I really had to talk to you!

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.038 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well,
I've got nothing to say.

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.791 position:50% align:center
At least just consider
coming back, please!

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.959 position:50% align:center
Again with the begging?
This is pathetic.

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.836 position:50% align:center
[EITARO] Why aren't
you angry about all this?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.840 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.801 position:50% align:center
[EITARO whimpers]

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:40.433 position:50% align:center

I'm angry for you.

[GROUP panting]

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
You really think
this'll work? I dunno.

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50% align:center
All we can do is wait.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.705 position:50% align:center
Ei's got this, you guys.
Least I think so.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
If this is how he's gonna be,
then I think he's gone for good.

[BOTH grunt]

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center

[EITARO grunts]

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
We let him go.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
You want to bring
in someone new?

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.682 position:50% align:center
But Minato's one of us!

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center
Our team won't be
the same if he's not on it.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
[BABAYARO]
Hm...

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.396 position:50% align:center
Look, I don't wanna
give up on him either,

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.855 position:50% align:center
but what choice do we have?

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:56.695 position:50% align:center
It's done. He's a completely
different person.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
Plus, he said no,

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50% align:center
and pretty much told us
we're worthless, so...

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.910 position:50% align:center
[SHUGO] We put a lot of
expectations on him.

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
Maybe it was more
than he could handle.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not giving up
on him without a fight!

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.626 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever it takes
to convince him to rejoin!

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:15.880 position:50% align:center
[SHUGO]
And how do you plan to do that?

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
I'm really good at fake crying!

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50% align:center
[GROUP grunts]

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
One little tear,

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
and he'll do whatever
I tell him to, trust me.

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
Uhh... We're so doomed.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
[GROUP grunts]

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.195 position:50% align:center
I am. I'm angry for you.

[MINATO gasps]

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:41.740 position:50% align:center
Where did your drive go?!

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
You were a champion,

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
so why aren't you out
there acting like one?!

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:49.247 position:50% align:center
Do you know how upsetting it is
to see you give up like this?!

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.999 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well,
how do you think I feel?

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:53.626 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You care!

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.420 position:50% align:center
You're upset because
you still have what it takes

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:58.256 position:50% align:center
to be the best in Japan, and you
know it!

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.716 position:50% align:center
And if you know you
have the talent,

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
then it doesn't make
sense to waste it, right?

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center
So, you should come
back and play with us!

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:07.265 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
You know what? You're right.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.059 position:50% align:center
You're gonna rejoin the team?

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center
No. I mean I've
got so much talent

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
that it'd be beneath me
to play with you guys.

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:15.190 position:50% align:center
[EITARO grunts]

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:18.526 position:50% align:center
So don't ask again,
and stop texting me.

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] This is ridiculous.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:24.240 position:50% align:center
I was the best in junior high,

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
and I deserve that
in high school, too!

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
Uh... Wait up!

Well, look at you.

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50% align:center
Still runnin' home after
practice, huh, champ?

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
Or am I wrong? What,
you just have to take a leak?

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
What do you want?

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center

I heard your memories came back.

[MINATO]
Yeah.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
Coach seemed pretty happy
about it after you guys talked.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:20.880 position:50% align:center
That right?

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:26.344 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Must've been great for you,

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50% align:center
playing water polo on
my team without me there.

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
You had a hell of
a rise, my friend.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
Must be easy to be the best

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.687 position:50% align:center

decent to challenge you.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
I bet you felt like a damn
king taking over my life.

You know, your old
throne is pretty nice.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
I can see how you
got spoiled up here.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.992 position:50% align:center
[MINATO scoffs]
I'm the spoiled one?

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
You did nothing but pass
the ball to me for three years!

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center
[MOMO] Yeah, well, things
are different now, all right?

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
I'm not the same kid
who used to set up plays

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.211 position:50% align:center
so you could score!
You have no idea what I can do,

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.630 position:50% align:center
how much I've sacrificed
to get here!

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:04.758 position:50% align:center
You don't know
a damn thing about me!

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
[MINATO grunts]

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
I did what Coach told me
to and focused on winning...

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:19.064 position:50% align:center
...just like you did.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:22.817 position:50% align:center
[BIZEN] Listen, Kiyomizu.
You're going to be our ace.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
[BIZEN]
You've certainly got the talent.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.199 position:50% align:center
[BIZEN]
But you're a pushover.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.578 position:50% align:center
[BIZEN] In my experience,
an ace has to be selfish.

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:34.954 position:50% align:center
You're out there
to score points,

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
even if it means
not being a team player.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50% align:center
Hesitate, even for a moment,

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
and you might lose
the chance to shoot.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Okay.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.130 position:50% align:center
Use your skills to
outshine the others.

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:46.383 position:50% align:center
That's what'll
carry us to victory.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.593 position:50% align:center
From now on, focus on winning.

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:49.761 position:50% align:center
What about...?

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.180 position:50% align:center
The team will go along
with it, trust me.

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
[MINATO grunts]

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.563 position:50% align:center
He told me that
I could be great, too.

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
So, I trained like hell,
became the best in Japan,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
and he still doesn't care.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Huh?

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:09.364 position:50% align:center
[MOMO]
I don't think he'll ever move on

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
from when you were our ace.

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50% align:center
He compares me to you every day.

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
"Minato would
make a better play."

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
"You could've made that shot

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:20.166 position:50% align:center
if you trained as
hard as Minato did."

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.085 position:50% align:center
I worked my ass off
to get to this point,

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
and he still treats me
like some kinda knockoff!

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.925 position:50% align:center
But I'm not your stand-in.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:30.677 position:50% align:center
I am my own person!

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna demolish
you at prefecturals

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
and show everyone
I'm better than you!

[MINATO scoffs]

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm glad
your memory's back,

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:44.232 position:50% align:center
'cause now I can
beat you at your best.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:46.443 position:50% align:center
Well, congrats,
you win, I guess.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:47.569 position:50% align:center
[MOMO]
What?

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
By default, I mean.
I quit water polo.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.323 position:50% align:center
You runnin' from me?!

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.409 position:50% align:center
No, I'm running from Yamanami!

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50% align:center
Those amateurs treat
the game like it's a damn joke!

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
I'd rather quit
than play for them!

[BABAYARO]
I don't know what to do.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50% align:center
It's so hard to believe
this is the real him.

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50% align:center
It really seems like the
nice Minato is gone forever.

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
Uh... No, it's nothing.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:39.704 position:50% align:center
Got an idea?
'Cause we could use one!

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.373 position:50% align:center
I bet your handwriting rocks.

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
That's so cool!

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.670 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he was a good guy.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.588 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIHARU]
Mm-hm...

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:58.181 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI] I wonder if
he's happier this way.

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI]
When we had the other Minato,

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
he seemed so much
happier than he is now.

A while back,

regaining my old memories

would erase the
new ones I'd made,

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.828 position:50% align:center

totally embarrassed.

Remember, if you want

it requires strong footwork,

using your lower half, too.

thrown with my arms!

of the club's mascots.

hard they're trying

does his own thing,
