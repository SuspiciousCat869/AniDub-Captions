[EITARO] No. Every
time there's a foul,

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:40.548 position:50% align:center
they have to stop the clock

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:43.176 position:50% align:center
and there's no telling
how many might be called.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.178 position:50% align:center
To resume the game,
you have to pass.

You aren't allowed
to take a shot.

And all that
stopping and starting?

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it adds up way
quicker than you'd think.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:53.228 position:50% align:center
So really, each period is
more like fifteen minutes.

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
After the first
and third periods,

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
there's a two-minute
break to rest.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:59.109 position:50% align:center
Oh, we also take a 15-minute
break during halftime.

play against Minato.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.123 position:50% align:center
Feels weird, doesn't it?

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:49.708 position:50% align:center
[KOKI]
Mm-hm.

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:52.502 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm jealous.

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:54.754 position:50% align:center
I wish I could.

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
[KOKI, KEITA grunt]

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:05.890 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] Something
happened to him out there.

00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:07.642 position:50% align:center
Even after all this time,

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
I've never seen him
play like that before.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
Woo-hoo!

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
That was amazing work, boys!
What a recovery!

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:18.361 position:50% align:center
You ready to beat Shogaku?

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Uh...

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
[SHUGO] It won't be easy
and we'll probably lose.

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.494 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm sure you're tired.
Get some rest.

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:28.371 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Okay.

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
He's got a point.

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:33.710 position:50% align:center
I'm taking a nap.

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Hm?

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
We only have two hours

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:37.756 position:50% align:center
to recover before
the next match.

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, that's true.

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIHARU]
I'm so sorry.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Hm?

00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:48.016 position:50% align:center
All I ever do is
screw things up.

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:49.392 position:50% align:center
Hey, that isn't true at all.

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:50.435 position:50% align:center
Babi's right!

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:51.770 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Mm.

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:56.358 position:50% align:center
But I didn't
contribute anything.

00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:57.650 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
You did fine.

00:21:57.734 --> 00:21:58.818 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:00.987 position:50% align:center
You kept your hands up
till the very end.

00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:03.698 position:50% align:center
It's basic, but it's important.

00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:08.078 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIHARU chuckles]

00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:09.537 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chuckles]

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:15.210 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
It really is just like I said.

00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:17.962 position:50% align:center
Greatest tool at our
disposal is our team.

00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:19.964 position:50% align:center
One person alone can't
carry us to victory,

00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:23.468 position:50% align:center
but as long as all of us,
work together we can win.

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:28.014 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Or the other me said, that is.
