00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I wanted
to ask you something.

[EITARO]
Hm?

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.045 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
When I first got home,

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:50.090 position:50% align:center
you said Asumi told you that I
had gotten out of the hospital.

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:51.675 position:50% align:center

Yeah.

she recognized you at all.

[EITARO grunts]

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:59.432 position:50% align:center
Because I was lying.

Huh?

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50% align:center
The truth is that
I've never met her.

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
I heard you were back
from my little sister.

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
And she knew because
she's in Asumi's grade.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:09.943 position:50% align:center
I don't...

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:12.904 position:50% align:center
Also, that isn't the
only lie I've told you.

Wha--?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.116 position:50% align:center
There are some things
I should confess.

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:16.950 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Confess?

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
First off,

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:21.037 position:50% align:center
I made it sound like we were
closer than we actually were.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.039 position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
[EITARO] Back when
we were in junior high,

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.793 position:50% align:center
I admired you so much.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:31.089 position:50% align:center
But I was so nervous around you,
I couldn't even talk to you.

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
So, that story you
told about making me laugh

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.260 position:50% align:center
when you said "taxicrab" was...

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50% align:center
That was true,

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
but it was the only time
you and I ever really spoke.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50% align:center
[MINATO gasps]

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:44.185 position:50% align:center
But then, on the day
you woke up from your coma,

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:47.230 position:50% align:center
when Momo and the guys came
to practice to talk to us,

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
they said something
that gave me an idea.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
So you're saying he has amnesia?

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
Afraid so.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.947 position:50% align:center
He had no reaction when
we went to visit him.

Mm.

[EITARO grunts]

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:00.577 position:50% align:center
[EITARO]
I thought

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
if I could just convince you
that we were friends,

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
then maybe I could
become your friend.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.207 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
[EITARO] That's why I came
to find you when you got out.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.045 position:50% align:center
To see if your memories
were really gone.

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:11.880 position:50% align:center
Whoa, dude, that's scary!

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
Not to shout, but it is!

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:15.467 position:50% align:center
Why would you lie like that?

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.218 position:50% align:center
Because it was the
only chance I had left

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
to play on a great
water polo team!

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Huh...

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:22.640 position:50% align:center
You don't remember this,

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50% align:center
but I was always on
the bench in middle school.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.394 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Wait, what?

00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:29.773 position:50% align:center
Three whole years,
and I never played one game.

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:32.317 position:50% align:center
I was hoping I'd finally
get my shot in my last year,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
but then my spot went
to a younger player.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
That was when it dawned on me

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.282 position:50% align:center
that if I stayed at
Shogaku for high school,

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center
I'd be out of the game for good.
And I couldn't let that happen.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
I knew that any
other team I joined

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center
would probably be
weaker than Shogaku,

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center
but not if that team
had you on it!

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.462 position:50% align:center
I thought if I joined your team,

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
we could take
them down together!

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.258 position:50% align:center
But I was wrong.

[MINATO grunts]

00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:03.181 position:50% align:center
Now you know why I ran away
and abandoned my teammates!

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
But in the end,
I did it all for nothing.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
I didn't listen,
even when you warned me.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
You said,
"Don't get your hopes up."

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
At first, I figured you
were just being modest,

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
but during that
match earlier today,

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center

I know that the person
I admired is gone for good,

you play all the time.

for you that I thought,

that the person you used
to look up to has vanished.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.756 position:50% align:center
I guess TV lied to me.
Wanna talk somewhere else?

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
If it's about the team, then

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.177 position:50% align:center
I already made up
my mind what I'm doing.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.220 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Oh, right.

00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:37.349 position:50% align:center
I figured, but before
you officially quit,

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
do you mind if
I tell you something?

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
[EITARO]
Hm?

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
Yesterday, I talked
to Coach Bizen.

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:45.398 position:50% align:center
[EITARO gasps]

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:47.567 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] I asked him
what made me strong before,

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
and you know what he said?

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
What made you an
exceptional player

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
was that you put in the work.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:55.825 position:50% align:center
--[MINATO] Work.
--[EITARO] Uh?

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center
There're DVDs in your room.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
Go do yourself a favor--
watch them.

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
I did.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
What ended up being on them?

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.544 position:50% align:center
It was just me.

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
Practicing my shooting
form alone in my room.

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:11.132 position:50% align:center
[EITARO]
Your form?

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Over and over again
for 30 minutes every day.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:15.720 position:50% align:center
[EITARO grunts]

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
You made every effort
you could to improve.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:24.229 position:50% align:center
You practiced at home and school
and even recorded your form.

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
At night before bed,
you would review the videos,

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
and practice passing
against the wall.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.655 position:50% align:center
To strategize,
you studied the old handbooks,

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:36.533 position:50% align:center
examining why certain
rules had changed.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
You were hungry
to learn everything

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:41.079 position:50% align:center
about the game and
how it had evolved.

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:44.582 position:50% align:center
Very few players go that far.

00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
The truth is your greatest
talent was your perseverance.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:52.132 position:50% align:center
Yep! He turned out to be right,

00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
because I found an
old ball in my closet,

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
and it was super smooth!

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
It had been used so much

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
that the grippy texture
wore off completely!

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50% align:center
I must've trained like crazy!

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
Turns out, I was
never a prodigy.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:07.564 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I just
worked super hard!

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
[EITARO gasps]

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
I didn't rise to the top.

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:14.195 position:50% align:center
I climbed there, step by step,

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
until I became the
very best in Japan.

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.784 position:50% align:center
What I achieved was the
result of intense training,

00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
day after day,
building upon myself,

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
until I could finally
reach those amazing heights.

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
Way to go, Kamekichi!
You're moving up in the world!

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:33.965 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] You thought it
was easy and natural for me,

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
but I'm happy to report,
it wasn't.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
You don't know
what a relief that is.

[EITARO grunts]

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.433 position:50% align:center
I was so bad at playing,

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.061 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd lost a talent
that I was born with.

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:47.479 position:50% align:center
If I never had it,

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:50.023 position:50% align:center
that means I can work hard
to get good again, right?

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:50.940 position:50% align:center
[EITARO grunts]

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center
My rival is who I used to be!

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
And from now on, I'm gonna try
my absolute best to beat him!

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
So...

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
...will you stay
and try with me?

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
It'll be reassuring
to have someone

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
who knew me in the past around.

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:08.750 position:50% align:center
And besides, you know
all about water polo,

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.503 position:50% align:center
so maybe you can teach me?

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:12.712 position:50% align:center
[EITARO grunts]

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center
I swear,

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
I will make you
look up to me again!

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.011 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you can forgive me?

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:22.764 position:50% align:center
I said a lot of awful
things to you back there.

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:26.851 position:50% align:center
Well, considering how bad I was,
what you said was mostly true.

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:29.479 position:50% align:center
It doesn't change that
I lied to you about who I was.

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.606 position:50% align:center
You're saying
you're fine with that?

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
It's not like I couldn't tell.

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.026 position:50% align:center
You switched
personalities from fanboy

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.403 position:50% align:center
to tough coach pretty quick.

00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
Uh.

Why should I? Now that
our seventh member has quit,

we can't compete anymore,

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.056 position:50% align:center

practicing, is there?
