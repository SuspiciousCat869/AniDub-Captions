It's better to try and
outswim the defenders

so what do you think of this?

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.767 position:50% align:center

looked at this site

died in an accident.

took time out of his

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:15.767 position:50% align:center
[TAKEKAZU]
Mm. Right. "Change" it is, then.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
[JO]
What?

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:18.019 position:50% align:center
For the tracksuits.

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
After hearing you out,
I'm convinced.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
It's the only way to go.

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50% align:center
[JO] Uh, hold on.
What about all your slogans?

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:29.197 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess we're just
gonna have to change them.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.657 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Mm!

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:34.327 position:50% align:center
[JO gasps, chuckles]

00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
You in, too, Amiami?

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.498 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:43.086 position:50% align:center
If we stay the way we are,
we can't beat my brother's team.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
Aww, hell yeah!
Our official motto is "change"!

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
--[BABAYARO] Sweet!
--[TAKEKAZU] Yeah!

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:48.591 position:50% align:center
[SHUGO]
I approve.

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Hm?

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:52.512 position:50% align:center
And in the spirit of
"change," from now on,

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:54.723 position:50% align:center
I'll wear the tracksuit
with all of you.

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:55.849 position:50% align:center
[JO gasps]

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:57.142 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps, chuckles]

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
Probably for the best. My
current one is a little tight.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
[gasps, chuckles]

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
Now that we've decided...

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.613 position:50% align:center
Ushi, would you
do us the honors?

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.157 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.827 position:50% align:center
Here! You can make hand-written
letters for the tracksuits!

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.120 position:50% align:center
Whatcha think, man?

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:17.996 position:50% align:center
You down?

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.205 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:20.832 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:29.341 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIHARU groans]
I'm not happy with any of these.

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:31.426 position:50% align:center
Take all the time you need!

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
We're busy over here
picking out a color scheme.

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
Wait. I could've sworn that
today's date was the 28th.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.392 position:50% align:center
Nope. The 29th.

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:42.395 position:50% align:center
Then that 30%
discount is gonna expire

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:45.231 position:50% align:center
if we don't order before
eight p.m. tonight.

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:46.399 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
What?!

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:48.109 position:50% align:center
No way! I boffed it!

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Are you kidding?!

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:50.779 position:50% align:center
It's already 7:30!

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:54.282 position:50% align:center
[JO] Let's see, the best
one is, uh, this one! See ya!

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIHARU yelps]
But that's just a draft!

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.410 position:50% align:center
[JO]
I'm sure it's perfectly fine!

00:17:57.494 --> 00:18:00.872 position:50% align:center
I'll pick the colors
on my way there! Peace!

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:02.874 position:50% align:center
[GROUP groans]

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
[JO yells]

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:22.310 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Nice!

00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:23.937 position:50% align:center
Looking way sharp!

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.189 position:50% align:center
Man! That color scheme is sick!

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:28.316 position:50% align:center
Definitely made the
right choice there.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
A mix of strength and coolness.

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:32.404 position:50% align:center
See? This is what
I was talking about!

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:34.322 position:50% align:center
We're lookin'
like a legit team now.

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.033 position:50% align:center
Uh, but...

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.076 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
So, as you can see...

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
...the front part may have
gotten a little messed up.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
Yeah. "Strange"?

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
What happened to "change"?

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.879 position:50% align:center
[JO] Sorry! But when
I got to the shop,

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
I only had one of the kanji, so
I must have lost the other page!

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:54.884 position:50% align:center
[JO] I was gonna come
back and look for it,

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
but they would've been
closed and we couldn't afford

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.805 position:50% align:center
the tracksuits without the sale!

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
[GROUP sighs]

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
Well, what's done
is done, I suppose.

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:05.311 position:50% align:center
Yeah...

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
[TAKEKAZU]
On the plus side,

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
at least the logo on the back
is looking pretty lit, right?

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:12.277 position:50% align:center
[EITARO] Except it says "water
ball" instead of "water polo."

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.778 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
What?!

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
[JO] It's fine! Some people
call it "water ball," right?

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:17.991 position:50% align:center
[EITARO] I mean, maybe,
but those people are wrong.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
Maybe people will
think that it's slang?

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:22.203 position:50% align:center
[EITARO] Or they're just gonna
think we're a bunch of idiots

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center
who don't know what
sport they're playing.

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
Well. Crap.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
[EITARO]
Uh-huh.

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:30.462 position:50% align:center
So we don't even have
the right sport name?

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:31.963 position:50% align:center
Dude! These things suck!

00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
You just got done
saying they were cool!

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] It wasn't
what we were expecting,

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:39.888 position:50% align:center
but I think it actually works!

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:42.766 position:50% align:center
Our team is pretty "strange,"
but in the best way.

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
[BABAYARO]
There's some positive thinking!

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:45.393 position:50% align:center
[JO]
Forgive me, my dudes!

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:48.146 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Look, Amihama
rolled his pant legs up!

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
I guess old
habits die hard, huh?

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
I'm home!

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:55.278 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI]
This is a disaster!

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
Can I please just stay

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center
home from school
until it grows out?

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:00.742 position:50% align:center
No, dear, you look lovely. Oh!

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:02.410 position:50% align:center
Welcome home.

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
Look what you did to my hair!

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.872 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.375 position:50% align:center
I wanted you to
help me pick a good cut,

00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
but you totally ignored me!

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:12.629 position:50% align:center
Oh, c'mon, it'll grow back!

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.214 position:50% align:center
But when did I
ignore you, though?

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:16.007 position:50% align:center
When you were
writing dumb slogans!

00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:17.676 position:50% align:center
Ohh...

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI] This is the worst.
I look so strange.

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Yeah, but strange is good.

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:25.684 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:27.644 position:50% align:center
"Strange" rhymes with
"change" after all.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.562 position:50% align:center
And that's the reason
you cut it, right?

00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:32.148 position:50% align:center
'Cause you wanted
something different.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.068 position:50% align:center
This is the worst pep talk ever.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:36.653 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:39.406 position:50% align:center
You were supposed to
tell me I didn't look strange!

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:41.908 position:50% align:center
I'll just start over, then.

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
I guess it does
look a little strange.

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
Strangely awesome!

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
Better.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.334 position:50% align:center
Oh, good! [chuckles]

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:53.503 position:50% align:center
I guess it's fine.

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:56.172 position:50% align:center
Speaking of,
he's sure changed a lot.

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
Hasn't he?

00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center
[TAEKO]
Mm.

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI]
Compared to junior high,

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:04.305 position:50% align:center
it's like he's a completely
different person.

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:11.187 position:50% align:center
[MINATO humming]

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Time for another water
polo lesson from the old Minato.

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:16.359 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
Still haven't seen this one yet.

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:25.952 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] You wanna tell me
what the hell that was?!

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:27.579 position:50% align:center
Talk about half-assing it!

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:29.330 position:50% align:center
That was the worst
pass I've ever seen!

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:30.498 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with you?!

00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:31.833 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] If you don't get
your head in the game,

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:34.586 position:50% align:center
you're gonna cost us our shot!

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:36.463 position:50% align:center
So wake up or get out!

00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:38.548 position:50% align:center
Wait, is that me?

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:43.094 position:50% align:center
Hey! I said only film games!
Gimme that damn camera!

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:45.388 position:50% align:center
[EITARO]
Sorry, I forgot!

00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:52.812 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Was that what I was like?
