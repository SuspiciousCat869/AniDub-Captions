--[JO gasps]
--[EITARO] Sorry, I thought--

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.353 position:50% align:center
One of your teammates
mentioned something about it.

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:05.940 position:50% align:center
He said that was the reason
why you joined the swim team.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.817 position:50% align:center
Unbelievable.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.362 position:50% align:center
So what, you beat him
and just burned out?

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.489 position:50% align:center
I never beat my brother.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center

Hm?

[MINATO grunts]

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.287 position:50% align:center
[SHUGO] I have a lot of respect
for him and for his skills,

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:22.916 position:50% align:center
which is the main reason why
it's my goal to surpass him.

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:26.711 position:50% align:center
He was always the superior
athlete between the two of us.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.924 position:50% align:center
[SHUGO] The only place
I could even begin to

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.677 position:50% align:center
reach his level
was in the water.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.557 position:50% align:center
[SHUGO]
I was so close to beating him.

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.726 position:50% align:center
But when he started junior high,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.771 position:50% align:center
he gave up swimming and
switched over to water polo.

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:49.067 position:50% align:center
[SHUGO]
I kept swimming,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.945 position:50% align:center
thinking he'd come
back to it eventually.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.698 position:50% align:center
But then he never did.

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:57.992 position:50% align:center
[SHUGO]
Even though I wound up

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.495 position:50% align:center
breaking his grade
school records,

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:03.498 position:50% align:center
it never felt
like I had really won.

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:06.084 position:50% align:center
Beating him in person
was all I wanted.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.461 position:50% align:center
And my chance had
come and passed.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:13.341 position:50% align:center
So, I decided to quit
the swim team altogether.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.471 position:50% align:center

You satisfied?

My pleasure!

Eitaro here told us

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:52.005 position:50% align:center
Minato had started
playing water polo again.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.423 position:50% align:center

just come waltzing in?

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
maybe there's
still hope for me yet!

All right. Here we go.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:06.236 position:50% align:center
Let's hit the basics:

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.737 position:50% align:center
Players score
points in water polo

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.073 position:50% align:center
by shooting the ball
into a floating goal.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
Unlike basketball,

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:14.077 position:50% align:center
all shots will only
get you a single point.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
And yet, the fights for
possession can be fierce.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:17.914 position:50% align:center
You may even hear the game

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.250 position:50% align:center
referred to as
"water wrestling."

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.294 position:50% align:center
Which brings us to the caps:
these babies protect your ears

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:24.587 position:50% align:center
when you get
cracked in the noggin,

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.756 position:50% align:center

your eardrums'll burst.

[GROUP]
Huh?

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.551 position:50% align:center
[JO] Water polo

Kick your legs out
from your body in circles.

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:36.558 position:50% align:center
Left goes clockwise,
and right goes counter,

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:37.726 position:50% align:center
like a figure eight,
