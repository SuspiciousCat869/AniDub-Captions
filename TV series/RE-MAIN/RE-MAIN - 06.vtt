Sure is a hot one today. I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
I hope they're doing their best.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:55.388 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] It's been one month
since we started water polo.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:57.098 position:50% align:center
So now that Golden Week's here,

00:00:57.182 --> 00:01:00.852 position:50% align:center
we've decided to do our very own
lock-in training camp at school!

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.771 position:50% align:center
Our goal is to
score our first win

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.273 position:50% align:center
at the big prefectural
tournament this July.

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center
But we've got a lot
of improvements to make

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.652 position:50% align:center
before we get there, especially
when it comes to teamwork.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.029 position:50% align:center
So we put our heads together,

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:13.531 position:50% align:center
stopped building strategies
exclusively around me,

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.575 position:50% align:center
and tried something new.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:18.036 position:50% align:center
I've gotten pretty
good at passing.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.538 position:50% align:center
So if Amihama
outswims his defender,

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.165 position:50% align:center
I pass to him.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.708 position:50% align:center
And he shoots.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.173 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] If Ejiri manages
to get open, I pass to him.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.050 position:50% align:center
Then he shoots.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.469 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:35.804 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
With this new strategy,

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.682 position:50% align:center

we might actually win!

Got the whole practice!

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:55.073 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] It burned up pretty
much all the money I had,

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:57.742 position:50% align:center
but I bought a new phone
with a really good camera.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.327 position:50% align:center
So now I can
record our progress,

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.454 position:50% align:center
just like I did
back in junior high!

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:02.789 position:50% align:center
It worked for the old me,

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:04.833 position:50% align:center
so maybe it'll work
for the new me, too!

Here's my confession:
In my head I call Ejiri "Buu"!

'Cause of how his
last name's written!

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center

[MINATO]
Hm.

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:19.434 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Every day, we perform
basically the same routine.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center

In the morning, we swim laps.

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
Eight kilometers
over three hours.

For actual water polo training,

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:37.118 position:50% align:center
we get started in the afternoon,

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
but we don't use
a ball at first.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
We do eggbeaters with weights.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Finally we break out the balls

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.510 position:50% align:center
and practice with them.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
We start with normal passes,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center
then move on to long passes.

Well, it doesn't look too
serious, but I'd still ice it.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.376 position:50% align:center
[JO]
Sure thing.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
I bet it's hurting right now,

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
but once the pain subsides,
you can expect it to hurt less.

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Captain Obvious over here.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.927 position:50% align:center
[YOKOI] Mister Mitamura!
We finished our drills.

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center
[MITAMURA]
Well, okey-dokey, then.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
I'm headed to the gym for now,

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
so if you boys need me,
the gym's where I'll be.

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50% align:center

Hm?

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.523 position:50% align:center

[MINATO]
Huh?

00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
How'd we get stuck
with the weird advisor?

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50% align:center
[JO]
Hey, ease up on him.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center
Mister Mitamura was the only one
who volunteered to advise us,

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.876 position:50% align:center
and we were his second club,
so we owe him a lot.

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:09.419 position:50% align:center
[TAKEKAZU]
Sorry 'bout that, Ushi.

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
I guess I don't
know my own strength.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.424 position:50% align:center
No. Don't apologize.
It's my fault.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
Got that right. You got hit
because you were zoned out.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIHARU grunts]
Sorry...

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
Are you having some

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIHARU]
Huh?

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
I just saw that you weren't
in your bed this morning.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:40.992 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIHARU] I wanted
to build up my endurance.

[YOSHIHARU panting]

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50% align:center
Okay, but how come?

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIHARU]
Isn't it obvious?

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center
I'm dragging the
whole team down!

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
I've tried and tried, but
I've never made a single shot.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.549 position:50% align:center
My long passes are
never long enough.

00:11:56.633 --> 00:12:00.679 position:50% align:center
And I'm the only one who always
sinks during eggbeaters.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:04.891 position:50% align:center
Everyone on the team is
getting better, except for me.

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:06.601 position:50% align:center
I'm so pathetic.

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:08.311 position:50% align:center
You're not dragging
us down, I promise!

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:10.438 position:50% align:center
Don't lie to me!

00:12:10.522 --> 00:12:11.940 position:50% align:center

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
I think everyone needs to relax.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and take a minute
to cool down, 'kay?

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
Sure...

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.661 position:50% align:center

I'm worried about Ushi.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center
I didn't know he was
being so hard on himself.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
Something tells
me nothing we say

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
is gonna help change his mind.

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
So then, what do we do now?

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center
[splashing]

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center

[YOSHIHARU] I really am
completely worthless, aren't I?

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] So, what about
shooting practice?

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
[JO] Easy! I'll just jump in the
opposite direction Ushi shoots.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.623 position:50% align:center
That way, he'll think
he caught me off guard

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
with his killer throw!

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.335 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
How about the eggbeater?

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:14.544 position:50% align:center
What's the plan there?

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.379 position:50% align:center
[BABAYARO] While I'm
keeping Ushi distracted.

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:19.424 position:50% align:center
Eitaro will swoop in,
swap his ten-kilo weight out,

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:22.260 position:50% align:center
and give him a nice, easy
five-kilo weight instead!

00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
[EITARO]
With a lighter load,

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
he should be able to
stay afloat no problem!

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
And what about long passing?

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center
[TAKEKAZU] We'll just close
the distance a little bit

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50% align:center
at the start of our drills,
and hope he doesn't notice!

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
He'll throw the ball to me
thinking I'm super far away,

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:35.231 position:50% align:center
I'll catch it like it's nothin',

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.233 position:50% align:center
and he'll feel like
the passing king!

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.027 position:50% align:center
Perfecto!

he was all alone,

life was worth living.

that having us in his life
