Oh. Hey, you're here.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.234 position:50% align:center
Isn't it still early--

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.111 position:50% align:center
[CHINU]
I was just curious; that's all.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.533 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] Wasn't expecting
a DM from you of all people.

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Uh, yeah.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.911 position:50% align:center
I made an account because I
didn't have your number, was--

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.913 position:50% align:center
What did you wanna talk about?

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Uh... Well,
I-I remembered my past.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.211 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:48.673 position:50% align:center
Just part of it, though.
Most of it's still blank.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.303 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Was that what I was like?

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] I found an old video
of me yelling during practice.

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:58.558 position:50% align:center
And then all of a sudden,
out of nowhere.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.852 position:50% align:center
I caught a whiff of
the chlorine in my hair,

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:03.605 position:50% align:center
and it was like
I was there again.

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:05.148 position:50% align:center
That's when the
memory of that moment

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.651 position:50% align:center
came rushing back.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.320 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Talk about half-assing it!

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.030 position:50% align:center
That was the worst
pass I've ever seen!

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:13.448 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with you?!

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:14.783 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:15.784 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] If you don't
get your head in the game,

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.077 position:50% align:center
you're gonna cost us our shot!

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.037 position:50% align:center
So, wake up or get out!

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.081 position:50% align:center
Hey! I said only film games!

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
Gimme that damn camera!

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:24.751 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I forgot!

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:28.713 position:50% align:center
That's the last thing
that I can picture.

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:33.468 position:50% align:center
Did you-- Did you ever hear
me talk that way back then?

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.970 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid to ask
my friend about it.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.139 position:50% align:center
So, I figured I'd come to you,
since you knew what I--

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:39.849 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] Well, I'm glad
you finally remembered.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.142 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:43.395 position:50% align:center
Now you know what a
terrible person you were.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:44.604 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Huh?

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:46.815 position:50% align:center
You were completely
arrogant and stuck-up,

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:49.526 position:50% align:center
but worst of all,
you were a bully.

[MINATO grunts]

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:54.948 position:50% align:center
Hiroshi Ichinose. Ring a bell?

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.574 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, who?

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.326 position:50% align:center
He was on your team.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.452 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:07.961 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] Growing up, he was
like an older brother to me.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:11.214 position:50% align:center
I wanted to be just
like him someday.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.799 position:50% align:center
That was actually the
reason why I picked up

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.677 position:50% align:center
water polo in the first place.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.181 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI grunts]

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:24.102 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] He always looked so
happy when he was playing.

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.062 position:50% align:center
But then, during
his second year,

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.772 position:50% align:center
when the new coach
was brought on,

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.816 position:50% align:center
you showed up to join the team.

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.901 position:50% align:center
That was when he
stopped smiling.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.403 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.280 position:50% align:center
Things got worse the next year.

[KEITA]
No!

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:47.000 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Why'd you let him get past you?!

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.209 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:49.627 position:50% align:center
[CHINU]
He was older than you.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.130 position:50% align:center
But at the end of the day,
you were the star player.

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.965 position:50% align:center
Were you even
trying to stop him?!

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.260 position:50% align:center
Why don't you start swimming
like you actually give a damn?

00:02:57.344 --> 00:03:00.847 position:50% align:center
[CHINU]
So you treated him like dirt.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.682 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI]
Sorry...

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:05.268 position:50% align:center
[BIZEN]
Ichinose.

[HIROSHI grunts]

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] In the end, he
transferred to another school

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:21.326 position:50% align:center
and quit water polo entirely.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
[MINATO gasps]

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.913 position:50% align:center
I hated you so much for that.

[gasps]

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
And then you had
the nerve to ask me out.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.752 position:50% align:center
[CHINU]
Absolutely not.

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:32.837 position:50% align:center
When I become Japan's
best middle-school player,

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.547 position:50% align:center
you owe me a kiss.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:35.757 position:50% align:center
What?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.802 position:50% align:center
Hundred ten thousand
says I'll do it. Deal?

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.346 position:50% align:center

That made me hate you even more.

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
[MINATO grunts]

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.517 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] Imagine my surprise
when you did become the best

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
and then got into that
accident and then, one day,

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.189 position:50% align:center
just showed up again
out of the blue.

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:53.400 position:50% align:center
You're looking better
than I thought you would.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.694 position:50% align:center
[MINATO gasps]

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:59.114 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] I held up
my end of that stupid bet.

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center
But when you said you
forgot what happened

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:04.577 position:50% align:center
and told me you weren't
playing water polo anymore.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.287 position:50% align:center
I don't even remember how.

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center

It made me so angry.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.459 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
[CHINU]
Some people like Ichinose

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.170 position:50% align:center
aren't cut out for sports,

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
and they don't make it
very far--I get that.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
But people like you,

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.803 position:50% align:center
who crush their spirits
and then just quit, are sick.

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:23.930 position:50% align:center
I couldn't let his
pain be for nothing.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
I wanted you to keep at it!

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
[MINATO gasps]

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
[CHINU]
So, I lied.

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
What?

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
You must not remember
the other half of our deal.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
The other half?

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
If you became Japan's
best high school player,

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
then I would have
to start dating you.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
What? That was a lie?

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.243 position:50% align:center
[CHINU]
It was revenge. Accident or not,

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.412 position:50% align:center
you didn't deserve to quit
after what you did.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.414 position:50% align:center
Revenge?

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
So, if you even think
about dropping out,

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
with or without your memories,
you're dead to me.

Man. You totally
saved us back there.

I stopped number six.

in time for this contest.

go watch him play?

Oh, okay.

That was him.

After hearing about Ichinose,

all my memories just
flooded into my mind.

Why'd they return so suddenly?

My junior high days.
The day of the accident.

It was raining that day, too.

Is that why?

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.568 position:50% align:center
I should get home.

it appears this lesion initially

[MORITANI] Minato's struggle
with retrograde amnesia

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:27.752 position:50% align:center
began right here,
on July 18th of last year.

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.295 position:50% align:center
He awakened from his coma,

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
having lost 3 years of memories
leading up to that date.

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
Roughly a year passed,

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center
with no sign that he would
recover those memories.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center
Then you say that he
called you on the phone

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:42.017 position:50% align:center
and told you he suddenly
remembered everything.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50% align:center
And all of this happened
this evening, right?

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:46.521 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:47.939 position:50% align:center
[MORITANI]
Based on that phone call,

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
we can assume he recovered
his junior high memories.

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:54.612 position:50% align:center
And after that call, he crashed
his bike and hit his head again,

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
which caused a second
case of amnesia.

00:10:57.032 --> 00:11:00.577 position:50% align:center
Only this time, these memories
appear to have been lost.

[MORITANI]
As I said previously,

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
our best guess is that
it was latent trauma

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center

original car accident.

What we know for certain

is that his old

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
Why would I ever play
with your sad little club?

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
Because, we're a team.
Don't you--

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Maybe before,
but you know what?

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
I don't remember you,
and I'm glad.

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center
You don't mean that.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.328 position:50% align:center
This isn't really you, right?

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:24.456 position:50% align:center
Why are you being like this?

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center
Because this is the
person he used to be.

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:28.710 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIHARU, JO]
Huh?

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.045 position:50% align:center
Wait, I know you.

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yeah! I was on
your team in junior--

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Oh, that's right.
So that'd make you...

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center
What was your name?

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center
[EITARO grunts]

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
Eitaro. Eitaro Oka.

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Oka, that's right.

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:45.935 position:50% align:center
All right then,
Oka, you tell 'em.

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
Tell these guys who I am.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:49.773 position:50% align:center
Tell them they
don't have the talent

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
to play with someone
like me. Go on.

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
--[TAKEKAZU] What?! You!
--[JO] It's okay, man!

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
Not enough class, either.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.322 position:50% align:center
The hell?!

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
Should've expected this
when I saw your tracksuits.

00:19:59.157 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
"Strange," right?

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
No team worth a damn would
ever be caught dead in those.

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
I'm outta here.

[TAKEKAZU growls]

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI]
Huh? He just left?

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
Yes, without even
telling us where he went.

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.225 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI] But it's good
that he's getting out, right?

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:27.060 position:50% align:center
Maybe he's meeting some friends!

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh! Right!

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
He's probably meeting
those guys from the team!

00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:33.108 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI] I bet he probably
left right before

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
they got here and missed them!

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
Just like him to
have terrible timing!

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:38.530 position:50% align:center
He's so embarrassing sometimes.

00:20:38.613 --> 00:20:41.408 position:50% align:center
I bet they've all found each
other by now, though, right?

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.451 position:50% align:center
Well, I sure do hope so.

00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:45.412 position:50% align:center
--[HIDEKI] Mm!
--[door opens]

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
Huh? Is that him?

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:48.456 position:50% align:center
Welcome home!

What do we do, captain?

[JO]
Hmm...

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
I don't even know
who he is anymore.

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:28.830 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

There's one thing we do know--

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
no Minato means no prefecturals.

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
[sighs] And if this
is how he's gonna be,

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:38.423 position:50% align:center
then I think he's gone for good.

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.010 position:50% align:center
