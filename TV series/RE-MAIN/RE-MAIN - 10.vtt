You seriously don't
know that much?

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
[EITARO] It's when you keep a
hand raised in the air

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:24.556 position:50% align:center
so you can block the ball.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.975 position:50% align:center
But just one, since the
keeper is the only player

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
that can have both
their hands above water.

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
When you're playing defense,

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
you need to keep your hands up
even when you're tired.

the height of his jumps.

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
Looks like I was wrong.

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
I'm a total slouch
compared to this guy.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
He never lets off the gas.
I don't think I've ever met

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
someone half as
dedicated as he is.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
That's true talent.

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
[JO]
Uhh... You okay?

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:07.420 position:50% align:center
Captain, let's strategize
around Minato.

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:08.755 position:50% align:center
[JO]
Wha--?

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
A plan centered on him
is our only shot at a win.

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
I agree. Let's go for it.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
Cool. Does that
work for you guys?

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:17.806 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:19.766 position:50% align:center
[MINATO panting]

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
Hey, guess what?

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.770 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be the
focus of our new strategy.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:26.064 position:50% align:center
Huh? Really?

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chuckles]

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay...

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
Then, let's make some waves.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Hm?

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center
Haven't heard that in a while.

00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Uh?

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center
Look at that.
He's still Minato after all.

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:44.416 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chuckles]

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:46.209 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
What's so funny?

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
[TAKESHI, AKIHISA,
NORIMICHI chuckling]

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.721 position:50% align:center
That was a little creepy.

00:18:57.804 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:01.307 position:50% align:center
Oh, there was something
I wanted to ask you.

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:02.726 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
The first years have been
slacking off a bit lately.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:07.605 position:50% align:center
Do you have a sec
to talk to them for me?

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
[CHINU grunts]
Of course.

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
Sorry to bug you.

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
I don't know why, but they
just listen to you more.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
No prob.

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI]
That's a tough situation.

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
[CHINU]
Yeah. Don't get me wrong--

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.287 position:50% align:center
it feels good that
our captain relies on me,

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
but I'm a little
overwhelmed right now.

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center
I seriously don't
have my act together.

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
I hate to say it,

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:30.962 position:50% align:center
but I really need to concentrate
on myself before big games.

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
Well, then don't
take on any new duties.

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:35.717 position:50% align:center
Speak your mind--be selfish.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
If I'm too selfish, I might
start acting like Minato.

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.723 position:50% align:center
It's wrong to focus on myself

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.475 position:50% align:center
when I have a chance
to help the team.

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
I'll have to make it work.

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI grunts]

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
Whatever you do, it's your call,

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
but don't worry
about what happened.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:51.983 position:50% align:center
[CHINU]
Huh?

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center
I've told you:

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
Ultimately, the team was way
stronger because of him.

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:57.322 position:50% align:center
And if I hadn't quit,

00:19:57.405 --> 00:20:00.116 position:50% align:center
then I wouldn't have
found table tennis.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.619 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know, but it
isn't about all that.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
I just can't stand to be
anywhere near that guy.

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50% align:center
Well, good luck at the tourney.
You'll be great.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
Hey, thanks. Nice to see you.

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:13.880 position:50% align:center
Talking to you before games
is one of my favorite things.

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:15.548 position:50% align:center
It calms me down.

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
You know I'm always
here for you.

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center
[MIKOTO]
Hey, sorry to keep you waiting!

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:20.178 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50% align:center
[MIKOTO]
Oh, hi, Chinu! What's up?

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
Just the usual.

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
I hear you have a big
game soon! Knock 'em dead!

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
I'll give it my best, thanks.

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
See you soon, then.

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
[CHINU]
Yeah.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
Okay, so I tried that
chocolate bar you gave me.

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
[MIKOTO]
Oh, yeah? What did you think?

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI] Blew my mind.
I'm still not over it!

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center
Thank you for dinner.

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:10.228 position:50% align:center
Are you done?
You didn't eat much.

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
I don't wanna upset my stomach.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.982 position:50% align:center
And I've gotta get
to sleep early tonight.

00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:20.488 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:21.322 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
What's up?

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:22.407 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.908 position:50% align:center
I wanna do some push-ups.

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:27.245 position:50% align:center
Is that a bad idea the night
before a game? Wasn't sure.

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Wait, why?

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
Because of the
lactic acid buildup.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:31.875 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Oh. If you really want to,

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.793 position:50% align:center
go ahead and do
a couple of reps.

00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:35.337 position:50% align:center
[TAKEKAZU]
Okay, cool.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.504 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
But if I were you,

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.214 position:50% align:center
I'd definitely do
some stretches first.

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
It's important to loosen up.

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
Hm? [grumbles]

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:46.056 position:50% align:center

Is that all you needed?

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:46.890 position:50% align:center
[TAKEKAZU]
No.

Hm?

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:51.019 position:50% align:center

[EITARO yelps]
I'm super nervous

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:04.824 position:50% align:center
and I thought you
might be able to help.

00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:06.326 position:50% align:center
Do you happen to
have any advice?

00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:08.036 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Yeah; go to sleep!

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:11.039 position:50% align:center

I'd really love to
watch your game.
