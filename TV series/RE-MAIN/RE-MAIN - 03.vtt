[JO]
Shugo Amihama.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:15.348 position:50% align:center
Swims like a shark.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:18.727 position:50% align:center
Last year during the
junior high 100-meter freestyle,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.478 position:50% align:center
he came in third place.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.522 position:50% align:center
But, uh...

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
It looks like he's
already on the track team.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.903 position:50% align:center
Wait, why the track team?!

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:30.822 position:50% align:center
I mean, I get that
there's no swim team here,

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.783 position:50% align:center
but water polo is like
swimming's way hotter cousin!

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.786 position:50% align:center
Why would a swimmer
choose track over us?

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.540 position:50% align:center
Whoever your second
choice is will have to do.

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.208 position:50% align:center
Nope, negatory!

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.253 position:50% align:center
I wanted him to join,
so I don't have a second choice!

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:47.297 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.679 position:50% align:center
All right. If you'd like
to be part of the team,

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
fill out one of these forms
and hand it back.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.309 position:50% align:center
Why do I have to be
the one to talk to him?

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:02.103 position:50% align:center
[JO] Because he swims and
you're water polo famous.

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:03.188 position:50% align:center
Maybe he's a fan.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.898 position:50% align:center
Well, that seems like a stretch.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:08.818 position:50% align:center
You guys leave this to me.
I'll let my fists convince him!

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.571 position:50% align:center
Let's try talking to him
before we commit a felony.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:13.823 position:50% align:center
[BABAYARO grunts]
There he is!

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.951 position:50% align:center
[JO] You're up! Ready? Go!

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:20.538 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Wait, g-go? Like right now?

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:24.668 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hey! Sup, Amihama?

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Aren't you...?

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:28.129 position:50% align:center
Yo! He does recognize him!

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.631 position:50% align:center
[TAKEKAZU] He's got that much
street cred?

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.591 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah.
He's a superstar. Hush!

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:33.218 position:50% align:center
Uh... Sorry, have we met before?

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:35.303 position:50% align:center
I'm in the same class as you.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:37.931 position:50% align:center
[MINATO gasps]

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:40.141 position:50% align:center
I sit up front.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:42.977 position:50% align:center
Oh! Hey, man!

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.938 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Yeah, nope. I've got nothin'.

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:46.606 position:50% align:center
C'mon, ask!

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.358 position:50% align:center
Well? What is it?

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.443 position:50% align:center
Oh, right! I wanted to
talk to you 'cause

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:53.321 position:50% align:center
I heard you were
a great swimmer!

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:54.739 position:50% align:center
And?

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:55.740 position:50% align:center
[MINATO stammers]

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.826 position:50% align:center
Guess the rumor's true.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:58.993 position:50% align:center
Rumor?

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:00.954 position:50% align:center
They say that
he shows no emotion.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:03.790 position:50% align:center
No one ever even saw him
laugh in junior high.

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:07.335 position:50% align:center
That's how he earned
his nickname, "The Mask."

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.630 position:50% align:center
Is that why you made
Minato talk to him for you?

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:12.799 position:50% align:center
Duh. I'm scared.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.301 position:50% align:center
[GROUP grunts]

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:18.346 position:50% align:center
So, uh, I guess
I'll cut to the chase.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.556 position:50% align:center
The water polo team needs a--

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:20.807 position:50% align:center
No thanks.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.935 position:50% align:center
[MINATO grunts]

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.061 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec!

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.647 position:50% align:center
What's track got
that water polo doesn't?

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:29.983 position:50% align:center
Do you really like
running that much?

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.610 position:50% align:center
[SHUGO] No. I'm just
sampling some clubs.

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:34.529 position:50% align:center
Next is kendo, then archery.

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:36.614 position:50% align:center
I'll decide which
one to join later.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:37.991 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.743 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case, why not
add water polo to your--

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50% align:center
I'm never swimming again!

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:42.662 position:50% align:center
[MINATO gasps]

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.247 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.417 position:50% align:center
So just leave me alone.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.960 position:50% align:center
[MINATO grunts]

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:52.255 position:50% align:center
What? Why the hell would a fish
like that give up his gills?

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.632 position:50% align:center
Don't look at me.

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:57.510 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Man...
I must've really hit a nerve.

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50% align:center
This might be
a battle we can't win.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.275 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 3A]
So, in the short story...

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
[MINATO sighs] Guess we're stuck
with six out of seven members.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:42.615 position:50% align:center
I can't even compete,
let alone be Okayama's best.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center
And if I'm not Okayama's best...

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
Dish out what you owe me if not!

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
[MINATO groans]

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.168 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
What's this guy's deal, anyway?

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:56.546 position:50% align:center
Why would a national-level
athlete suddenly just quit?

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
An injury?

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 3A]
Amihama.

00:04:58.923 --> 00:04:59.924 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.384 position:50% align:center
[SHUGO]
Yes, sir.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
Motojiro Kajii: "Lemon."

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
"An accursed swelling
constricted around my heart!

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
Was it frustration,
disgust, or the catarrh?

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:14.981 position:50% align:center
It clung to my insides,
like a terrible hangover.

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
One that came from drinking
all day, every day,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
wreaking havoc with
a gruesome vengeance."

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.696 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Wow, he's going all out!

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
I kinda feel like we should
clap. Would that be weird?

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
So I've been watching Amihama.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
I think he always gives 100%,
no matter what he's doing.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Dude doesn't
seem like the type.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
it's weird he quit swimming.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.797 position:50% align:center
So? Got any theories on
why he might've dropped?

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
Good question.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
Maybe he just got
over his damage.

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
I talked to somebody who runs
in the same circles as him.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
They said Amihama first
joined the swim team

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center
so he could beat
his older brother at it.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.394 position:50% align:center
Wait, really?

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:55.146 position:50% align:center
Oh. So he must have quit when
he got better than his brother.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.232 position:50% align:center
That would explain it,
wouldn't it?

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess.

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
[BABAYARO]
If that's true,

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
then he has no reason
to get back in the water.

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Hmm...

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50% align:center
What if...?

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.200 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Hm?

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
Uh... No, it's nothing.

Got an idea?
'Cause we could use one!

Mm!

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIHARU]
Mm... Just a thought,

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.420 position:50% align:center
but what if we
could help Amihama

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.672 position:50% align:center
find a reason to join us?

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.173 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:25.593 position:50% align:center
Inspire him and get him to see
what he's missing out on.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
[BABAYARO]
Wow! I had no idea!

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
Water polo sounds like
a great way to get fit!

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIHARU]
It's more than just swimming.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
You can do things such as
jump and, or shoot!

Don't even get me started on

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.115 position:50% align:center
what it does for
your abdominals.

Well, maybe I should strongly
consider joining then!

if I play water polo,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
can I get super jacked, too?

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.850 position:50% align:center
If you're dedicated, sure!

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.561 position:50% align:center
