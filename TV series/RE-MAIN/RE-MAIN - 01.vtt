00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:22.272 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
What? Where am I?

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.983 position:50% align:center
Looks like I'm underwater.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
What's that? A ball?

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:33.825 position:50% align:center
I'm so confused. Why am I here?

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Wait! What's going on?

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.215 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI] So, I raised my hand,
'cause I had a really good idea,

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.134 position:50% align:center
and then you know
what my teacher said?

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:54.220 position:50% align:center
She goes, "I don't think
Asumi will know this one,

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:56.848 position:50% align:center
but let's hear what
she has to say anyway."

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:58.683 position:50% align:center
Isn't that, like,
the meanest thing?

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.810 position:50% align:center
I couldn't believe
she just said that!

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.189 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI hums]

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:08.526 position:50% align:center
Well, turns out she was right;
I really didn't know the answer.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.072 position:50% align:center
Oh, right! I was
s'posed to go shopping!

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.824 position:50% align:center
Mom says that onion
sprouts are cheap today.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.911 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow!

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.583 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:33.134 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI] Doctor!
He's awake! My brother's awake!

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.011 position:50% align:center
[NURSE 1A] Nursing staff,
please report to room 24.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.846 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
I was finally up.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.682 position:50% align:center
[NURSE 1A] Nursing staff,
please report to room 24.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:43.853 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Awake for the
first time in 203 days.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.074 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Okay. So here's
what I've been told.

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:22.035 position:50% align:center
I played water polo for
three years in middle school.

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
I can't really
remember any of it,

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
but apparently, back then,
I was an incredible player!

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
Our team went on to
win a national tournament

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:32.879 position:50% align:center
during the winter of my third
year, called the Momotaro Cup.

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
There were even some
high-school teams playing there,

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50% align:center
so it was a pretty
huge deal for us to win.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:41.346 position:50% align:center
My mother and sister came to
cheer me on at the big game,

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.556 position:50% align:center
but afterwards, when we
were heading back home,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
we got into a car crash.

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center
Turns out the accident was
so awful, it put me in a coma.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.856 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe it now,

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center
but I was unconscious for
six months and three weeks.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.362 position:50% align:center
And when I finally woke up,

00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:01.616 position:50% align:center
I'd completely lost
three years of my memories.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
It'll take some
time, of course...

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
I can't remember a single thing

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:05.995 position:50% align:center
that happened in middle school.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
It's a total blank.

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:08.915 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI]
Yeah!

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:11.835 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] So, in a way, it's
like I'm back in sixth grade,

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.962 position:50% align:center
which is a pretty weird feeling.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.881 position:50% align:center
My mom and dad both
look older than I remember,

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
and Asumi's gotten so big!
She's in junior high now,

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.763 position:50% align:center
so it feels like
she's older than me!

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.015 position:50% align:center
So?

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Hm?

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:28.643 position:50% align:center
Are you starting to
remember anything yet?

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center
Uh, no. Not yet.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.147 position:50% align:center
[TAEKO]
Hmm.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
Well, there's no hurry.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
The doc told us what the best
medicine for memory loss is.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
Patience!

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.280 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] I don't mind not
remembering things.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
I'm just happy to be alive.

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:47.662 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's not like I can't
make new memories, right?

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
[KEITA, KOKI, BIZEN]
Excuse us!

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.457 position:50% align:center
Oh! They're here!

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
Come on in!

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Hm? Hm?

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Uhh...

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
--[KEITA cries] Minato!
--[KOKI cries] You're okay!

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center
Uh, all right.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50% align:center
[KEITA]
Oh, right! Don't wanna hurt you.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
Sorry... Excited.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.359 position:50% align:center
No. It's not that.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but... who are you?

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50% align:center
[KEITA, KOKI gasp]

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center
They're your friends! You know,
from the water polo team?

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:31.706 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
--[rustling]
--[TAEKO] Thank you.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
That's very kind of you.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
This is Mr. Bizen,
your team's coach.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.799 position:50% align:center
Uh, hi.

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:42.467 position:50% align:center
It's been a while.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
Hang on! I can't just accept
this! You don't know who we are?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
After all we've been through?

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50% align:center
[BIZEN]
Momo. Calm down.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
We were Shogaku's
Elite Four, remember?

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.520 position:50% align:center
We all won nationals together!

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:57.524 position:50% align:center
There's no way you
forgot about that! Right?

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.734 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
[MOMO sniffs]

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.625 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] I thought
it'd look a lot different

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.419 position:50% align:center
but not much has changed here.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
You lost three years
of memories, not 20.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.466 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:29.973 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
I've changed more than anything.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center
I'm 20 centimeters taller,

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
and my face looks
so much older now.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
Kinda surreal.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] After four
solid months of rehab,

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.652 position:50% align:center
my doctors finally decided
I was in good enough shape

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center
to leave the hospital, and
go back home with my family.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
We live at my dad's store,
"Memory Shop Kiyomizu,"

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center
a name which is
kind of awkward now.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
But we called it that
because it's a souvenir shop,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
located in Kurashiki Bikan.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.168 position:50% align:center
We mainly sell trinkets
and knick knacks.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.545 position:50% align:center
But also, jeans!

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:02.630 position:50% align:center
Home sweet home.

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:05.925 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Just like the rest of the town,

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
this place really
hasn't changed much.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
[MINATO gasps]
Wait! Kamekichi?

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so?

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
"Yeah, so"?!

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
When I last saw him, he was
just an itty-bitty shell baby!

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI] He grew up and got a
job. He's the shop mascot now.

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
You are, buddy?

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's my good working boy.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:27.113 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
No! It can't be.

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
Did it sell?

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:34.287 position:50% align:center
Did someone pay for
that thing with money?

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:37.499 position:50% align:center
Whoa, nope! No, they did not!

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.084 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] This is a quote
unquote "piece of art"

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
I made back in fourth grade.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
I've been hoping someone
would buy it ever since, but...

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.341 position:50% align:center
Of course no one bought it.

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
No one can even stand
to look at that thing.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.762 position:50% align:center
[MINATO sighs]
The world's not ready for it.

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50% align:center
So many great artists like me go
underappreciated in their time.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.185 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI] Looks like
you're just as dumb as ever.

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:58.561 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
I hoped you would be.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.652 position:50% align:center
[MINATO chuckles]

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.612 position:50% align:center
[TAEKO]
There they are.

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:11.449 position:50% align:center
Look at you two. I really
missed my little comedy duo.

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI] We're not a duo,
Mom; that's lame!

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
[TAEKO chuckles]

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.373 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Minato.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
Oh. No. It was just
a little bit lame.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:24.295 position:50% align:center
No, I mean I'm sorry
about the accident.

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't--

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.465 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's why you're sorry?

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
Mom! Don't do that!
Everything's great!

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
We're back at home in the
Kiyomizu house again, after all.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.389 position:50% align:center
And our house is...

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI]
...our happy place!

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:39.602 position:50% align:center
Exactly. Things'll be
back to normal in no time!

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
[TAEKO]
Mm! You're right.

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] When I saw how
forced my mom's smile was,

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:49.237 position:50% align:center
I knew I had to do
something big to cheer her up.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
Hey, know what?

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.616 position:50% align:center
I think I wanna go back
to playing water polo again.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
Maybe that'll help us get
some normal back in our lives.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center
 Trust me; I'll be champion
again before you know it!

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Maybe I spoke too soon.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
It looks like
someone doctored my face

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
onto someone else's body.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.842 position:50% align:center
And what's up
with those weird hats?

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:14.929 position:50% align:center
[MINATO grunts]

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
So many water polo books.

Let's see what this one's about.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] "Remain. One type of
rule violation in water polo.

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
Refers to receiving
the ball within two meters

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.785 position:50% align:center
of the opponent's goal.

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:39.913 position:50% align:center
To 'remain offside' is
the act of remaining near

the opponent's goal."

[MINATO groans]
What language is this?!

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:58.348 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Oh, man.
Look how muscular I was.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Well, RIP to
being ripped! Unreal!

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
You sleep for six months

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50% align:center
and your muscles
deflate like balloons?

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
I can't play like this! I'll
just go up to Mom and I'll say,

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
"I think I've
outgrown water polo!"

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
If I tell her now,
it'll hurt less, right?

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 1C] I'm looking for a

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.255 position:50% align:center
[TAEKO] Sure, we can order
that for you. No problem.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
[MINATO sighs]
What to do? This sucks.

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.644 position:50% align:center
I never should have
told her I'd play again.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center

Hm?

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center

Of course you can
help me, Minato!

I've been looking
everywhere for you

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.295 position:50% align:center
since Asumi said you were back!

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:54.756 position:50% align:center
Um, sorry, do I know
you from somewhere?

you complimented my specs?

"Rockin' glasses, Eitaro!"

That doesn't sound like me.

The big guns then!

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
You were the one who showed me
the joys of playing water polo!

how to do the eggbeater kick!

Fine then.

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
At least tell me which high
school you're gonna go to.

Uh, high school?

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
Shogakukan has
its own high school.

Only problem is it's
difficult to get into.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.005 position:50% align:center
And from what I heard,

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
you probably aren't
gonna make the cut.

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:40.719 position:50% align:center
So where do you think you'll go?

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center

I forgot that I was in middle
school before the accident!

Do you know what that means?

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center

into high school now,

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center

So? What's the big announcement?

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.257 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] It's not so
much an announcement.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
Just something I wanted
to get off my chest.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.096 position:50% align:center
Oh. Is this about water polo?

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.931 position:50% align:center
You're gonna play again, right?

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
Well, I was going
to at first, but no.

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:14.437 position:50% align:center

I thought maybe you guys

you'll have extra free time.

Why?

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:01.192 position:50% align:center
You've gotta do three years'
worth of studying,

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:02.694 position:50% align:center
and you're not
the brightest bulb.

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:04.988 position:50% align:center

how about you explain to me

how I can be dumb when
I already know I'm an idiot!

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:09.159 position:50% align:center
[ASUMI] It's called
a brief moment of clarity!

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? It takes
an idiot to know one,

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center

Yeah, as if.

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
But I did enter Yamanami High,

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center

How'd you know
I went to school here?

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
I asked Asumi about
your academic plans

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
and made sure
I got enrolled here, too!

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Why would you
come here just because of me?!

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
Well, you chose this school

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
specifically to play
water polo, right?

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.197 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Uh?

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
No use hiding it.
I know they have a club here!

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:39.494 position:50% align:center
I only enrolled here because
of my entrance exam grades!

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center
And also 'cause it's
close to where I live!

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
That's it!

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:45.458 position:50% align:center
Kidder! You signed up yet
or should we both go?

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center
I'm finished with water polo!
So drop it, all right?

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.421 position:50% align:center

[STUDENTS]
Hm?

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:15.507 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't play a sport
just because it's popular.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
You should play it
'cause it's your passion.

if I hit a growth spurt,

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:02.429 position:50% align:center
I might be better
off in basketball.

Hey, you're Minato Kiyomizu!

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
I knew that was you!

Oh, c'mon! Drop the
ugly name and face!

That's rude to people named
Taro Tanaka! And to my face!

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.613 position:50% align:center
You can't lie to me, man--
I've seen you!

No! Uh. That was a misprint!

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:27.287 position:50% align:center
