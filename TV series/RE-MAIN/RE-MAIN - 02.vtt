Wow, uh, thanks, but...

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.441 position:50% align:center
Wha... What did you do that for?

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:29.571 position:50% align:center
I see. The rumors were true.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.448 position:50% align:center
Rumors?

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.825 position:50% align:center
You lost your memories. Right?

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:35.160 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, yeah!

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50% align:center
Didn't know that'd get me
a kiss from the Chinu!

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
So you do know my name!

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
That article--
it had your name in it.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:44.502 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:48.506 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, were we,
like, an item?

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.424 position:50% align:center
[CHINU]
Item?

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
Well, you did kiss me,

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:53.094 position:50% align:center
so we must have had
something special going on.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.346 position:50% align:center
It's a real shame
I can't remember

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
all the romantic
memories we made.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.058 position:50% align:center
But since you're my girlfriend,

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.935 position:50% align:center

bring them all back!

Huh?

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.195 position:50% align:center
Look, I hardly know you. This
is, like, our third meeting.

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:11.404 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.198 position:50% align:center
The first time we talked
was in ninth grade.

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:15.408 position:50% align:center
We were both at a spring event.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:22.832 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] You dropped your towel.
I let you know I saw it fall.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.129 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] And then you turned
around and said, "Oh, thanks."

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.506 position:50% align:center
That was it.

The second time
we talked was over there.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.472 position:50% align:center
One summer, you just
showed up here at my school.

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:41.601 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] You said you liked me
since the whole towel thing.

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:43.520 position:50% align:center
And kinda spilled
your guts to me.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:44.562 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Big yikes.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:45.689 position:50% align:center
[CHINU]
I was gonna leave,

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.649 position:50% align:center
but you got really
desperate and said,

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:50.193 position:50% align:center
"When I'm Japan's best
middle-school water polo player,

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.945 position:50% align:center
you owe me kiss. Deal?"

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.447 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Okay, so we've
established that I was a mess.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.865 position:50% align:center
What happened next?

00:01:55.949 --> 00:02:00.036 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] You said, "Bet you
 110,000 yen I can do it."

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.913 position:50% align:center
I agreed to that
so you'd shut up.

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:03.206 position:50% align:center
Ah! I said that?

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.417 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, talk about
embarrassing!

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
Wait, why 110,000?
That's specific.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.170 position:50% align:center
It included tax.

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:10.839 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, naturally.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.966 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] So, since
you won the Momotaro Cup,

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.592 position:50% align:center
I came to find you.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:16.803 position:50% align:center
Can't have you saying
I didn't keep my word.

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:18.930 position:50% align:center
Well, that explains a lot.

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:22.600 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] Mm? Isn't that
a Yamanami uniform?

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.770 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] Why go there?
They don't have a good team.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.897 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm not playing
water polo there.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.065 position:50% align:center
It's just close to my house.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.276 position:50% align:center
What do you mean
you're not playing?!

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.530 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] I-I can't. I don't
even remember how to play.

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:39.409 position:50% align:center
So, yeah, "Japan's best"
is probably out.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.744 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.872 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] Well, I guess
that means I won the bet.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.540 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.251 position:50% align:center
[JO]
An accident, huh?

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:51.463 position:50% align:center
Must have messed him up pretty
bad if his grades took a hit.

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.423 position:50% align:center
That's not all.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center
[JO grunts] Wait, is he
so jacked up he can't play?

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:57.927 position:50% align:center
I think so, yeah.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50% align:center
[JO]
Oh, my God!

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.724 position:50% align:center
He was supposed to be
the star of the team!

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:05.810 position:50% align:center
You got a plan B? 'Cause
he's stepping away for good.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:08.188 position:50% align:center
I don't think there's
any changing his mind.

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, look, there he is.

I'll join!

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:16.112 position:50% align:center

I'll join!

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:19.491 position:50% align:center

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:24.037 position:50% align:center
I'll join water polo!

Huh?

[MINATO groans]

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:08.141 position:50% align:center
[CHINU] Well, I guess
that means I won the bet.

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
You must not remember
the other half of our deal.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
The other half?

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
If you became Japan's
best high-school player,

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center
then I would have
to start dating you.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center
Wha...?

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
I said no.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:22.113 position:50% align:center
So you said you'd pay
220,000 yen if you failed.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
And I wasn't gonna
turn that down.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.368 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] That doesn't count as
an actual bet, though, does it?

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
What? Yes it does! I kissed you!

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
It's your turn to
hold up your end!

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:31.748 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm sorry,

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
but the odds on that are
like a billion to one now.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
Whatever happened to you,
it sure left you pathetic.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.181 position:50% align:center

Whatever. I'm outta here.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Hm? W-Wait, I'll do it!

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
I'll pay the 220k!

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
You're unbelievable!

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.354 position:50% align:center
[MINATO whimpers]

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.314 position:50% align:center
You're not even going
to try playing again?

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:57.899 position:50% align:center
I didn't take you for a quitter.

00:05:57.982 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50% align:center

I mean, c'mon. "Japan's best?"

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.986 position:50% align:center
Fine. Okayama's best then.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50% align:center

[MINATO]
Well, here we go.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.918 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] After I officially
signed up for the team,

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:20.046 position:50% align:center
I decided it was time to break
the news to my family again.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.466 position:50% align:center
That way, there'd be no
turning back if I got cold feet.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.510 position:50% align:center
Well, I hope you're not
doing it for our sake.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
Are you sure this
is what you want?

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
A hundred percent sure!

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50% align:center
I must return--the water
is calling out to me.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.520 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Yeah, more like my
wallet is calling out to me.

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
Goodness! The water, really?

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.482 position:50% align:center
Oh, he's hearing voices.

I know you will.

smiling faces,

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.919 position:50% align:center
I can already tell
I made the right choice.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Having said that, let's be real.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center
It's water polo.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.511 position:50% align:center
How does someone train
for a sport like that?

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.848 position:50% align:center
Swimming? Lifting?
Maybe something else.

Huh?

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
You didn't tell us
you were famous, Kiyomizu!

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
Yeah, who knew?

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.398 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

these on our desks.

What's wrong with flexing

Okay, first of all,
I have no muscle!

I may have been
before the accident,

too much pressure.

I knew I had to sign up.

[MINATO stammers]
What I said?

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.929 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize it
was inspirational.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center

Uh?

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
It's something
a patissier once said.

Oh.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Who just goes
around quoting patissiers?

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:12.445 position:50% align:center

[MINATO] Why do we keep bringing
up dads?

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center
And you want to join because...?

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
Just because.

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
You don't say.

I'm gonna go now.

[EITARO] We're happy to
have you all the same!

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey! We should
all go check out the pool!

[MINATO chuckles]

00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:03.329 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] Club life is about
to begin! Right! Let's do this!

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
Now, witness the wonder.
Behold our magnificent pool!

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.587 position:50% align:center
[MINATO gasps]

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:15.342 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Huh. That's different.

00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:21.264 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] So apparently, the pool
was once used for swim classes.

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
But over time, people kinda
forgot about it and let it go.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
Since it was so deep,

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.980 position:50% align:center
some students got the idea
to use it for water polo.

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center
And the school eventually
gave them permission

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:33.318 position:50% align:center
to go for it and form a team.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:37.447 position:50% align:center
Problem is, it's outside and
chilly for most of the year.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.992 position:50% align:center
Solution: They laid out a blue
cover to keep the water warm.

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.994 position:50% align:center
The school also went ahead
and built a little shack

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
with a bath in it
for the players to soak in.

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
If it's an extra cold day,
they train by wearing wet suits.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
Or so blondie here says.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
So? Everybody still with me?

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:57.425 position:50% align:center
--[EITARO] I guess.
--[YOSHIHARU] Yeah.

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
Water polo sounds crazy intense.

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.346 position:50% align:center
It's not easy, that's for sure.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.181 position:50% align:center
'Specially not with
a setup like this.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:04.599 position:50% align:center
[JO]
Get this.

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
I started school here last year,
but there was no team;

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
they'd been disbanded
for a full decade!

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Hm?

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:15.819 position:50% align:center
Get it? I'm the one who brought
this club back from the dead!

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:17.445 position:50% align:center
I had a pretty rough start.

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
I went around asking everyone
in sight to join the team.

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:23.493 position:50% align:center
Somehow, I managed to
convince six others to join

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
and we were ready to start
playing matches!

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.915 position:50% align:center
Thing is, none of them
really got into it.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:32.293 position:50% align:center
Soon enough,
I was the only one left.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:35.672 position:50% align:center
Just getting to compete
became my dream.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
My spirits weren't
crushed, though.

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
I kept up with cleaning the pool

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.595 position:50% align:center
and stayed sharp
with my training.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:43.763 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:46.099 position:50% align:center
I had to be ready.
Eventually new members

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.560 position:50% align:center
were bound to hear
the call of the ball.

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:49.728 position:50% align:center

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.399 position:50% align:center

Not to spoil the moment, but...

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
Are you the only

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.322 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
This is the entire team?

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:03.867 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
Don't you need seven to play?

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:06.703 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
Meaning we're short.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:08.872 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.623 position:50% align:center
Will you quit saying
"yup" already?

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
Without seven,
we don't even have a team!

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.713 position:50% align:center
Oh, great.

your new teammate!

Step this way, sir!

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:40.278 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Whoa, yikes!

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
This guy does not look
like the water polo type.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.282 position:50% align:center
More like an
underground fighter!

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
First things first!
I got a request for ya.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:49.371 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah, dude!
You can name it.

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center
[TAKEKAZU]
I wanna play keeper if I join.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center
We'll never lose, 'cause
no one will ever score on us!

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:56.920 position:50% align:center
[JO] Sorry. That position
belongs to me.

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:58.922 position:50% align:center
But you can pick
any of the others.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
[TAKEKAZU] Eh? And just whose
decision was that, captain?

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
I mean, it was kinda the only
position I could train solo for,

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
so it's mine.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
Oh, so since you were
the only one around,

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.184 position:50% align:center
you gave yourself the job.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:12.394 position:50% align:center
Your point?

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center
Seems kinda unfair.

After all, I might be
better than you are.

supposed to know?

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
[EITARO] Question. Have you
played water polo before?

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:34.916 position:50% align:center
Never. But with my raw talent,
it oughta be a cinch.
