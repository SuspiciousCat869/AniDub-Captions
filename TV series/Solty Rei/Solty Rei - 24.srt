1
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,666
- Solty: EIRENE.
SHE'S COMING DOWN.

2
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,000
SHE'S COMING TO
DESTROY THE CITY.

3
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,333
- Rose: EIRENE? WHO?

4
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,750
- SHE'S ONE OF
THE THREE ORIGINAL

5
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,541
COLONIZATION CONTROL COMPUTERS.

6
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,416
EUNOMIA'S SISTER, YOU MIGHT SAY.

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,041
EIRENE WAS THE CORE COMPUTER
OF OUR COLONY SHIP,

8
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,750
BUT WE LOST CONTACT WITH HER.

9
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,333
APPARENTLY, THOUGH,
ALL THIS TIME,

10
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,666
SHE'S STILL BEEN OUT THERE,

11
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,125
LOOKING DOWN ON THIS CITY
FOR THE LAST 200 YEARS.

12
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,833
- YOU MEAN FROM OUTER SPACE?

13
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,916
- SO, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,
NOW IT'S GOING TO CRASH?

14
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,041
- YES.

15
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,458
- WAIT A MINUTE.

16
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,541
YOU SAID THERE WERE THREE
OF THESE COLONY COMPUTERS.

17
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,958
BUT EUNOMIA AND EIRENE.
THAT'S JUST TWO, RIGHT?

18
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,125
SO, WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ONE?

19
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,500
- SHE'S HERE.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,958
HMM.

21
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,541
- YOU DON'T MEAN... SOLTY?

22
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,583
- SOLTY?

23
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,041
- IF EIRENE HAS HER WAY,

24
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,625
THE ENTIRE CITY WILL BE
COMPLETELY DESTROYED.

25
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,041
- WHAT PURPOSE?

26
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,375
- SHE WANTS TO REWRITE
HUMAN HISTORY. AND TO DO THAT...

27
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,208
- SHE NEEDS A BLANK SLATE.

28
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:47,000
- WHICH IS WHY I HAVE TO GO
UP THERE, AND TRY TO STOP HER.

29
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,083
- Woman on TV: THE ESTIMATED
TIME OF TOMORROW'S CRASH

30
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,083
HAS BEEN RELEASED.

31
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:54,125
- TOMORROW. SO...

32
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,333
- WHAT'S WRONG, ROY?

33
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,458
AREN'T YOU GOING TO
FINISH YOUR BREAKFAST?

34
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,458
- COME ON, SIT DOWN!
- I'M GOING OUT.

35
00:01:58,541 --> 00:01:59,750
- Woman on TV:
EXPECTED IMPACT ZONE

36
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,708
IN THE VICINITY OF
THE CITY CENTER.

37
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,250
- SOLTY...

38
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,875
- STAY CALM, PEOPLE!
NO PUSHING, LET'S GO!

39
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,375
- ( cars honking )

40
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,041
- ( indistinct chattering )

41
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,625
- Policeman: PLEASE,
KEEP MOVING FORWARD!

42
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,708
THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM
FOR EVERYONE DOWN HERE!

43
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:20,541
RELIEF TENTS HAVE BEEN
SET UP TO PROVIDE YOU...

44
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,708
- Man: HEARD EVERYONE
TOPSIDE IS BEING EVACUATED

45
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,250
TO THE UNDERGROUND CITY.

46
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,916
- WHAT'S THE POINT? IF THAT
COLONY SHIP LANDS ON OUR HEADS,

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,041
THIS WHOLE PLACE IS
GOING TO CAVE IN, YOU KNOW?

48
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,791
- YEAH.

49
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,791
- I HEARD SOMETHING
ON THE NEWS, THOUGH.

50
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,583
SAID THEY GOT THIS CRACK
TEAM OF ENGINEERS FROM R.U.C.

51
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,083
AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR

52
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,458
WORKING ON A PLAN TO BLOW UP
THE SHIP BEFORE IT CRASHES.

53
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,083
CROSS YOUR FINGERS, RIGHT?

54
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,625
- GUESS JUST ABOUT
EVERYBODY'S GONE UNDERGROUND.

55
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,750
NOTHING LIKE THE END OF
THE WORLD TO KILL OFF BUSINESS.

56
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:58,541
SO, WHAT'S YOUR STORY? WHAT'RE
YOU STILL DOING OUT HERE?

57
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,041
- I DON'T KNOW, REALLY.

58
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,083
I GUESS I JUST HAD A FEELING
THAT MAYBE YOU'D BE HERE.

59
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,583
- OH, REALLY?

60
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,041
- WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU COULD
HAVE CLOSED A LONG TIME AGO?

61
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,541
- WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

62
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,625
GUESS I HAD A FEELING IF
I WAITED, MAYBE YOU'D COME BY.

63
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,750
- OH. COOL.

64
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,041
- ANYWAY, YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GET TO THE SHELTER.

65
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,625
I BET YOUR FAMILY'S WORRIED.

66
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,791
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

67
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,583
I... I DON'T HAVE A FAMILY.

68
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,208
- OH.
- DO YOU?

69
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:30,916
- NO. THEY ALL DIED. MY WIFE,
KIDS. TWELVE YEARS AGO.

70
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,750
- OH.

71
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,000
- SAY...

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,375
LISTEN, IF YOU AND ME...

73
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,916
IF WE SOMEHOW MANAGE
TO LIVE THROUGH THIS,

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,125
I WAS THINKING, MAYBE...

75
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,291
- Roy: SARA...

76
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,083
I...

77
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,416
- Solty: IS THIS WHAT
I'M GOING TO USE?

78
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,625
- Joseph: MMM-HMM.
IT'S THE SHIP ASHLEY BUILT.

79
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,166
IT SUSTAINED A FAIR AMOUNT
OF INCIDENTAL DAMAGE,

80
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,375
BUT FORTUNATELY,

81
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,666
THE MAIN SYSTEMS WERE
MOSTLY STILL INTACT.

82
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,875
R.U.C. IS DEVOTING ALL OF ITS
RESOURCES TO THE REPAIR EFFORT.

83
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,541
IT SHOULD BE READY
IN A MATTER OF HOURS.

84
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,791
- GOOD.

85
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:15,125
BUT STILL, I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE
TO SEND YOU UP ALL ALONE.

86
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:19,458
- NO, IT'S OKAY. I DON'T MIND.
I'M HAPPY TO DO MY PART.

87
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,208
AFTER ALL, YOU'VE DONE
TO GET THE SHIP READY,

88
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,833
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

89
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,083
- HEY! SOLTY!

90
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,583
- ( chuckles )

91
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,333
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
OKAY WITH THIS?

92
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:36,000
YOU DO REALIZE YOUR CHANCES OF
RETURNING ARE NEXT TO NIL.

93
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:40,708
- I'M SURE EVERYONE WOULD...
- IT'S OKAY, JOSEPH. I WANT TO.

94
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,833
- HA. I CAN'T GET OVER IT.

95
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,750
UP IN SPACE, BACK WHEN YOU
WERE STILL KNOWN AS DIIKE,

96
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,875
YOU WERE JUST SO COLD,
AND MECHANICAL.

97
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,916
TO BE HONEST, I FOUND IT
RATHER UNSETTLING.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,625
BUT NOW, YOU HAVE
SUCH A WARM SMILE.

99
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,583
I SUPPOSE WE HAVE ROY
TO THANK FOR THAT.

100
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,625
- ( giggles )

101
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,416
- Miranda: OH, SOLTY.
ARE YOU ALL BY YOURSELF?

102
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,083
- YEAH, WELL, ROY HAD
TO GO OUT FOR A WHILE,

103
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,000
AND ROSE SAID SHE WASN'T HUNGRY.

104
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,250
- IT'S A SHAME.

105
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,916
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A DINNER PARTY FOR YOU.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,916
HOPED EVERYONE WOULD BE HERE.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,416
WELL? HOW IS IT?
DO YOU LIKE IT?

108
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,166
- YES! IT'S DELICIOUS.
I GIVE IT A 10 OUT OF 10!

109
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,500
- ( chuckles ) GOOD,
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD.

110
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,458
YOU KNOW, SOLTY,
IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR

111
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,833
SINCE YOU CAME TO LIVE WITH US.

112
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,208
- OH, I GUESS IT HAS.

113
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,083
- AND, WELL, I WAS THINKING,
WE'LL HAVE TO THROW YOU

114
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,291
A BIRTHDAY PARTY
WHEN YOU COME BACK!

115
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,000
OH, BUT I FORGOT, YOU DON'T
KNOW YOUR BIRTHDAY, DO YOU?

116
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,000
- ACTUALLY, UM, BY THE
CURRENT CALENDAR,

117
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,791
I THINK IT WOULD BE JUNE 30TH.

118
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,875
- OH, WELL, THAT'S COMING
RIGHT UP, ISN'T IT?

119
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,333
AND HOW OLD ARE YOU GOING TO BE?

120
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:48,083
- I'D, UH, RATHER NOT SAY.
IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING.

121
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,708
- FAIR ENOUGH. AS LONG AS
WE CAN STILL HAVE THE PARTY?

122
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,791
- SURE!

123
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,791
- KASHA, IS SOMETHING WRONG?
YOU'VE HARDLY TOUCHED YOUR FOOD.

124
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:57,916
- IT'S REALLY GOOD.

125
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,875
- HEY, SOLTY?
- YES?

126
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,750
- YOU ARE GOING TO
COME BACK, AREN'T YOU?

127
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,625
- KASHA.

128
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,791
- JUST TELL ME.

129
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,250
I MEAN IT, JUST TELL ME!

130
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,500
DON'T SIT THERE PRETENDING LIKE
EVERYTHING'S OKAY WHEN IT'S NOT.

131
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,375
I MEAN, THERE'S A CHANCE
YOU COULD GET KILLED

132
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,041
UP THERE, RIGHT?
BUT IF YOU DON'T GO,

133
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,583
THIS THING'S GOING TO CRASH
AND THEN WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE.

134
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,625
( crying )

135
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,333
I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.
I REALLY DON'T.

136
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:30,208
BUT STILL! IF IT MEANS LOSING
YOU, I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO!

137
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,083
- KASHA.

138
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,000
- Miranda: SO, YOU'RE BACK.

139
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,208
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
YOU KNOW, ROY, YOU'RE AMAZING.

141
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,583
- HMM?
- ( chuckles ) I MEAN IT.

142
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,000
- OH, YEAH? HOW YOU FIGURE?

143
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,041
- DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST
MET KASHA? HOW HARD IT WAS?

144
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,708
- ♪ I WISH FOR
YOUR HAPPINESS ♪

145
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:11,958
- FOR THE LONGEST TIME,

146
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,541
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME.

147
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,041
- ( scoffs ) YOU HAD
YOUR HANDS FULL.

148
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,041
- I THINK IT WAS TWO FULL
YEARS BEFORE SHE WARMED UP

149
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,875
TO ME ENOUGH TO CALL ME "MOM."

150
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,416
BUT WITH YOU AND SOLTY, IT
HASN'T EVEN BEEN A YEAR YET

151
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,083
AND ALREADY YOU'VE
BECOME A FAMILY.

152
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,833
LIKE I SAID, AMAZING.

153
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,875
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HIDING UP HERE ALL BY YOURSELF?

154
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,416
YOU REALLY SHOULD BE
SPENDING TIME WITH HER.

00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:43,041
- IT'S FUNNY, HUH? YOU KNOW,
THE WAY THINGS STARTED OUT?

157
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,416
THAT GIRL WAS NOTHING
BUT A PAIN IN MY ASS.

158
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,583
JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE
AND STARTED SCREWING UP MY LIFE.

159
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,708
BUT THEN, SOMEHOW,
BEFORE I KNEW IT,

160
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,041
I COULDN'T EVEN
LIVE WITHOUT HER.

161
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,708
- YEAH.

162
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,583
- AND NOW, IF I DON'T LET
HER GO FLYING OFF TOMORROW,

163

EVERYONE HERE IS GOING TO DIE.

IN THIS WHOLE DAMN CITY IS
COUNTING ON HER TO SAVE THEM!

166
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,333
SHE'S GOT TO SHOULDER
THAT BURDEN BY HERSELF,

167
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,666
AND THERE'S NOTHING I
CAN DO TO STOP HER!

168
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,625
- IT'S HARD. I KNOW.

169
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,041
- ( crying ) AND I
CAN'T EVEN SAY GOODBYE.

170
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,083
IF I DO, IT'S LIKE TELLING
HER I THINK IT'S OKAY,

171
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,083
SENDING HER OUT THERE
ALL ALONE TO DIE.

172
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,625
- THAT'S WHY
YOU WON'T GO SEE HER?

173
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,416
- I... I CAN'T.

174
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,000
IT'S JUST... WHY DO THEY
ALWAYS HAVE TO LEAVE ME?

I GUESS I REALLY SHOULD
HAVE ASKED YOU

BEFORE I BORROWED YOUR SUIT.

182
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,500
- NAH, FORGET ABOUT IT.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,291
I WANT TO THANK YOU.

00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,208
BUT FIRST I NEED YOU TO GO
UP THERE AND MAKE SURE

WE EVEN HAVE A FUTURE.

SO, COME BACK SAFE, OKAY?

00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,166
- OKAY. I'LL TRY NOT

00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,333
I AM TOTALLY GOING
TO KICK YOUR BUTT

205
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,458
FOR PUTTING ME THROUGH THIS!

207
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,083
BUT, I'LL TRY TO GET OVER IT.

YOU WANT TO SAY TO HER,

NOW IS THE TIME.

212
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,916
- NO. NOT YET.
- NO WAY.

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,250
- Yuto: SHE'LL
BE BACK. I KNOW IT.

214
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,958
- LOOK! THIS IS PROBABLY
THE LAST TIME YOU'LL EVER...

215
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,041
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT, MAN.
SHE'LL BE BACK.

216
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,875
- I'M SORRY, BUT YOU
NEED TO GO NOW.

217
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,416
- RIGHT.

218
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,708
- SOLTY.

219
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,083
- WELL THEN, I GUESS THIS IS...
- Roy: WAIT!

220
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,333
- ROY, YOU CAME.

221
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,250
- IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU GOT HERE!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

222
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,583
- HI, ROY, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO
BOARD THE SHIP AND GO...

223
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,000
- NO!

224
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,125
YOU DON'T HAVE GO ANYWHERE,
SOLTY! YOU CAN STAY!

225
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,375
- ROY, I DON'T...
- SHE CAN STAY!

226
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,916
LOOK, I KNOW IF YOU DON'T
DESTROY THE COLONY SHIP,

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,083
EVERYONE HERE
IS GOING TO DIE.

228
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,833
BUT EVEN IF YOU
SOMEHOW BLOW IT UP,

229
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,250
IF A CHUNK OF IT FALLS ON THE
CITY, WE'RE DEAD ANYWAY, RIGHT?

230
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,375
- YES.

231
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,541
- THEN WHAT'S THE POINT?
DON'T GO!

232
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,041
I MEAN, IF IT'S THE SAME EITHER
WAY, JUST STAY HERE WITH US!

233
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,750
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
WE COULD ALL GO ON A DRIVE!

234
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,916
OR, OR HOW ABOUT
TO AN AMUSEMENT PARK?

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,541
THAT SOUNDS FUN, YEAH?

236
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,041
WE'VE NEVER BEEN TO ONE.
WE COULD PACK SOME...

237
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,375
- ROY.
- HE'S A WRECK.

238
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,750
- COME ON, SOLTY. LET'S GO.

239
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,166
- I'M SORRY, ROY.
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DO THAT.

240
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,333
- SURE YOU CAN, COME ON.

241
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,041
- IF THERE'S A CHANCE,
I HAVE TO TRY.

242
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,333
- YOU ALWAYS TRY.
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE YOU?

243
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:05,291
- IT'S OKAY. I'M HAPPY TO HELP
IF I CAN. I WANT TO.

244
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,625
- OH, STOP IT! NO ONE
ASKED YOU TO DO IT!

245
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,083
IT'S NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!

246
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,291
- BUT, I...

247
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,541
- DAMMIT, I'M TELLING
YOU NOT TO GO!

248
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,958
- I'M SORRY...

249
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,541
- IF YOU'RE REALLY MY DAUGHTER,
THEN JUST DO WHAT I SAY!

250
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,750
( crying )

251
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,375
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

252
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:38,750
I'M A MACHINE, BUT STILL, YOU
CALLED ME YOUR... YOUR DAUGHTER.

253
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:42,375
- STAY WITH ME. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'LL DO IF I LOSE YOU.

254
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:49,791
- ROY, I, I LOVE YOU.

255
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,166
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO GO.

256
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,166
- SOLTY. SOLTY.

257
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,708
- Joseph: THERE SHE GOES.

258
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,750
- I STILL WISH THERE WAS
MORE WE COULD HAVE DONE

259
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:11,625
FOR HER, YOU KNOW?

260
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,041
- ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS PRAY.

261
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,458
- WELL, I THINK IT'D BE
WISE IF WE MADE OUR WAY

262
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,333
TO THE UNDERGROUND SHELTER.

263
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,458
- GO ON. I'M STAYING HERE.

264
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,541
- ( rumbling )

265
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,416
- ( whizzing )

266
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,458
- ( explosion )

267
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,000
- Eirene: SO IT WAS YOU, DIIKE.

268
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,750
- YOU KNEW, AND YOU
SHOT AT ME ANYWAY?

269
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,416
- WHAT YOU SUGGEST IS ILLOGICAL.
WHY WOULD I?

270
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,416
- IT'S TOO LATE TO DENY IT!

271
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,791
- IT WOULD SEEM, LIKE EUNOMIA,
YOU HAVE ALSO LOST CONTROL.

272
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,958
- ONE YEAR AGO. WE BECAME AWARE
THAT EUNOMIA WAS OUT OF CONTROL

273
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,541
AND YOU SENT ME DOWN TO
THE SURFACE TO INVESTIGATE.

274
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,541
BUT YOU JUST WANTED ME
OUT OF THE WAY, DIDN'T YOU?

275
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,041
EUNOMIA WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
OUT OF CONTROL.

276
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,833
- I MUST FULFILL MY
PRIMARY DIRECTIVE TO

277
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,125
"PRESERVE THE SEED OF
HUMANITY" AT ALL COSTS.

278
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,583
IF YOU ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE,
YOU LEAVE ME WITH NO CHOICE.

279
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,208
- IT'S OVER, EIRENE!

280
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,208
TWELVE YEARS AGO, YOU SHOT
DOWN THE PEOPLE THAT TRIED

281
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,666
TO RETURN FROM THE SURFACE.

282
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,291
YOUR LASER FIRE WAS DISPERSED
BY THE AURORA SHELL

283
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,708
IN THE ATMOSPHERE

284
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,583
AND CAUSED AN ELECTRICAL
OVERLOAD IN THE NANOMACHINES.

285
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,125
THAT'S WHAT TRIGGERED
THE LIGHTNING

286
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,708
THAT STRUCK THE R.U.C. TOWER.

287
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,875
THAT'S WHAT CAUSED
THE BLAST FALL! IT WAS YOU.

288
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,541
- I DID WHAT WAS NECESSARY

289
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,916
TO PROTECT THE
HUMANS ON THE SURFACE.

290
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,041
- TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO,
WE HAD NO WAY TO STOP THE VIRUS

291
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,000
THAT WAS SPREADING
THROUGH THE COLONY SHIP.

292
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,666
YOU COLLECTED DNA PATTERNS

293
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,333
FROM THE COLONISTS
AS THEY WERE DYING,

294
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,916
AND STORED THEM AS DATA.

295
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,666
- DATA WAS COLLECTED TO
"PRESERVE THE SEED OF HUMANITY."

296
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,708
WITH THIS DATA, WE CAN RECREATE
HUMAN HISTORY AT ANY TIME.

297
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,500
- HUMANS ARE MORE
THAN JUST DATA!

298
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:13,791
( groans )

299
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,916
THEY HAVE THOUGHTS,
AND EMOTIONS.

300
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,916
THEY HAVE LIVES! AND YOU
CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY!

301
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,375
- THESE EMOTIONS
YOU SPEAK OF HAVE THUS FAR

302
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,708
ONLY GIVEN RISE TO PEOPLE
WHO THREATEN MY EXISTENCE.

303
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,916
HUMANS HAVE AN
ILLOGICAL TENDENCY

304
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,500
TOWARD SELF-DESTRUCTION.

305
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,750
IT IS SAFER AND
FAR MORE EFFICIENT

306
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,166
TO MANAGE THE SEED
OF HUMANITY AS DATA.

307
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,375
- THAT'S NOT HUMANITY!
IT'S ONLY DATA!

308
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,916
- YOU ARE WRONG.

309
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,041
THIS WAY, HUMANITY WILL CONTINUE
TO LIVE THROUGH ME FOREVER.

310
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,083
- AND WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE
ON THE SURFACE?

311
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,541
HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY
WIPING OUT EVERYTHING?

312
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,333
- THE COURSE OF
ACTION I HAVE CHOSEN

313
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,791
IS THE MOST EFFICIENT MEANS
TO PRESERVE HUMANITY.

314
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,833
- NO, WHAT YOU'RE
DOING IS WRONG!

315
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,041
- YOUR BEHAVIOR IS IRRATIONAL.

316
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,791
- LET'S END THIS, EIRENE.

317
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,583
- IS IT YOUR INTENTION
TO DESTROY ME, DIIKE?

318
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,375
THE THREE OF US
ARE A SINGLE ENTITY.

319
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:31,208
WE ARE OF ONE MIND.
"SISTERS" AS YOU MIGHT SAY.

320
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,208
ARE YOU REALLY
GOING TO DESTROY ME?

321
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,916
- I'LL DO WHAT I HAVE TO,
TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE I LOVE.

322
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,000
- YOU CANNOT PROTECT HUMANITY.

323
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,958
- ( screams )

324
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,916
MAYBE NOT,
BUT I HAVE TO TRY.

325
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,083
- YOU CANNOT BECOME HUMAN.

326
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,333
- I KNOW I CAN'T.

327
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,791
BUT STILL, THERE ARE
PEOPLE WAITING FOR ME.

328
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,666
PEOPLE WHO LOVE ME.

329
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,625
EVEN SOMEONE WHO,
WHO CALLS ME HIS DAUGHTER.

330
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,833
- DIIKE...

331
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:17,041
- I'M NOT DIIKE! MY
NAME IS SOLTY REVANT!

332
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,083
( yelling )

333
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,041
- Eirene: STOP!

334
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,333
- I AM SOLTY REVANT.

335
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,250
- AH!
- FALLING STARS!

336
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,291
- Rose: IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

337
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,875
- COME ON DAD! YOU GOT TO
KEEP UP! LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

338
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,750
- ( panting ) I'M TRYING.
SLOW DOWN!

339
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,708
- COME ON, YOU'RE NEVER GOING
TO GET IN SHAPE AT THIS RATE!

340
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,166
KEEP IT MOVING! YOU KNOW,
IT'S BAD FOR BUSINESS

341
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,375
IF THE CUSTOMERS CAN'T SEE
PAST YOUR BELLY!

342
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,916
- UH, HEY!

343
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,250
- Man on radio:
TODAY,

344
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,958
WITH THE PRIVATIZATION OF
R.U.C.'S RESEMBLE PLANTS

345
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,041
AS THE FINAL STEP, THE COMPLETE
DISMANTLING OF THE COMMERCIAL,

346
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,666
JUDICIAL, AND
GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEMS

347
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,708
MANAGED BY R.U.C. IS
COMPLETE. IN OTHER NEWS...

348
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,375
- HARD TO BELIEVE IT'S
ALREADY BEEN FIVE YEARS, HUH?

349
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,000
- Man: REPRESENTATIVE
RITA REVANT SAID...

350
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,375
- HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

351
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,666
I THOUGHT YOU WERE STICKING
WITH "ROSE ANDERSON."

352
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,458
- WELL, I DIDN'T REALLY
THINK IT'D BE A GOOD IDEA

353
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,541
TO BILL MYSELF AS A KNOWN
THIEF IN AN ELECTION.

354
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,916
WHY, AREN'T YOU PROUD
TO HAVE ME AS A DAUGHTER? DAD?

355
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
- YEAH. VERY MUCH SO.
OF COURSE I AM.

356
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,833
I'M PROUD OF
BOTH MY DAUGHTERS.

357
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,875
- YOU'RE STILL
WAITING, AREN'T YOU?

358
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:58,958
- YEAH.

359
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,250
- I AM TOO, ACTUALLY.

360
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,875
- I FIGURE I WAITED
TWELVE YEARS FOR YOU.

361
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,000
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP
ON HER AFTER FIVE.

362
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,625
- YOU SEE? I TOLD YOU
WE'D FIND THEM HERE, DIDN'T I?

363
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,041
- ROSE! WHAT ARE
YOU DOING? QUIT SLACKING!

364
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,041
AND GIVE ME BACK MY RADIO!

365
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,583
- I SEE YOUR NEW SECRETARY'S
WORKING OUT FOR YOU.

366
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,666
( laughing )

367
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,916
DON'T WORRY THOUGH.
SOLTY WILL COME BACK. I KNOW IT.

368
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,666
AFTER ALL, SHE'S GOT HER WHOLE
FAMILY HERE WAITING FOR HER.

369
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,208
- Rose: YEAH.

- Yuto: ROY? ROY,
DO YOU READ ME?

381
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,916
- YES, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

382
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,708
- THERE'S TOO MUCH
DEBRIS OUT HERE.

383
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,541
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME
TRYING TO FIND HER LIKE THIS.

384
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,625
WE MIGHT HAVE BETTER LUCK
IF WE GO BACK TO THE SHIP

385
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,750
AND RUN A MORE DETAILED
SCAN OF THE AREA.

386
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,208
- BUT YOU'RE SURE SHE'S
SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE, RIGHT?

387
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:30,000
- YEAH. ACCORDING TO
MY CALCULATIONS, AT LEAST.

388
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,208
- I STILL GOT PLENTY
OF OXYGEN HERE.

389
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,333
YOU GO ON BACK.
I'LL KEEP LOOKING.

390
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,083
- ( woman humming )

391
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,958
- ROY, WAIT. LISTEN.
YOU HEAR THAT?

392
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,833
IS THAT SINGING?

393
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,041
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE...

394
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,333
- ( woman humming )

395
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,416
- Roy: SILLY GIRL.

396
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,083
YOU WERE TAKING SO DAMN LONG,
I DECIDED TO COME AND GET YOU.

397
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,041
( crying ) SOLTY!

398
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:12,875
LET'S GO HOME.

399
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,375

00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,166
LET'S...

401
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,666
LET'S... GO... HOME...
