1
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,291
- RI...

2
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,333
UH, ROSE.

3
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,166
ABOUT THE NEWSPAPER.

4
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,541
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T READ AT
THE BREAKFAST TABLE. IT'S...

5
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,583
NOW, ROSE!

6
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,541
YOU'RE A YOUNG LADY,
I'M TELLING YOU THIS...

7
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:48,916
UH?

8
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,666
- UM, SO, ANYWAY.

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,833
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT
BREAKFAST THIS MORNING?

10
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,208
I TRIED REALLY HARD TO
MAKE IT EXTRA SPECIAL!

11
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,958
- I WILL NEVER WILL
UNDERSTAND THAT GIRL.

12
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,000
- UH?

13
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,666
- ( exhales )

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,750
- ( exhales )

15
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,166
AH, DAMN.

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,375
IT'S LIKE THIS.
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

17
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,916
THAT OLD MAN IS SUPPOSED
TO BE MY REAL FATHER!

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,125
JUST BECAUSE HE SUDDENLY
ANNOUNCES HE'S MY DAD,

19
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,500
I SHOULD ACCEPT IT?

20
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,375
- AFTER ALL THESE YEARS OF
SEARCHING, I FIND MY DAUGHTER,

21
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,875
AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE ROSE!

22
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,041
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THIS.

23
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,166
I MEAN, I'M HAPPY, BUT...

24
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,958
- IT'S CONFUSING.

25
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,541
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT ROSE
TURNED OUT TO BE ROY'S DAUGHTER,

26
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,416
BUT NOW THEY ARE HARDLY TALKING.

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,291
YOU KNOW? I JUST WANT
THEM TO GET ALONG,

28
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,958
CAUSE THIS IS HARD ON ME,

29
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,791
AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE I'M BEING SELFISH!

30
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,500
- I UNDERSTAND.

31
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:01,000
- SINCE WHEN DID THIS PLACE
TURN INTO A COUNSELING OFFICE?

32
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,041
- ( theme song playing )

33
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

34
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,333
- I SEE. SO YOU FAILED
TO APPREHEND THE SUBJECT.

35
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,916
- I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, SIR.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,041
- NEVER MIND.

37
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,166
THIS WAS A VERY
IRREGULAR CASE FOR YOU.

38
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,541
WE'LL OVERLOOK IT THIS TIME.

39
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,833
HOW ARE SILVIA AND CELICA DOING?

40
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,833
- I'VE BEEN TOLD THEY'LL BE
READY TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL

41
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,500
AND RESUME THEIR
DUTIES NEXT WEEK.

42
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,416
- ALL RIGHT.

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,916
IT'LL BE DIFFICULT BUT I'M
COUNTING ON YOU AND AXELA

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,958
TO CONTINUE TO HANDLE
THINGS ON YOUR OWN UNTIL

45
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,458
THEY CAN RETURN. DISMISSED.

46
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,083
- YES, SIR. THANK YOU, SIR.

47
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,041
- HMM. A VERY
IRREGULAR CASE INDEED,

48
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,750
BUT IT WAS ALSO A
VERY INSTRUCTIVE ONE.

49
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,500
SHE'S EVERYTHING
I EXPECTED HER TO BE.

50
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,208
- HOW BEAUTIFUL.

51
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,541
- Rose: THE WHOLE
THING'S RIDICULOUS!

52
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,000
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

53
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,708
EVEN IF THAT OLD
GROUCH IS MY FATHER,

54
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,708
WHY SHOULD IT MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE TO ME?

55
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,125
IT'S NOT LIKE HE
RAISED ME OR ANYTHING.

56
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,791
- Larry: I REALLY DON'T
THINK IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

57
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,333
- 'KAY, SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

58
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,458
- ABOUT WHAT?

59
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,750
- YOU KNOW WHAT!

60
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,166
DO YOU THINK ROY
IS REALLY MY FATHER?

61
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,583
- HMM, THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE IS ALL THERE.

62
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,000
- OKAY, FINE,
BUT THE DNA TEST IS WHAT COUNTS.

63
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,333
THERE'S NO SOLID PROOF THAT...

64
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,958
- YOUR DNA MAY HAVE BEEN
MUTATED IN THE BLAST FALL.

65
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,125
WE ALREADY WENT OVER THIS.

66
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,625
LOTS OF GIRLS WERE CHANGED.
YOU COULD BE ONE OF THEM.

67
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,083
OF COURSE, THERE'S
NO TEST FOR THAT.

68
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,166
- THAT'S PRETTY VAGUE.

69
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,708
- I KNOW IT IS.

70
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,500
SO ALL WE'VE GOT TO GO ON ARE
YOUR BABY CLOTHES AND SHOES.

71
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,250
THE ONES DAD FOUND YOU IN.
AND THAT TUNE YOU'VE BEEN

72
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,875
SINGING ALL YOUR LIFE,
EVER SINCE YOU WERE A KID.

73
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,333
- ( Rose humming )

74
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,708
- LET'S FACE IT, YOU DIDN'T
LEARN THAT TUNE FROM ANY OF US.

75
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,958
YOU JUST STARTED SINGING IT OUT
OF THE BLUE, ALL BY YOURSELF.

76
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,541
AND ACCORDING TO RAVANT,

77
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,083
HE'S ALWAYS HAD A COPY OF
THAT RECORD AT HIS PLACE.

78
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,625
THAT SONG WAS A FAVORITE
OF HIS AND HIS WIFE'S,

79
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,791
AND THEIR DAUGHTER. THOSE OLD
ANALOG DISKS ARE PRETTY RARE,

80
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,666
YOU NEVER SEE 'EM.
SO THE ODDS ARE...

81
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,833
- Female Singer: ♪ WE'RE
WANDERING THE ROAD

82
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,250
NOT YET KNOWN ♪

83
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,833
- OKAY, OKAY,

84
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,458
BUT IT'S STILL NOTHING BUT
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE!

85
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,958
- YES, IT IS. BUT...

86
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,791
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
YOU'RE ROY'S DAUGHTER,

87
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,083
OR ANYONE'S, AS FAR
AS WE'RE CONCERNED,

88
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,333
YOU'RE OUR SISTER,
NO MATTER WHAT.

89
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,916
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO
ROY'S PLACE, THAT'S FINE.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,416
AND IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK
TO BEING A THIEF, NO PROBLEM.

91
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,833
HMM, IT'S ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.

92
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:25,916
- I'M COMING BACK!

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,541
YOU BETTER BELIEVE
I'M COMING BACK!

94
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,333
- THAT'S GREAT.

95
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,875
SO WITH THAT SAID,

96
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,125
YOU ANY CLOSER TO
COMPLETING YOUR MISSION?

97
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,166
- MISSION?

98
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,583
( gasps )

99
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,500
- Yuto: WAIT. NO, DON'T DO
ANYTHING STUPID, JEREMY!

100
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,875
- Jeremy: BUT YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

101
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,833
THE RESEARCH IS SOLID,
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY...

102
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,041
- THINK IT OVER FOR A MINUTE!

103
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,833
YOUR RESEARCH IS
INTRIGUING, YES,

104
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,583
AND IT MERITS FURTHER
STUDY, BUT NOT...

105
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,333
- BUT DON'T YOU
SEE WHAT THIS MEANS?

106
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,958
IF I CAN SUCCESSFULLY
TEST MY THEORY,

107
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,500
WE CAN PUT AN END TO R.U.C.'S
MONOPOLY ON THE ENERGY MARKET!

108
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,458
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S
AT LEAST WORTH A SHOT?

109
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,500
- WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO DO IS TOO RISKY!

110
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,833
YOU NEED MORE DATA!

111
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,458
- YUTO, LISTEN TO ME!

112
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,416
I'VE GOT ALL THE DATA,
I'VE BUILT THE EQUIPMENT,

113
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,833
I'M TELLING YOU THE
THEORY IS COMPLETE!

114
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,500
I JUST HAVE TO PROVE IT!

115
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,458
AND I COULD REALLY
USE YOUR HELP!

116
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,500
- IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!

117
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,125
I CAN'T LET YOU DO IT!

118
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,791
- PLEASE, YUTO, YOU HAVE TO!
- IT'S TOO RASH OF A DECISION,

119
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,875
- URGH, YOU'RE SUCH A COWARD!
-Jeremy

120
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,125
- ( tone beeps )

121
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,083
- JEREMY? JEREMY,
ARE YOU WITH ME?

122
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,500
- ( exhales )

123
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,708
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
I HAVE A PAIR AGAIN.

124
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,875
- Rose: WHAT THE HELL?

125
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,666
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
DOING IN HERE, YOU OLD GOAT?

126
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,791
- I... I WAS JUST...
- PERVERT.

127
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,708
- NO, NO, NO, NO!
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG!

128
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,375
- THAT IS IT!
I AM SO OUT OF HERE!

129
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,458
- WHA...
- SEE YA!

130
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,666
- RITA, PLEASE!

131
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,583
- MY NAME IS ROSE ANDERSON!

132
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,625
- DON'T GO!

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,958
- Solty: HUH?

134
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,291
- ROSE!

135
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,208
- WHAT'S WRONG?

136
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,041
ROY, IS SHE...

137
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,333
- Roy: THINGS AREN'T GONNA BE
THE SAME AROUND HERE ANYMORE.

138
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,375
- UH.

139
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,958
- OH, HEY, ROY!

140
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,416
ARE YOU ON A CASE RIGHT NOW?

141
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,833
CAUSE I WAS WONDERING IF
MAYBE YOU COULD DO A JOB FOR ME.

142
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,583
- KID, ARE YOUR
PARENTS STILL ALIVE?

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,458
- YEAH. I MEAN, YES,
THEY'RE BOTH FINE.

144
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,791
- WELL GO HOME SOMETIMES.

145
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,750
AND MAKE SURE THEY
KNOW YOU'RE FINE.

146
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,875
BE A GOOD SON.

147
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,250
- HEY, NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

148
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,750
I NEED TO TALK TO
YOU. COME BACK.

149
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,958
- I LOVE ROY, AND I LOVE ROSE.
AND I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT

150
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,166
THEY TURNED OUT TO BE
FATHER AND DAUGHTER.

151
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,208
AND I UNDERSTAND WHY ROY
IS SO WORRIED ABOUT ROSE.

152
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,375
BUT HE'S GOTTA STOP
PUSHING SO HARD.

153
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,166
HE NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE LESS...

154
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,208
I DON'T KNOW.

155
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,750
UH-OH. THAT WASN'T GOOD.

156
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:14,041
ANYWAY, I WISH ROY WOULD
LISTEN TO ME EVERY NOW AND THEN.

157
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,083
THAT'S NOT SELFISH OF ME, IS IT?

158
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,125
( gasps )

159
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,875
AW.

160
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,750
SORRY DISHES.

161
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,375
- Rose: THERE YOU ARE!

162
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,750
- OH, ROSE!

163
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,208
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING
EVERYWHERE FOR YOU!

164
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,375
I CHECKED YOUR ROOM,

165
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,958
BUT I ENDED UP RUNNING
INTO THE OLD MAN!

166
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,666
UH, THAT GUY IS SUCH A PAIN!

167
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,750
- UH, LOOKING FOR ME?

168
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:36,833
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

169
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,333
- LISTEN, SOLTY.

170
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,916
I HAVE SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT
I NEED TO TELL YOU, OKAY?

171
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,583
- WHAT? YOU'RE LEAVING?

172
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,083
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT! OH, AND
SINCE THE WHOLE REASON

173
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,000
I CAME TO LIVE HERE IN THE FIRST
PLACE WAS TO GET YOU TO BECOME

174
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,875
A THIEF AND A MEMBER
OF THE ROSE ANDERSON GANG,

175
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,458
I WAS THINKING.

176
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,333
WHY DON'T YOU JUST PACK UP YOUR
STUFF AND COME ALONG WITH ME?

177
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,375
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

178
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,833
- JUST LIKE THAT?

179
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,208
ROSE, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'D WANT TO LEAVE HERE?

180
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,583
- OH, COME ON!

181
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,916
AREN'T YOU SICK OF THAT
OVERBEARING OLD GROUCH YET?

182
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,833
BESIDES, IT'S BEEN FOREVER
SINCE I PULLED A JOB.

183
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,333
I GOTTA GET OUT
BEFORE I GET TOO RUSTY.

184
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,541
- BUT WHAT'S YOUR HURRY?

185
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,083
WON'T YOU THINK IT OVER?

186
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,083
- THERE'S NOTHING TO
THINK OVER. I'M GOING!

187
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,541
- BUT ROY HAS BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU FOR SO MANY YEARS,

188
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,041
AND NOW THAT HE'S FOUND YOU,

189
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,791
WILL YOU AT LEAST
GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO...

190
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,666
- UH, ARE YOU SINGING
THAT SONG TOO?

191
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,416
MY NAME IS ROSE!
I'M NOT RITA REVANT!

192
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,583
I'M A THIEF, NOT THE DAUGHTER
OF SOME DRIED UP OLD HUNTER!

193
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,291
OKAY. I'M SICK OF ALL THIS
TALKING. IT MAKES ME TIRED!

194
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,333
I GOTTA PACK MY THINGS.

195
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,625
COME ON.
YOU CAN GIVE ME HAND.

196
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,791
- NO, I WILL NOT!

197
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,375
I WON'T HELP YOU,
AND I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU!

198
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,166
- BUT SOLTY, I...

199
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,833
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE
SO SELFISH ABOUT ALL THIS?

200
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,000
IS IT SO AWFUL?

201
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,833
ROY CARES ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.

202
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,708
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
KNOWING WHO YOU ARE?

203
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,916
- OH, THAT'S JUST GREAT!

204
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,958
WELL, IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE HIS
SIDE, THEN WHO NEEDS YOU ANYWAY?

205
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,583
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S TIME I GET GOING

206
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,583
AND WHILE I'M AT IT I MIGHT
TAKE A COUPLE THINGS

207
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,041
TO REMIND ME OF YOU TWO LOSERS.

208
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,583
- WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THERE, SOLTY?

209
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,875
I COULD HEAR YOU TWO YELLING
AT EACH OTHER DOWN THE HALL!

210
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,458
- ROSE IS LEAVING.

211
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,208
- OH, HONEY.

MAYBE I'D TAKE

222
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,791
ANOTHER STAB AT THROWING
A BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR ROY.

223
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,125
YOU'LL HELP ME, WON'T YOU?

- ( record crackling )

225

- WHOA, HOLD ON A MINUTE.
WHO'S HE?

226
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,166
- THIS IS ROY REVANT.

227
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,708
IT'S OKAY,
HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

228
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,750
HE WORKS WITH
THE MAVERICK HUNTERS AGENCY.

229
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,833
- A HUNTER?

230
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,541
- YEAH, HE'S HERE TO...

231
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,833
HEY! JUST A MINUTE, WHAT...

232
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,708
- I'M SORRY!
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,

233
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,000
BUT I DO NOT WANT TO SPEAK
TO ANYONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE

234
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,708
AN ACADEMIC BACKGROUND!

235
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,833
I CAN'T RISK CATCHING
HIS "STUPIDITY"!

236
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,333
- JEREMY, PLEASE!

237
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,125
COME ON! ROY ISN'T LIKE THAT!

238
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,666
I'M PRETTY SURE HE'S AT LEAST
GOT A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE!

239
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,375
JEREMY! JEREMY!

240
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,250
- Jeremy: NO WAY!

241
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,333
- ROY, WAIT!
- I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

242
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,083
SHE'S YOUR FRIEND.
YOU HELP HER OUT.

243
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,375
- WE CAN EXPECT
HEIGHTENED AURORA SHELL ACTIVITY

244
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,000

WITH STRONG ELECTROMAGNETIC
INTERFERENCE ANTICIPATED...

246
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,333
- YOU AREN'T SERIOUSLY
PLANNING TO GO AHEAD

247
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,833
WITH THIS BIRTHDAY PARTY IDEA?

248
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,416
- YES, OF COURSE WE ARE!

249
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,583
- WELL, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'VE HEARD, BUT I'M LEAVING.

250
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,333
I'VE GOT MY OWN
PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH.

251
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,166
I REALLY DON'T NEED THE
EXTRA GRIEF OF PLANNING

252
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,833
SOMEONE ELSE'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

253
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,750
- BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA.

254
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,958
IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR GOING
AWAY PARTY AS WELL, SEE?

255
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,083
- OH, LIKE THAT'S GONNA
MAKE IT ANY LESS WORK!

256
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,166
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

257
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,750
YOU'RE THE ONE GETTING A PARTY!

258
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,500
- Newscaster: ACCORDING
TO MR. WELMAR,

259
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,041
WOOD WAS PLACED ON THE DISABLED
LIST AT HIS OWN REQUEST...

260
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,333
- I'D LIKE TO... ROSE, I...

261
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,583
- WHAT?

262
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:48,291
- ABOUT BEFORE,
I'M SORRY I GOT MAD. I ONLY...

263
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,083
- YEAH, FINE.
NO BIG DEAL, OKAY?

264
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,666
- BUT...

265
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,500
- WELL, WHAT IS IT YOU WANT ME
TO DO FOR YOUR LITTLE PARTY?

266
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,583
- WOULD YOU MIND BUYING
ROY ANOTHER PRESENT?

267
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,041
IT'D BE A BIG HELP.

268
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,458
- OH, ALL RIGHT. IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT, DOES IT?

269
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,666
- ROSE, PLEASE!

270
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,750
- I'M SORRY.
I'M OKAY WITH IT, REALLY.

271
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,916
I'M NOT ANGRY ANYMORE.

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,208
I GUESS I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL,
IS THE PROBLEM.

273
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,708
- I UNDERSTAND.

274
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,291
- LATER.

275
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,791
- ( exhales )

276
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,291
- Kasha: IT'S NOT GOING
VERY WELL, IS IT?

277
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,208
- Miranda: IT IS WHAT IT IS.

278
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,208
- Newscaster: ...SAYS THE 70
YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER...

279
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,166
- Roy: SARAH.

280
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,666
I FOUND RITA.

281
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,875
JUST LIKE I PROMISED YOU.

282
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,625
ALIVE.

283
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:40,875
SHE WAS ALIVE.

284
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,666
HMM.

285
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,416
THE ONLY PROBLEM
IS SHE HATES ME.

286
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,375
( exhales )

287
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,083
SHE'S ALIVE.

288
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,416
THANK GOD.

289
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,291
- Yuto: YOU CAN'T BE
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS!

290
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,791
- Jeremy: AND WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE IT'S NUTS, THAT'S WHY!

291
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,166
- BUT, BUT, BUT...
LOOK AT THIS!

292
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,291
AURORA SHELL ACTIVITY IS
AT AN ALL TIME HIGH TODAY!

293
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,416
CONDITIONS ARE PERFECT
FOR MY EXPERIMENT!

294
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,333
- JEREMY! I WON'T LET YOU!

295
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,708
- YUTO, IF ALL YOU'RE
GONNA DO IS LECTURE,

296
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,125
THEN HOW ABOUT YOU GO.

297
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,208
- IF THAT'S YOUR ATTITUDE,
THEN I HAVE TO CALL R.U.C.

298
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,166
I'M SORRY IT'S COME
TO THIS BUT IT LOOKS LIKE

299
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,291
HAVING YOU ARRESTED IS
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP YOU!

300
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,500
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT!

301
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,791
- YOU'RE NOT GIVING
ME ANY CHOICE!

302
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,625
- NO!

303
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,791
- ( grunts )

304
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,458
- OH, WOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE STILL CONSCIOUS

305
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,625
AFTER GETTING
A SHOT OF THIS.

306
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,875
THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE!

307
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,625
- JE... JEREMY.

308
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,291
- BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO STAY UNCONSCIOUS

309
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,416
UNTIL THE EXPERIMENT IS OVER,
OKAY? THIS MIGHT STING.

310
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,250
- ( Yuto screams )

311
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,083
- WHERE HAVE YOU
BEEN ALL THIS TIME?

312
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,250
- WHAT'S THIS, ONE OF
THOSE SLUMBER PARTIES?

313
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,333
WHERE'S RI...

314
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,500
WHERE'S ROSE?

315
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,625
- I SENT HER OUT TO DO
SOME SHOPPING FOR ME.

316
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,166
- OF COURSE KNOWING HER,
SHE PROBABLY RAN OFF!

317
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,125
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN!

318
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,958
ROSE IS GONNA COME BACK.
I KNOW SHE WILL!

319
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,166
- HEY, RELAX. KIDDING.
CALM DOWN.

320
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,833
- ( gasps happily )

321
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,500
( giggles )

322
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,083
- ( phone ringing )

323
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,125
- THIS IS ROY.

324
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,333
- Yuto: UH, ROY...

325
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,333
- YUTO? NOW WHAT?

326
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,750
- Yuto: PLEASE. HELP. HELP ME.

327
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:33,791
- YUTO, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

328
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,333
- I GUESS THIS IS OKAY.

329
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,666
THE CLERK SAID THIS WAS A
GOOD PRESENT FOR AN OLDER GUY,

330
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,000
BUT WHO KNOWS,

331
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,833
HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T LIKE
ANYTHING I GOT FOR HIM.

332
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,791
( sighs )

333
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,000
- HE DESTROYED MY ARM AS REVENGE
FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DAUGHTER.

334
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,666
SHOOTING ME TO PIECES WASN'T
GOING TO BRING HER BACK.

335
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,708
- AT LEAST THIS TIME
WE'RE TOGETHER.

336
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,791
RITA, PLEASE!

337
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,500
- ROY CARES ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.

338
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,166
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
KNOWING WHO YOU ARE?

339
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:15,000
- DAMN IT! WHAT THE HELL IS
WRONG WITH EVERYONE AROUND HERE?

340
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,458
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN'T HELP IT!

341
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,958
I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

342
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,083
AND I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT!

343
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,125
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED,
I AM WHO I AM!

344
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,291
AND NOTHING IN THE WORLD
CAN CHANGE THAT!

345
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,041
( gasps )

346
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,541
WAIT A MINUTE, THAT'S IT,
I AM WHO I AM!

347
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,541
IT'S SO INCREDIBLY SIMPLE.
WHY DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG?

348
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,041
I'M AN IDIOT!

349
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,500
- UH, ARE YOU OKAY, MISS?

350
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,208
- JEREMY'S GOAL IS
TO TAKE DOWN R.U.C.

351
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,708
- WHAT'S THAT?

352
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,208
- R.U.C. CONTROLS THE CITY'S
WATER, ITS ENERGY, ITS POLITICS.

353
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,541
AND WITH THE
REGISTRATION SYSTEM,

354
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,125
IT CONTROLS THE LIFE
OF EVERY CITIZEN.

355
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,416
IT CONTROLS ALL
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

356
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,833
ANY RESEARCHER WHO WANTS
FUNDING HAS TO GO TO R.U.C.

357
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,333
AND HAS TO FOLLOW
THEIR GUIDELINES.

358
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,583
JEREMY IS DOING
UNAUTHORIZED ENERGY RESEARCH.

359
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,833
SHE'S TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO
TAP INTO THE LIGHTENING ENERGY

360
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,166
GENERATED BY THE AURORA SHELL
ABOVE THE ALTITUDE CEILING

361
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,500
TO CREATE A NEW
SOURCE OF CHEAP POWER.

362
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,166
SHE WANTS TO BREAK R.U.C.'S
MONOPOLY ON THE ENERGY MARKET.

363
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,041
BUT, IF HER CALCULATIONS
AREN'T ABSOLUTELY CORRECT,

364
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,333
AND SOMETHING GOES WRONG...

365
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,125
- WHAT? YOU MEAN...

366
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,250
- ANOTHER BLAST FALL,
MAYBE WORSE THAN THE LAST ONE.

367
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,291
- OH, MAN,
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO RAIN.

368
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,750
WHAT A DREARY DAY
TO CHANGE THE WORLD!

369
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,791
- THERE, THAT'S THE PLACE!

370
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,000
DAMN IT.

371
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,041
- Solty: THIS WAY!

372
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,416
- SHIT. I CAN'T DO IT!

373
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,791
SOLTY, YOU GOTTA GET UP THERE.

374
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,166
- RIGHT!

375
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,125
- HEY! YO!
- ROSE?

376
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,375
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP
THERE IN THE RAIN, OLD MAN?

377
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,458
- YOU WANNA CATCH YOUR DEATH?

378
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,125
- YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!

379
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,625
CAUSE I GOTTA TALK TO YOU,
AND IT'S IMPORTANT, ROY!

380
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,791
- WE'LL TALK LATER!
- NO, RIGHT NOW!

381
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:24,875
- HERE WE GO!

382
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,833
- I'VE DECIDED I CAN ACCEPT YOU!

383
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,000
YOU'RE MY REAL FATHER!

384
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,708
IT'S OKAY, I'VE REALIZED
I CAN DEAL WITH IT NOW!

385
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,500
IT JUST TOOK ME A LITTLE TIME!

386
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,166
BUT REMEMBER, I CAN NEVER
BE RITA REVANT, OKAY?

387
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,125
I'LL ALWAYS BE ROSE ANDERSON!

388
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,958
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO ACCEPT THAT FACT!

389
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,208
NOTHING CHANGES!

390
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,333
I CAN BE YOUR DAUGHTER, BUT
I'M A THIEF AND YOU'RE A HUNTER!

391
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,208
IS THAT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU?

392
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,541
CAN YOU DEAL WITH THAT?

393
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,416
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY.

394
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,625
- YES!

395
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,958
I CAN.

396
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,166
I CAN DEAL WITH THAT.

397
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,375
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

398
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,000
BE A THIEF,
NONE OF THAT MATTERS!

399
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,000
THE ONLY THING THAT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU'RE ALIVE.

400
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,541
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS TO ME!

401
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,416
- ALRIGHT.

402
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,541
SO IT'S A DEAL.

403
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:34,875
THAT WAS EASY.

404
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,958
- ALMOST TO THE
ALTITUDE CEILING.

405
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,291
- ( thudding )

406
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,333
- THAT'S FAR ENOUGH!

407
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,666
- ( lightning crashing )

408
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,916
- ( all gasp )

409
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:01,875
- Solty: ROY!

410
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,208
- ( screams )

411
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,291
- ( gasps )

412
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:49,916
- RITA!

413
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,541
RITA!

414
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,166
- ( theme song playing )

415
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

416
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:37,000
- Rose: JUST WHEN ALL MY DOUBTS
HAD FINALLY BEEN DISPELLED...

417
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,333
- Roy: ROSE.

418
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,666
- Solty: NEXT TIME,
"HEAVY HEARTS."

419
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,291
GOODBYE.
