1
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,250
- SO, WHY DON'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

2
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,125
DID YOU COME HERE TO TALK
TO ME OR JUST STARE AT ME?

3
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,958
- WHY DID YOU TELL THAT LAWYER
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE ADOPTED?

4
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,208
- HEY, HOW'D YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

5
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:41,125
IS R.U.C. SPYING ON ME
OR ARE YOU SOME KINDA STALKER?

6
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,541
- Celica: NEVER MIND
HOW I KNOW ABOUT IT.
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

7
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:47,125
I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU
WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE
ADOPTED, OKAY? SO, SPILL.

8
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,958
- Kasha: I DON'T
HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT.
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

9
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,458
- ARGH. KNOCK IT OFF.

10
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:56,333
- OH, CELICA, YOU STABBED
CELICA RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES.

11
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,708
- YEAH, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE NEXT
IF YOU DON'T KNOCK IT OFF.

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,666
- OH, SORRY.

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,083
- DID YOU GUYS COME HERE
TO DO A COMEDY ROUTINE?

14
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,541
- NO, I CAME HERE BECAUSE
THE PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO ADOPT YOU,

15
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,500
ARE THE SAME ONES
WHO ADOPTED ME.

16
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,708
- HUH?
- THEY TOOK ME IN YEARS AGO.

17
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,375
I WAS VERY LITTLE.
MUCH YOUNGER
THAN YOU ARE NOW.

18
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,500
- YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS, RIGHT?
- CELICA.

19
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,708
- ACCORDING TO THE CITY'S
REGISTRATION LAWS,

20
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:23,708
A REGISTERED COUPLE
IS ONLY ALLOWED TO ADOPT
ONE UNREGISTERED CHILD.

21
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,000
- SO THAT MEANS YOU.

22
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,666
- THAT'S RIGHT, KID.
I WAS UNREGISTERED
LIKE YOU.

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,625
THAT'S WHY MOM AND DAD
COULDN'T ADOPT YOU RIGHT AWAY.

24
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:38,125
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT
ABOUT YOU, IT WAS TOO LATE,
THEY ALREADY HAD ME.

25
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,666
BUT NONE OF THAT
MATTERS ANYMORE.

26
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,541
YOU'RE A LEGAL CITIZEN NOW,
YOU'RE ALL SIGNED UP.

27
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:47,083
A COUPLE CAN ADOPT AS MANY
REGISTERED CHILDREN AS THEY
WANT TO.

28
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,791
SO, THERE'S NO PROBLEM ANYMORE.

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,583
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

30
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,416
- WELL, NO, I DON'T.

31
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,083
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
YOU WANT ME TO ACCEPT
THEIR OFFER, IS THAT IT?

32
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:02,750
- YES I DO. IF ADOPTING YOU
WILL MAKE MOM AND DAD HAPPY,
THEN THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

33
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,541
THEY'VE BEEN SO GOOD TO ME
EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T THEIR
OWN FLESH AND BLOOD.

34
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,541
- BUT WHY ARE THEY
DOING THIS NOW?

35
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:12,291
- THEY DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET
GRANDPA AND THE OTHERS.
- OH.

36
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:16,083
- YOU KNOW, TO SPARE THEIR
FEELINGS. THAT'S HOW
KIND HEARTED THEY ARE.

37
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:20,125
- KIND HEARTED, HUH?
THEN WHY DIDN'T THEY
THINK ABOUT MY FEELINGS?

38
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,375
I'VE GOT MY MOM
AND I'LL NEVER LEAVE HER.

39
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,041
AND NOTHING IN THE WORLD
COULD EVER MAKE ME.

40
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,583
- NO MATTER WHAT?
- NO MATTER WHAT.

41
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,375
- I UNDERSTAND.

42
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,291
- CELICA, I DIDN'T...
HEY, WAIT UP.

43
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,250
- KASHA, I'M SORRY.

44
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,875
- CELICA.
- OH, ARE YOU LEAVING ALREADY?

45
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,208
JUST MADE SOME FRESH COOKIES
THEY'LL BE READY TO EAT
IN A COUPLE MINUTES.

46
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,333
- Silvia: UH, THANKS,
BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO LEAVE.

47
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,875
WE'RE SORRY TO HAVE
BOTHERED YOU.

48
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,375
COME ON, CELICA.
WAIT UP, WILL YOU?

49
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,333
- OKAY, ROSE.

50
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,500
OUR GUESTS ARE GONE
AND THE COAST IS CLEAR.
YOU CAN RELAX NOW.

51
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,833
- ( all sighs )

52
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,250
- ( exclaims softly )

53
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:45,833
- SOLTY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
DID KASHA SAY WHAT THOSE
R.U.C. PEOPLE WANTED WITH HER?

54
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,375
- UH, THEY SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT ADOPTING KASHA.

55
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,208
I DIDN'T HEAR IT ALL,
BUT I THINK SHE TURNED
THEM DOWN.

56
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,375
- ADOPTING HER?

57
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,375
- THIS HAS GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH KASHA'S REAL FAMILY
TURNING UP ALL OF A SUDDEN.

58
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,208
- HUH? YUTO, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

59
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,541
- MIRANDA AND KASHA
AREN'T REALLY BLOOD RELATIONS.

60
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,625
- Rose: YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
- Miranda: ACTUALLY, IT'S TRUE.

61
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:10,208
- KASHA ISN'T MY REAL DAUGHTER,
AT LEAST NOT BY BIRTH,
THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

62
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,916
- REALLY?

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,208
- YUP. NOW WHO'S GONNA
EAT SOME OF THESE HOT
HOME-MADE COOKIES?

64
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,708
- Rose: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
ARE YOU OKAY WITH
ALL THIS ADOPTION TALK?

65
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:23,291
- NO, I'M NOT WORRIED.
IN FACT, AN ATTORNEY
WAS HERE YESTERDAY,

66
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,250
REPRESENTING KASHA'S UNCLE.

67
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,750
KASHA SENT HIM HOME
PRETTY QUICK.
( chuckling )

68
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,000
- SO, YOU DON'T SEEM TOO UPSET
THAT HE WANTS TO TAKE KASHA.

69
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,000
- NICE.
- BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT.

70
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,750
I KNOW I CAN TRUST KASHA
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

71
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,000
- ARE YOU SURE?
- ABSOLUTELY.

72
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,541
- MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD. WHOA.

73
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,000
- SORRY I'M LATE.

74
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,625
- Integra: SO THAT'S IT.
POOR CELICA.

75
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:05,416
- YEAH, SHE ALWAYS ACTS
SO BLASE AT WORK.
HOW'S SHE REALLY DOING?

76
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,500
- PRETTY MUCH THE WAY
YOU'D EXPECT.
SHE'S REALLY DEPRESSED.

77
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,625
- WOW.

78
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:15,791
- Silvia: YOU KNOW, I THINK
ALL OF US HAVE SOME KIND OF
A SKELETON IN OUR CLOSET.

79
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:20,791
BUT WE JOINED R.U.C., BECAME
A TEAM, AND AT THAT POINT
OUR BACKGROUNDS DIDN'T MATTER.

80
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,958
TOGETHER WE MADE PEOPLE
RESPECT US FOR WHAT
WE COULD DO.

81
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:28,500
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS
I THINK OF YOU GUYS AS A LOT
MORE THAN JUST COLLEAGUES.

82
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,541
- OH, JEEZ, SILVIA,
THIS IS GETTING
REALLY EMBARRASSING.

83
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,666
- ( exclaims ) I FEEL EXACTLY
THE WAY YOU DO, SILVIA,
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

84
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,541
- THANKS, AXELA,
I APPRECIATE IT.

85
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,458
WHAT ABOUT YOU, BOSS LADY?

86
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:44,708
- LOOK, SILVIA, IF I DIDN'T FEEL
THE SAME WAY, DO YOU THINK
I'D BE SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW?

87
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,916
LET ME GUESS. YOU WANT
US ALL TO GET TOGETHER

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,916
AND THROW AN APPRECIATION DAY
PARTY FOR CELICA, DON'T YOU?

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,583
- AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE THE LEADER.

90
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,375
- YOU JUST HAD TO MAKE ME SAY
ALL THAT OUT LOUD, DIDN'T YOU?

91
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,625
- OH, AND I'LL COOK. I'LL MAKE
THE BIGGEST FEAST EVER.

92
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,458
OH, THIS IS GONNA BE FANTASTIC.

93
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:03,541
- YEAH, YOU DO THAT.
HERE'S TO THE GREATEST PARTY
EVER THROWN.

94
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,750
- YEAH.
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S STARTING A LITTLE EARLY.

95
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,916
- ( phone ringing )

96
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,666
- OLD GUY, PHONE'S RINGING.

97
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,458
- ( sighs ) YOU'RE
RIGHT NEXT TO IT.

98
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,666
- SO?
- WHY DON'T I JUST
GO AHEAD AND GET IT?

99
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,333
- DON'T YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'S HIS PHONE AND THE CALL'S
BOUND TO BE FOR HIM ANYWAY.

100
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,458
COME ON, GRANDPA.
IT'S ANNOYING.

101
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:30,041
- ARGH, YEAH, YOU'D KNOW
ALL ABOUT ANNOYING,
WOULDN'T YOU?

102
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,958
HELLO, THIS IS ROY.

103
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:38,625
OH, HEY. UH, HOW ARE YOU?
NOW? I'M ON MY WAY.

104
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:45,083
- SO, WHO WAS THAT?
- NO ONE. I GOT TO GO
OUT FOR A WHILE.

105
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,083
- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA BE BACK?
- I'LL SEE YOU AROUND
DINNER TIME.

106
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,541
- HMM?
- BYE, ROY.

107
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,125
- YOU KNOW WHAT, SOLTY?
- WHAT? IS SOMETHING WRONG?

108
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,583
- I'M BORED.
- AH.

109
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,125
- WELL, IF YOU WANT TO,

110
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,666
YOU CAN COME ALONG
WITH ME WHILE I GO
SHOPPING FOR GROCERIES.

111
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,708
- HMM.

112
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,125
- HAPPINESS? REALLY?
- YEAH.

113
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,541
- I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING
BUGGING YOU.
- YEAH.

114
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,500
- HMM.

115
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:18,500
- SO, TELL ME, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA OF WHAT HAPPINESS IS?
- OF COURSE I DO.

116
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:22,083
- BECAUSE I KNOW EVERYTHING.
- DO YOU REALLY KNOW, ROSE?

117
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,791
- YOU'RE NOT JUST KIDDING
AROUND WITH ME? WHAT IS IT?

118
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,583
- THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
IT COULD BE. COLD HARD CASH.

119
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:35,416
- ( exhales )
- RIGHT. EXCUSE ME.

120
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,916
- JUST A MINUTE. HEY,
WHAT'S WITH THE ATTITUDE?

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,041
YOU THINK I'M SHALLOW,
DON'T YOU?

122
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,125
- OH, NO. I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE SHALLOW AT ALL.

123
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,125
- YOU DO SO THINK I'M SHALLOW.
- OUCH, COME ON, NO, I DON'T.

124
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,625
- COME ON, SPIT IT OUT.
- CUT IT OUT.

125
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,500
- ( grunting )
- OKAY, I DO, OW. OW.

126
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,541
- HAPPINESS...

127
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,500
I STILL DON'T KNOW.
WHAT CAN IT POSSIBLY BE?

128
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,666
- HEY. WHAT?
- HOLD ON A SEC. LOOK THERE.

129
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,000
- THERE, ACROSS THE STREET.

130
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,666
- SEE YOU TOMORROW.
- THANKS.

131
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,208
- THAT WOMAN HE'S WITH,
ISN'T SHE THAT BUSY BODY MOTHER

132
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,125
WE HAD DINNER WITH
THE OTHER NIGHT?

133
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,750
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON?

134
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,125
- NOW WHAT?

135
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,916
- OH, NOTHING.
WE WERE JUST WONDERING
IF YOU LIKED DINNER.

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,666
- AREN'T YOU GOING TO ASK HIM?
- I CAN'T JUST COME
RIGHT OUT WITH IT.

137
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,250
- GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU.
- AH.

138
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,625
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

139
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:48,208
- NO, NOT AT ALL,
EVERYTHING IS JUST FINE.
ISN'T IT, ROSE?

140
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:53,833
- OKAY THEN. OH, UH,
I'M GOING OUT TOMORROW.

141
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,000
- HAPPY APPRECIATION DAY
TO EVERYONE IN OUR VIEWING AREA.

142
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,916
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME
OF THE SPECIAL EVENTS.

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,833
- I'M OFF, GIRLS.
I'LL TRY AND BE BACK
SOME TIME BEFORE EIGHT.

144
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,125
- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
HE'S SNEAKING AWAY TO GO
ON A DATE WITH THAT WOMAN.

145
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,708
- DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S IT?

146
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,750
- OF COURSE. WHY ELSE
WOULD HE MEET HER
ON APPRECIATION DAY?

147
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,041
- NOW, COME ON. LET'S GO.
- HUH? GO WHERE?

148
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,208
- TO FOLLOW THEM, OF COURSE.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET HER
GET AWAY WITH THIS?

149
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,208
I SEE. OKAY, JUST FORGET IT.

150
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,541
IT'S YOUR LIFE, SEE IF I CARE
IF THAT WOMAN STEALS
YOUR HAPPINESS,

151
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,958
NO SKIN OFF MY NOSE.

152
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,708
- HUH?
- SEE YOU.

153
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,166
- ( door opens )

154
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,625
- Kasha: SOLTY?
- ( gasps )

155
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:50,083
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
COULD HELP ME.

156
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,291
- Integra: SO, HOW CAN I HELP?
JUST SAY THE WORD.

157
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,583
- OH. WELL, YOU COULD START
CHOPPING UP THE VEGGIES FOR ME.

158
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,000
- OKAY, THEN I'M ON IT.

159
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,708
- WHAT ABOUT ME?
- YOU CAN TOSS THE SALAD.

160
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,250
- ALL RIGHT.
TOSSING SEQUENCE INITIATED.

161
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,583
- I'M SORRY IF I KEPT YOU
WAITING, ROY.
- IT'S OKAY.

162
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,916
- WELL, THEN, SHALL WE GO?
- SURE.

163
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,750
- ( rustling )

164
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,041
- AHA, I KNEW IT.

165
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:24,958
- OVER HERE, LARRY.

166
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,791
- YOU'RE A VERY NAUGHTY
LITTLE GIRL

167
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,208
FOR MAKING A THIEF LIKE ME
COME OUT IN PUBLIC LIKE THIS,

168
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,791
BUT THEN AGAIN,
DANGER IS MY BUSINESS.

169
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:40,041
- OH MY GOD. YOU'RE COOL.
- SO WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO GO, HONEY?

170
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,375
- YOU CAN TAKE ME
ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO.

171
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,958
- HONEY? DAMN.

172
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,375
- LOOKS SERIOUS.
- HAS SHE REALLY FALLEN FOR HIM?

173
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,875
- HEY, WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE, YUTO?

174
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,166
- SPYING LIKE YOU.
OH, THEY'RE GETTING AWAY.

175
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,708
- LET'S GO.
- GO WHERE?

176
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,750
- ( screams )

177
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,625
- PLEASE, KASHA.
CAN'T YOU TELL ME
WHERE WE'RE GOING?

178
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,708
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
JUST STAY WITH ME.

179
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,291
- Miranda: KASHA, WHERE ARE YOU?

180
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,750
SORRY I TOOK SO LONG,
BUT THE STORE WAS PACKED.
( chuckles )

181
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,291
THAT'S STRANGE.

182
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,875
- Solty: WOW. DO YOU REALLY
KNOW SOMEONE WHO LIVES HERE?

183
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,000
- I DON'T KNOW.
WE'RE SNEAKING IN.

184
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,875
- HUH?
- OPEN THE GATE.

185
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,041
- COME ON.

186
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,250
- ( metal twisting )

187
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,083
- CAN WE GO HOME?
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

188
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,125
WHAT IF SOMEONE CATCHES US?
WE'RE GONNA GET IN
A WHOLE... OUCH.

189
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,166
- OOPSIE.

190
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,333
- HUH?

191
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,250
- HEY, YOU.

192
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,916
WE HAVE A FRONT DOOR,
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE.

193
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,958
- I WAS WONDERING
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

194
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,208
SO, THIS IS WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN HIDING
ALL THIS TIME.

195
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:23,000
TELL ME. DO YOU THINK
I'LL END UP ALL ALONE
AGAIN? HMM?

196
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,083
- HERE. THIS IS A PHOTO
OF YOUR FATHER.

197
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,750
- HUH?

198
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,083
- YOU CAME HERE BECAUSE
YOU WERE WONDERING ABOUT
YOUR FATHER, DIDN'T YOU?

199
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:40,791
- OH MY GOSH.
THIS IS MY REAL FATHER.
- HE WAS A VERY NICE MAN.

200
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,416
A LOT OF WOMEN WANTED
TO MARRY HIM, BUT HE TURNED
THEM ALL DOWN.

201
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,958
I THINK THAT HE LOVED
YOUR MOTHER SO MUCH

202
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,083
HE COULD JUST NEVER BE
INTERESTED IN ANY OTHER WOMAN.

203
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,958
AND I SHOULD TELL YOU, KASHA.

204
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,125
ALTHOUGH YOUR FATHER NEVER SAID
ANYTHING TO MY DAD ABOUT YOU,

205
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,791
TO SPARE HIS FEELINGS
HE KNEW ABOUT YOU.

206
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,458
YOUR DAD'S LAST WORDS WERE
"MAKE SURE SHE'S HAPPY."

207
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,458
HE MEANT IT. YOUR HAPPINESS
WAS HIS FINAL REQUEST.

208
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,916
YOU'RE HAPPY WITH MIRANDA.
SO, YOU SHOULD GO BACK THERE.

209
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,916
I'M KIND OF USED TO HAVING
FATHER AND MOTHER ALL TO MYSELF.

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,333
I DON'T THINK I COULD
GET USED TO SHARING.

211
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:25,041
PLUS, IF THEY COME HOME NOW,
THEY MIGHT GET THE WRONG IDEA.
ABOUT YOU STAYING, I MEAN.

212
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,125
YOU CAN HAVE THAT PHOTO.

213
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,541
AND YOU CAN VISIT HERE
ANYTIME YOU LIKE.

214
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:35,125
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW, I THINK
YOU SHOULD GO HOME SO, UH...

215
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,833
- YOU OKAY?
- I DON'T WANT THIS.

216
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,250
- YOU CAN KEEP YOU HAND OUTS.

217
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,583
- KASHA, WAIT.
- AND I WON'T COME BACK EITHER.

218
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,250
- I SEE.

219
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,041
I'M SORRY.

220
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,000
- WAIT FOR ME. KASHA.

221
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,833
- GO AWAY. I WANNA BE ALONE
RIGHT NOW.

222
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,541
I SAID I WANNA BE ALONE. SORRY.

223
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,500
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

224
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,250
WHY DID I FEEL HAPPY
FOR A SECOND?

225
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,000
STUPID.

226
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:25,333
- ( crying ) STUPID, STUPID,
STUPID. I'M SO STUPID.

227
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,583
- PERFECT.

228
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,375
- HIS LAST WORDS WERE
"MAKE SURE SHE'S HAPPY."

229
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,583
- HAPPINESS.
- Rose: SOLTY.

230
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,166
- ROSE?
- COME ON, I NEED YOU.

231
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,041
- WHY ARE YOU HIDING
IN THAT ALLEY? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, ANYWAY?

232
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,333
- NEVER MIND ALL THAT.
YOU GOT HERE JUST IN TIME.

233
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,458
DO YOU HAVE YOUR
CITIZEN'S I.D. CARD?

234
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,291
- YEAH. BUT WHY DO I NEED
MY CARD?

235
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,458
- SO, YOU CAN PAY
FOR MY COFFEE OF COURSE.

236
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,250
- COFFEE?
- CHECK IT OUT.

237
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,958
- ROY?

238
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,875
- CARE FOR MORE COFFEE?
- NO THANKS. I'M FINE.

239
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,000
- COME ON. LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE, THIS IS NONE
OF OUR BUSINESS.

240
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,583
- SUSH, WILL YOU KEEP IT DOWN.

241
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:23,041
- SO, THANKS. I MEAN,
FOR TODAY, I MEAN.

242
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,916
- OH, NO. PLEASE DON'T
MENTION IT, I REALLY ENJOYED IT.

243
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,416
- SO, GET THIS, THOSE TWO WALKED
ALL OVER THE CITY TOGETHER
AND EVEN WENT SHOPPING.

244
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,083
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
IT WASN'T THAT EASY FOLLOWING
THEM WITHOUT BEING SPOTTED.

245
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,958
- OH.

246
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,666
- SO, ROY. TELL ME,
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
GETTING MARRIED AGAIN?

247
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,583
- ( gasps )

248
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:45,000
- GETTING MARRIED? OH MY GOSH,
THIS IS EVEN MORE SERIOUS
THAN I THOUGHT.

249
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:50,250
- I DON'T KNOW. HAVE YOU,
YOU KNOW, CONSIDERED,
UH, RE-MARRIAGE?

250
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,583
- OH, MY, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.

251
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,583
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
- NO, YOU IDIOT. SHUT UP.

252
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:02,041
- PLEASE, ROY. DON'T DO IT.
IT'S A MISTAKE.
- WHERE'D YOU TWO COME FROM?

253
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,250
- Girl: I'M AGAINST IT TOO.
- Both: HUH?

254
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,666
- PLEASE DON'T.
- REVANT, YOU DOG.
YOU'RE PRETTY SLICK, CHIEF.

255
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,458
- NOT YOU TOO.
- NOW WAIT A MINUTE,
ROY'S ON A DATE, TOO?

256
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:15,250
- I GUESS LIFE REALLY
DOES BEGIN AT FORTY.
- NOW THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

257
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,708
- YOU MUST NOT DO IT, MAMA.
YOU MUSTN'T MARRY
A MAN LIKE HIM.

258
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:22,958
I KNOW HIS KIND, HE'LL SUCK YOU
DRY AND SPIT OUT THE PITS,
LIKE AN OLD SHOE.

259
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,291
- SHE'S GOT QUITE A WAY
WITH WORDS, HASN'T SHE?

260
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,625
- NOW WAIT A MINUTE, I THOUGHT
YOU SAID BEFORE YOU WANTED HER
TO GET RE-MARRIED.

261
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,625
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
LOOK AT HIM. YOU CAN SEE
WHAT KIND OF MAN HE IS.

262
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:36,708
- Solty: ROY ISN'T THE KIND
OF PERSON HE LOOKS LIKE.
- THANKS.

263
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,041
- SO, PLEASE DON'T,
I'M BEGGING YOU, MAMA.

264
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,208
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

265
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,791
- NOW HOLD ON A MINUTE.

266
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,458
WHERE IN THE WORLD
DID YOU GET THE IDEA
I WAS PLANNING TO RE-MARRY?

267
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,333
ROY HERE JUST ASKED ME
TO GO SHOPPING WITH HIM TODAY,

268
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,458
THAT'S ALL. NO BIG DEAL.

269
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:56,208
HE ASKED ME TO HELP HIM
CHOOSE GIFTS FOR A COUPLE
OF YOUNG LADIES HE KNEW.

270
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,208
- UH.
- HOLD ON, DID YOU SAY GIFTS?

271
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,583
- HERE. I KNOW
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY, BUT...

272
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:07,375
- THANK YOU.
OH, THANK YOU, MOM.
- IT'S YOUR TURN, ROY.

273
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,208
- HERE YOU GO.

274
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,375
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
THERE'S ONE FOR ME,
AND ONE FOR SOLTY.

275
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,291
- WELL, IT'S KINDA
APPRECIATION DAY.

276
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,500
- YOU REALLY
HAVE A WONDERFUL FATHER.

277
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,666
- YEAH.

278
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,625
- Miranda: KASHA! YOU'RE SOAKED.
GOODNESS, WHAT HAPPENED?

279
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,833
GET IN HERE RIGHT AWAY.
I'LL GO FILL THE BATH TUB.

280
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,500
- UH, MOM?
- HMM, WHAT?

281
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,250
- UM-UM. NOTHING.

282
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,666
- HERE WE GO,
DO YOU FEEL BETTER NOW?

283
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,208
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

284
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:57,208
- MOM, I...
- KASHA, PLEASE FORGIVE ME.
I'M AFRAID THAT I...

285
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:02,125
I THOUGHT YOU DECIDED TO ACCEPT
THE ADOPTION OFFER AND WEREN'T
