1
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,166
- DID YOU JUST SAY THAT,

2
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,125
THAT SHE IS OUR NEW
SUPERIOR OFFICER?

3
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,625
- THAT'S CORRECT.
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY,

4
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,833
YOU WILL ALL BE WORKING
TOGETHER AS ONE UNIT.

5
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,416
- BEGGING YOUR PARDON, SIR.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,708
BUT THAT WOMAN IS A THIEF. SHE'S
DONE NOTHING BUT CAUSE TROUBLE.

7
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,583
ON MANY OCCASIONS,
TO THIS VERY ORGANIZATION.

8
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,500
- AND NOW SHE'S IN CHARGE?
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU.

9
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:44,416
I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH EDUCATION
OR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,666
SHE IS A SUPERIOR INDIVIDUAL,

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,875
WHICH IS WHY I AM MAKING
HER YOUR SUPERIOR.

12
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,708
- OPERATIONS DIRECTOR.
- YES, INTEGRA. WHAT IS IT?

13
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,833
- SIR, I UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU MEAN, ABOUT HER QUALITIES.

14
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,875
HOWEVER, IT IS FAIR TO SAY
THAT WE ARE NOT QUITE ORDINARY.

15
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,625
- AH! RIGHT YOU ARE!
BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY.

16
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,000
ROSE IS A PROCEED,
JUST LIKE YOU.

17
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,500
- ( gasps )

18
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,958
- OKAY THEN, ASSUMING THERE
ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS,

19
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,458
BEGINNING TOMORROW MORNING,

20
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,416
YOU WILL ALL TAKE ORDERS FROM
YOUR NEW SUPERIOR OFFICER.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,958
MS. ANDERSON WHY DON'T YOU
INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO THE TEAM?

22
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,833
- HELLO, EVERYONE,
PLEASED TO MEET YOU. I'M ROSE.

23
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,666
- ( theme song playing )

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

25
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,750
- JOSEPH?
- YEAH.

26
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,750
HE'S AN OLD HERMIT. DOESN'T LIVE
TOO FAR FROM HERE. YOU KNOW,

27
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,791
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE
KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT GIRL.

28
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,208
- WHERE'S HE LIVE?

29
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,166
- DUE WEST, BUT IT'S NOT
THE EASIEST PLACE TO FIND.

30
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,125
NO ROAD SIGNS. BUT I THINK
I COULD GET YOU THERE.

31
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,333
I'LL DRAW YOU A MAP WITH SOME
LANDMARKS ON IT IF YOU WANT.

32
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,875
- GUESS I'LL HAVE
TO GO CHECK IT OUT.

33
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,291
- I JUST CAN'T BRING
MYSELF TO DO IT!

34
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,166
A FORMER THIEF,
OUR SUPERIOR OFFICER?

35
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,625
I WON'T ACCEPT IT! HOW CAN I?
IT'S RIDICULOUS!

36
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,166
WOULD YOU CARE TO ADD
SOMETHING TO THIS, INTEGRA?

37
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,958
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

38
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,541
- I THINK I'LL BE FOLLOWING
THE DIRECTOR'S ORDERS.

39
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,125
- ( sighs ) CELICA?

40
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,541
- I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS, AS
LONG AS I STILL GET A PAYCHECK.

41
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:58,750
- HEY, DON'T LOOK AT ME!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.

42
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:02,291
- Rose: MORNING, EVERYONE!
- GOOD MORNING TO YOU, TOO!

43
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,291
- YES. HI! GOOD MORNING!
- HEY!

44
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:09,541
- ( Rose sighs ) THIS PLACE IS
BIG! I GOT LOST ON THE WAY DOWN.

45
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,750
( yawns ) SO TIRED.

46
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,250
SO, THE EMPTY SEAT'S MINE,
I TAKE IT?

47
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,916
- YES. THAT'S THE ONE.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,958
- I FIGURED AS MUCH.
JUST MAKING SURE.

49
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,375
( sighs )

50
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,125
- HUH?
- EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.

51
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,125
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU WITH
THIS ON YOUR FIRST DAY,

52
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,000
BUT I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR
SIGNATURE ON THESE DOCUMENTS.

53
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,583
- IS THAT SO? DO ME A FAVOR,
WILL YOU? DON'T CALL ME "CHIEF".

54
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,375
IT KIND OF BUGS ME.
I DON'T LIKE IT.

55
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,958
- Integra: UH, OKAY.

56
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,500
- SO I SHOULD LOOK THAT OVER,

57
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,958
MAKE SURE IT'S ALL OFFICIAL
AND STUFF, THEN SIGN IT. RIGHT?

58
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,875
HMM. JUST LEAVE IT THERE.

59
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,000
- BUT...
- WHAT?

60
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,041
- IS IT SOMETHING THAT
CAN'T WAIT?

61
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,958
- WELL, I SUPPOSE IT COULD WAIT.

62
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,250
- THEN I'LL LOOK AT IT LATER.
JUST SET IT DOWN FOR NOW.

63
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:59,166
- EXCUSE ME! BUT FOR A SUPERIOR
OFFICER ON HER FIRST DAY,

64
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,458
YOUR ATTITUDE IS
COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE.

65
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,500
- SILVIA...
- IT IS?

66
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,333
- ANYONE WITH COMMON
SENSE WOULD AGREE.

67
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,458
- "COMMON SENSE", HUH?

68
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,375
RIGHT. LET ME TAKE
A COUPLE MOMENTS

69
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,500
TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS
IS GOING TO WORK.

70
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,166
I BELIEVE THE END RESULT
IS ALL THAT COUNTS.

71
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,833
AS LONG AS YOU PRODUCE RESULTS,

72
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,458
I DON'T REALLY CARE
HOW YOU GOT THEM.

73
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,791
YOU CAN GOOF-OFF ON DUTY,

74
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,458
TAKE A NAP, WHATEVER.
IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME.

75
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,125
- SERIOUSLY?
- Rose: SERIOUSLY.

76
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,458
- TERRIFIC! I LOVE YOU!

77
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,791
- ( phone ringing )

78
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:33,458
- THIS IS SECURITY, SPECIAL OPS,
SECTION 7 AXELA SPEAKING.

79
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,541
RIGHT. CHIEF.

80
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,500
- "ROSE".
- OH, RIGHT. SORRY.

81
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:44,958
UH, ROSE? WE HAVE A REQUEST FOR
IMMEDIATE ACTION FROM SECTION 4.

82
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,083
- THIS MUST BE IT.

83
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,291
- ( banging on door )

84
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,250
- THE DOOR'S OPEN.

85
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,708
- ARE YOU JOSEPH?

86
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,375
- WHO WANTS TO KNOW?
- I DO. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

87
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,166
YOU SEEN THIS GIRL?

88
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,541
- SO YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOLTY, HUH?

89
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,500
SHE WAS HERE, BUT SHE WENT
BACK WHERE SHE BELONGS.

90
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,291
- UH...

91
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,791
HELLO?

92
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,750
- Axela: YOU HAVE THREE TARGETS,
TWO MEN, AND ONE WOMAN.

93
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,458
THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE ATTACK ON THE RUC TRANSPORT

94
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:41,083
THAT TOOK PLACE 30 MINUTES
AGO ON 47TH STREET.

95
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,666
ONE MAN HAS TWO RESEMBLE ARMS.
THE OTHER, TWO RESEMBLE LEGS.

96
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,125
IT APPEARS THAT
THE WOMAN IS NATIVE.

97
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,833
- SILVIA. CELICA. REPORT.
ARE YOU TWO IN POSITION?

98
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,583
- IN POSITION AND READY.

99
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,791
- SAME HERE.
THE TARGET'S LOCKED.

100
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,000
- OKAY ROSE.
EVERYONE IS READY TO MOVE IN.

101
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,166
REQUESTING PERMISSION
TO COMMENCE.

102
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,000
- SURE! GO RIGHT AHEAD!

103
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,583
- Integra: COMMENCING OPERATION!
GIRLS LET'S DO THIS!

104
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,166
- Silvia: RIGHT!
- Celica: COPY THAT!

105
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,083
- ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE JUST HOW
GOOD YOU LADIES REALLY ARE.

106
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,250
- HOW'S IT LOOK?

107
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,708
- THE COAST IS CLEAR.
THERE'S NO SIGN OF COPS.

108
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,708
ALL RIGHT GUYS.
LET'S MOVE IT OUT.

109
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,000
- ( gunshot )

110
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,041
- ( screams )

111
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,708
- WHAT THE HELL?
- ONE DOWN, AND TWO TO GO.

112
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,625
- IT'S A SNIPER!
WE GOTTA FIND ANOTHER WAY!

113
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,375
- THE BACK DOOR!

114
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,875
( screams )

115
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,041
- YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?
- DAMN YOU!

116
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,333
( grunts )

117
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,583
HUH?

118
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,791
( grunting )

119
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,208
- GO, USE IT RIGHT NOW! QUICKLY.

120
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,750
- ( gasps ) WHAT WAS THAT?

121
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,000
- SILVIA! COME IN! SILVIA!

122
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,916
WHAT'S GOING ON?
DO YOU READ ME?

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,458
CELICA!
WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE?

124
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,750
WHAT DO YOU SEE
FROM YOUR POSITION?

125
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,000
- Celica: I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING!

126
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,583
I THINK THEY USED SOME
SORT OF FLASH GRENADE!

127
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,458
- Integra: UNDERSTOOD,
BUT WHERE IS SILVIA!

128
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,000
- Celica: I DON'T KNOW! I TOLD
YOU, I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING!

129
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,458
- IT'S NO GOOD.
I DON'T HAVE A SHOT.

130
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:19,500
- Rose: OPEN FIRE. IF YOU'RE
LUCKY, YOU'LL HIT THE TARGET.

131
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,208
AT THE VERY LEAST
IT'LL CAUSE A DISTRACTION.

132
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,500
- Celica: WAIT. ARE YOU SURE?

133
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,208
- Rose: SILVIA'S SUIT WILL
PROTECT HER, RIGHT?

134
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,166
FIRE! THAT'S AN ORDER!

135
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,625
- NO! DON'T DO IT, CELICA!

136
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,333
- Celica: THANK YOU.
STANDING DOWN.

137
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,375
- ( grunting )

138
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,416
- MY EYES. CAN'T SEE!

139
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,125
- ( screams )

140
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,750
- BULLSEYE!

141
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,708
WE START BY TAKING AWAY
THE TARGET'S MOBILITY.

142
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,125
WORKS EVERY TIME.

143
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:52,000
- ROSE! HOW COULD YOU...

144
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,625
WAIT! I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ONE OF US!

145
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,625
- NOT ANYMORE. I'M SORRY,

146
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,833
THAT WAS THE "OLD" ME.
I'M WORKING AT RUC NOW.

147
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,500
- WHAT DO YOU NEED ME TO DO?

148
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,666
- IT'S ALL OVER.
OPERATION SUCCESSFUL.

149
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,833
- ( sighs ) I'M BEAT!

150
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,041
- A SHOWER REALLY SOUNDS
GOOD RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

151
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,708
- YEAH! AND A NAP.

152
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,000
- NICELY DONE!
- OH! HELLO SIR.

153
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,083
- I JUST FINISHED REVIEWING
THE COMMUNICATIONS LOG

154
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,666
FROM YOUR LATEST MISSION.

155
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,750
HOW ARE YOUR EYES, SILVIA?
EVERYTHING OKAY?

156
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,791
- YES! THANK YOU FOR ASKING
SIR! I SEE JUST FINE NOW.

157
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,083
- SO WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT?

158
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,083
- WELL, PRETTY MUCH WHAT
I WAS EXPECTING.

159
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,625
- YOU DID VERY WELL.

160
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,625
- I KNEW YOU WERE TESTING ME.
- ( chuckles ) MAYBE I WAS.

161
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,583
LOOK. I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED,
BUT WE SHOULD TALK.

162
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,208
WOULD YOU MIND COMING WITH ME?

163
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,208
- SURE! WHY NOT.
- THIS WAY.

164
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,958
- CHIEF.

165
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,708
- I BELIEVE I TOLD YOU
TO CALL ME ROSE, SILVIA.

166
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:56,958
- AND I DON'T CARE.

167
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,041
I'M HERE TO CHALLENGE
YOU TO A MOCK-BATTLE.

168
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,541
- "MOCK-WHAT?"

169
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,916
- THE OPERATIONS DIRECTOR
SAID THAT HE PUT YOU IN CHARGE

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,875
OF THIS SECTION BECAUSE
YOU WERE SUPERIOR TO US.

171
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,125
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

172
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,708
THEN ACCEPT MY CHALLENGE
UNDER THIS CONDITION,

173
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,000
IF I DEFEAT YOU, I GET
TO TAKE OVER AS CHIEF.

174
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,458
- OH! SO YOU WANT
TO BE CHIEF, HUH?

175
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:19,541
- IF I WIN, THEN I WILL BE.

176
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:25,291
- WELL IT SOUNDS KINDA FUN.
OKAY! LET'S DO IT!

177
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,750
- SO WHAT'S UP?
DO WE STOP BEFORE CONTACT?

178
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,541
- NO. THIS WILL BE A FULL
CONTACT BATTLE SIMULATION.

179
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,000
NO HOLDS BARRED.

180
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,291
- FINE. AND HOW WILL
THE WINNER BE DETERMINED?

181
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,125
- THE BATTLE ENDS WHEN ONE OF
US IS EITHER UNABLE TO FIGHT,

182
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,625
IS RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS,

183
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,625
OR VERBALLY CONCEDES,
ADMITTING DEFEAT.

184
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,291
- AND THE TIME LIMIT?
- NO TIME LIMIT.

185
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,333
- SOUNDS GREAT!
THIS SHOULD BE EXCITING.

186
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,375
- LET'S GO.

187
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,291
- WHO DO YOU THINK
IS GOING TO WIN?

188
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,875
- WELL, IT'S
HARD TO SAY.

189
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,666
BUT SILVIA IS AN EXPERT IN
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.

190
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,041
- OOH, THERE THEY GO!

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,333
- ( groans )

192
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,333
- SHE'S FAST!

193
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,625
- HANG IN THERE, ROSE!
GIVE IT TO HER, SILVIA!

194
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:49,416
( gasps ) GO! GO! GO!

195
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,000
- REMEMBER, WE'RE GOING UNTIL
ONE OF US IS UNCONSCIOUS

196
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,625
OR JUST CAN'T FIGHT.

197
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,625
- ( groans )

198
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:03,500
- OOH. AND SHE IS DOWN.
GAME OVER!

199
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,375
- IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?

200
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,333
- ( laughs ) THAT HURT!

201
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,041
- THIS WOULD BE A GOOD
TIME TO GIVE UP.

202
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:19,208
- BUT WHY? WE WERE JUST STARTING
TO GET TO THE GOOD STUFF!

203
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,500
I MEAN, IT'D BE A SHAME
TO END IT SO SOON.

204
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,041
- I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT.

205
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,333
I WAS AFRAID YOU WERE
GOING TO DISAPPOINT ME!

206
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:33,958
- ( grunting )

207
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,208
- ( laughs )

208
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:40,000
- WHAT THE...
- INTERESTING.

209
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,583
- ROSE IS ACCLIMATING
TO HER SUIT.

210
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,166
IT'S HER FIRST DAY, SHE'S NEVER
SEEN BATTLE IN IT BEFORE.

211
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,416
- Integra: IT TAKES A LITTLE
WHILE FOR THE SUIT TO COLLECT

212
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,666
HER INDIVIDUAL DATA,

213
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,041
BEFORE IT CAN PERFORM
TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL.

214
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,375
- I CAN'T HIT HER!

215
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,916
- ( laughs )

216
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,375
I THINK I'M FINALLY STARTING TO
GET THE HANG OF THIS THING.

217
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,958
- GET A HANG OF THIS!

218
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,333
- YOU'RE GOING ABOUT THIS THE
WRONG WAY! SAVE YOUR SPECIAL

219
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,666
MOVES FOR WHEN YOU CAN
GET THE MOST OUT OF THEM.

220
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,166
KIND OF LIKE THIS!

221
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,625
- ( groans )

222
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,041
- STILL WANT TO CONTINUE?

223
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:26,125
- NO. I GIVE UP.
- SILVIA...

224
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,291
- SO ROSE WON?

225
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,541
- ( scoffs )

226
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,791
- SILVIA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

227
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,916
- MY PRIDE HURTS A LITTLE.
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,458
I GUESS I'M OKAY.

229
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,333
IT'S FINE. IT JUST GIVES ME
INCENTIVE TO KEEP WORKING.

230
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,000
- I'LL GET HER BACK ONE DAY.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

231
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,708
SO IF WE LET YOU HAVE YOUR WAY,

232
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,750
SOMEDAY YOU'RE
GOING TO BE OUR BOSS.

233
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,291
- NOT SURE I LIKE THAT.

234
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,416
- ( chuckles ) WELL,
WE'LL SEE. ANYWAY...

235
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,208
I'M GOING TO GO TAKE
A SHOWER. JUST UH...

236
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,333
TAKE CARE OF THINGS
FOR ME UNTIL I GET BACK.

237
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,666
- ( door opens )

238
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,291
- POOR SILVIA.

239
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,000
- ( gasps ) SOLTY?
- SOLTY!

240
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,458
- ( chuckles) HEY!

241
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,708
I JUST GOT BACK SO
I THOUGHT I'D...

242
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,333
- ( grunts )

243
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,625
- WHAT DID YOU DO
THAT FOR, KASHA?

244
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,333
- ( crying )

245
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:55,291
OH, SOLTY! I WAS SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOU! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

246
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,375
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH HERE?

247
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,083
- WELCOME HOME, SOLTY.

248
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,625
- I WAS WORRIED SICK!
SO, ARE YOU OKAY?

249
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,625
I FELT SO LOST. I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT YOU.

250
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,791
- STAY AWAY FROM HER, YOU FREAK!

251
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,250
- Yuto: WHY? WHAT DID I DO?
I WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT HER.

252
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,416
- Kasha: IT WAS THE WAY
YOU WERE LOOKING AT HER.

253
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,166
PERVERT!

254
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,666
- MIRANDA? WHERE'S ROY?

255
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,458
- WAIT. YOU MEAN YOU
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM?

256
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,458
HE WENT OUT LOOKING
FOR YOU, SOLTY.

257
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,166
- WHAT?
HE WAS LOOKING FOR ME?

258
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,125
- EWW!

259
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,166
- HEY, MOM! IS THE BATH READY?
- YES.

260
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,875
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON. YOU'RE
COVERED IN DIRT! LET'S GO!

261
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,333
- KASHA!
- YOU SMELL TOO.

262
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,625
- AND WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING, YUTO?

263
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,458
- HUH?

264
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,500
- ( beeps )

265
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,083
- CAN I HELP YOU?

266
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,375
- YES. MY CARD DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE WORKING.

267
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,708
- WHAT, YOU MEAN NO
ONE'S TOLD YOU?

268
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,333
YOU'VE BEEN DISMISSED
FROM THE PROGRAM.

269
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,833
YOUR CLEARANCE HAS BEEN REVOKED.

270
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,000
THESE FACILITIES ARE
OFF-LIMITS TO YOU NOW.

271
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,208
- ( gasps )

272
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,375
- I SHOULD WARN YOU,

273
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,541
IF YOU SPEAK TO ANYONE
OF YOUR WORK HERE,

274
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,250
OR IF YOU MAKE ANY ATTEMPT
TO RE-ENTER THESE FACILITIES...

275
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,916
- COME ON, I DON'T
HAVE ALL DAY.

276
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,333
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO
TALK TO ME ABOUT?

277
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,291
- NOW I WANT YOU TO LISTEN.

278
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,583
WHEN THE GIRL FIRST
ARRIVED HERE,

279
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,916
HER AI CIRCUITS WERE OVERLOADED.
ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE.

280
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,666
I WAS THE ONE WHO REPAIRED HER.

281
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,791
THE NATURE OF THE DAMAGES
LED ME TO BELIEVE

282
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,166
THAT SHE HAD BEEN EXPOSED
TO EXTREME LEVELS OF STRESS.

283
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,916
- ANY IDEA WHEN
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN?

284
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,041
- YEAH, I DO.

285
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,500
- WHAT HAPPENED?

286
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,541
- I'D RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

287
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,083
- IS THAT SO?

288
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,625
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT GIRL IS?

289
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,583
- YEAH. SHE'S AN ANDROID.
SO WHAT?

290
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,416
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

291
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,333
- IT'S MORE THAN THAT, AND YOU
KNOW IT. I'M SURE BY NOW

292
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,250
YOU'RE AT LEAST PARTIALLY
AWARE OF HER CAPABILITIES.

293
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,958
SO YOU HAVE SOME IDEA
OF HOW POWERFUL SHE IS.

294
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,375
IN TIME, THAT POWER WILL
ENDANGER NOT ONLY YOU,

295
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,958
BUT EVERYONE AROUND YOU.

296
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,625
KNOWING THAT, ARE YOU STILL
WILLING TO FIND HER?

297
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,541
AND LIVE WITH HER?
AND CARE FOR HER?

298
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,041
HEY! WAIT A MINUTE.

299
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,000
- LOOK, EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
NONE OF THAT MATTERS.

300
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:31,291
'CAUSE I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HER.
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

301
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,000
- ( door closes )

302
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,958
- ( sighs )

303
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:41,125
- WOW, SOLTY, HOW DID YOU
MANAGE TO GET THIS DIRTY?

304
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,833
YOU'RE FILTHY!

305
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:47,416
- I GUESS I'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT. THINGS HAPPENED.

306
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,541
KASHA, I MET SOMEONE.

307
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,708
I MET SOMEONE THAT I LOVE.

308
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,833
- HUH?

309
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,958
- I'M ONLY KIDDING.
WELL, HALF-KIDDING.

310
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,833
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

311
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,250
- IT MEANS EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

312
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,208
- "HALF-KIDDING IN LOVE", WHAT?
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

313
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,416
- YUTO! REALLY!
- HUH?

314
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,416
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

315
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,000
- UH, WELL I WAS...

316
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,041
- ( loud slap )

317
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,583
- WHAT! THIS SAYS
THAT I'M FIRED!

318
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,125
- HUH?

319
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,958
"THIS NOTICE IS TO INFORM YOU
THAT, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY

320
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,375
"YOU ARE HEREBY DISMISSED
FROM EMPLOYMENT

321
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,333
FOR DERELICTION OF DUTY."

322
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,000
THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE!

323
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,458
- "DERELICTION OF DUTY"?
WHAT THE HECK'S THAT MEAN!

324
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,833
- I HAVE NO...
WAIT JUST A MINUTE.

325
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,833
- HEY! WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF THIS?

326
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,333
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

327
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,041
I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS THE
SAME EXACT TIME THAT YOU DID.

328
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,291
- "RESULTS ARE ALL THAT COUNT."
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

329
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,916
THEN YOU GO AND PULL THIS?

330
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,125
- LISTEN, I'M TELLING
YOU IT WASN'T ME!

331
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,291
MAYBE IT WAS THE
OPERATIONS DIRECTOR.

332
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,666
WHY DON'T YOU GET
IN HIS FACE ABOUT IT?

333
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,000
- ALL RIGHT THEN. GUESS I WILL.

334
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,041
- ( door opens )

335
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,291
- SILVIA! WAIT!

336
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,666
HEY! WAIT A MINUTE!
MAYBE THIS ISN'T...

337
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,458
- LET GO OF ME, AXELA!

338
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,541
- IT WON'T DO ANY
GOOD RIGHT NOW.

339
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,833
- AND WHAT MAKES YOU
SO SURE ABOUT THAT?

340
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,375
- BECAUSE I...

341
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,125
- ROSE, DON'T LET ME DOWN.

342
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,375
YOU'RE THE ONLY
ONE I CAN COUNT ON.

343
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,291
- LOOK, JUST COME BACK
TO THE OFFICE FOR NOW

344
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,541
AND WE'LL FIGURE...

345
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,375
- I AM GOING TO TAKE
CARE OF THIS RIGHT NOW.

346
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,416
OR ELSE TOMORROW,

347
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,958
CELICA WON'T BE ONE
OF US ANYMORE.

348
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:52,333
OPERATIONS DIRECTOR!

349
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,791
I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU FIRED
CELICA! HOW COULD YOU?

350
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,625
AFTER ALL THIS TIME, AND AFTER
EVERYTHING WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED.

351
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,208
- WE TRUSTED YOU!
- YES. I UNDERSTAND.

352
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,750
- NO, YOU DON'T! YOU...
- YOU'RE WRONG, SILVIA.

353
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,791
YOU AND THE OTHER GIRLS
ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE

354
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,958
I CAN COMPLETELY DEPEND ON.

355
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,000
- THE ONLY ONES
THAT I CAN TRUST.

356
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,333
- THEN WHY'D YOU DO IT? TELL ME.

357
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,916
- YOU AND THE OTHER PROCEED
MEMBERS HAVE ALL BEEN

358
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,666
RE-ENGINEERED AT THE DNA LEVEL
TO POSSESS SPECIAL CAPABILITIES.

359
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,875
IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING,

360
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,500
YOU ARE THE NEXT GENERATION
OF HUMAN BEINGS.

361
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,250
YOU AND THE OTHER GIRLS
WERE THE ONLY ONES

362
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,375
WHO COULD HELP ME BRING MY IDEAL
VISION OF THE WORLD TO FRUITION.

363
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,208
- THAT IS WHY I STAKED
MY VISION ON YOU.

364
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,583
- ON ME?

365
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,375
- YES. AND DURING OUR PROCESS
OF WORKING TOGETHER,

366
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,291
I CAME TO REALIZE THAT
I HAD DEVELOPED FEELINGS

367
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,875
BEYOND THOSE OF A SUPERIOR
FOR HIS SUBORDINATES.

368
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,333
AS FOR THE REST...
I TRUST IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.

369
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,125
- ( gasps ) DIRECTOR...

370
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,708
- SILVIA...

371
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,041
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.

372
00:20:55,916 --> 00:21:00,250
BUT IN THE END, MY ONLY DESIRE
IS FOR SUPERIOR SOLDIERS.

373
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,000
- ( loud crunch )

374
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,666
- ( gasping )

375
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,333
- AND INSUBORDINATION IS
SOMETHING I WILL NOT TOLERATE.

376
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,666
ROSE, SHE'S THE ONE.

377
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,250
SHE'LL HELP ME REALIZE MY DREAM.
WHICH MEANS...

378
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,291
I NO LONGER HAVE A NEED FOR YOU.

379
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,333
- HOW COULD YOU...

380
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,250
I BELIEVED IN YOU...

381
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,791
- SILVIA!
- SILVIA WHAT...

382
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,666
SILVIA!

383
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,333
- SILENCE!

384
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,625
- ( all gasp )

385
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,750
- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU ALLOW EMOTION

386
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,541
TO INTERFERE WITH DUTY.

387
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,666
I HAVE NO MORE USE FOR YOU.
YOU'RE OBSOLETE!

388
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,333
- ( theme song playing )

389
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

390
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,666
- Solty: THIS IS THE PLACE
WHERE I BELONG.

391
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,333
AND THIS IS WHERE HE BELONGS.

392
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:42,000
NEXT EPISODE, "WELCOME HOME."

393
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,583
DINNER'S READY!
