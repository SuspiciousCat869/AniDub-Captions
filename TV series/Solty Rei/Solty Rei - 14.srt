IS THIS RITA?

3
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,666
- Coroner: YES.
HER INJURIES WERE QUITE SEVERE.

4
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,750
I'M SORRY. I WISH THERE
WAS MORE I COULD'VE DONE

TO HELP WITH THE IDENTIFICATION,

7
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,000
WE ALSO HAVE THESE
PERSONAL EFFECTS THAT

8
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:03,125
WERE FOUND NEAR THE BODY.

9
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,333
WERE THEY HERS?

10
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,250

THROUGH THE RUBBLE
FOR SURVIVORS.

21
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,958
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS
FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS RIGHT NOW

22
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,041
IS THE STRUCTURAL
INTEGRITY OF THE AREA.

23
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,333
- THEY'VE BEEN SHOWING
THE SAME THING

24
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,291
ON EVERY CHANNEL ALL MORNING.

25
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,666
I CAN'T WATCH ANYMORE.

26
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,583
- HOW IS HE?

27
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,833

28
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,625
- HE HASN'T EATEN ANYTHING
IN DAYS. IT'S AS IF

29
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,791
THE HANDS OF THE CLOCK HAVE
TURNED BACK TWELVE YEARS.

ACTED BACK THEN, TOO.

34

YOU DID EVERYTHING
YOU COULD TO STOP HER.

HE'LL EAT ANYTHING?

00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,125
OH, AND GIRLS,

233
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,791
I WAS THINKING OF AUTHORIZING

PASS OUT WHEN HE
TOUCHED YOUR SHOULDER.

238
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,250
OH, THAT WAS CLASSIC.

HOW ABOUT YOU LET ME SHOW

THAT WAY YOUR FACE WON'T
LOOK LIKE A RIPE TOMATO WHEN...

241
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,291

250
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,583
WE'RE STILL SEARCHING, THOUGH.

251
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,708
- OH, OKAY.
