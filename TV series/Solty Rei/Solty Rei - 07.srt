1
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,375
- Solty: HERE IN THE
CITY WHERE WE LIVE,

2
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,958
WE HAVE SO MANY AMAZING THINGS.

3
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:44,375
TALL BUILDINGS, PARKS,
HOSPITALS, SHOPPING MALLS,

4
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,541
LOTS OF CARS,
EVEN A MONORAIL.

5
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,958
WE HAVE TELEVISIONS
AND TELEPHONES,

6
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,208
AND MACHINES THAT PLAY MUSIC.

7
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,208
I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT BUILDING
THAT MIRANDA OWNS.

8
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,250
I LIVE WITH MIRANDA,

9
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:04,166
AND KASHA AND ROY.

10
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,750
I LOVE THIS TOWN.

11
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,541
- AND NOW FOR THE NEWS...

12
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,708
IN THIS MORNING'S
TOP HEADLINES...

13
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:36,250
- ( smacks lips ) THIS ACTUALLY
TURNED OUT PRETTY GOOD.

14
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,750
- Rose: UGH. WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THAT?

15
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,125
"R.U.C. ANNOUNCES LAUNCH
OF NEW PRODUCT LINE."

16
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,416
HAVEN'T THOSE GREEDY PIGS
MADE ENOUGH MONEY ALREADY?

17
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,958
- WHAT IN THE HECK
ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?

18
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,541
- OH, COME ON.
DON'T BE LIKE THAT!

19
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,875
I TOLD YOU I WAS MOVING IN
FOR A WHILE, DIDN'T I?

20
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,333
- YEAH! AND WHY'S THAT AGAIN?

21
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,708
- OH, YOU.

22
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,791
I TOLD YOU, THE POLICE CAME
AND RAIDED OUR HIDEOUT.

23
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,541
MY BROTHERS AND I
HAD TO GET OUT QUICK.

24
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,125
SO I'M PRETTY MUCH HOMELESS
FOR THE TIME BEING.

25
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,458
I'LL BET.

26
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,875
- I HAD NO IDEA.

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,666
OH MY GOSH, ROSE.

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,958
THAT SOUNDS JUST AWFUL.

29
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,458
- ( chuckles )
YEAH, I GUESS IT DOES!

30
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,500
- BUT, OH, WELL...
- WE'RE NOT FINISHED YET.

31
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,333
- OOH! MY HOROSCOPE SAYS
THINGS'RE LOOKING UP TODAY.

32
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,333
WHAT'S YOUR SIGN, SOLTY?

33
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:21,166
SORRY. SEE, I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHEN I WAS BORN.

34
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,541
( chuckles ) WELL, I HOPE
YOU'RE NOT A SCORPIO.

35
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,291
TODAY'S AWFUL FOR THEM.

36
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,250
NOW YOU, WHAT'S YOUR SIGN?

37
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:33,958
- TAKE A GUESS.

38
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,625
- ( theme song playing )

39
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:36,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

40
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,000
- AND IN OTHER NEWS TODAY...

41
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,250
- Rose: WE NEED TO TALK.

42
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,541
THIS PLACE IS A MESS.

43
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,500
DO YOU EVER
CLEAN UP AROUND HERE?

44
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,125
- WHY? YOU LOOKING FOR A JOB?

45
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,041
- UH, ROSE?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

46
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,916
- AS LONG AS I'M GONNA BE LIVING
HERE, THERE ARE CERTAIN MINIMUM

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,833
STANDARDS OF CLEANLINESS
I'LL NEED TO HAVE MAINTAINED.

48
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,291
- EW!
- Roy: WHAT?

49
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,416
- THIS SORT OF FILTH
IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE,

50
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,000
NOT TO MENTION
ABSOLUTE MURDER ON MY SKIN.

51
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,041
- Roy: YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE.

52
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,916
LOOK, THIS IS
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

53
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,083
- Rose: DO WE HAVE
A DRESSING TABLE?

54
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,500
AND WHAT ABOUT THE SHOWER?
USABLE, I HOPE?

55
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,916
I ONLY USE SHAMPOO
WITH TTC, NOTHING ELSE.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,083
SAME FOR BODY WASH.

57
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,375
- NOW, WAIT, I HAVE...

58
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,125
- YOU'LL HAVE TO CLEAN
THE PLACE EVERY DAY.

59
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,625
LAUNDRY, TOO.

60
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,208
BUT, LISTEN, JUST SO WE'RE
CLEAR, I DO NOT WANT MY THINGS

61
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,291
WASHED WITH THE
OLD MAN'S, GOT IT?

62
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,583
- ( chuckles sarcastically )
YEAH RIGHT.

63
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,750
I EXPECT A HEALTHY,
WELL-BALANCED BREAKFAST.

64
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,833
SOMETHING LIGHT.
NOTHING FRIED OR FATTY.

65
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,791
AND I ONLY DRINK ROSEMARY TEA,
BECAUSE AFTER ALL,

66
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:05,916
WELL...

67
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,500
THAT IS MY NAME!

68
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,500
THAT LAST PART
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A JOKE.

69
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,208
- UH?

70
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,791
- BUT SERIOUSLY,
I DON'T DRINK COFFEE.

71
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,541
AND NO TAP WATER, EITHER.

72
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,958
OH, AND YOU'LL WANNA
BUY PURIFIED WATER

73
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,375
AND USE THAT FOR
EVERYTHING, OKAY?

74
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,791
- UM, OKAY.

75
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,000
- Roy: FORGET IT!

76
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,000
LOOK, I NEVER SAID
YOU COULD STAY HERE!

77
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,500
I WANT YOU GONE RIGHT NOW!

78
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,583
- OH, RELAX.

79
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,458
JUST GO WITH IT.
IT'S BETTER FOR EVERYONE.

80
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,083
- THE HELL IT IS! GET OUT!

81
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,375
- HERE, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A VOTE?

82
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,708
BY SHOW OF HANDS,

83
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,500
WHO THINKS IT'S A GOOD
IDEA FOR ME TO STAY HERE?

84
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,916
I DO!

85
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,500
I DO.

86
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,708
- UM...

87
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,041
UH...

88
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:50,875
I DO...

89
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,250
- ( scoffs )

90
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,333
- IT'S JUST, SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO.

91
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,958
I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

92
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,291
AND WELL, I WAS THINKING
IT MIGHT BE NICE,

93
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,166
HAVING A FRIEND
TO SPEND TIME WITH...

94
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,291
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT!
WE'LL HAVE A BALL!

95
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,583
- NO, WE WON'T!

96
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,833
UGH.

97
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,041
- ROY? WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

98
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,416
- TO WORK.

99
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,750
YOU'RE GONE BY THE TIME I GET
BACK, AND THAT'S FINAL, ROSE!

100
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,041
I MEAN IT.

101
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,250
I MEAN IT!

102
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,583
- ( door slams )

103
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,125
- IS HE ALWAYS THIS GRUMPY?

104
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,166
- WELL... KINDA.

105
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,708
- ( muttering ) DAMMIT!
OF ALL THE STUPID...

106
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,541
IT'S THE LAST THING
I NEEDED TODAY.

107
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,416
AH.

108
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,541
WHAT?

109
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,041
- ( exclaims in fear )

110
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,375
I... I'M SORRY, SIR!

111
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,625
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
I PROMISE! I DIDN'T MEAN IT!

112
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,791
OH, I'M SO SORRY!

113
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,750
- ( meows )

114
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,625
- Kasha: SO, ROY, ANYTHING
INTERESTING ON THE HOME FRONT?

115
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,708
LIKE MAYBE A SURPRISE GUEST?

116
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,541
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

117
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,583
- WELL, ROSE DID STOP BY
TO SAY HELLO YESTERDAY.

118
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,125
SHE EVEN BROUGHT CHOCOLATES.

119
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,375
- ( sniggers )

120
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,333
SHE TAKES OVER MY PLACE,
AND YOU GET THE GIFT.

121
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,458
- YOU WANT SOME?

122
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,458
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, DON'T LET
HER STAY THERE TOO LONG.

123
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,458
A KNOWN THIEF LIVING WITH
A HUNTER AT HIS APARTMENT?

124
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,750
IT JUST LOOKS BAD.

125
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,000
- Roy: WHOA, WHOA!

126
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,666
I NEVER WANTED HER
THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

127
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,083
- Miranda: OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

128
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,416
IF ANYONE RAISES ANY EYEBROWS,
WE'LL JUST TELL THEM

129
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,375
SOMEONE HIRED US
TO KEEP TABS ON HER.

130
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,083
IT'S NOT THAT UNUSUAL.

131
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,541
- SO WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW?

132
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,625
ROSE SAYS THE POLICE
RAIDED HER HIDEOUT.

133
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,500
IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THAT?

134
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,791
- Miranda: HER STORY CHECKS OUT.

135
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,083
I MEAN, IT'S ALL
BEEN LOGGED ONTO THE POLICE NET.

136
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,458
- AND WHAT ABOUT HER BROTHERS?

137
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,708
- WELL, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING TO
INDICATE THEY'VE BEEN CAPTURED.

138
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,500
NO. THE POLICE HAVE
ISSUED WARRANTS,

139
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,583
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE STILL AT LARGE.

140
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,000
- ( humming )

141
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,458
UH. OH, HI... ROY.

142
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,875
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S THE SPOT!

143
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,958
OH, YES! PUSH RIGHT THERE!

144
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,166
- ( sighs )

145
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,458
MY THINGS...
ROSE, COME HERE.

146
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,958
- ROSE! ROSE!
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.

147
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,083
WE FINISHED YOUR ROOM!

148
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,250
- ROSE!
- Rose: GREAT! THANKS, BOYS!

149
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,250
- Roy: NO.

150
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,666
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

151
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,125
- ( groans ) WHAT'S UP
WITH YOU, MAN?

152
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,541
- ( crowd chattering )

153
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,791
- Rose: COME ON IN!

154
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,833
YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE!
EVERYTHING GOES TO ME!

155
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,291
SORRY, I SORT OF COMMANDEERED
YOUR ROOM.

156
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,916
A GIRL'S GOTTA HAVE HER PRIVACY.

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
- YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?
- WHY YOU... LISTEN...

158
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,791
- HERE. I'M GUESSING THIS IS
KINDA SPECIAL TO YOU, RIGHT?

159
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,000
IT'S THE ONLY
THING IN THAT ROOM

160
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,125
YOU ACTUALLY BOTHERED TO CLEAN.

161
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,666
- Woman: YOUR TOTAL BILL
COMES OUT TO 78,000 TORAS...

162
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,791
- OH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!

163
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,708
- SO, UH, IT MUST FEEL
AWFULLY CROWDED

164
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,750
HAVING ANOTHER
PERSON LIVING HERE.

165
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,708
- NOT REALLY.

166
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,875
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE WELCOME
TO STAY AT MY PLACE!

167
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,875
- OH. NO, THANKS.

168
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,000
- WELL, IF YOU GET SICK
OF ALL THE NOISE, YOU COULD...

169
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,666
- NO, THANK YOU.

170
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,791
- Man: THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, MISS!

171
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,791
- WHAT THE HECK
DID YOU DO TO MY PLACE?

172
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,000
- DO YOU LIKE IT? I'M JUST
TRYING TO MAKE THINGS

173
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,625
A LITTLE MORE
BEARABLE AROUND HERE.

174
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,750
- NO! CHANGE IT BACK!
- AW!

175
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,833
- AND THAT'S MY ROOM!
END OF DISCUSSION!

176
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,500
- SO WHERE AM I
SUPPOSED TO SLEEP?

177
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,000
- ON THE FLOOR.

178
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,291
- OH, COME ON.
BE REASONABLE!

179
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,208
- OH, WAIT! I GOT IT! THERE'S
A PERFECT WAY TO SETTLE THIS!

180
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,250
NAME YOUR STAKES.

181
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,500
- NOW, GET YOUR CRAP
OUTTA MY ROOM.

182
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,958
AND PUT SOME CLOTHES ON!

183
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,583
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

184
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,833
- Rose: I'M GUESSING THIS IS
KINDA SPECIAL TO YOU, RIGHT?

185
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,500
- DAMN GIRL.

186
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,250
WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING!

187
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,750
I SHOULDA BET TO HAVE HER
LEAVE THE APARTMENT!

188
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,916
- ( chuckles ) MAKE A NOTE.
TO GET WHAT YOU WANT,

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,041
SOMETIMES ALL IT TAKES
IS A LITTLE DIVERSION!

190
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:39,416
SO, ANYWAY, IT'S GONNA BE TIGHT
WITH BOTH OF US IN ONE ROOM.

191
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,083
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
ALL MY THINGS WILL FIT IN HERE.

192
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,208
NO, I GUESS NOT.

193
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,375
SO, ARE THESE YOURS?

194
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,750
- OH. THOSE THINGS?

195
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,458
- NO. THEY'RE NOT MINE.

196
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:54,041
THEY BELONG TO RITA.
SHE'S ROY'S DAUGHTER.

197
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,208
SHE'S BEEN MISSING
FOR A LONG TIME, THOUGH.

198
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,750
- HMM.
- UM...

199
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,583
IF YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'LL HAVE ENOUGH SPACE,

200
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,500
I COULD FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE
TO SLEEP IF YOU WANT.

201
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,500
REALLY, I'M SURE I'LL BE
JUST FINE ON THE SOFA.

202
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,333
- NO, THAT WOULD SORT OF DEFEAT
THE PURPOSE, NOW WOULDN'T IT.

203
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:15,583
AFTER ALL, ONE OF THE REASONS
I CAME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE

204
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,041
WAS TO GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER.

205
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,166
I, UH...

206
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,833
- ( groaning )

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,625
- DOCTOR?

208
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,291
- THERE ISN'T MUCH MORE
I CAN DO FOR THEM,

209
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,791
ESPECIALLY UNDER
THESE CONDITIONS.

210
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,208
WITHOUT THE PROPER ANTIBODIES

211
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,791
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE
WON'T LAST LONG.

212
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,583
UH, HEY! LOOK!

213
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,333
- LARRY AND ANDY!

214
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,916
- HEY. QUIET.

215
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,666
- YEAH! COME ON,
THIS IS A HOSPITAL!

216
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,625
THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO REST!

217
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,125
- LARRY, UM...

218
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,666
- I KNOW, DOC. I KNOW.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

219
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,000
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR ANTIGENS
VERY SOON.

220
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,791
- Rose: WHEN SOMEONE HAS
A RESEMBLE ENHANCEMENT

221
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,166
MADE TO THEIR BODY,

222
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,083
THERE'S ALWAYS A CERTAIN
LEVEL OF REJECTION AT FIRST,

223
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,208
WHERE THE LIVING TISSUE
COMES INTO CONTACT

224
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,250
WITH THE MACHINE PARTS.

225
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,291
SO THERE ARE MEDICINES
CALLED ANTIGENS

226
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,791
THAT PREVENT ANY
NEGATIVE REACTIONS.

227
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,083
IT'S EASY FOR
REGISTERED CITIZENS.

228
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,791
FOR THEM, GETTING THE ANTIGENS
THEY NEED IS AS SIMPLE AS, LIKE,

229
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,416
BUYING COLD MEDICINE.

230
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,041
BUT FOR UNREGISTERED CITIZENS,
IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.

231
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,625
AND THAT IS WHY
WE HAVE TO STEAL 'EM.

232
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,375
- SO I WAS THINKING...
- UH, I CAN'T!

233
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,791
I'M SORRY. BUT I'M NOT GONNA
HELP YOU STEAL ANYTHING.

234
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,500
ROY WOULD BE MAD AT ME IF I DID.

235
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,958
- NO. DON'T BE ABSURD!

236
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,125
NO ONE'S ASKING YOU
TO STEAL ANYTHING! REALLY!

237
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,625
I WAS JUST...
I WAS GONNA SAY...

238
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,333
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
YOU CAN DO FOR ME!

239
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,500
- SOMETHING BESIDES STEALING?
- MM-HMM.

240
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,875
- ANOTHER HARD DAY'S WORK
OVER AND DONE.

241
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,625
INTEGRA, WHAT IS THAT
OVER THERE?

242
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,958
ANOTHER SHIPMENT
OF RESEMBLE ANTIGENS?

243
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,750
- YES. THAT'S RIGHT.

244
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,750
- THE LAST COUPLE SHIPMENTS WERE
HIJACKED BY THIEVES, RIGHT?

245
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,375
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAG ALONG.

246
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,125
- THAT'S VERY NOBLE OF YOU.
BUT IT'S NOT OUR JOB.

247
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,541
BESIDES, THEY HAVE ALL THE
PROTECTION THEY NEED ALREADY,

248
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:42,000
HEAVY SECURITY UNIT
EV-DOUBLE-O-TWO.

249
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,958
AND I UNDERSTAND THEY'VE ALSO
REQUESTED CIVILIAN HUNTERS.

250
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,958
- NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES,
ARE THEY?

251
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,750
- Miranda: I DO HAVE
ONE JOB REQUEST HERE

252
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,166
THAT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN.

253
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,666
- YEAH? WHAT?

254
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,750
- YOU'D BE PROVIDING SECURITY

255
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,916
FOR A TRANSPORT OF
RESEMBLE ANTIGENS.

256
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,291
THEY'VE LOST
SHIPMENTS TO BANDITS

257
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,750
SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST,

258
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,500
SO I GUESS THEY'RE TAKING
EXTRA PRECAUTIONS THIS TIME.

259
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,666
WHAT DO YOU SAY? YOU WANT IT?

260
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,333
- I THINK I'LL LET SOMEONE ELSE
DEAL WITH IT.

261
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,500
- SO, NO, THEN?
- NO.

262
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,208
- IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO PASS
ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

263
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,583
WHICH MAKES ME CURIOUS.

264
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,416
ROY, DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING
I DON'T?

265
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,166
- SO, NOW WE JUST SIT BACK
AND WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

266
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,916
- Rose: IT'S SIMPLE, REALLY.
ALL I NEED YOU TO DO, IS RUN.

267
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,375
- YOU WANT ME TO RUN?

268
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,666
- UH-HUH. OUT THERE,
ALONG THAT MAIN STREET.

269
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,291
- JUST RIGHT OUTSIDE?

270
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,458
- THAT'S RIGHT.

271
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,583
- HOW FAR?

272
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,375
- AS FAR AS YOU CAN GO, I GUESS.

273
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,833
- OKAY, BUT I'M STILL
NOT REALLY SURE I KNOW WHY.

274
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,791
- I'M JUST CURIOUS TO SEE
WHAT THAT BODY OF YOURS

275
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:02,083
IS CAPABLE OF. COME ON.
THIS ONE TIME, FOR ME?

276
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,958
- WELL, I GUESS I COULD.

277
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,458
- GOOD, THEN IT'S SET!

278
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,083
START RUNNING AS SOON AS
THIS TIMER REACHES ZERO, OKAY?

279
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,333
- UM, OKAY.

280
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,750
- DON'T LET ME DOWN NOW.
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

281
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,583
- ALMOST TIME.

282
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,000
- Rose: IT'S GETTING CLOSE.

283
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,125
YOU! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

284
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,958
- Roy: I KNOW YOU'RE PLANNING
TO RAID THAT SHIPMENT

285
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,333
OF RESEMBLE ANTIGENS.

286
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,583
- AND YOU CAME HERE
TO STOP US, IS THAT IT?

287
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,750
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

288
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,333
SECURITY IS SOMEONE ELSE'S JOB.

289
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,625
YOU DO WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE GONNA DO.

290
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,000
- SO WHAT THEN? I'M KINDA
BUSY, IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED!

291
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,916
- I WANT YOU TO LEAVE
SOLTY OUTTA THIS.

292
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,625
SINCE WHEN DID YOU START
CARING WHAT SOLTY DOES?

293
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,833
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
HER FATHER?

294
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,458
- I'M TELLING YOU,
I DON'T WANT HER INVOLVED.

295
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,916
- WELL, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT
IT TOO MUCH IF I WERE YOU.

296
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,041
MY BROTHERS AND I WILL BE
HANDLING ALL OF THE ACTUAL

297
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,166
"DIRTY WORK".

298
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,000
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT,
YOU KNOW IT!

299
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,208
DO YOU HEAR ME?
HEY! ROSE!

300
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,083
- HERE WE GO.

301
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,166
- SOLTY, NO!

302
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,625
SOLTY!

303
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,125
- HEY, ROY!

304
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,250
( screams )

305
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,875
- WHAT THE... THEY TOOK
OUT THE LEAD EV UNIT!

306
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,375
- OKAY. THIS IS WHERE
THE FUN STARTS!

307
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,458
- WHAT'D I RUN INTO!

308
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,750
- WELL, NOW THAT SOLTY'S

309
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,833
TAKEN THE FIRST TANK
OUT OF COMMISSION,

310
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,500
JUST ONE TO GO!

311
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,791
- A DEFLECTIVE COATING?

312
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,708
ALL RIGHTY, THEN. GUESS IT'S
TIME TO PULL OUT THE BIG GUNS!

313
