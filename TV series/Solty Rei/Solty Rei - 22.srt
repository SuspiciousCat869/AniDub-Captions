1
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,875
- ( Axela laughing )

2
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,375
LOOK AT IT! LOOK AT IT BURN!

3
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,875
BASTARDS! I HATE THEM!
I HATE THEM ALL!

4
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,875
- AXELA.

5
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,041
- ( theme song playing )

6
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,708
- SO, YOU'RE GOING
TO R.U.C., HUH?

8
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,916
- WELL, I CAN'T FIX ANYTHING
BY STAYING HERE, CAN I?

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,375
BESIDES, IF ROSE REALLY IS
DOING ASHLEY'S DIRTY WORK,

10
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,625
I HAVE TO STOP HER.

11
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:33,083
I'M HER FATHER.
SHE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.

12
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,500
- AND SHE'S OURS, TOO.

13
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,791
- WHAT GOOD ARE BIG BROTHERS

14
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,666
IF THEY CAN'T LOOK
AFTER THEIR KID SISTER?

15
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,333
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

16
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:45,625
- BE CAREFUL AND WATCH
EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

17
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,291
OH, AND DON'T DO
ANYTHING STUPID.

18
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:51,958
- THANKS KASHA. MIRANDA,
TAKE CARE OF THIS BUNCH, OKAY?

19
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,083
- YOU GOT IT, ROY.

20
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,916
- I'M COUNTING
ON YOU, TOO, YUTO.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,041
- RIGHT.

22
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,416
- NOW, FOR THE HARD PART.

23
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,750
JUST HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET IN THERE? IT'S RISKY,

24
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,500
BUT IF WE SPLIT UP, WE MIGHT
MAKE HARDER TARGETS,

25
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,541
BUT, IF WE GO IN AS A GROUP,
WELL, IF WE GET PINNED DOWN

26
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,333
OR SURROUNDED,
WE WON'T STAND A CHANCE.

27
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,291
- EXCUSE ME.
- HUH?

28
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,791
- WHAT YOU NEED
IS ME, AS A DECOY.

29
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,916
- A DECOY?

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,416
- WHAT, DO YOU HAVE
SOMETHING IN MIND?

31
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,625
- YES, YOU'LL HAVE TO
TRUST ME.

32
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,958
- I KNOW I CAN DRAW
THEIR ATTENTION OUTSIDE.

33
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,833
THAT SHOULD GIVE
THE REST OF YOU A CHANCE TO...

34
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,375
- WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?
YOU'RE JUST A KID.

35
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,125
WE'RE NOT USING YOU
AS A DECOY, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

36
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,375
- I THINK YOU'RE
ALL FORGETTING

37
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,083
THAT I'M A TRAINED
MEMBER OF PROCEED.

38
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,583
I AM. I'M SKILLED IN COMBAT
AND I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

39
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,083
IF I SHOW UP AT R.U.C.,
THEY'LL ASSUME I'M THERE

40
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,500
TO AVENGE MY TEAM MATES
AND THEY'LL TRY TO PURSUE ME.

41
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,250
- IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.
- BUT...

42
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,375
- LOOK, ROY, IF YOU'VE
GOT A BETTER PLAN,

43
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,958
I'D REALLY LOVE TO HEAR IT.

44
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,791
- ALL RIGHT, SO, LET'S SAY
WE GO THROUGH WITH THIS,

45
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,208
DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD
AT LEAST SEND SOMEBODY WITH HER?

46
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,583
PROCEED OR NOT,

47
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,041
WE CAN'T LET HER BE A DECOY
BY HERSELF NOW, CAN WE?

48
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,833
- UH, NO, I CAN MANAGE ALONE.
- UM.

49
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,666
- I'LL GO. I'LL DO IT.
- YOU, SOLTY?

50
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,250
- WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE...

51
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,208
- I'LL GO WITH AXELA.
I CAN HELP HER GET INTO R.U.C.,

52
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,125
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH HER.

53
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,125
- UH, FINE.

54
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,166
- SOLTY.

55
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,041
- SOMEBODY'S GOING TO
HAVE TO DO IT, ROY.

56
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,833
- PLEASE DON'T WORRY, I WON'T
LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HER.

57
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,416
SHE'S SAFE WITH ME.

58
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,833
- YOU AND I KNOW, SHE'D MAKE
A HELL OF A BODYGUARD.

59
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,375
- AT THE FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE,
YOU GET OUT OF THERE.

60
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:29,500
- I WILL. WELL, AXELA, READY
TO GIVE IT OUR BEST SHOT?

61
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,500
- YEAH, SURE.

62
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,666
- ( laughing )

63
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,125
- SORRY FOR THE DECEPTION,

64
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,708
BUT THE TRUTH IS I HAD TO
USE ALL OF YOU AS MY DECOY.

65
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,333
YOU SEE, IT WAS
THE ONLY WAY

66
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,875
TO GET ME INSIDE THIS
BEAUTIFUL BABY.

67
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,500
- ARE YOU SURE THIS ELEVATOR
WILL TAKE US ALL THE WAY UP

68
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,125
TO THE SURFACE LEVEL?

69
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,625
OKAY, AXELA. ARE YOU
READY TO DO THIS?

70
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,750
- AXELA, ARE YOU...
- FORGIVE ME, SOLTY.

71
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,666
- AXELA.

72
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,041
AXELA, AXELA!

73
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,916
THE CITY, IT'S SHAKING.

74
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,166
- ( laughing )

75
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,833
- AXELA.

76
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,666
- Joseph: SOLTY.
- HUH?

77
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,750
- JUST ONE THING. IF MY
CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT,

78
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,208
YOUR STRENGTH SHOULD HAVE
RETURNED TO FULL POWER BY NOW.

79
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,125
ALL OF YOUR
ABILITIES ARE ACTIVE.

80
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,833
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO KNOW.

81
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,250
- MY STRENGTH, THAT'S RIGHT.

82
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:32,333
- WHY IS EVERYTHING SHAKING?
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?

83
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,500
- Researcher:
NONE OF YOUR CONCERN.

84
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,333
JUST CONCENTRATE
ON THE TASK AT HAND.

85
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,375
- HOW CAN I WHEN THE WHOLE
DAMN BUILDING IS SHAKING APART?

86
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,125
- THOSE ARE THE OPERATIONS
DIRECTOR'S ORDERS.

87
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,625
- MAN!

88
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,250
THESE GUYS THINK ALL THEY
HAVE TO DO IS MENTION ASHLEY,

89
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,125
AND I'LL BEHAVE
JUST LIKE A TRAINED PET.

90
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,375
WELL, IF THAT'S HOW
THEY WANT TO PLAY,

91
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,541
EXTERNAL MONITORS
1, 2, 3 ON SCREEN.

92
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,583
- ( beeps )

93
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,333
- WHOA, WHAT IS THAT THING?

94
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,500
- WHAT THE HELL
IS CAUSING THESE TREMORS?

95
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,791
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
JUST DEAL WITH IT.

96
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,166
- GUYS, UP AHEAD.

97
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:17,000
- THIS IS NOT GOOD.
- THESE GUYS ARE PISSING ME OFF.

98
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,041
- REMEMBER, DON'T KILL THEM.
THEY'RE ALL BEING MANIPULATED.

99
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,083
- YEAH, I KNOW.
- THIS WAY.

100
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:33,541
- TAKE THIS WITH YOU. I INSIST.
- THAT THING YOU SENT?

101
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,750
- SO, WHAT IS IT?

102
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,958
- AN ACTIVATION KEY
THAT WILL COME IN HANDY.

103
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,416
- YOU NEED TO MAKE IT
TO THE BASEMENT OF R.U.C.

104
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,958
THERE YOU'LL FIND
A SUBSYSTEM ROOM.

105
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,500
ONCE INSIDE, INSERT THE KEY,
AND IT SHOULD DISRUPT

106
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,375
R.U.C.'S MAIN OPERATING
SYSTEM FOR A WHILE.

107
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,500
- WHAT...
- WHAT'S WRONG?

108
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,250
- I JUST DON'T GET IT.
A POWERFUL DEVICE LIKE THIS.

109
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,250
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH IT, OLD MAN?

110
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:02,250
- WHEN I LEFT R.U.C., I HELPED
MYSELF TO THIS LITTLE ITEM.

111
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,333
WITH HIS AMBITIONS, I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE A NECESSARY TOOL

112
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,166
TO USE AGAINST ASHLEY ONE DAY.

113
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,041
- I'M SURPRISED, YOU HAVEN'T
USED THIS KEY BEFORE.

114
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,958
- THERE WAS NO WAY I
COULD STOP HIM BACK THEN,

115
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,041
BUT NOW, WE MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE.

116
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,000
THAT KEY WILL ONLY SHUT DOWN
R.U.C. TEMPORARILY,

117
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,791
BUT, THAT COULD BE JUST ENOUGH
TIME TO CATCH ASHLEY OFF-GUARD.

118
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,916
AT LEAST IT GIVES US
A FIGHTING CHANCE, EH?

119
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,708
- DON'T WORRY,
I'LL PUT IT TO GOOD USE.

120
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,291
- ( laughing )

121
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,958
I'M GOING TO DESTROY IT,
EVERY BIT.

122
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,875
IT'S IRONIC THAT I'M USING
YOUR OWN CREATION

123
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,000
TO OBLITERATE ALL YOUR
HOPES AND DREAMS.

124
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,708
DO YOU HEAR ME?
DO YOU, ASHLEY LYNX?

125
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,333
( gasps )

126
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,166
- AXELA.

127
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,833
- AXELA, I KNOW
IT'S YOU IN THERE.

128
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:10,875
- SOLTY.

129
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,291
- YOU HAVE TO STOP.

130
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:16,375
IF YOU DO THIS, LOTS OF
INNOCENT PEOPLE WILL GET HURT.

131
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,041
- BUT HE KILLED MY BEST FRIENDS.

132
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,958
I WON'T LET HIM GET
AWAY WITH MURDER.

133
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,333
- AXELA!

134
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,625
- GET OUT OF THE WAY.
I CAN'T STOP IT.

135
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,625
- ( grunts )

136
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,208
( screams )

137
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,458
( gasps )

138
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,083
- SOLTY. YOU ALWAYS
WERE A RECKLESS ONE.

139
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,916
- ROSE, THANK YOU.

140
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,541
- ( screaming )

141
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
- THERE GO OUR
SHOPS. DAMN IT.

142
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,125
WE CAN'T LET THEM
GET ANY CLOSER.

143
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,000
- HOLD THEM BACK. FIRE! FIRE!

144
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,083
- NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.
GET OUT OF THERE! RUN!

145
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,333
- COME ON. LET'S GO.

146
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,166
- YOU? BUT YOU'RE A...

147
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,541
- WAIT, ARE THEY
UNREGISTERED CITIZENS, TOO?

148
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,958
- YES, THEY ARE.

149
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,208
- WHY THEN. WHY
ARE YOU HELPING US?

150
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,291
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
HATED REGISTERED CITIZENS.

151
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,541
- YOU SHOULD ALWAYS LEND A
HAND WHEN SOMEONE IS IN NEED,

152
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,083
AM I RIGHT?

153
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,250
- ( laughs ) GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

154
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,375
- ( machine beeping )

155
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,000
- ( grunting )

156
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,791
- HEY, COME ON, NOW.
WAS THAT REALLY NECESSARY?

157
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,208
- IT IS WITH THESE GUYS.

158
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,625
- HESITATE AND THEY'LL KILL YOU.
DON'T BE A COWARD, YUTO.

159
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,083
- COWARD, HUH? YOU SEEM
TO HAVE FORGOTTEN

160
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,708
WHO RESCUED YOU A
FEW MINUTES AGO.

161
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,791
- OH, THAT WAS YOU,
WASN'T IT? SORRY.

162
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,041
- FORGET IT.

163
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,958
- LET'S JUST GET INTEGRA
OUT OF HERE BEFORE

164
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,333
ANY MORE OF THOSE
GUYS DECIDE TO SHOW UP.

165
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,083
- COME ON, THIS WAY.
QUICKLY! HURRY UP!

166
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,208
- Miranda: KASHA.
- HUH?

167
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,583
( screams )

168
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,166
- MOM, BEHIND YOU.
- GOT THEM.

169
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,000
- ( laughs ) I WANT TO HELP.

170
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,250
( chuckles )

171
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,708
- HONEY, YOU'VE GOT
TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

172
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,958
- MOM, DID YOU SEE?

173
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,250
THIS RIOT GEAR'S GREAT.
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS AIM,

174
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,375
PULL THE TRIGGER AND BOOM.

175
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,875
I TOOK THEM DOWN,
JUST WITH ONE SHOT.

176
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,666
- ( chuckles ) THAT'S MY
DAUGHTER. THE SHARPSHOOTER.

177
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,291
- THEY'RE WEARING DOWN OUR
STRENGTH AND OUR AMMUNITION.

178
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,083
I DON'T KNOW LONG
WE CAN HOLD OUT.

179
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,666
- WELL, THEN,

180
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,708
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO MAKE EVERY
SHOT COUNT UNTIL THIS IS OVER.

181
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,750
- ( people screaming )

182
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,208
- WHAT, WHAT'S THAT?

183
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,375
- OH, NO THOSE, TOO?
- THEY'RE BEING CONTROLLED?

184
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,125
- HUH? ROSE.

185
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,541
- I WAS WATCHING.
SO, YOU CAN FLY?

186
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,375
- YES, AFTER JOSEPH
REPAIRED ME.

187
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,375
- SO, WHO'S BEHIND
THE CONTROLS OF THAT THING?

188
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,041
- AXELA. I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO TALK TO HER.

189
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,416
- I'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY
TO STOP HER SOMEHOW.

190
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,125
- I SEE, AXELA, HUH?

191
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,666
- ROSE ANDERSON.

192
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,541
- ROSE, WAIT.

193
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,375
- SORRY, AXELA, IT'S
NOTHING PERSONAL

194
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,000
BUT I'VE GOT TO PUT AN
END TO THIS, RIGHT NOW.

195
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,416
- NO, THAT'S NOT THE WAY.

196
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:03,875
- ( grunting )

197
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,458
- COME ON, TODAY, ANDY.
- THEY DON'T STOP.

198
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,416
- YEAH, I KNOW.

199
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,583
- ANDY, LOOKOUT!

200
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:17,916
- LARRY!

201
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,583
- ( screams )

202
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:26,041
- IT'S OPEN. INSIDE.
- LARRY, ARE YOU OKAY?

203
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,458
- OH, NO YOU DON'T. I AM SO SICK
OF YOU GUYS GETTING IN OUR WAY.

204
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,583
- DAMN IT!

205
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,083
- LARRY!

206
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,750
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU. DO ME
A FAVOR AND GO END THIS THING,

207
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,458
OKAY, LITTLE BROTHER?

208
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,250
- NO, LARRY. LARRY!

209
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,708
- HEY, ROY?
TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM.

210
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,458
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON,
YOU BASTARDS.

211
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,875
I'M SICK OF PLAYING NICE.

212
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,083
- ( screaming )

213
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,666
- ( Andy crying )

214
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,541
LARRY.

215
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,083
- ( elevator bell rings )

216
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,708
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

217
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,916
- IT'S ROBOTS, HUH? GOOD,
WE DON'T HAVE TO HOLD BACK.

218
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,875
- DAMN RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

219
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,000
- PLEASE STOP IT, ROSE.
YOU HAVE TO.

220
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,208
- YOU BETTER GET
OUT OF HERE, SOLTY.

221
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,083
( gasps )

222
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,500
- SOLTY?

223
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,666
- Computerized voice: ENERGY
CHARGE, THIRTY-SEVEN PERCENT.

224
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,166
- FIRE.
- INSUFFICIENT POWER.

225
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,833
- YOU HEARD ME, FIRE!
- FIRING.

226
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,666
- ( grunts ) STOP GETTING
IN MY WAY.

227
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,000
- NO, I WON'T.

228
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,541
I'M NOT GOING TO STAND BY
AND LET YOU SHOOT AXELA.

229
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,208
- WHAT, HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

230
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,916
IF YOU DON'T BACK DOWN THEN
I'LL BE FORCED TO KILL YOU, TOO.

231
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,833
- ( gasps ) IF YOU
REALLY MEAN THAT,

232
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,583
THEN I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO STOP YOU.

233
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,541
- ( screams )

234
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,833
- Computerized voice:
RECHARGING COMMENCING.

235
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:19,458
CHARGE AT 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5...

236
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:23,291
- WELL, ROSE, I KNOW YOU'RE
NOT THE ONE WHO'S RESPONSIBLE.

237
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,416
BUT TWO OF MY BEST
FRIENDS ARE GONE.

238
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,000
SYLVIA AND CELICA
ARE GONE FOREVER.

239
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:33,083
- Computerized voice:
6, 6.5, 7, 7.5...

240
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,083
- BUT IF IT MEANS,
I HAVE TO DESTROY YOU

241
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:39,041
TO GET TO ASHLEY THEN,
THEN SO BE IT.

242
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:45,000
- ROSE, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

243
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,500
- DON'T YOU GET IT?

244
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,708
WE'VE GOT TO STOP HER BEFORE
SHE CAUSES ANY MORE DAMAGE.

245
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,125
- BUT LIKE THIS? THERE'S
GOT TO BE ANOTHER WAY.

246
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,583
- IT'S THE SAFEST WAY.
I CAN END THIS WITH ONE SHOT.

247
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,625
- MOVE OR I'LL TAKE
YOU DOWN, TOO.

248
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,875
- STOP BEING SO STUBBORN.

249
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,208
- IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
- YOU CAN'T KILL AXELA.

250
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,458
- Rose: I DON'T WANT TO.

251
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,125
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO,
BUT IT'S NECESSARY.

252
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,250
THERE HAVE BEEN TOO
MANY VICTIMS ALREADY.

253
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,750
I WON'T LET THERE BE
ANY MORE. NO ONE, NONE.

254
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:20,083
SYLVIA AND CELICA, THEY'RE BOTH
DEAD AND INTEGRA, SHE'S...

255
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,250
- ( gasps )

256
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,833
- Rose: IT'S TOO LATE
TO TURN BACK NOW.

257
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,833
- NO, IT'S NOT, ROSE.

258
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,083
- IF I STOP NOW,

259
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,750
THEIR SACRIFICES WOULD
HAVE BEEN MADE IN VAIN.

260
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:36,666
- AND THAT'S WHY
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

261
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,416
- WHY DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS?

262
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,458
- IT'S FOR THE GOOD OF EVERYONE.

263
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,416
IF I DO NOTHING, IT,
IT'LL NEVER COME TRUE.

264
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,750
- WHAT, WHAT, ROSE?

265
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,750
- I'VE ALWAYS HATED THE
CITIZEN REGISTRATION SYSTEM.

266
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,916
HATED IT EVEN
WHEN I WAS A CHILD.

267
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,458
I ALWAYS HOPED
IT WOULD FALL APART,

268
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,875
THEN IT WOULDN'T MATTER WHO
LIVED ABOVE AND WHO LIVED BELOW.

269
00:16:56,125 --> 00:17:00,250
BUT I, I WAS A KID,
SO NO ONE TOOK ME SERIOUSLY.

270
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,208
THEY'D SORT OF
SMILE AND SAY

271
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,500
"THAT'S A NICE FAIRY
TALE, SWEETIE."

272
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,500
BUT ASHLEY, HE WAS DIFFERENT.
HE LISTENED TO EVERYTHING

273
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,166
I HAD TO SAY AND SAID
HE BELIEVED IN ME.

274
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,666
SO, YOU SEE, I'VE GOT
TO HELP ASHLEY! I'VE GOT TO.

275
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,041
- SO, THAT OUR DREAM
CAN COME TRUE.

276
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,291
- BUT KILLING IS WRONG.

277
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,750
- IF I WANT TO REACH OUR GOAL,

278
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,375
WE HAVE TO CLOSE OUR
EYES TO A FEW SACRIFICES.

279
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,333
- IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU
REALLY FEEL, ROSE,

280
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,833
THEN WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

281
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,708
A GOOD DREAM SHOULDN'T
MAKE YOU CRY.

282
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,416
IT SHOULDN'T MAKE
YOU DO BAD THINGS

283
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,875
TO THE ONES YOU CARE ABOUT.

284
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,541
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT, ROSE.

285
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,000
- LIFE IS PAINFUL, SOLTY.
THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS.

286
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,708
- THAT'S AN EXCUSE.
IT ISN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY.

287
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,750
- GROW UP. IT'S HOW
THE ADULT WORLD WORKS.

288
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,250
- DON'T BE AN ADULT, ESPECIALLY
IF IT MAKES YOU LIKE THIS.

289
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,208
JUST BE YOURSELF. BE THE ROSE,
WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE.

290
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,541
I'M SURROUNDED BY WONDERFUL
PEOPLE WHO I REALLY CARE FOR

291
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,083
AND THEY'RE REALLY GOOD TO ME,

292
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,333
AND I LOVE TO COOK, BECAUSE
IT SEEMS TO MAKE THEM HAPPY.

293
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,250
AND SEEING THE SMILES
ON THEIR HAPPY FACES...

294
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,000
WELL, THAT'S ALL
THAT I'LL EVER NEED.

295
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,458
I'VE GOT A GOOD LIFE AND I HOPE
IT'LL CONTINUE TO BE LIKE THAT.

296
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,541
AND OF COURSE,
ONE OF THE PEOPLE

297
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,833
WHO MAKES MY LIFE
SO WONDERFUL, IS YOU.

298
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:20,875
- HUH?

299
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,750
- ( beeping )

300
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,375
- AND AXELA, I LOVE YOU, TOO.

301
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,250
- ( gasps )

302
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,000
- I LOVE COOKING WITH YOU,

303
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,666
OR EVEN JUST SITTING
AROUND AND TALKING.

304
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,583
IT WOULD BE SO NICE IF ALL
OF US COULD GET TOGETHER

305
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,750
AND HAVE FUN LIKE THAT AGAIN.

306
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:48,958
- AND THAT'S, THAT'S MY DREAM.
- YOURS, BUT THAT DREAM IS...

307
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,750
- THE SAME ONE THAT YOU WANT.

308
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,916
EVERYONE COMING TOGETHER.
THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT, ROSE?

309
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,958
- ( gasps )

310
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:01,583
- I KNOW IT'S BEEN HARD
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

311
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:05,375
DON'T FEEL BAD, OKAY?
EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES.

312
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,333
OH, ROSE, WELCOME BACK.

313
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,958
- ( both crying )

314
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,833
- ( crying )

315
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,375
- Computerized voice: CHARGE
COMPLETE. WEAPONS AT FULL POWER.

316
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,166
INITIATING FIRING SEQUENCE.

317
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,000
- THAT'S ENOUGH, ABORT.

318
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,458
- ERROR. INITIATING
FIRING SEQUENCE.

319
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,250
- YOU CAN'T. ABORT.

320
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,375
- RELEASING SAFETY.
ACKNOWLEDGED.

321
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,458
- ( gasps ) STOP.

322
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,375
- ABORT. THAT'S AN ORDER, NOW!

323
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:47,166
- NO. GET AWAY!

324
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,375

- ARE WE SAFE NOW, MOM?
- LOOKS LIKE IT.

328
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,833
- NO. NOT YET.

329
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,250
- GREAT. DO THOSE THINGS
EVER GIVE UP?

330
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,666
- ( grunts )

331
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,125

- GOOD.

334
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,791
THEN LET'S GET THE
HELL OUT OF HERE.

335
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,750
THERE'S NO REASON
TO STICK AROUND NOW.

336
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:00,333
ANDY, I'M SURE HE'S FINE.

337
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,375
- ( footsteps approaching )

338
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,541
- HUH?

339
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,750
- COME ON.
- HOW WOULD YOU...

340
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,291
YOU'RE RIGHT, OLD MAN.

341
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,708
I GUESS, IT IS MY BIG
BROTHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

342
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,750
- ATTABOY.
- COME ON, LET'S MOVE.

343
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,583
- LET'S FIND ROSE
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

344
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,500
( grunts )

345
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,000
( groans )

346
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,916
- TRESPASSING IS A CRIME,
MR. REVANT.

347
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,666
AH, DAMN JOSEPH. IT HAD TO BE.

348
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,041
EUNOMIA CAN'T BE SHUT DOWN
BY THE SUBSYSTEM ALONE.

349
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,708
HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO WOULD
KNOW HOW TO DO SO.

350
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,208
I SHOULD HAVE MADE SURE
HE WAS DEAD LONG AGO.

351
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,041
- ( groans )

352
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,000
- I MUST ADMIT, I'M SURPRISED.

353
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,291
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE THE
ONE WHO'D STOP EUNOMIA FOR ME.

354
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,250
SO HERE'S MY DILEMMA.

355
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,750
SHOULD I THANK YOU
FOR HELPING ME,

356
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,083
OR KILL YOU FOR GETTING
IN MY WAY?

357
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,541
- ( theme song playing )

358
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

359
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,708
- Roy: IS THAT
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT?

360
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:37,833
- Ashley: THAT? IT IS MY
GRANDEST WISH IN LIFE.

361
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,166
- Rose: NEXT TIME,
"FAREWELL MESSAGE."

362
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,083
- Solty: LET'S KEEP OUR PROMISE.
