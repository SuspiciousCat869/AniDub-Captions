1
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,375
- ( gasps )

2
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,000
- WELL, WHAT A
PLEASANT SURPRISE!

3
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,833
FANCY MEETING YOU TWO UP HERE.

4
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,416
- ROSE! IT'S YOU!

5
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,916
- IMPOSSIBLE.
IT CAN'T BE. SHE DIED.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,333
I WAS WITH HER WHEN SHE DIED.

7
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,375
- ( phone beeping )

8
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:57,166
- GO AHEAD. YES.
NICE SHOOTING. WELL DONE.

9
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,958
NOW GO RECOVER CELICA'S BODY.

10
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,208
- ( gasps )

11
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,208
- SORRY I'D LIKE TO STAY
AND CHAT FOR A WHILE,

12
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,666
BUT I'VE GOT TO RUN, SEE YOU!

13
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,083
- ROSE! WAIT! DON'T GO!

14
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,291
COME BACK.

15
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,291
- SHE'S ALIVE.

16
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,583
ROSE. HOW?

17
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,958
WHAT IN THE HELL'S GOING ON?

18
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,250
- ( theme song playing )

19
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

20
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:14,083
- UH, YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO EAT DINNER YET, HUH?

21
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,125
I'M GOING TO GO
DO SOME SHOPPING,

22
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,708
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING, YOU
WANT, I COULD GET IT FOR YOU.

23
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,541
( sighs )

24
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,833
- ROSE.

25
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,083
- Man 1:
RESPIRATION, PULSE,

26
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,666
BLOOD PRESSURE, AND BRAIN
WAVES, ALL NORMAL.

27
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,125
- ALL LINES SHOW CO-EFFICIENT
LEVELS WITHIN ZERO-POINT-FOUR.

28
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,375
-SYSTEMS CHECK.

29
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,375
- THE SUBJECT HAS PASSED
EVERY SINGLE PROCESS.

30
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,500
HER PATTERNS ARE
ALL IN THE GREEN.

31
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,791
- SHE'S PERFECT.
- AMAZING!

32
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,000
- THANK YOU, ROSE.
THAT WAS WONDERFUL.

33
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,458
YOU ARE TRULY MAGNIFICENT.

34
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,541
THERES SOMETHING
I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU.

35
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,208
GET DRESSED AND FOLLOW ME.

36
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,708
- SO, WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO SHOW ME?

37
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,666
JUST WHERE ARE WE GOING?

38
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,083
HUH?

39
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,166
- THIS IS QUITE AN HONOR.

40
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,500
EVEN THE OTHER DIRECTORS AREN'T
ALLOWED TO ENTER THIS PLACE.

41
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:38,791
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
WHAT DO YOU KEEP DOWN HERE?

42
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,708
- YOU'LL FIND OUT IN A MOMENT.
IT'S JUST BEHIND THIS DOOR.

43
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,500
- I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.
IT'S PITCH BLACK IN THERE.

44
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,666
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

45
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,500
- DO YOU LIKE IT? I'VE SPENT
YEARS ON ITS CONSTRUCTION.

46
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,875
AND NOW THAT I'VE FOUND YOU AND
YOUR OUTSTANDING ABILITIES,

47
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,708
IT WILL FINALLY SEE
THE LIGHT OF DAY.

48
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,750
- WHAT IS IT? AREN'T
YOU AT LEAST GONNA

49
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,833
TURN ON THE LIGHTS
SO I CAN SEE?

50
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,416
( gasps )

51
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,041
WHAT. WHAT IS THAT THING?

52
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,625
- IT HOUSES EVERYTHING
WE WILL NEED

53
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,791
TO MAKE OUR SHARED
DREAM COME TRUE.

54
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,333
- SHARED DREAM?

55
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,916
- THAT'S RIGHT.

56
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,250
NOW LET'S BEGIN OUR FUTURE.

57
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,250
- HUH?

58
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,166
- COME ON.
YOU'LL CATCH A COLD OUT HERE.

59
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,458
- Woman on tv: AND NOW AN
UPDATE ON THE RECENT MURDER

60
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,208
WITHIN R.U.C.'S
SECURITY DIVISION.

61
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,458
CELICA YAYOI, WANTED
BY THE POLICE

62
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,125
FOR THE MURDER OF SILVIA BAN

63
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,958
WAS SHOT AND KILLED THIS
MORNING WHILE RESISTING ARREST.

64
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,625
INVESTIGATORS HAVE SUGGESTED
THAT THE SUSPECT WAS

65
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,291
IN A DERANGED STATE OF MIND
AT THE TIME OF HER DEMISE.

66
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,333
THERE IS NO NEWS ON THE
WHEREABOUTS OF THE

67
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,583
TWO REMAINING SUSPECTS,
AS THEY ARE STILL AT LARGE.

68
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,291
STAY TUNED TO THIS
BROADCAST FOR ADDITIONAL

69
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,000
INFORMATION REGARDING
THIS STORY AS IT DEVELOPS.

70
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:22,875
- CELICA. THAT WAS A
STUPID THING TO DO.

71
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,958
WHAT'S THIS? A VIDEO DISK?

72
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,041
- ( banging on door )

73
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,166
- Andy: INTEGRA MARTEL!

74
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,166
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN
THERE, PLEASE OPEN UP!

75
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,625
- Yuto: AXELA ASKED US TO COME
HERE. THIS ISN'T A TRAP.

76
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:48,125
THERE'S ONLY THE TWO OF US.
COULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR?

77
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,750
- Andy: DON'T SHOOT, OKAY?

78
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,625
I'M ANDY ANDERSON AND
I'M HELPING THIS GUY

79
00:06:58,708 --> 00:06:59,833
GET YOU BACK SAFELY.

80
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,500
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
PLEASE. COME WITH US.

81
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,958
WE GOT HER.

82
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,250
- INTEGRA!

83
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,000
INTEGRA!

84
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,791
- AXELA! I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.
I WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

85
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,916
- OH, THANK GOD, YOU'RE ALRIGHT!

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,250
- WOULD YOU MIND TELLING
ME WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

87
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:28,333
- OH, IT'S JUST, AXELA WAS
NICE ENOUGH TO HELP ME OUT

88
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,041
ONCE WHEN I WAS HAVING
A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE.

89
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,375
SO WHEN I FOUND HER,

90
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,041
I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY
RIGHT TO RETURN THE FAVOR.

91
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,500
- FAIR ENOUGH.

92
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,166
BUT A HUNTER AND A BAND OF
THIEVES WORKING TOGETHER?

93
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,666
- I WONDER WHAT THE
INTELLIGENCE COUNCIL

94
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,083
WOULD THINK ABOUT ALL THIS.

95
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,125
- SCREW THEM! WHO CARES
WHAT THE DAMN COUNCIL THINKS.

96
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,708
- I GUESS, YOU'RE RIGHT.

97
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,666
- WE GOT THE BASIC IDEA OF WHAT
HAPPENED FROM YOUR FRIEND HERE.

98
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,125
NOW HOW ABOUT YOU START FILLING
US IN ON SOME OF THE DETAILS.

99
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:59,916
HOW CAN ROSE STILL BE ALIVE?
WHY IS SHE WORKING FOR R.U.C?

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,458
AND WHO'S THIS GUY?
THIS OPERATIONS DIRECTOR?

101
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,000
WHAT DOES HE HAVE
TO GAIN FROM ALL THIS?

102
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,958
- BY YOUR SILENCE, I TAKE IT,

103
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,750
YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS
TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS.

104
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,291
- COME ON! YOU WORKED THERE!

105
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,000
IS THIS THE KIND OF THING THAT
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME? HUH?

106
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,166
DID YOU TALK TO ROSE? I JUST
FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT YOU

107
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,416
COULD BE SO IN THE DARK
ABOUT ALL THIS!

108
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,333
- SORRY. I JUST DON'T KNOW.
- THIS IS GETTING US NOWHERE.

109
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,625
- ARE YOU SURE? YOU DON'T KNOW
ANY MORE THAN YOU'VE TOLD US?

110
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,416
- NO. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE
THIS OUT, SAME AS YOU.

111
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,416
ALL I KNOW IS THIS,
THE DATA'S BEEN TAMPERED WITH

112
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,291
AND OUR ACCESS TO THE HOST
COMPUTER HAS BEEN RESTRICTED.

113
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,166
WE JUST WANT TO CLEAR OUR NAMES
OF THESE FALSE ACCUSATIONS!

114
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,291
- ( scoffs )
FALSE ACCUSATIONS? LOOK AT YOU!

115
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,541
YOU'RE ALL OVER THE NEWS!

116
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,541
FOOTAGE OF YOU KILLING
THAT LADY IN COLD BLOOD!

117
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,958
- IF YOU'RE GOING TO FALL
FOR FALSIFIED DATA LIKE THAT,

118
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,000
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT AS SMART OF
A THIEF AS I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

119
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,250
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?
- STOP IT, ANDY.

120
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,625
ROY. BE REALISTIC.

121
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,166
WHY SHOULD THESE GIRLS
WANT TO TELL US ANYTHING?

122
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,708
IF THEY'RE HIDING INFORMATION,

123
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,500
THEY'LL SHARE IT
WHEN THEY'RE READY.

124
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,208
- YEAH. YEAH.

125
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,625
- IT'S HORRIBLE.

126
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,208
IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME WAY
TO SPEAK TO ROSE DIRECTLY.

127
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,291
- YEAH.

128
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,041
- IT ALL COMES BACK TO ROSE.

129
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,625
SEEMS LIKE THIS WHOLE
SCREWED UP SITUATION

130
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,333
GOT STARTED THE DAY,
SHE SHOWED UP AT R.U.C.

131
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,166
SO IF WE'RE GOING
TO FIGURE THIS OUT,

132
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,541
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY THE KEY.

133
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,291
- SOUNDS REASONABLE.

134
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,250
LET'S CONTINUE OUR
INVESTIGATION FROM THAT ANGLE.

135
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,750
- SO WHAT SHOULD WE
DO WITH THESE TWO?

136
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,500
- HEY, ROY? I COULD...
- GO AHEAD IT'S OKAY.

137
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,250
I'LL LEAVE THEM TO YOU, SOLTY.

138
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,500
- ( exclaims ) MIRANDA?

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,333
- FINE. WHY DON'T YOU SHOW THEM
TO THE EMPTY UNIT DOWNSTAIRS?

140
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,541
- LOOK THAT'S REALLY
NOT NECESSARY.

141
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,750
- WAIT A MINUTE!

142
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,666
DON'T YOU REALIZE YOU'RE
HARBORING CRIMINALS?

143
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,875
- OH, YEAH. I GUESS IT'LL BE
JUST LIKE HARBORING YOU.

144
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,000
- WHAT? HEY! DON'T PUT ME
IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS...

145
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,875
- I'M HUNGRY! WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO ABOUT DINNER, SOLTY?

146
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,958
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT!
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

147
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,958
I'D FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT DINNER.
I'LL GO GET IT STARTED.

148
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,291
- WELL, HURRY IT UP!
- Miranda: KASHA!

149
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,500
- SOLTY? WOULD YOU MIND
IF I GIVE YOU A HAND?

150
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:10,333
- AXELA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!
- SURE! THAT'D BE GREAT!

151
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,500
- THANKS YOU WOULDN'T BY
CHANCE HAPPEN TO HAVE

152
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,750
-WAIT.
-THOSE LAUREL LEAVES.

153
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,250
- ISN'T THIS NICE?
US, COOKING TOGETHER?

154
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,208
- YES, IT IS! THANK YOU, SOLTY.

155
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,625
- DON'T MENTION IT.

156
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,208
- OH, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU NEED
TO CUT THEM INTO SMALLER PIECES.

157
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,333
- I DO?

158
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,750
- OH YEAH. IF THE
PIECES ARE TOO BIG,

159
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,125
THEN THEY WON'T COOK EVENLY.

160
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,125
- OH, I GUESS I
DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

161
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,416
- ( chuckles ) IT'S A
COMMON MISTAKE ACTUALLY.

162
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,541
- HEY.

163
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,083
I WAS, I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD TALK TO YOU?

164
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,333
- I SEE.
SO THIS IS ABOUT SILVIA?

165
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,125
- SHE WAS, I MEAN WE...

166
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,125
- THE TWO OF YOU WERE FRIENDS,
WEREN'T YOU?

167
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,333
- YES. EVER SINCE
THAT ONE DAY, I GUESS.

168
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,375
WE TRIED TO KEEP IN TOUCH.
SHE WAS A GROWN-UP,

169
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,625
BUT SHE STILL ACTED LIKE
A LITTLE KID SOMETIMES.

170
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,166
SOMETIMES SHE'D TAKE ME
OUT FOR SOME ICE CREAM.

171
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,000
SHE WAS SO NICE TO ME.

172
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,458
( crying )

173
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,708
- IT'S OKAY.
- WHY'D SHE HAVE TO DIE?

174
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,666
- DON'T WORRY KASHA.
WE ARE GOING TO GET THIS MAN.

175
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,625
- Woman on tv: THE OPERATIONS
DIRECTOR OF R.U.C'S

176
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,458
SECURITY DIVISION MADE
A STATEMENT TODAY,

177
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,125
ON THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE ONGOING

178
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,750
MURDER INVESTIGATION.

179
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,166
- ASHLEY.
- Woman on tv: DIRECTOR

180
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,666
COMMENDED THE EFFORTS OF THE

181
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,708
SECURITY TEAM IN BRINGING
DOWN THE SUSPECT CELICA YAYOI,

182
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,875
AND ASSURED THE PUBLIC THAT
THE REMAINING SUSPECTS

183
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,583
WOULD ALSO BE
BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.

184
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,791
- I'VE SAT BY LONG ENOUGH.

185
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,583
I CAN'T REMAIN A
SPECTATOR ANY LONGER.

186
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:59,541
- I LOVE THIS CITY.
AND YET I DESPISE IT.

187
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:03,416
AND I'LL CRUSH ANYONE
THAT STANDS IN MY WAY.

188
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,416
- ( phone ringing )

189
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,250
- Mrs. Yayoi: WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

190
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,916
YOU HOUND ME DAY AND NIGHT FOR
INTERVIEWS! CELICA WOULD NEVER

191
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,875
--DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT!
- I'M SORRY, MRS. YAYOI.

192
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,625
- INTEGRA,
IS THAT YOU? IT IS YOU!

193
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,708
PLEASE! TELL ME WHAT
HAPPENED TO MY LITTLE GIRL!

194
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,125
YOU MUST KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT ALL THIS!

195
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,750
YOU GIRLS WERE LIKE
SISTERS! PLEASE--

196
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,125
- ( crying ) I'M SO SORRY.

197
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,791
- HEY.

198
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,250
- AXELA THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SHOW YOU.

199
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,916
- HMM. IS THIS THING
RECORDING OR WHAT?

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,083
LOOKS LIKE IT IS. YEAH,
THE LITTLE RED LIGHT IS ON.

201
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,208
( clears throat )

202
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,625
OKAY. I DECIDED THAT IF I TRIED
TO WRITE THIS DOWN IN A LETTER,

203
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,166
I WOULD NEVER HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO FINISH,

204
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,208
THAT, PLUS I TOTALLY
SUCK AT WRITING,

205
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,625
SO HERE WE GO. OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS A LOT MORE EMBARRASSING

206
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:14,833
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

207
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:18,041
JUST BEAR WITH ME,
THIS WILL BE OVER SOON.

208
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,791
LET'S SEE, INTEGRA?

209
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:25,208
I'M REALLY SORRY FOR ALL THE
TROUBLE THAT I'VE CAUSED YOU.

210
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,791
IT'S JUST, TOO BAD THAT
THINGS ENDED UP THIS WAY.

211
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,041
( laughs ) LISTEN TO ME!

212
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,083
SOUNDS LIKE THESE ARE MY
LAST WORDS OR SOMETHING.

213
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,666
- WHATEVER. ANYWAY.
- CELICA...

214
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,000
OH! AXELA! I NEED YOU
TO DO ME A FAVOR.

215
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,541
IF ANYTHING YOU KNOW...

216
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,416
IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO ME,

217
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,583
I'D LIKE YOUR HELP
WITH SOMETHING.

218
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,083
WOULD YOU MIND GOING
BY MY SISTER'S GRAVE

219
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,666
AND TIDYING THINGS UP A BIT?

220
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,250
JUST ONCE A YEAR WOULD BE FINE.
JUST TRY TO KEEP THE WEEDS AWAY,

221
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,041
AND MAKE SURE, YOU CAN
STILL SEE HER NAME AND ALL THAT.

222
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:58,041
OKAY? I APPRECIATE IT.
OH, AND ONE MORE THING.

223
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,041
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT!

224
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,666
THAT WAS ALL I
REALLY WANTED TO SAY.

225
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,541
THAT'S IT THEN. GOODBYE.

226
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,333
- ( crying )

227
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,541
CELICA...

228
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,500
- ( sighs )

229
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,666
- ROSE!

230
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,625
- TELL ME WHAT DO
YOU WANT TO DO?

231
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,000
- WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE FOR ME TO DO?

232
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,166
- IT'S NOT FAIR TO ANSWER
A QUESTION WITH A QUESTION.

233
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,291
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN MIND?

234
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,041
- YES.

235
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,541
- YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF,
DON'T YOU?

236
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,666
- YES.
- THEN WHY?

237
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,000
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO UNCERTAIN?
EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES.

238
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,250
PEOPLE DO, MACHINES DO.

239
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,666
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS,
TO NOT REPEAT THOSE MISTAKES.

240
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,375
TO BE ABLE TO LEARN
FROM THOSE PAST EXPERIENCES

241
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,041
AND ALLOW THEIR OUTCOME
TO GUIDE YOU.

242
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,333
YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR
ABILITIES TO THE FULLEST,

243
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,791
AND DO YOUR BEST.

244
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,958
THAT WAY, YOU WILL
HAVE NO REGRETS.

245
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,541
IF YOU CAN DO THAT, THEN
YOU CAN START YOUR FUTURE.

246
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,041
- THEN COME WITH ME.
- YES.

247
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,416
- TO THE FUTURE.
- YES.

248
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,541
- TOGETHER.

249
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,125
- ( phone ringing )

250
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,041
- YES?

251
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,958
WHAT IS IT?

252
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,583
- Woman: I'M SORRY
TO DISTURB YOU SIR,

253
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,291
BUT WE SEEM TO HAVE
A SITUATION IN THE LOBBY.

254
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,500
- I SAID LET GO OF ME!

255
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,583
WHERE THE HECK
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, OLD MAN?

256
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,375
- ROSE, JUST LISTEN TO ME!

257
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,666
- STOP IT!
YOU'RE MAKING A SCENE!

258
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,833
- ROSE...

259
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,833
- HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME?

260
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,041
YOU SAID AS LONG
AS I WAS ALIVE,

261
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,375
YOU WOULDN'T CARE
ABOUT WHAT I DID.

262
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,583
WELL I'M ALIVE,
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

263
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,166
ARE WE DONE HERE?
GOOD. GLAD WE HAD THIS TALK.

264
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,125
- NO! WE'RE NOT DONE!
TURN AROUND AND TALK TO ME!

265
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,541
- SORRY, BUT I'VE GOT
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

266
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,333
- WAIT!

267
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,833
- EXCUSE ME SIR,
BUT THIS IS A PLACE OF BUSINESS.

268
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:06,708
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO REFRAIN FROM SUCH BEHAVIOR.

269
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,000
- AND WHO IN THE HELL,
MIGHT YOU BE?

270
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,750
- FIRST, MIGHT I ASK YOUR
RELATIONSHIP TO MS. ANDERSON?

271
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,291
- NO, FIRST YOU ANSWER ME!

272
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,958
- VERY WELL. IF YOU INSIST.

273
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,291
I'M THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS
FOR THE SECURITY DIVISION.

274
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,000
HER DIRECT SUPERVISOR HERE,
IN OTHER WORDS.

275
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,000
ASHLEY LYNX.
I'M PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

276
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,833
- ( gasps ) SO YOU'RE THE ONE!

277
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,708
- WE SHOULD TALK.

278
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,750
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU TELL
ME WHAT YOU MEANT BY THAT?

279
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:33,875
- HERE YOU GO, SIR.

280
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,541
- THE TEA LEAVES ARE
GROWN BY OUR COMPANY.

281
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,083
THE TASTE IS RATHER UNIQUE,

282
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,416
AND THE FRAGRANCE
IS QUITE SOOTHING.

283
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,000
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE BLENDS.

284
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,458
- I'M TAKING ROSE HOME.
- SORRY?

285
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,541
- YOU HEARD ME.
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER.

286
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,458
NOW CALL HER DOWN HERE,
SO WE CAN GO.

287
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,958
- AH! SO THE TEA IS NOT
TO YOUR LIKING, I TAKE IT?

288
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,291
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO
TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

289
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,166
- YOU GET HER IN HERE!
RIGHT NOW!

290
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,208
- IT'S NOT NECESSARY
TO RAISE YOUR VOICE.

291
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,625
I'M NOT DEAF, YOU KNOW.

292
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,791
- FINE. SO GET HER ALREADY.

293
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,541
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S
NOT POSSIBLE.

294
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,791
ROSE IS ACTUALLY BUSY
WORKING AT THE MOMENT.

295
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,416
BUT I WOULD BE MORE
THAN HAPPY TO ADDRESS

296
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,333
ANY CONCERNS YOU MIGHT HAVE.

297
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,208
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

298
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,666
- IF YOU WON'T CALL
HER DOWN HERE,

299
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,000
THEN I'LL FIND HERMYSELF.
-OUTSIDERS AREN'T

300
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,583
ALLOWED TO ROAM AROUND
THE BUILDING UNATTENDED.

301
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,541
- I AM NOT GOING TO
LET ROSE STAY HERE

302
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,916
AND WORK WITH SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

303
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,958
- SOMEONE LIKE ME?
APPARENTLY YOU'VE

304
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,416
DEVELOPED A SOMEWHAT
OF A DEEP LOATHING FOR ME.

305
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,375
- DEVELOPED, HUH?
IT'S PRETTY EASY TO LOATHE

306
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,250
SOMEONE WHO KILLS
HIS EMPLOYEES.

307
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,791
- I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

308
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,125
BUT I'M CURIOUS YOU
WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW

309
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,583
ANYTHING CONCERNING
THE WHEREABOUTS OF

310
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,208
MY FORMER SUBORDINATES?

311
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,833
I'D BE GRATEFUL FOR
ANY INFORMATION

312
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,333
YOU HAVE ABOUT THEM.

313
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,250
IT'S A CITIZEN'S
DUTY TO COOPERATE

314
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,125
WITH A POLICE INVESTIGATION.

315
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,916
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
- OH, IS THAT SO?

316
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,208
- AND EVEN IF I DID,
I WOULDN'T TELL YOU.

317
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,041
- AND WHY WOULD THAT BE?

318
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,333
- LIKE I SAID,
'CAUSE I DON'T LIKE YOU.

319
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,500
- AND I FIND YOU UNPLEASANT,
AS WELL.

320
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,125
LISTEN CAREFULLY MR. REVANT.

321
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,791
I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT R.U.C
CONTROLS THE GOVERNMENT

322
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,375
AND THE ECONOMY OF THIS CITY.

323
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,791
- SO? WHAT DO I CARE?

324
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,500
- IT WOULD BE BEST FOR YOU
TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

325
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,708
- OTHERWISE, YOU AND THOSE
AROUND YOU MIGHT GET HURT.

326
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,916
- WHAT WAS THAT?

327
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,958
- STAY OUT OF IT.
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

328
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,833
- IS THAT SOME KIND OF THREAT?

329
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:36,000
- THAT ALL DEPENDS ON
WHAT YOU DO, MR. REVANT.

330
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,583
LEAVE THROUGH THE BACK EXIT.

331
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,875
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMEONE TO ESCORT YOU?

332
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,750
( laughing )

333
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,666
- ( phone ringing )

334
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,291
- Automated voice: NO ONE IS
AVAILABLE TO TAKE YOUR CALL.

335
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,333
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE
AFTER THE TONE.

336
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,041
- ( beeps )

337
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,125
- ROY REVANT. THIS IS JOSEPH.

338
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,958
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND THAT
I TRACKED DOWN YOUR NUMBER.

339
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,291
SOME PEOPLE PAID
A VISIT TO MY HOME RECENTLY.

340
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,791
- THAT VOICE.
WHERE HAVE I HEARD IT BEFORE...

341
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,625
- IT SEEMS ASHLEY IS TAKING
NO CHANCES THIS TIME.

342
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,208
- ( gasps )

343
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,833
- Man 1: GREAT. ANOTHER FAILURE.
- Man 2: I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING!

344
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,583
- Man 3: YOU HAVE GOT
TO LOWER THE FATALITY RATE!

345
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,625
- Man 4: AFTER ALL OUR EFFORTS,
WE'VE STILL HAD NO SUCCESS.

346
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,083
- I SINCERELY BELIEVE
THAT THIS METHOD

347
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,833
OF AUGMENTING THE
GENES IS ENTIRELY WRONG.

348
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,208
ASHLEY, ARE YOU
EVEN LISTENING TO ME?

349
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,708
- IT WAS HIM! THE OPERATIONS
DIRECTOR WAS THERE!

350
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,208
- I'VE SHIPPED A PACKAGE TO YOU.

351
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,333
I THINK YOU WILL FIND
IT'S CONTENTS USEFUL.

352
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,666
GOOD LUCK. GIVE MY BEST
REGARDS TO THAT GIRL.

353
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,416
- HELLO? HELLO?

354
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,458
- ( dial tone )

355
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,333
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

356
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,916
- SOLTY! I NEED TO ASK YOU

357
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,208
- SOMETHING!
- WHAT IS IT?

358
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,291
- DO YOU KNOW
A MAN NAMED JOSEPH?

359
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,125
- YES. BUT WHY?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HIM?

360
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,875
- YOU HAVE TO TELL
ME WHERE HE IS! PLEASE!

361
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,250
- TWELVE LONG YEARS HAVE
PASSED, MY DEAREST ONE.

362
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:47,791
BUT THIS TIME, I WILL COME
FOR YOU WITHOUT FAIL.

363
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,291
ILLUMINA.

364
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,166
- ( theme song playing )

365
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

366
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,333
- ( music playing )

367
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,666
- Solty: WHAT IS GOING
ON WITH YOU, ROSE?

368
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,333
- Rose: THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

369
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,500
- Solty: NEXT EPISODE,
"CATASTROPHE CALLS."

370
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,083
YOU WILL COME BACK, WON'T YOU?
