1
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,500
- TWELVE YEARS AGO,

2
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,000
THERE WAS THIS EXPLOSION
CALLED THE BLAST FALL.

3
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:27,458
IT WAS CAUSED BY LIGHTNING
FROM THE AURORA.

4
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,458
MY MOM SAYS A LOT
OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED,

5
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,583
AND LOTS AND LOTS OF OTHERS
WERE NEVER FOUND,

6
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,416
SO NO ONE KNOWS WHAT
HAPPENED TO THEM.

7
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,375
OF COURSE,
I WASN'T EVEN BORN YET

8
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,958
WHEN ALL THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE HAPPENED.

9
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:47,291
( Kasha speaking )

10
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,500
- ( theme song playing )

11
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

12
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,916
- Woman on TV: IN OTHER NEWS,

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
OFFICIALS REPORT A DRAMATIC
RISE IN INFERIN ABUSE.

14
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,208
ITS GROWING POPULARITY AMONG

15
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,875
ADOLESCENT DRUG USERS HAS LED

16
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,041
THE POLICE TO STEP UP
ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS,

17
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,791
BUT WITH LITTLE EFFECT SO FAR.

18
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,375
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE DEPARTMENT
NOTED THAT THE DIFFICULTY

19
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,125
IN IDENTIFYING THE
DRUG'S SOURCES

20
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,541
MAKE IT UNLIKELY
THAT THE PROBLEM

21
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,500
WILL BE RESOLVED ANY TIME.

22
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,708
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING HERE?

23
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,458
- I HOPE YOU SLEPT WELL.
IS THAT BREAKFAST?

24
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:01,541
- DID YOU BREAK IN?
- UH, OH, NO.

25
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,833
IT WAS ALREADY OPEN.

26
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,875
- GO BACK TO MIRANDA'S PLACE.

27
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:09,041
- YOU'RE NOT A VERY GOOD COOK,
ARE YOU?

28
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,125
MIRANDA IS. SHE'S REALLY GOOD.

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,791
- JUST GO.

30
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,625
- HEY, I'LL BET YOU
DIDN'T KNOW MIRANDA

31
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,041
IS TEACHING ME HOW TO COOK.

32
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,416
- GO!

33
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,250
- OH, THAT GIVES ME A GREAT
IDEA, MAYBE TOMORROW...

34
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:23,875
UH...

35
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,125
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

36
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,208
- YEAH, TO WORK.
- TERRIFIC!

37
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,041
ALONE.

38
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,250
- I CAN HELP!
- NO. THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

39
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,500
- BUT I WANT TO HELP YOU.
- I'M SURE YOU DO.

40
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,041
- OH, MY. I THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR DOOR.

41
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,375
OH, SOLTY, I WAS WONDERING
WHERE YOU'D GOTTEN TO.

42
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,000
- ( giggles ) I WAS
IN ROY'S ROOM.

43
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,833
- MIRANDA, I WANT HIS
GIRL OUT OF THIS--

44
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:56,958
- THERE'S A LETTER
FOR YOU, SOLTY.

45
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,125
IT'S FROM THE CITY
WELFARE OFFICE.

46
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,416
I THINK IT'S ABOUT YOUR
CITIZEN STATUS.

47
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,500
- LET'S SEE.

48
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,041
"DEAR MISS SOLTY REVANT,

HUH...

57
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,541
- Roy: WHAT IS THIS,
SOME KIND OF JOKE?

58
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,750
THE DEAL WAS YOU WERE GONNA
LOOK AFTER HER AT YOUR PLACE.

59
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,500
- I WAS JUST AS SURPRISED

BUT IT'S A DONE DEAL,
SO WHY NOT ACCEPT IT?

64
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,166
- IT'S STILL TEMPORARY.

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,708

GOING TO CANCEL IT?

- HERE, YOUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT.

68

THE CLIENT JUST SO HAPPENS
TO BE A HOSPITAL,

69
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,333
SO YOU CAN GET
SOLTY'S PHYSICAL

- Rose: SO, THEY GOT A HUNTER?

77
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,541
- Andy: YEP. LOOKS LIKE
SOMEBODY TOOK THE JOB.

78
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,708
- ( laughs ) I WONDER WHO THIS
LOSER IS. WHAT DOES IT SAY?

79
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,041
- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
THE MORE OPPONENTS THERE ARE,

80
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,083
THE MORE EXCITING THE GAME IS.

81
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,166
- TRUE. AND LIKE EVERY
OTHER GAME WE PLAY,

82
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,500
WE'LL ALWAYS COME OUT ON TOP.

WE'RE GOING OUT.

85
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,375
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE GONE ANYWHERE TOGETHER!

86
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,416
( gasps ) OH, AND

WHERE IS IT? IS IT CLOSE?
IS IT FAR?

88
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,791
DO THEY JUST DO PHYSICALS?
OR DO THEY DO OTHER THINGS, TOO?

89
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,541
IS GETTING A PHYSICAL FUN?
I'M SO EXCITED, THIS IS GREAT.

117
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,291
WE'VE TAKEN THE LEAD IN MEETING
THE INCREASING DEMAND

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,125
NONE OF YOU PAPER PUSHERS
GET IT RIGHT.

- ( door opens )

141
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,541
- IT'S REALLY A VERY
SIMPLE ASSIGNMENT.

142
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,541
- WE WANT YOU TO MAKE
SURE THAT CASE ISN'T STOLEN.

143
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,000
- STOLEN?

144
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,916
- YES, WE RECEIVED A RATHER
BOLD, YET ANONYMOUS LETTER

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,333
BOASTING THAT IT WOULD BE TAKEN

146
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,333
AND THERE WAS NOTHING
WE COULD DO ABOUT IT.

147
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,208
- REALLY. YOU STILL HAVE IT?

148
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,583
- I'M VERY SORRY.
I'M AFRAID I MISPLACED IT.

149
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,208
- AND WHAT'S IN THIS BRIEFCASE?

150
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,000
- ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT
YOU NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

151
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,125
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PROTECT
THE CASE, OR IS THAT A PROBLEM?

152
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,708
- ( gunshots )

153
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,500
- WE'VE INSTALLED A NEW
HIGH TECH SECURITY SYSTEM.

154
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,625
NATURALLY, I'M THE ONLY ONE
WITH THE CODE TO DISARM IT.

155
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,875
WE'RE MOVING THE CASE TOMORROW,
AFTER WHICH THE QUESTION

156
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,791
OF THEFT WILL NO
LONGER BE AN ISSUE.

157
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,708
- OH, AND WE'LL NEED YOU TO
PROVIDE SECURITY THEN, AS WELL.

158
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,500
- SO, UNLESS YOU HAVE
MORE QUESTIONS?

159
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,291
- NO, NO QUESTIONS.

160
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,916
- Solty: UM, IS THAT...

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,875
OH. IS THAT THING PART
OF THE PHYSICAL?

162
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,375
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO EXACTLY?

163
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,750
- WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM
A SCAN OF YOUR VITAL FUNCTIONS.

164
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,708
NOW HURRY UP AND GET
YOUR TUSH ON THE TABLE.

165
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,375
I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY,
YOU KNOW.

166
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,000
- OH, OKAY.

167
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,666
I WONDER IF ROY HAS
STARTED THE JOB ALREADY?

168
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,291
- ( whirring )

169
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,583
- I SURE WISH I WAS
HELPING HIM RIGHT NOW.

170
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,708
- ( gun clicks )

171
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,458
- SO I FIND MYSELF ASKING,

172
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,541
DO DOCTORS DO ELECTRICAL WORK?

173
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,166
( gasps ) YOU'RE JUST A KID.

174
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,541
- I'M NOT A KID.
- THE HELL YOU'RE NOT.

175
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,750
- ( gun clicks )

176
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,666
- Larry: ALLOW ME TO
INTRODUCE YOU.

177
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,375
THIS IS MY YOUNGER BROTHER,
ANDY ANDERSON.

178
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,333
AS FOR ME, I'M THE GUY WHO'S
GOT A GUN AIMED AT YOUR HEAD.

179
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:24,083
BUT YOU, YOU CAN CALL ME
LARRY, MR. REVANT.

180
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,125
- LARRY ANDERSON?

181
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,833
SO, YOU BOYS ARE THE
INFAMOUS ANDERSON BROTHERS?

182
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,500
JUDGING BY THE LETTER
YOU SENT IN ADVANCE,

183
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,125
I GUESS YOU'RE AS ARROGANT
AS THEY SAY YOU ARE.

184
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,416
- YOU'VE GOT A BIT
OF A REP YOURSELF.

185
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,875
I HEARD YOU REALLY
TORE UP THE UNDERWORLD.

186
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,541
OF COURSE THAT
WAS A WHILE BACK,

187
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,333
WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR YOUR MISSING KID.

188
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:46,166
EASY. I DON'T WANT
ANY EXTRA WORK.

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,666
JUST DON'T MOVE.

190
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,583
- WHAT'RE YOU GUYS
PLANNING TO DO?

191
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,833
- THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

192
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,541
JUST SIT BACK
AND ENJOY THE SHOW.

193
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,541
- SCANNING SYSTEMS.
OPERATING NORMALLY.

194
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,208
EVERYTHING CHECKS OUT. SO...
HUH?

195
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,541
- ( electronic beeping )

196
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,750
- ( gasps ) WHAT'S THIS?

197
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,708
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

198
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,416
BUT THERE'S NO MISTAKE.

199
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,000
- ( beeping )

200
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,916
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,416
I'VE GOT TO GET MORE
POWER TO THE SCANNER.

202
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:44,000
I'VE GOT TO RUN MORE TESTS.
CHECK HER REACTIONS.

203
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,125
- WAIT! YOU ASSHOLES AREN'T
GOING TO CUT THE POWER, ARE YOU?

204
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,500
ARE YOU COMPLETELY INSANE?
THERE MUST BE DOZENS

205
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,875
OF PEOPLE ON LIFE SUPPORT
OR IN SURGERY RIGHT NOW,

206
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,916
- THEY COULD ALL BE KILLED.
- SHUT YOUR FACE, GRANDPA!

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,750
- THE BACKUP
GENERATORS WILL KICK IN

208
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,583
RIGHT AFTER WE PULL THE PLUG.

209
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,750
SOON AS IT DOES, WE'LL STRIKE.

210
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,791
IT'LL BE OVER IN A MOMENT.

211
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,458
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN
TO THE PATIENTS.

212
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,750
IT'S A SIMPLE GAME.

213
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,041
- EXCUSE ME, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

214
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,916
- Yuto: RELAX, THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

215
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,541
THE SENSOR PADS ARE FOR
A COUPLE MORE LITTLE TESTS.

216
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,291
JUST A SEC.

217
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,291
HERE WE GO. EASY.

218
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,000
- ( explosion )

219
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,166
- WHAT WAS THAT?

220
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,666
- HUH?

221
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,750
- THAT'S ODD.

222
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:38,958
( exclaims )

223
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,208
- ANDY, NO!
- THAT WASN'T ME.

224
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,416
- ( grunting )

225
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,041
- LARRY!

226
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,541
- ( gunshot )

227
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,625
- ( groans )

228
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,500
DAMN.

229
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,583
- THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, SIR.

230
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,833
YOU ALLOWED THOSE FELONS

231
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,416
TO ESCAPE FROM UNDER
YOUR VERY NOSE.

232
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,833
- PARDON ME, DOCTOR.

233
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,833
BUT HE DID STOP THEM
FROM STEALING THE CASE.

234
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,250
WHO ASKED YOU!
GROSS INCOMPETENCE.

235
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,291
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

236
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,875
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
TO DESCRIBE IT.

237
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,958
I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT
TO ADD EXTRA HUNTERS

238
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,375
TO THE GUARD DETAIL
FOR TOMORROW'S TRANSPORT.

239
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,416
AND, SIR, THE MONEY
FOR THOSE HUNTERS

240
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,208
WILL COME OUT OF
YOUR REMUNERATION.

241
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,666
IS THAT PERFECTLY CLEAR?

242
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,208
- YEAH, WHATEVER YOU SAY.

243
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,208
- Man: OKAY, LISTEN.

244
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,500
I KNOW YOU WANNA BE A BIG SHOT
RESEMBLE TECHNICIAN SOMEDAY,

245
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,333
BUT UNTIL THEN,
YOU REALLY CAN'T GO AROUND

246
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,000
TAPPING INTO THE MAIN POWER
GRID WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION.

247
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,666
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
BLOW EVERYTHING UP

248
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,125
AND BLACK OUT THE HOSPITAL
IN THE PROCESS.

249
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,875
- AWESOME. AWESOME.
- WHAT?

250
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,875
- THAT GIRL WAS REALLY AWESOME!

251
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,916
IF I COULD JUST EXAMINE
HER AGAIN, I COULD...

252
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,666
AWESOME. SHE WAS SO AWESOME.

253
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,666
- YOU ARE SO FIRED.

254
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,166
- UH, ARE YOU...
- GET SOME SLEEP.

255
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,541
- OKAY.

256
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,625
GOOD NIGHT.

257
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,458
THERE SURE ARE A LOT
OF PEOPLE HERE, ROY.

258
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,166
- AH, JUST IGNORE 'EM.

259
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,500
ALL THAT MATTERS THAT WE
CONCENTRATE ON DOING OUR JOB.

260
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,083
- OKAY.

261
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,041
- EXCELLENT, GENTLEMEN,
LET'S MOVE OUT.

262
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,583
( chuckles ) WITH THIS KIND OF
SECURITY, THOSE MISCREANTS

263
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:11,500
WILL HAVE TO THINK TWICE
BEFORE THEY TRY ANYTHING.

264
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:15,666
- UH, ROY, IS IT A GOOD IDEA
TO BE SO FAR BACK?

265
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,375
- HA! I TOLD YOU THIS
WAS GONNA BE SIMPLE.

266
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,541
- YEAH, LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA
BE EASY MONEY TODAY, BOYS.

267
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,708
- ( car tires squealing )
- ( gasps )

268
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,708
- SORRY WE'RE LATE. LET'S BEGIN.

269
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,458
- OKAY, TAKE 'EM DOWN.

270
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,833
- WHAT THE HELL?

271
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:37,875
( gasps )

272
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,791
- ( gasps ) WHAT HAPPENED?
- HANG ON TIGHT!

273
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,000
- Man: HEY, HEY KENT,
SLOW DOWN.

274
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,166
I THINK SOMETHING'S
GOING DOWN BEHIND THE TRANSPORT.

275
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,708
- Andy: YOU DON'T MISS A THING,
DO YOU?

276
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,791
AFRAID YOUR BUDDIES
ARE OUT OF THE GAME.

277
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,750
- OH, YOU BASTARD!

278
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,583
- ( bell ringing )

279
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,166
- HEY, LOOK.
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

280
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,041
- WHERE?
- Kasha: I TOTALLY GOT AN A.

281
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,083
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- WHAT IS THAT?

282
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,750
- WHOA, MAN. THAT SUCKS.

283
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,500
- ( explosion )

284
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,791
- Andy: HEY LARRY, THIS GUY
DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO QUIT.

285
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,833
- Larry: BUT YOU GOTTA
ADMIRE HIS DEDICATION.

286
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,875
- OKAY, THEN WE'LL HAVE
TO DO THE OL' SMASH N' GRAB.

287
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,041
( laughs ) THIS IS MORE
MY STYLE, ANYWAY.

288
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,833
OH YEAH, COME TO DADDY.

289
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,208
- ( gunshot )

290
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,666
- WHAT THE...

291
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,083
- THAT WAS FOR YESTERDAY.
- I WANNA HELP, TOO!

292
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,583
- WAIT. SOLTY.

293
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,375
- GIMME THAT CASE, YOU LITTLE...

294
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,291
- ( sighs ) THEY'RE SO
FAR AHEAD OF US NOW,

295
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,375
WE MAY NEVER CATCH UP.

296
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,333
- SPARE ME THE TRAFFIC
REPORT, MISSY.

297
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,791
GET THIS CAR MOVING BEFORE
THOSE CROOKS CAN GET AWAY.

298
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,208
- YOU KNOW, DEWEY,

299
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,500
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE REAL
NATALIE PUTS UP WITH YOU.

300
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,416
- THE REAL NATALIE,
WHAT DO YOU...

301
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,458
( gasps )

302
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,750
- YEAH, THE ONE
WHO'S BEEN RESTING

303
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,708
COMFORTABLY AT HOME
SINCE YESTERDAY.

304
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,875
( giggles )

305
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,333
SEE YA!

306
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,250
- FOR THE LOVE OF...
JUST HOLD STILL!

307
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,583
- ( screaming )

308
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,750
( chuckles ) LOOK, I GOT IT.
HEY, ROY!

309
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,166
- THAT A GIRL.

310
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,500
- ( whizzing )

311
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,541
- ( gasps )

312
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,916
- WE LIVE IN SAD, SAD TIMES.

313
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
FOOLS AND VILLAINS
