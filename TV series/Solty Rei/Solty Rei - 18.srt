1
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,791
- Kasha: HEY, ROY!

00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,541
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?
SOLTY'S BACK! SHE...

3
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,416
- HMM...

4
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,000
- ( panting )

5
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,666
- OH! YOU'RE BACK! HI, ROY.

6
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,291
I'M SORRY.

7
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:57,041
I WAS... THAT IS... I, UH...

8
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:02,125
- NO, NO, WAIT. I SHOULD
APOLOGIZE TO YOU. I...

9
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:11,000
- HEY, GUESS WHAT? I'VE, UH,
BEEN TRYING OUT SOME NEW DISHES.

10
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,291
YOU WANNA GIVE THEM A TASTE?

11
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,791
- SURE.

12
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,833
- HERE YOU GO.
- WOW.

13
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,541
- SO HOW IS IT?

14
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,166
- IT'S NOT BAD.

15
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,750
- ( theme song playing )

16
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

17
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,500
- Woman on TV: THE INFANTS
FOUND BY THE AUTHORITIES

18
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,541
ARE DOING FINE...

19
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,000
- THERE. I THINK
IT'S ONLY BRUISED.

20
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,916
- THANKS, INTEGRA.

21
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,375
- Woman on TV: NEW DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE HOMICIDE THAT TOOK PLACE

22
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,708
YESTERDAY INSIDE R.U.C.'S
SECURITY DIVISION.

23
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,083
ARREST WARRANTS

24
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,708

00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,375
FORMER CO-WORKERS OF SILVIA
BAN, THE MURDER VICTIM.

28
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,541
OFFICIALS SUSPECT AN
INTERNAL WORKPLACE DISPUTE

29
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,125
TO BE THE MOTIVE
FOR THE KILLING.

30
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,916
THIS INVESTIGATION WILL...

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,708
- WE'VE BEEN FRAMED.

32
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,041
- TOTALLY.

33
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,250
- ( screaming )

34
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,166
- NO! CELICA!
SNAP OUT OF IT!

35
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,833
- I CAN'T THINK OF A NICER
WAY TO SPEND A DAY

36
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,333
OFF THAN AT A PLACE LIKE
THIS. NOW THERE'S AN IDEA...

37
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,625
- ( screaming )

38
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,583
- SILVIA BAN AND CELICA YAYOI
RETURNING TO DUTY!

39
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,375
- ( overlapping chatter )

40
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,000
- ( screams )

41
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,958
( sobbing )

42
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,958
- YOU ARE MAKING
THIS VERY DIFFICULT.

43
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,291
- ASHLEY LINX.

44
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,875
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR
THE MURDER OF SILVIA BAN.

45
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:46,458
PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD AND
KNEEL DOWN ON THE FLOOR, SLOWLY.

46
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,541
- I DID WHAT WAS NEEDED

47
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,250
TO GET RID OF AN
UNNECESSARY SUBORDINATE.

48
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,875
- ( tires squeal )

49
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,166
- Guard: THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!
SHUT THE GATE!

50
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,583
- WELL, NOW WHAT? ANY THOUGHTS?

51
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,000
- TO START,

52
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,666
WE NEED TO WORK ON FINDING
A WAY TO CLEAR OUR NAMES.

53
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,125
- AND HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT?

54
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,500
- FIRST, WE HACK INTO
THE R.U.C. MAINFRAME

55
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,166
AND DIG UP WHATEVER
DATA WE CAN FIND.

56
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,750
SECURITY CAMERA IMAGES,
COMMUNICATIONS RECORDS,

57
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,625
ENTRY AND EXIT LOGS,
ANYTHING WE CAN GET.

58
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,791
THERE HAS TO BE
SOMETHING WE CAN USE.

59
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,208
SOME INFORMATION THAT WILL
PROVE OUR INNOCENCE.

60
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,375
AND WITH ANY LUCK WE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO IMPLICATE

61
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,541
THE DIRECTOR WHILE WE'RE AT IT.

62
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,875
- SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK AXELA? CAN YOU DO IT?

63
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,416
- YOU BET.

64
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,166
- SO, IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
NOTHING FOR ME TO DO RIGHT NOW.

65
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,208
- HEY WAIT. WHERE ARE YOU...
- BYE BYE!

66
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:00,250
- Man: HEY! COME BACK HERE!
- OH, HE'S GOTTA BE KIDDING!

67
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,958
( chuckles )

68
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,833
- ( thud )

69
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,416
- OW! WHY DON'T YOU LOOK WHERE
YOU'RE GOING, YOU OVERGROWN...

70
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,458
HUH?

71
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,833
OH! ROSE, IT'S YOU.

72
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,666
PERFECT TIMING!

73
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,708
YOU GOING TO A COSTUME PARTY?

74
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,791
OH, NEVER MIND THERE'S
A GUY CHASING ME...

75
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,708
RUN INTERFERENCE FOR ME
LIKE ALWAYS, OKAY? THANKS!

76
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,791
( exclaims )

77
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,041
LOOK ROSE, I DON'T
HAVE TIME TO CHAT!

78
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,083
- THERE YOU ARE,
YOU LITTLE PUNK.

79
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,750
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
AWAY THIS TIME.

80
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,916
YOU LIKE STEALING FROM ME, DO
YOU? YOU SAWED OFF LITTLE CROOK?

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,166
- AW, WHAT'S IT TO YOU,
I DIDN'T TAKE THAT MUCH.

82
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,125
YOU REGISTERED BIG SHOT!

83
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,625
- WAIT YOU MEAN
YOU'RE UNREGISTERED?

84
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,125
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- WHAT'S ALL THE COMMOTION HERE?

85
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,791
- THIS CHILD WAS CAUGHT
STEALING. TAKE HER AWAY.

86
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,250
- BUT, MISS...

87
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,166
- AT ONCE!
- UH, RIGHT!

88
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,291
- ALL RIGHT, YOU, LET'S GO!
- NO!

89
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,333
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, ROSE?
YOU TRAITOR!

90
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,416
( Mii grunting )

91
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,875
- GEEZ, LADY,

92
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,500
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO AND
GET HER ARRESTED LIKE THAT.

93
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,583
ALL I REALLY WANTED WAS
TO GET MY PRODUCE BACK

94
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,708
OR MAKE HER BUY IT.

95
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,416
SHE WAS JUST A LITTLE
KID YOU KNOW.

96
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,875
- DON'T BE A FOOL!
A CRIME IS STILL A CRIME,

97
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,750
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE
A CHILD OR AN ADULT.

98
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,833
THAT KID DIDN'T KNOW
RIGHT FROM WRONG.

99
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:27,958
AND THIS WAS A GOOD
CHANCE TO TEACH HER!

100
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,833
THIS SORT OF THING IS EXACTLY
WHY UNREGISTERED CITIZENS

101
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:44,708
CAN NEVER GET AHEAD!

102
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:48,250
- Man: THERE YOU GO MY FRIEND.
THAT'S ABOUT EVERYTHING I GOT.

103
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,750
WHOA, WHOA.
TAKE IT EASY THERE.

104
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,500
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL, HON?

105
00:07:56,583 --> 00:08:00,958
NOT THAT IT'S ANY
OF MY BUSINESS. JUST CURIOUS.

106
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,375
ARE YOU PLANNING ON STARTING
YOUR OWN PRIVATE WAR?

107
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:08,166
- MY OWN PRIVATE WAR? HELL YEAH!

108
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,708
- UH, ON SECOND THOUGHT,
MAYBE I'LL JUST GET A MANICURE.

109
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,375
- HEY, STOP SQUIRMING!
- AREN'T YOU OVERDOING IT?

110
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,166
- ARE YOU KIDDING,
THIS IS PERFECT!

111
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,500
WHEN THE BIG BOSS GETS
A LOAD OF THE NEW SILVIA,

112
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,333
YOU'LL HAVE TO BEAT
HIM OFF WITH A STICK.

113
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,333
IF THAT'S YOUR IDEA
OF A GOOD TIME.

114
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,500
- DON'T BE AN IDIOT!
THAT'S NOT WHY I...

115
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,291
- ( laughing )

116
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,875
- WHAT IS IT? KNOCK IT OFF!

117
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,041
CELICA!

118
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,625
- UH, LISTEN, CELICA...
- DON'T SAY IT.

119
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:47,125
- ( sighs ) DON'T GET KILLED.

120
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,750
- YOU BET I WON'T.

121
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,166
- SO YOU'RE READY
TO GO BACK TO WORK. HUH?

122
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,333
- YEAH. I GUESS SO.

123
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,500
- ABOUT TIME YOU GOT
YOUR REAR IN GEAR.

124
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,666
WE NEED YOU TO KEEP
THE CASH FLOWING!

125
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,583
- OH, REALLY?
- SORRY ABOUT MISS MONEYBAGS.

126
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,416
- NO SWEAT. IT'S OKAY.

127
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,416
- SOLTY, I JUST WANTED TO ASK
YOU, UH, WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE

128
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
HALF KIDDING ABOUT BEING
IN LOVE WITH THAT GUY,

129
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,000
DID THAT MEAN THAT MAYBE
YOU WERE HALF SERIOUS?

130
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,625
- YUTO...

131
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,916
- ANYTHING GOOD GOING
ON THESE DAYS?

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
- IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN KINDA SLOW.

133
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,791
BUT HERE'S ONE
THAT JUST CAME IN.

134
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,375
HE'S AN EX-BANK EMPLOYEE

135
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,458
WHO DECIDED TO HELP HIMSELF TO
THE TILL. CURRENTLY ON THE LAM.

136
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,791
NONE OF THE OTHER
BOUNTY HUNTERS

137
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,416
HERE HAVE TAKEN THE JOB YET,

138
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,541
SO THIS WOULD BE A GOOD
TIME TO GO GET HIM.

139
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:45,041
- HE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MUCH OF
A CHALLENGE. BUT WHAT THE HELL.

140
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,375
- SO, SO YOU AND THIS GUY...
DID, DID YOU...

141
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,583
- SOLTY!
- YES?

142
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,916
- WE'RE BACK ON THE
CLOCK, KID. LET'S GO.

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,791
- ALL RIGHT

144
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,166
- NO, WAIT, SOLTY, COME BACK.

145
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,375
- YOU'RE PATHETIC.

146
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,291
- ( clattering )

147
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,916
- WHAT DID YOU SAY? YOU BETTER
NOT BE SCREWING WITH ME!

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,291
- PLEASE. TAKE IT EASY, ANDY!

149
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,083
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
SURE ABOUT THIS?

150
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,500
- I SWEAR IT'S TRUE.
EVERYBODY WHO'S BEEN UP ABOVE

151
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,666
IS SAYING THE SAME
THING, ASK ANYONE.

152
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,000
- Woman 1: HAVE YOU HEARD
ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE MURDER

153
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,875
AT R.U.C. THE OTHER DAY?

154
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,666
- ALL I'VE HEARD IS THAT THEY
HAVEN'T CAUGHT THE KILLERS YET.

155
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,291
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.

156
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,041
I MEAN, THEY COULD BE
OUT THERE ANYWHERE,

157
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,000
GETTING READY TO STRIKE AGAIN.

158
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,458
- AND THEY LOOK SO YOUNG.

159
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,166
- YEAH, I GUESS LOOKS
REALLY CAN BE DECEIVING.

160
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,000
- WELL, I SURE HOPE
THEY CATCH THEM SOON.

161
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,500
- UH, ME TOO.

162
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,375
- ( sighs )

163
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,625
- ( door opens )

164
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:21,666
- ( gasps )

165
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,208
- IT'S JUST ME.

166
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,875
- ( sighs ) DON'T DO THAT.

167
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,500
- HOW'D IT GO OUT THERE?

168
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,333
- OKAY. BUT I'M SORRY.

169
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,916
I COULDN'T FIND YOU
ANY LAUREL LEAVES.

170
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,875
- OH? WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
I'LL MANAGE.

171
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,625
- I TRIED TO SNEAK BACK
INTO OUR APARTMENT,

172
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,250
BUT R.U.C. ALREADY HAS
THE PLACE TOTALLY SEALED OFF.

173
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,833
EVERYTHING WE OWNED HAS
BEEN RUMMAGED THROUGH

174
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,500
AND HAULED OFF TO
POLICE IMPOUND.

175
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,833
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT'VE YOU GOT?

176
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,791
WELL AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, ALL
RECORDS RELATING TO SILVIA'S

177
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,875
MURDER HAVE BEEN
ERASED. EXCEPT THIS.

178
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,708
- WHAT IS IT?
- SEE FOR YOURSELF.

179
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,958
THIS RECORDING IS THE ONLY
PIECE OF EVIDENCE

180
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,458
LEFT AND IT'S ALREADY BEING
REVIEWED BY INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

181
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,916
- NO...

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,708
- IT HAPPENED LESS
THAN TWO DAYS AGO.

183
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,375
YET SOMEHOW IN THAT SHORT
TIME HE'S MANAGED TO...

184
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,583
- HE'S FABRICATED THIS
VERY ELABORATE VIDEO

185
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,833
AND ERASED ALL THE REAL
EVIDENCE FROM THE SERVERS.

186
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,666
HE MAY BE GOOD, BUT THERE'S
NO WAY HE'S THAT GOOD.

187
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,791
THE ONLY WAY HE
COULD'VE PULLED THIS OFF

188
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,000
IS IF HE ALREADY HAD IT
PREPARED AS A CONTINGENCY.

189
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,500
- ( gasps )

190
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,500
- I'VE SUSPECTED FOR A WHILE
THAT SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT.

191
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,666
IF I'D LISTENED TO MY GUT,

192
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,166
MAYBE I COULD'VE
PREVENTED ALL THIS.

193
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,541
- BUT HOW?

194
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,708
- LISTEN TO ME, AXELA,
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL,

195
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,541
NOW'S THE TIME TO SPILL IT!

196
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,083
FOR INSTANCE, WHAT EXACTLY
WAS THAT CLASSIFIED PROGRAM

197
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,583
YOU WERE WORKING ON
WITH THE DIRECTOR?

198
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,208
- COME ON, YOU'VE
GOT TO TELL ME!

199
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,208
IT MIGHT BE THE KEY TO
THIS WHOLE MESS!

200
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,333
WE DON'T OWE R.U.C
ANYTHING ANYMORE!

201
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,041
AXELA!

202
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,833
- I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M NOT AN EMPLOYEE ANYMORE,

203
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,291
SO I GUESS THERE'S
NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO ME NOW.

204
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,791
HERE'S THE STORY.

205
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,666
THE PROJECT WAS AN
ATTEMPT TO ENHANCE

206
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,041
AND HARNESS MY PROCEED
ABILITIES IN ORDER TO...

207
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,625
- ( rapid beeping )

208
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,500
- SHE'S GETTING AWAY!
DOWNSTAIRS! MOVE!

209
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,541
LET' S GO! LET'S GO!
MOVING TO PERIMETER LOCATION.

210
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,416
- Integra: HIDE! DON'T MAKE
A SOUND! I'LL DRAW THEM AWAY!

211
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,208
WE'LL MEET UP LATER. GOT IT?

212
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,291
- Celica: GOOD OLD R.U.C.

213
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,458
THEY CAN TRACK A
FLEA IN A FLY'S NAVEL,

214
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,541
BUT THEY CAN'T FIND
A STOLEN ARMS CACHE.

215
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,333
SURE WORKED OUT
GOOD FOR ME, THOUGH.

216
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,166
LET THE WAR BEGIN.

217
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,666
- SEND THE BODY FOR AN AUTOPSY.
SECTION FIVE, MED UNIT.

218
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,041
- YES, SIR.

219
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,041
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, ROSE?
YOU TRAITOR!

220
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,625
- FOR ALL OF THESE YEARS...

221
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,083
FOR ALL OF THESE YEARS,

222
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,333
UNREGISTERED CITIZENS HAVE
BEEN SACRIFICED LIKE CATTLE.

223
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,125
IRENE SLAUGHTERED. AND WHO
KNOWS HOW MANY OTHERS.

224
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,500
I'VE MADE MY CHOICE!

225
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,208
I WON'T WAVER. I WON'T,
I WON'T! I'VE MADE MY CHOICE.

226
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,125
- ( phone ringing )

227
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,791
- ANSWER.
- Ashley: IT'S ME.

228
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,208
WE'VE FOUND THEM.

229
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,416
I WANT YOU TO PROCEED
IMMEDIATELY TO THEIR LOCATION.

230
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,208
- UNDERSTOOD.
- DON'T FAIL ME.

231
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,458
- ( laughing ) THE GREAT THING
ABOUT HAVING LOTS OF MONEY

232
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,666
IS THE NEAT TOYS
YOU CAN BUY!

233
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,375
- DAMMIT. FOR A TWO
BIT EMBEZZLER

234
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,250
HE SURE IS MAKING
MY LIFE DIFFICULT.

235
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,333
YOU SURE LIKE TO RUN, DON'T YOU?

236
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,833
- YOU MIGHT AS WELL GIVE UP
BECAUSE YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME.

237
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,458
- ( loud crash )

238
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,666
- ( groaning )

239
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,416
- SORRY. I HOPE I DIDN'T
HURT YOU, SIR

240
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,000
- ( groaning )

241
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,125
- WELL, I SEE YOU MET SOLTY!

242
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,291
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

243
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,791
I WAS STANDING HERE
AND HE RAN INTO ME.

244
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,333
- ( laughs )

245
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,875
LET'S GO. WE'LL HAND THIS
JOKER OVER TO THE COPS

246
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,250
AND HAVE SOME DINNER.

247
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,875
- ALRIGHT!

248
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,333
- ( laughing )

249
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:25,208
AXELA WARRICK. WE'VE BEEN
AUTHORIZED TO USE DEADLY FORCE.

250
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,791
BUT BEFORE THAT,

251
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,791
THERE'S NO REASON WE CAN'T HAVE
OURSELVES A LITTLE FUN, RIGHT?

252
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:33,000
- YEAH. YOU JUST KEEP STILL,
OKAY, BABE? - WHY TAKE CHANCES?

253
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,416
PUT ONE THROUGH HER KNEE
SO SHE CAN'T MAKE A RUN FOR IT.

254
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,708
- HEH. GOOD IDEA.

255
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,208
- ( gunshots )

256
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,916
- ( men groaning )

257
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:51,041
- HUH! BUNCH OF CANDY ASSES!

258
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,875
- CELICA!

259
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
- I THINK WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR TASTE IN MEN.

260
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,000
WHERE'S INTEGRA?

261
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,750
- OH! THEY STORMED THE HIDE
OUT AND TRASHED EVERYTHING,

262
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,750
AND WE GOT SEPARATED.

263
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,125
CELICA, THAT SUIT, WHERE?

264
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,583
- WHAT? THIS THING? HEY!

265
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,000
WHOOPS. LOOKS LIKE
WE'VE GOT MORE COMPANY.

266
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,250
- GET OUT OF HERE, AXELA!
BEFORE YOU GET YOURSELF SHOT!

267
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,125
- BUT, HOW CAN YOU ...
- BEAT IT!

268
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,416
- BUT I...

269
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,750
- YOU'RE IN THE WAY HERE!
START MAKING TRACKS!

270
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I DON'T NEED ANY
DISTRACTIONS, OKAY?

271
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,250
I'LL BE FINE. JUST GO AHEAD
AND GET DINNER READY.

272
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,250
I'LL BE THERE TO JOIN YOU.
I PROMISE.

273
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,125
- ( gunshots )

274
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,041
- NOW, LET'S DO THIS, SHALL WE?

275
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,333
- ( muffled speech )

276
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,208
- WHAT IS IT, SOLTY?
- THAT'S GUNFIRE.

277
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,250
- ( groans )

278
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,041
- UH, OW!
- OH IT'S YOU!

279
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,166
- HUH?

280
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,666
- HEY, I KNOW YOU.

281
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,916
- ( gasps )

282
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,208
- YOU READY?
- UH, SURE.

283
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,875
- LET'S GO.
- RIGHT!

284
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,916
- AW, COME ON! YOU BIG
STRONG MEN DON'T WANNA GET

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,333
WIPED OUT BY A CUTE
LITTLE GIRL, DO YOU?

286
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,083
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? COME ON!

287
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,791
OH, HELLO.

288
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,875
- ( loud explosion )

289
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,875
- LOOK, I'LL BE FINE. JUST GO
AHEAD AND GET DINNER READY.

290
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,791
- ( crying )

291
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,166
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T
LARRY AND ANDY.

292
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,291
WHAT A SURPRISE.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TWO!

293
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,375
- WHERE IS HE,
WHERE'S THE OLD GUY?

294
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,125
- ROY? HE'S OUT ON
AN ASSIGNMENT RIGHT NOW.

295
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,000
- SO, WHEN'S HE COMING BACK?
- HARD TO SAY.

296
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,625
- GET HIM BACK IN
HERE RIGHT NOW!

297
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,416
- WHOA. WHAT'S YOUR DEAL?
- JUST RELAX. WILL YOU?

298
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,291
- BOYS. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

299
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,791
- NO SENSE WASTING AMMO ON
THOSE TIN SOLDIERS BACK THERE.

300
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,666
I'LL WAIT FOR MY REAL TARGET.

301
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,125
WELL, WELL, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

302
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,666
- Larry: WE WANT
TO KNOW IF IT'S TRUE.

303
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,500
- THAT ROSE IS STILL ALIVE.
AND WORKING FOR R.U.C. SECURITY!

304
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,166
- ( all gasp )

305
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,541
- HERE I THOUGHT
WE COULD GET ALONG.

306
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,833
- PLEASE GIVE IT UP, CELICA.
- MURDERER!

307
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,458
- WHAT ARE YOU...

308
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,708
- YOU'RE IN THIS WITH
THAT MASKED BASTARD. AREN'T YOU?

309
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,083
- LISTEN!

310
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,166
- HEY, YOU OKAY?

311
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,166
- I THINK I HEARD ROSE'S VOICE.

312
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,208
- HUH?

313
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,541
- ( car door opens )

314
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,458
- SOLTY! COME BACK HERE!

315
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:01,125
- EVERYTHING I LOVED IS RUINED.
ALL BECAUSE YOU SHOWED UP!

316
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,500
- THIS WON'T SOLVE
ANYTHING CELICA.

317
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,833
UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND THE
REST OF YOUR LIFE ON THE RUN.

318
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,166
- NOT ME. I'M DONE RUNNING.

319
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,041
- IS IT REVENGE YOU'RE AFTER?

320
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,458
- DAMN RIGHT I WANT REVENGE!
SILVIA'S DEAD!

321
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,000
- WAIT! YOU SAID YOU
HEARD ROSE'S VOICE?

322
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,708
- FROM UP THERE!

323
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:28,125
- YOU'RE WASTING BULLETS. THAT
GUN CAN'T PENETRATE THIS SUIT.

324
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,083
GIVE YOURSELF UP NOW
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

325
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,458
- NOT A CHANCE!

326
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,708
NOW TELL ME WHY WE WERE
SET UP TO TAKE THE FALL FOR

327
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,125
SILVIA'S MURDER BEFORE I PART
YOUR HAIR ON THE OTHER SIDE!

328
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,916
- WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS!

329
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,750
IF YOU'RE REALLY INNOCENT,
THEN YOU HAVE TO PROVE IT!

330
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,500
THE RIGHT WAY! IN COURT!

331
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,041
- I DON'T TRUST YOU.

332
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,375
- ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT NOW?

333
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,291
YOU THINK YOU CAN TRUST ME NOW?

334
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,666
- ROSE, I...
- WHAT?

335
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:11,458
- I'LL SEND THAT MASKED PRICK
TO HELL RIGHT AFTER YOU!

336
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,375
- ( gunshot )

337
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,458
- ( gasps )

338
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:35,666
- ( loud crash )

339
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,875
- IT CAN'T...
- IT IS HER.

340
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,500
- ( theme song playing )

341
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

342
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,166
- Solty: YOU'RE GOING
TO CATCH A COLD.

343
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,833
I...

344
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,958
NEXT TIME, "ALL TOGETHER."

345
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,166
WELCOME, EVERYBODY!
