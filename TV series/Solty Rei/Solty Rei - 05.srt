1
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,541
- Yuto: IN THE CITY
WHERE WE LIVE,

2
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,666
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE.

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,833
THE FIRST, ARE NATIVES,

4
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,916
PEOPLE WHOSE BODIES
ARE WHOLLY ORGANIC,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,291
FREE OF MECHANICAL ALTERATION.

6
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,791
OTHERS ARE CALLED RESEMBLE,

7
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,541
PEOPLE FITTED WITH
CYBERNETIC PARTS,

8
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,208
WHICH COMPLEMENT
THEIR BODILY FUNCTIONS,

9
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,083
OR GREATLY ENHANCE
THEIR CAPABILITIES.

10
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,583
NOW, A THIRD CATEGORY
HAS EMERGED.

11
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,250
A TOTALLY NEW TYPE OF BEING,

12
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,000
ONE THAT IS 100% CYBERNETIC,

13
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,833
A TECHNOLOGICAL MARVEL LONG
DREAMED OF BY MODERN SCIENTISTS,

14
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,208
BUT WHICH MANY BELIEVED
TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.

15
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,916
THE DREAM, HOWEVER,
HAS SOMEHOW BECOME A REALITY,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,750
AND FITTINGLY, IT HAS BEEN
GIVEN A NAME, GENUINE.

17
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,000
HAVING SAID THAT,

18
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,666
THIS HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS STORY.

19
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,541
- ( chuckles )

20
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,541
- ( gasps )
- ( alarms sounding )

21
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,208
- TIME FOR PLAN B.

22
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,166
GUESS I'LL HAVE TO HIDE IT
OVER THERE FOR NOW.

23
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:07,875
- OH, WOW! WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THE SIZE OF THIS BATHTUB.

24
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,375
- FOR THE FIFTIETH TIME,
IT'S AN INDOOR POOL.

25
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,625
- I CAN'T THINK OF A NICER
WAY TO SPEND A DAY OFF

26
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,125
THAN AT A PLACE LIKE THIS.

27
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,875
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

28
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,750
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU
DOING HERE, SILVIA?

29
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,833
- ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
WAIT AROUND 'TIL THEY CLOSE,

30
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,041
THEN THE PRIZE'LL BE ALL MINE.

31
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,583
- ( theme song playing )

32
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

33
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,166
- SOLTY! C'MON AND PLAY.

34
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,708
- ( gulping )

35
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,666
- ( exclaims ) UH, SOLTY?

36
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,208
- HEY, WILL SHE...

37
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,458
- NO. SHE'S PERFECTLY SAFE.

38
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,541
THERE'S NO CHANCE
SHE'LL RUST OR STAIN.

39
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,458
RESEMBLE TECHNOLOGY'S
COMPLETELY WATERPROOF.

40
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,041
- BUT IT'S HER FIRST TIME.

41
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,500
I WONDER IF WE SHOULD'VE
PUT HER IN THAT

42
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,208
RESEMBLE SWIMMING WORKSHOP?

43
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,541
- TRUE, BUT SHE'LL BE FINE.

44
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,000
- GOOD AFTERNOON!

45
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,541
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
ORDER ANYTHING ELSE?

46
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,250
I MUST ADMIT I DIDN'T
EXPECT TO SEE YOU HERE.

47
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,666
- Roy: YEAH, WHATEVER.

48
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,333
- Yuto: ROY, DO YOU KNOW
THIS GIRL?

49
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,666
- NOT A CLUE. PROBABLY FISHING
FOR A BETTER TIP OR SOMETHING.

50
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,125
- ( scoffs ) YOU'VE GOT
SOME NERVE.

51
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,208
- OKAY, I'D LIKE TO
PLACE AN ORDER.

52
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,916
- I CAN PUT UP WITH A LOT,

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,291
BUT THE ONE THING
I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT STAND

54
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,416
IS TO BE TOTALLY IGNORED.

55
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,333
- AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

56
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,208
- NO, BUT SHE IS.

57
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,166
- DON'T EVEN PLAY DUMB WITH ME.

58
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,083
- WRONG TABLE, SWEETHEART.

59
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,625
- YEAH, RIGHT, I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE HERE WITH SOLTY.

60
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,041
STILL FEEL LIKE PLAYING
GAMES NOW, HUH?

61
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,791
- ARE YOU OKAY?

62
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,416
- YEAH, I'M OKAY.

63
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,625
- ( sighs ) SOMEBODY
ORDER SOMETHING.

64
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,625
- LET ME SEE HERE.
I'D LIKE A COCONUT COCKTAIL.

65
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,541
- YEAH, OKAY.
ONE COCONUT JUICE THING AND...

66
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,666
I JUST HAVE TO SAY
ONE THING TO YOU, JERK.

67
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,083
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
INTERFERING WITH MY WORK.

68
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,291
YOU GOT THAT?

69
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,875
- INTERFERE WITH WHAT?
WAITING TABLES?

70
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,208
- WAFFLE ON ONE.
- YOU FINISHED?

71
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,250
- YEP, I THINK THAT'LL
ABOUT DO IT.

72
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,208
- HOW'D YOU GET IN?

73
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,875
- AS YOUR GUEST, OF COURSE.

74
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,791
- OH, YOU'RE GIVING ME
A HEADACHE.

75
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,000
- OH, STOP GETTING
SO WORKED UP.

76
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,708
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE
REALLY OUT ANYTHING.

77
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,250
AFTER ALL, YOU DID
WIN THE TICKETS.

78
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,250
- WAIT, HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

79
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,291
- WELL, YOU HAD FOUR TICKETS,

80
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,250
IT WOULD'VE BEEN AN AWFUL SHAME
IF YOU LET THEM GO TO WASTE.

81
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,833
- LEARN TO SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
- ( groaning )

82
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,625
- STOP IT.
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

83
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,833
- ( sighs ) A DAY OF R AND R
IS JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED.

84
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,208
TOO BAD INTEGRA HAD
TO WORK TODAY.

85
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,166
- ( sighs )

86
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,500
UGH, I REALLY NEED
TO GET A LIFE.

87
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,041
- ( phone ringing )

88
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,000
- HELLO?

89
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,250
SPECIAL SECURITY SECTION 7.

90
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,333
HMM?

91
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,708
( gasps )

92
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,208
- OH, WHATEVER.

93
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,291
I REALLY DON'T CARE IF
YOU GUYS ARE HERE OR NOT.

94
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,125
THERE'S NOTHING ANY OF YOU
CAN DO TO MUCK UP MISS ROSE'S

95
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,041
TOTALLY PERFECT CRIME.

96
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,541
- PERFECT CRIME?
YOU'RE ROSE ANDERSON?

97
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,375
- UH, YEAH. I AM!

98
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,000
- WHO GIVES A DAMN.

99
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,250
NOBODY HIRED ME TO PUT UP
WITH YOUR NONSENSE TODAY, KID.

100
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,041
SO, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SCRAMBLE.

101
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,458
- SHUT UP.
AND DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

102
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,416
I'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO
THAN KEEP YOU COMPANY, OLD MAN.

103
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,541
- HOLD IT. WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING WITH THAT?

104
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,958
- YOU CURIOUS?
- HARDLY.

105
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,083
- GOOD. I'LL TELL YOU.
- OOH.

106
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,708
- I'M SURPRISED HE
HASN'T GONE OFF.

107
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,875
THINK WE SHOULD WE WARN HER?

108
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,166
- NO, JUST DUCK.

109
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,750
- IT'S ALL RIGHT THERE
IN BLACK AND WHITE.

110
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,208
"AN EMERALD WORTH BILLIONS

111
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,083
STOLEN FROM THE
R.U.C. ART MUSEUM."

112
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,333
BUT THE BEST PART
ISN'T IN THE HEADLINES.

113
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,916
A SCOOP EVERY REPORTER
IN THIS CITY WOULD KILL

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,458
TO GET THEIR HANDS ON.

115
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,125
- Silvia: THE STOLEN EMERALD
IS HERE?

116
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,541
WHAT? ARE YOU CERTAIN?

117
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,750
- Integra: NO, BUT THERE IS
A HIGH PROBABILITY.

118
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,375
IT'S A LEVEL B ASSIGNMENT.

119
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,291
WE'VE BEEN ORDERED TO RECOVER
THE EMERALD AT ANY COST.

120
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,708
- BUT THIS WAS OUR FIRST
DAY OFF IN A LONG TIME.

121
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,583
- I UNDERSTAND, BUT THESE ARE
THE HAZARDS OF THE JOB.

122
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,458
NOW, STOP COMPLAINING
AND GET TO WORK. GOOD LUCK.

123
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,916
- IS THERE ANY OTHER...

124
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,208
- ( chuckles )

125
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,875
- YOU'RE NOT PULLING
OUR LEG, ARE YOU?

126
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,500
IT REALLY WAS YOU WHO
STOLE THE EMERALD LAST NIGHT?

127
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,041
- UH, WELL, DUH.

128
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,666
MISS ROSE, THE BRIGHT BLUE
METEOR OF HOPE STRIKES AGAIN.

129
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,291
- THE FACT THAT IT'S IN THE NEWS
PROVES THAT YOU FAILED.

130
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,916
I SEE A BRIGHT ORANGE JUMPSUIT
IN YOUR FUTURE.

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,791
- AND WHAT GOOD IS A STELLAR
PERFORMANCE WITHOUT COVERAGE?

132
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,750
THE STUPID NEWSPAPERS
HAVE DONE ME A FAVOR.

133
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,125
THEY'VE JUSTIFIED MY CAUSE.

134
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,458
I'M LIKE, THE PEOPLE'S NEW
CHAMPION, OR SOMETHING.

135
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,333
- OH YEAH, WE RECEIVED
A JOB REQUEST ON YOUR ROBBERY.

136
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,666
I THINK THAT WHOEVER
RECOVERS THE EMERALD

137
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,666
WILL RECEIVE A BOUNTY WORTH
TEN PERCENT OF ITS VALUE.

138
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,041
- TEN, HUH?
I'M PRETTY IMPRESSED.

139
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,166
- I'M NOT. IT'S PATHETIC.

140
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,791
WHAT ABOUT THE
WORTHINESS OF THE CAUSE?

141
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,000
IT'S LIKE ALL ABOUT
THE MONEY WITH YOU.

142
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,416
- JUST GO FOLD SOMETHING.

143
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,000
- SOME EGO. SHE CERTAINLY
HAS QUITE THE HIGH OPINION

144
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,125
OF HERSELF, DOESN'T SHE?

145
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,916
- WHAT GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,125
- THE COLD FACT IS YOU'RE JUST
AN ORDINARY THIEF.

147
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,666
BET YOUR PARENTS
ARE REAL PROUD.

148
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,041
- SURE WERE.
ECSTATIC, ACTUALLY.

149
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,750
IN FACT MY MOM AND DAD
WERE CAREER THIEVES

150
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,250
UNTIL THEY RETIRED
A FEW YEARS AGO.

151
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,666
- HI, ROSE.
WAIT, ARE YOU ROSE?

152
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,166
- YEAH, AND WARNING,
STAY OUT OF THIS ONE.

153
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,500
- WHAT?

154
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,541
- ALL RIGHT. LOOK, I KNOW
HOW USEFUL YOU CAN BE.

155
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,708
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
YOUR LATEST PERFORMANCE.

156
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,875
- ( screaming )

157
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,375
- SOMEDAY, IF YOU EVER GET
TIRED OF YOUR OLD MAN,

158
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,583
I'LL TURN YOU INTO
A MASTER THIEF.

159
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,583
SEE YOU.

160
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,708
- NA-NA-NA-NA.

161
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,041
I AM SUPPOSED TO
BE OFF WORK TODAY.

162
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,625
- GROW UP, CELICA.
WE HAVE A THIEF TO CATCH.

163
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,000
- ( all gasping )

164
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,041
- HEY, DID YOU SEE HER?
- WASN'T THAT...

165
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,000
- OH, YOU'VE GOTTA BE MENTAL.

166
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,000
WHY ON EARTH ARE YOU
HIDING WITH ME?

167
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,833
- WELL, I...

168
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,750
- I NEVER EXPECTED
THEM TO SHOW UP.

169
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,208
WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?

170
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,083
- ARE THEY FRIENDS OF YOURS?

171
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,958
- THEY'RE FROM R.U.C. SECURITY.
SPECIAL TASK FORCE.

172
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,458
THEY WORK BEHIND THE SCENES,

173
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,875
MOSTLY-TRACKING DOWN ONLY
THE MOST NOTORIOUS CRIMINALS.

174
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,250
YOU MIGHT SAY THEY'RE
THE R.U.C.'S HUNTERS.

175
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,375
AND THEY'RE VERY GOOD
AT THEIR JOB.

176
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,791
- OH, YEAH?

177
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,291
- PERSONALLY, I'VE NEVER HAD
A RUN-IN WITH THEM.

178
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,708
BUT BELIEVE ME,
THEY'RE THE ENEMY, SOLTY.

179
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,208
AND THEY DON'T LIKE ME.

180
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,291
LUCKILY, I ALREADY HAVE
WHAT I CAME HERE FOR.

181
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,666
EVEN IF THEIR OBJECTIVE
WAS TO DISRUPT MY PLAN,

182
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,708
THEY'RE TOO LATE.

183
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,666
I'M HOME FREE...

184
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,291
( gasps )

185
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,708
- THAT'S ODD.
THERE'S NOTHING COMING OUT.

186
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,916
- OH, NO.
I TOOK THE WRONG ONE.

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,791
- WHAT? YOU WANTED SALT?

188
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,375
- ( gasps ) WHAT TO DO?

189
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,083
THINK, ROSE. THIS CAN'T
FALL APART NOW.

190
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,625
- UH, ROSE.

191
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,000
- DON'T BOTHER ME.
I'M BUSY NOW.

192
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,083
- WHY DO YOU DO
THINGS LIKE THIS,

193
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,791
THINGS THAT GET YOU
INTO TROUBLE?

194
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,250
WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO STEAL STUFF?

195
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,375
- ( rattling )

196
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,833
- WHAT THE HELL.

197
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,041
IT'S LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING
INSIDE BLOCKING THE HOLES.

198
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,666
AND IT'S RATTLING.

199
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,708
- COULD BE THE LOST EMERALD.
THAT'S WHERE I'D HIDE IT.

200
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,500
- YEAH, RIGHT.

201
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,666
- TELL ME, SOLTY,

202
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,666
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THE UNDERGROUND CITY?

203
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,666
- UM, NO, WHY?

204
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,666
- WELL, YOU'RE LUCKY.

205
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,291
IT'S A CESSPOOL OF
TRASH AND BILE,

206
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:05,125
UNFIT FOR RATS,
LET ALONE HUMANS.

207
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,791
YET THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE ARE FORCED

208
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,041
TO CALL THIS WASTELAND HOME,

209
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,208
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

210
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,458
LAW MAKERS CALL
THEM INCOMPENTERS,

211
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,083
UNREGISTERED CITIZENS.

212
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,375
AS SUCH, THEY HAVE
NO ACCESS TO JOBS,

213
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,416
HEALTH CARE, OR EVEN SCHOOLS.

214
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,958
THE GOVERNMENT CHOOSES TO
PRETEND THEY DON'T EXIST.

215
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,541
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
THEY'RE NORMAL PEOPLE

216
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,958
WHO'VE BEEN DEALT A ROTTEN HAND

217
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,916
BY THOSE WHO SHOULD'VE
PROTECTED THEM.

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,583
THE POLICE DON'T PATROL
DOWN THERE,

219
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,916
SO IT'S BECOME A HAVEN
FOR CRIMINALS.

220
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,333
THOSE WHO TRY
TO GET REGISTERED

221
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,166
ARE TURNED AWAY BECAUSE
OF A STRICT POLICY,

222
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,375
WHICH CALLS FOR APPLICANTS
TO PAY A STIFF FEE

223
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,958
AND ATTAIN A GUARANTOR.

224
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,625
DON'T THOSE STUPID JERKS KNOW
IF WE COULD AFFORD THOSE THINGS,

225
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,875
WE WOULDN'T BE
LIVING IN FILTH?

226
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,416
WEIGH THEIR SUFFERING
AGAINST THE TENS OF BILLIONS

227
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
THIS STONE'LL GO FOR AND

228
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,916
YOU'LL SEE HOW LUDICROUS
OUR SYSTEM IS.

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,750
THAT MONEY COULD BETTER
THE QUALITY OF LIFE

230
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,625
FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

231
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,291
THAT IS WHY I STEAL.

232
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,250
BUT NOW, ALL HOPE IS LOST.

233
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,750
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

234
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,416
- NO, WAIT. SOLTY.

235
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,958
- EXCUSE ME.

236
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,666
- HEY, WAIT A SECOND.
I KNOW YOU.

237
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,125
- I NEED YOU TO GIVE ME
THAT SHAKER THING.

238
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,333
- THIS ONE?

239
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,750
YES!

240
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,291
- WHAT'S WRONG?

241
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,375
- I NEED IT.

242
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,458
'CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES
DEPEND ON WHAT'S INSIDE.

243
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,958
- IDIOT.

244
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,333
- YOU'RE TELLING ME PEOPLE NEED
THE PEPPER IN THIS THING.

245
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,666
- THAT'S ODD.
- PLEASE.

246
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,583
- THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN MY SALAD?

247
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,125
- YES.

248
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,875
- UH, ROY, SHOULDN'T
WE STOP HER?

249
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,125
- LET HER BE.

250
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,416
- LOOK, KID, THE GRINDER
BELONGS TO THIS CAFE.

251
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,583
IF YOU WERE TO TAKE IT,

252
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,125
THAT'S CALLED STEALING.
AT WHICH POINT,

253
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,541
ALL I COULD GIVE YOU IS A
RIDE TO THE POLICE STATION.

254
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,291
- I HAVE TO HAVE IT.

255
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,291
- PERSISTENT.

256
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,083
- PLEASE HELP ME.

257
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,583
I COULD SAVE SO MANY LIVES.

258
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,708
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT...

259
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,083
I NEED THE EMERALD
IN THAT SHAKER.

260
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,291
- ( grunting )

261
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,208
- YOU'RE...
YOU'RE ROSE ANDERSON.

262
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,208
- ( whistles )

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,041
- I'LL BE TAKING THIS ORDER
TO GO, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

264
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,541
- NO, YOU WON'T.
- ( screams )

265
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,458
- GET BACK HERE!

266
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,041
( grunting )

267
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,000
- IT'S YOU.

268
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,583
- I WILL NOT LET YOU STOP HER.

269
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,250
- COME TO MOMMA!

270
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,000
- HOPE THIS DOES THE TRICK.

271
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,416
- HUH?

272
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,750
( grunting )

273
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,208
- THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL.

274
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,083
ROY, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

275
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,333
- TAKE A NAP.

276
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,416
- THEY'LL DESTROY
THE WHOLE COMPLEX.

277
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,083
MIRANDA MUST BE GOING OUT OF
HER MIND LOOKING FOR HELP.

278
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,291
- ( sighs )

279
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,625
I ALMOST FEEL GUILTY,

280
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,083
THE TWO OF US BEING IN
HERE AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

281
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,083
- DON'T EVEN SWEAT IT, MOM.
ROY SAID TO IGNORE THEM.

282
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,916
AND BESIDES KEEP YOUR MIND
ON THE PRIZE.

283
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,333
FIRST ONE TO LEAVE HERE
BUYS THE ICE CREAM.

284
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,083
- OKAY, OKAY.

285
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,125
- ( yelling )

286
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,333
- NO, NO. SHE IS NOT
GONNA MESS UP MY DAY OFF.

287
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,250
- THERE'S AN INCOMING MESSAGE
FROM HEADQUARTERS.

288
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,166
- EARPLUGS.
I CAN'T HEAR A THING.

289
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,750
- SEEMS THEY'RE
WILLING TO PAY A BONUS

290
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,000
TO WHOEVER RECOVERS
THE EMERALD FIRST.

291
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,916
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

292
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,333
THINK I'LL GET MY CHECK
BEFORE THE MALL CLOSES?

293
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,375
- WHAT PEOPLE DO FOR MONEY.

294
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,583
- ( screaming )

295
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,708
- I GOT IT!

296
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,208
STOP IT. THAT TICKLES.
LET GO.

297
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:27,958
( gasps )

298
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,000
- THINK AGAIN, GIRL.

299
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,541
- ( gasping )

300
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,083
- JUST A LITTLE FARTHER.

301
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,750
- NOT SO FAST.

302
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,291
- ( exclaims )

303
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,791
- SO LONG.

304
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,125
- ( screaming )

305
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,166
- LITTLE GIRL, IF YOU WANNA
SEE YOUR NEXT BIRTHDAY,

306
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,166
YOU'LL GIVE THAT TO ME
RIGHT NOW.

307
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,375
- HELP!

308
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,958
- IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW. NO ONE'S
GONNA HURT YOU. PROMISE.

309
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,625
- THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
WHO NEED THAT MORE THAN US

310
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,291
SO WILL YOU HELP ME RETURN IT?

311
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,416
- ( giggles )

312
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,250
OKAY!

313
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,041
- Both: JUST LIKE THAT?

314
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,000
- ( in singsong tone )
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

315
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,458
( chuckles )

316
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,833
BUT, NOW THAT I HAVE IT,
WHO SHOULD I TAKE IT TO?

317
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,125
- YOU DON'T HAVE IT. SEE?

318
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,541
( laughs )

319
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,833
( in singsong tone ) I GET
THE BONUS. I GET THE BONUS.

320
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,833
- NO, WAIT.
THAT CAN SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES.

321
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,666
- WHAT IS IT WITH THIS
FREAKING GIRL? AXELA, CATCH.

322
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,333
- ( exclaims )

323
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,583
- HAND IT OVER!

324
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,583
- WHAT... WHO...
YOU TAKE IT.

325
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,583
- THAT'S MINE!

326
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,041
- NO, MINE!

327
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,833
- GIVE IT TO ME, NOW!

328
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,833
- YUTO, OVER HERE.

329
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:06,333
- SOLTY. I KNOW SHE'S
COMPLETELY CYBERNETIC.

330
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,625
YET, HER BODY LOOKS
HUMAN IN EVERY WAY.

331
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,666
NOT ONE SEAM.
JUST PURE, INNOCENT PERFECTION.

332
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,375
AUTONOMOUS AI!

333
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,916
AND ABOVE ALL, THERE'S HER
SWEET, UNASSUMING SMILE.

334
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,750
AM I... AM I IN LOVE?

335
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,416
HERE, SOLTY. I LOVE YOU. CATCH!

336
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,500
( exclaims )
I NEVER COULD PITCH.

337
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,708
- IDIOT.

338
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,375
- ( all gasping )

339
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,416
- Ringmaster: WELCOME TO THE
AMAZING WATER CIRCUS.

340
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,375
WE PROUDLY PRESENT THE
WORLD-FAMOUS TRAPEZE DUO,

341
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,500
THE GOLDEN FLYERS,

342
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,750
LAYLE OLAH AND FURIK VON SHITEN.

343
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,166
TONIGHT, THEY SOAR ABOVE
THE WATER, WITH NO NET.

344
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,208
- MOVE!
- ( exclaims ) SECURITY.

345
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,500
- PARDON ME.
- WHAT IS THIS?

346
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,166
- Both: I'LL GET IT THIS TIME!

347
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,000
- OH, GREAT.

348
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,625
- ( screaming )

349
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,333
- Both: GOT IT!

350
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,333
- THAT PRIZE MONEY'S MINE.

351
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,583
- CAREFUL, YOU'RE STRETCHING IT.
THAT'S MY FAVORITE SWIMSUIT.

352
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,458
- ( crowd cheering )

353
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,875
- HEY, WATCH IT, WILL YOU?

354
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,708
- SORRY. MY BAD.

355
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,041
- ( gasps )

356
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,958
- THIS TIME, NOTHING'LL STOP ME.

357
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,666
- WAIT.

358
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,791
- ( gasps )

359
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,666
- SOLTY!

360
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,916
- ( screams )

361
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,250
- SHE'S SUICIDAL.

362
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,125
- AXELA, HURRY.
TURN OFF THE POWER.

363
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,125
- I'M WORKING AS FAST AS I CAN.

364
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,083
- JUST A LITTLE CLOSER.

365
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,000
( gasps )

366
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,791
- SOLTY!

367
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,541
- ( crowd cheering )

368
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,208
- Ringmaster: WATERTASTIC.

369
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,375
- I TRIED MY BEST.

370
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,500
- WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU
THINKING UP THERE?

371
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,875
YOU WERE ALMOST KILLED
FOR A ROCK.

372
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,875
- I'M SO SORRY.

373
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,625
I TRIED FOR MORE,
BUT THIS IS ALL I COULD GET.

374
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:00,333
YOU COULD'VE SAVED SO MANY
PEOPLE IF IT WASN'T FOR ME.

375
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,625
( crying )

376
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,208
CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

377
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,416
- SILLY GIRL. I WAS ONLY
HALF-SERIOUS, YOU KNOW.

378
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,125
ACTUALLY, IT'S REALLY NOT
ALL THAT BAD DOWN BELOW.

379
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,125
IN FACT, A LOT OF THE PEOPLE
LIVING THERE ARE PRETTY HAPPY.

380
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,083
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

381
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,875
- YEAH, I PROMISE.

382
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,875
- ( chuckles ) THEN THERE'S
NOTHING TO FORGIVE.

383
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,500
- I REALLY LIKE YOU.

384
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,791
YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER
BECOMING A THIEF, SOLTY.

385
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,208
- HEY, DON'T LISTEN TO HER.
LET'S GO HOME.

386
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,416
- OKAY.

387
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,875
- OH, WHAT A WASTE. I NEED A
DAY OFF FROM THIS DAY OFF.

388
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,375
I'M BEAT.

389
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,833
- WELL, IF NOTHING ELSE
COMES OUT OF THIS,

390
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,083
I'M APPREHENDING ROSE ANDERSON.

391
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,875
- I'LL BE WAITING FOR
YOUR ANSWER. SEE YOU, GIRL!

392
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,375
- COME BACK HERE!

393
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,541
- ( chuckles )

394
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,000
- YOU'RE MINE, ROSE ANDERSON!

395
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:21,208
- ( sighs ) LET'S GO. MY EARS
CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE OF THIS.

396
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:30,000
- REGARDING THE EMERALD
STOLEN FROM THE R.U.C. MUSEUM,

397
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,416
I REGRET TO INFORM YOU

398
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,791
THAT OUR ASSIGNMENT
WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.

399
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,666
SORRY, SIR.
WE FAILED TO RETRIEVE IT.

400
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,875
- YOUR APOLOGY IS
UNNECESSARY, INTEGRA.

401
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,791
THE MISSION WAS OF LITTLE
INTEREST TO ME, ANYWAY.

402
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:47,125
TO BE HONEST, WE WERE SIMPLY
DOING A FAVOR FOR SECTION 1.

403
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,041
HOWEVER,

404
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,000
YOUR FAILURE HAS BROUGHT
SOMETHING FAR MORE INTRIGUING

405
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,541
TO MY ATTENTION.

406
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,000
- ( theme song playing )

407
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

408
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,625
- Solty: ROY KEEPS SEARCHING,

409
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,750
ALWAYS SEARCHING FOR
SOMETHING HE LOST.

410
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,125
NEXT TIME,"BELOVED DAUGHTER."

411
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,000
I HOPE HE FINDS WHAT
HE'S LOOKING FOR SOON.
