95
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,166

103
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,666
TO BE OUT IN PUBLIC LIKE THIS?

104
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,666
- I KNOW, BUT I FELT SO SORRY
FOR HER LOOKING LIKE THAT.

105
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,291
POOR THING.

106
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,833
MY CLOTHES ARE WAY TOO BIG FOR
HER, AND YOURS ARE TOO SMALL.

107
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:25,458
- I STILL THINK WE SHOULD
GO HOME. RIGHT, ROY?

108
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,000
- ALL THE SAME TO ME.

109

111
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,375
YOU'RE SO MUCH PRETTIER
IN PERSON.

112
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,666
- THANKS, THAT'S
VERY KIND OF YOU.

113
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,666
- HEY, I THOUGHT
WE CAME HERE TO SHOP.

114
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,375
- OH, YES, RIGHT. ( chuckles )
WELL, I GUESS I'LL BE GOING NOW.

115
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,541
IT WAS... IT WAS NICE
CHATTING WITH YOU!

116
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,291
- ( gasps )
- OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

117
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,791

LIKE A LITTLE KID.

118
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,375
- THEN HOW ABOUT THIS?
- TOO FLASHY.

119
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,666
- OOH! THIS!
- TOO LAME.

120
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,083
- WHICH OF THESE DO YOU THINK
IS CUTER?

121
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,041
ROY?

122
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,875
WHICH DO YOU LIKE BETTER,
THIS ONE? OR THIS ONE?

123
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,750
- DON'T ASK ME.

124
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,916
- THEN BETWEEN THIS ONE
OR THIS ONE?

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,833
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.
- THIS, OR THIS?

126
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:31,166
- DON'T CARE.
- OKAY. THIS ONE...

127
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,916
- IT'S FINE.
SURE, WHATEVER, I LOVE IT.

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
- Kasha: REALLY?
- Miranda: MM, I DON'T KNOW.

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,750
- IT'S KIND OF DORKY, HONESTLY.

130
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,583
- I'M SURE WE COULD FIND
SOMETHING A BIT MORE FLATTERING.

131
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,833
- I LIKE IT.
THIS IS THE ONE I WANT.

132
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,916
- YOU'RE SURE?

133
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,916
- YOU HEARD HER.
THIS IS THE ONE.

134
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,875
- ( giggles )

135
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,625
- SO WHAT'RE YOU TRYIN' TO PULL?

136
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,666
WHY DID YOU BREAK INTO MY PLACE?

137
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,083
I THOUGHT I SPELLED IT OUT
PRETTY CLEAR.

138
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,583
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOU.

139
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,458
- UM, I, UH...

140
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:22,000
I REALLY DO LOVE
THESE NEW CLOTHES. I DO!

141
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,708
I NEVER, EVER
WANNA TAKE THEM OFF!

142
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,291
- ( sighs )

143
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,583
- HEY! I GOT US SOME LUNCH!
- OH, COMING!

144
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,083
- SO, ARE YOU HAVING FUN, ROY?

145
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,750
- YEAH.

146
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,500
AND JUST LOOK AT THE GIRLS,
GETTING ALONG SO WELL.

147
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,833
- YOU'VE NEVER EATEN A HAMBURGER
BEFORE? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,500
WHAT ARE YOU, LIKE,
FROM OUTER SPACE?

149
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,916
JUST WATCH ME, I GUESS, AND

151
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,833
SO YOU CAN GET YOUR
MOUTH AROUND IT.

152
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,958
THEN GRAB HOLD,
OPEN WIDE, AND...

153
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,416
( muffled ) SEE? IT'S EASY!

154
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,208
- SUCH A CUTE GIRL, ISN'T SHE?

155
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,833
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK SO?

156
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,041
- NO, I DO NOT.

157
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,958
- ( laughs )

158
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:29,541
- HEY, I THINK YOU MISSED A
SPOT! YOU NEED A NAPKIN?

159
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,083
HAVE YOU EVER USED
A NAPKIN BEFORE?

160
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,375
- GET DOWN!

161
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,375
- ( screaming )

162
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,125
- NO!

163
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,958
- HEY! YOU OKAY?

164
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,000
- I THINK SO, BUT S-SHE...
SHE TRIED TO SAVE ME.

165
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,833
- HEY, GIRL!

166
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,000
- THAT HURT.

167
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,041
- KASHA!
- MIRANDA!

168
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,041
STAY HERE AND
KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

169
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,125
- RIGHT. I GOT IT.

170
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,750
- WHERE IS HE?

171
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,083
COME ON, WHERE'S HE
SHOOTING FROM?

172
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,166
- OVER THERE.

173
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,541
- ( gun cocking )

174
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,916
- WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.

175
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,458
MUST BE A RES OR SOMETHIN'.

176
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,166
- WAIT. UH, OKAY. HE'S GONE.

177
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,791
- THINK I FOUND HER.
- GOOD. CONFIRM.

178
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,791
- I'M POSITIVE. THE COMPUTER
TURNED UP A HIT ON OUR SUSPECT

179
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,583
FROM ONE OF THE CITY'S
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS.

180
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,875
- AN 89% MATCH ON HER FEATURES?

181
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,458
DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER
THAN THAT.

182
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,958
- THAT'S HER.
THAT'S GOTTA BE HER.

183
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,041
- Integra: LET'S GO.

184
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,875
- Officer: OH, I SEE.

185
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:06,125
- SO YOU SAY SOMEONE SHOT AT YOU
YESTERDAY, TOO. INTERESTING.

186
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,916
- YEAH, IT'S JUST
ATTEMPTED MURDER.

187
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,833
NOTHIN' TO GET
WORKED UP OVER!

188
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,500
- CALM DOWN, KASHA, IT'S OKAY.

189
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,625
- SAY, I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE
OFF THE SUBJECT HERE,

190
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,416
BUT DIDN'T I SEE YOU ON TV?

191
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,583
- OH, UH, YES.

192
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,000
- WELL, YOU SEEM
LIKE A SMART LADY.

193
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,625
I MEAN, IF SOMEONE
REALLY TRIED TO KILL YOU,

194
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,541
WHY DIDN'T YOU REPORT IT
TO THE POLICE?

195
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,000
- WE DID! YESTERDAY!

196
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,500
BUT THERE'S NO RECORD
OF A REPORT. SEE WE USUALLY...

197
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:30,958
- I'M TELLIN' YOU, WE DID!
JEEZ! WHAT IS WITH YOU PEOPLE?

198
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,625
- KASHA, PLEASE.
- MOM, I'M...

199
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,750
- OFFICER, ARE...

200
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,208
- EXCUSE ME, BUT I'M
IN THE MIDDLE OF

201
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,750
TAKING A STATEMENT HERE.

202
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,458
IF YOU NEED TO SPEAK WITH
ANY OF THESE PEOPLE,

203
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,625
I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO WAIT OUTSIDE FOR...

204
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,000
OH! I-I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE...

205
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,458
MY MISTAKE, MA'AM!

206
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,291
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT, OFFICER.
AT EASE. WE WON'T BE LONG.

207
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,500
WE JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS
WE'D LIKE TO ASK OF THEM.

208
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,041
- I SHOULD WARN YOU,

209
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,875
TWO ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN
MADE ON THIS WOMAN'S LIFE

210
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,458
IN THE LAST TWO DAYS.

211
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,958
SO JUST TO MAKE YOU AWARE
OF THE DANGER.

212
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,458
- THANK YOU, OFFICER.
YOUR CONCERN IS DULY NOTED.

213
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,166
WE'LL SEND FOR YOU
IF WE NEED YOU.

214
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,625
- UH, YES, MA'AM! UNDERSTOOD!

215
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,291
I'LL BE IN THE HALL
BY THE VENDING MACHINE.

216
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,958
- I AM INTEGRA MARTEL
FROM R.U.C. SECURITY,

217
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,000
AND WITH ME
IS OFFICER SILVIA BAN.

218
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,541
- HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO...

219
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,833
- WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT.

220
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,041
UNDER THE AUTHORITY
GRANTED US BY R.U.C.,

221
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,875
AND IN THE INTEREST OF
COMPANY SECURITY,

222
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,291
WE'RE DETAINING THIS
GIRL ON SUSPICION

223
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,958
OF INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE.

224
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,291
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

225
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,791
- IN ANY CASE, WE'RE LEAVING.

226
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,083
- WAIT, PLEASE!

227
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,708
WON'T YOU AT LEAST TELL US
WHAT IT IS YOU THINK SHE'S DONE?

228
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,958
- THIS IS A PHOTO
TAKEN OF THE INTRUDER,

229
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,416
SEEN ENTERING ONE OF
OUR COMPANY'S MOST

230
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,833
HIGH-LEVEL SECURITY AREAS.

231
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,291
WE RAN THIS IMAGE
THROUGH A DETAILED ANALYSIS,

232
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,625
HOPING TO NARROW DOWN
THE LIST OF POSSIBLE SUSPECTS.

233
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,500
INITIALLY, OUR COMPUTERS
WERE UNABLE TO GENERATE

234
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,000
ANY POSITIVE MATCHES
AMONG REGISTERED CITIZENS

235
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,083
OR KNOWN CRIMINALS.

236
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,666
- SO SHE'S AN
UNREGISTERED CITIZEN?

237
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,125
- TODAY, HOWEVER,
OUR SEARCH HIT ON A PHOTO

238
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,791
TAKEN BY ONE OF OUR
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

239
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,250
OUTSIDE A DEPARTMENT STORE.

240
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,333
I'M SURE YOU CAN SEE
THE RESEMBLANCE FOR YOURSELF.

241
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,083
OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 89% MATCH.

242
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:21,208
MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR US
TO BRING HER IN FOR QUESTIONING.

243
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,916
SO, MISS MAVERICK,
ARE YOU SATISFIED?

244
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,333
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

245
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,458
- BUT, UH...
- WAS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

246
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,791
- MAY I ASK YOU
WHEN THIS ALLEGEDLY HAPPENED?

247
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,208
- IF YOUR INTENT IS TO
SUPPLY HER WITH AN ALIBI,

248
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,791
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

249
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,125
WE KNOW BETTER, MS. MAVERICK.

250
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,166
AND AS I EXPLAINED, THE R.U.C.
COMPUTERS CONFIRMED THE MATCH.

251
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,916
THIS EVIDENCE ALONE IS
MORE THAN SUFFICIENT

252
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,750
TO SECURE A CONVICTION.

253
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,833
- BUT, MOM...

254
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,000
- ROY, PLEASE.

255
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,208
HELP ME, ROY.

256
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,625
- THAT'LL BE ALL.
THE REST OF YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

257
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:04,083
- COME ON.
- NO. NO!

258
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,750
- I SAID MOVE IT!
- I DON'T WANT TO!

259
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,083
- I'M WARNING YOU...

260
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,958
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SIR?

261
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,541
- INTERFERING WITH
A SECURITY OFFICER

262
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,958
IS A HIGHLY PUNISHABLE OFFENSE!

263
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,291
- SHE'S JUST A KID.

264
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,333
HOW ABOUT YOU GO A
LITTLE EASY ON HER?

265
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,666
- ROY.

266
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,416
- SIR, YOU WILL TAKE YOUR HANDS
OFF ME RIGHT NOW.

267
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,666
- ( grunts )
- NO, DON'T!

268
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,500
- DAMN, BRAT!

269
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,333
MAKE ONE MOVE AND I WILL
END YOU! ARE WE CLEAR?

270
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,458
- STOP, SILVIA. THAT'S ENOUGH.

271
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,666
- ( alarm blaring )

272
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,583
- Kasha: WHAT'S THAT?
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT!

273
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,291
BUT EVERYONE NEEDS TO
EVACUATE THE BUILDING RIGHT NOW!

274
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,000
THERE'S A FIRE
ON THE THIRD FLOOR!

275
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,958
- A FIRE?
- COME ON, LET'S MOVE!

276
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,500
- HEY, THAT'S THE MAN!

277
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,791
ROY, HE'S THE ONE
WHO TRIED TO SHOOT US!

278
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,375
- HOW DID SHE...

279
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,333
- SHE CAUGHT THE BULLET
WITH HER BARE HAND!

280
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,833
- ( alarm stops )

281
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,416
- HE'S ONE of NEUMANN'S BOYS.

282
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,333
- YOU MEAN HE'S FROM
ANOTHER AGENCY?

283
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,791
THEY WERE TRYING TO KILL MOM?
- YEAH. LOOKS THAT WAY.

284
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,791
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- IT'S NOT HER.

285
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,125
WE MADE A MISTAKE!

286
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,250
- ( phone beeping)
- THIS BETTER BE IMPORTANT.

287
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,875
- Celica: I, UH, I HAVE
SOMETHING HERE.

288
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,666
SORRY, IT CAN'T WAIT.

289
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,333
WE RAN SOME
FURTHER IMAGE ANALYSIS,

290
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,125
AND THE COMPUTER HAS
CONFIRMED THAT YOUR SUSPECT

291
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,458
DOES NOT MATCH THE INTRUDER.

292
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,500
I REPEAT. YOUR SUSPECT DOES NOT
MATCH THE INTRUDER!

293
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,250
- OH, AND I'LL HAVE
A TALK WITH AXELA

294
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,791
ABOUT BEING MORE CAREFUL!

295
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,291
- BUT IT WASN'T ME, IT WAS
A PROCESSING ERROR! I SWEAR!

296
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,125
- UH-HUH, LIKELY STORY.
BLAME IT ON THE EQUIPMENT!

297
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,666
- SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

298
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,875
THE GIRL HAS BEEN CLEARED
OF ANY AND ALL CHARGES.

299
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,916
- DID I MISS SOMETHING?
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

300
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,916
- LIKE I SAID,
YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

301
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,541
NOW THEN, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
WE'LL BE DOING THE SAME.

302
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,750
BUT FOR YOUR OWN GOOD,
I WOULD REMIND YOU

303
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,291
THAT SHE IS STILL
AN UNREGISTERED CITIZEN.

304
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,875
UNLESS YOU INTEND TO
ASSUME LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP,

305
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,041
THE LAW STIPULATES THAT
YOU MUST TURN HER OVER

306
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,333
