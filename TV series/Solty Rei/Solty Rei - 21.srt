1
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,916
- Computerized voice: C.R.W.
START UP VOLTAGE IS CONFIRMED.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,166
READY TO INITIATE
NEURAL INTERFACE.

3
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,125
AWAITING YOUR NEXT ORDER.

4
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,458
- ENGAGE.
- ACKNOWLEDGED.

5
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,208
- Yuto: ROY! MIRANDA!

6
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,750
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT'S GOING
DOWN AT THE R.U.C. BUILDING?

7
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,875
- LOOKS LIKE THERE
WAS SOME KIND OF ACCIDENT.

8
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,208
- ACCIDENT?

9
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,916
- YEAH. WAIT, WHO'S THAT GUY
AND WHAT'S HE DOING?

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,291
- I'LL FILL YOU IN LATER.

11
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,000
- I GUESS YOU GOT TIRED
OF BEING WATCHED, HUH, BRO?

12
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,166
THE SURVEILLANCE TEAM IS
GONE. I FIGURED YOU DID IT.

13
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,208
- YOU DID TAKE THEM
OUT, DIDN'T YOU?

14
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,666
- IT WASN'T ME.

15
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,000
- AH. SORRY, I DIDN'T TELL
YOU BUT I SAW INTEGRA.

16
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,541
SHE WAS JUST HERE.

17
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,583
- ( gasps )

18
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,625
THERE ARE DOZENS OF THEM.
WE GOT TO MOVE.

19
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,000
- ( all gasp )

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,875
- ( gunshots )

21
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,291
- ( theme song playing )

22
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

23
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,333
- CAPTAIN.
- HMM?

24
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,333
- SIR, WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS
BUILDING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM,

25
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,125
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF THEM.
IT'S LIKE THEY VANISHED.

26
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,458
- THEN SEARCH AGAIN. THERE WAS
NO WAY FOR THEM TO GET OUT.

27
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,583
- SIR.

28
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:36,166
- DAMN. WHERE THE HELL
CAN THEY BE HIDING?

29
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,375
- Andy: DAMN IT. WE DIDN'T
EVEN GET TO SIT DOWN

30
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,083
AND IT'S BACK TO THE SEWERS.

31
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,666
- Larry: GIVE IT A REST.

32
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,000
- SOLTY'S GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT, ISN'T SHE ROY?

33
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,791
- I HOPE SO. JOSEPH.

34
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,791
- YOU ARE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO FIX HER, RIGHT?

35
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,000
- YEP.

36
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,208
- UH, WHERE YOU
TAKING US, GRAMPS?

37
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,958
- JUST FOLLOW ME, KIDDO.

38
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,041
- ARGH, I AM SO SICK
OF YOU, OLD GUYS.

39
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,958
- SO, WERE YOU SERIOUS WHEN
YOU SAID OUR ANCESTORS

40
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,541
MOVED TO THIS PLANET?

41
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,708
- I KNOW IT MUST BE HARD
FOR YOU TO BELIEVE,

42
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,000
BUT, IT'S THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH.

43
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,500
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

44
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:26,041
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND THE
EVIDENCE EVERYWHERE IN THE CITY.

45
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,291
- YOUNG LADY, DO YOU KNOW
HOW THIS CITY WAS FOUNDED?

46
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,541
- OH, I . WELL, UH...

47
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,666
- HE MEANS KASHA.

48
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,250
- WELL, ONE TIME
IN HISTORY CLASS,

49
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,333
MY TEACHER TOLD US THAT OUR
ANCESTORS CAME TO THIS LAND FROM

50
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,791
ANOTHER CITY A LONG TIME
AGO AND BUILT THIS ONE.

51
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,416
- YOUR TEACHER TOLD YOU, EH?
- MMM-HMM.

52
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,958
- AND JUST WHERE IS THIS CITY

53
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,416
OUR ANCESTORS WERE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE COME FROM?

54
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,750
- UH...
- WHAT'S IT CALLED?

55
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,208
HOW COME WE NEVER
HEAR ABOUT IT, ANYMORE?

56
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,625
- I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVEN'T LEARNED THAT YET.

57
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,958
- RIGHT AND YOU
NEVER WILL, EITHER.

58
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,791
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EXIST.

59
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,000
- WHAT?

60
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,875
- THINK ABOUT THIS
UNDERGROUND CITY HERE.

61
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,666
IF OUR ANCESTORS
CAME FROM

62
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,041
SOME PLACE ELSE ON THIS PLANET,

63
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,125
WHY WOULD THEY BUILD
A PLACE LIKE THIS?

64
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,208
WHAT USE COULD THEY
POSSIBLY HAVE HAD FOR A CITY

65
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,583
BUILT UNDER THE EARTH?

66
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,958
- UH, MAYBE THEY BUILT IT

67
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,625
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES
FROM SOMETHING?

68
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:18,166
- SUCH AS.
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.

69
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,375
- MAYBE IT'LL MAKE SENSE

70
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,958
IF YOU TRY THINKING
ABOUT IT LIKE THIS.

71
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,375
HUMAN BEINGS NEED
AIR TO BREATHE.

72
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,166
WHEN PEOPLE FIRST
ARRIVED ON THIS PLANET,

73
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,208
IT HAD NO VIABLE ATMOSPHERE.

74
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,250
SO, THEY NEEDED A
SECURE PLACE TO LIVE

75
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,666
UNTIL ONE COULD BE ESTABLISHED.

76
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,041
THE UNDERGROUND
CITY IS THAT PLACE.

77
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,791
ONCE, THE AURORA
SHELL WAS ERECTED,

78
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,583
AND THE ATMOSPHERE
WAS STABILIZED,

79
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:42,083
THE PEOPLE MOVED BACK
TO THE SURFACE.

80
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,541
AS MORE AND MORE FOLKS LEFT FOR
THE SUNLIGHT AND OPEN SPACES,

81
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,791
THE UNDERGROUND
CITY WAS DISCARDED,

82
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,458
AND IT'S ORIGINAL
PURPOSE WAS FORGOTTEN.

83
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,916
- I'LL BUY IT,
BUT ONLY UP TO A POINT.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,375
- BUT WHAT GOOD
DOES THIS DO US NOW?

85
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,916
THE ENTIRE UNDERGROUND CITY

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,041
WAS BUILT BY CANNIBALIZING
THE TECHNOLOGY

87
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,541
OF THE ORIGINAL SHIP
THE COLONISTS LANDED IN.

88
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,958
- ( gasping )

89
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,291
- THIS CHAMBER WAS ACTUALLY
A COMPLETE SECTION

90
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,958
OF THE ORIGINAL SHIP.

91
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,750
- WHOA!

92
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,291
- Andy: AND I THOUGHT
I KNEW THE UNDERGROUND.

93
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,791
- YOU THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO FIX HER WITH THIS STUFF?

94
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,541
- THIS EQUIPMENT
WAS ORIGINALLY USED

95
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,958
TO REPAIR THE SHIP'S COMPONENTS

96
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,125
AND PARALLEL
PROCESSING CIRCUITS.

97
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,916
SOLTY'S SYSTEMS ARE SO COMPLEX,

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,583
THEY CAN ONLY BE REPAIRED
BY THE SAME TECHNOLOGY.

99
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,000
- DID YOU SAY THE
SAME TECHNOLOGY?

100
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,750
- YES, SIR. SOLTY WAS
CONSTRUCTED USING THE SAME

101
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,416
A.I. TECHNOLOGY THAT
WAS USED TO BUILD THIS SHIP.

102
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
- WHOA.

103
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,125
- Girl: HEY, LADY.

104
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,791
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

105
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,750
- HUH? OH, NO, NOTHING,
I'M FINE. THANKS, ANYWAY.

106
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,750
- THAT'S GOOD. I'M GLAD.

107
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,125
- YOU BE CAREFUL NOW, OKAY?
- OKAY.

108
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,375
- IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE MADE A FRIEND.

109
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,916
YOU KNOW, THAT LITTLE GIRL
WILL NEVER HAVE A HOME

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,666
WHERE THE SUN SHINES, BECAUSE
SHE'S AN UNREGISTERED CITIZEN.

111
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,291
SHE'LL NEVER HAVE AN
EDUCATION OR A DECENT JOB.

112
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,666
NONE OF THESE KIDS WILL EVER
HAVE ANY OF THE BENEFITS

113
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,291
YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED. ROSE AND
ANDY AND I HAVE SPENT OUR LIVES

114
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,208
FIGHTING FOR THESE KIDS'
FUTURES. BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE

115
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,666
A FORMER R.U.C. EMPLOYEE
CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

116
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,208
- YOU'RE MISTAKEN. YOU SEE,
I USED TO BE ONE OF THEM.

117
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,583
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.
BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT,

118
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,375
AND IT'S UP TO ME TO
SEE THAT MY FRIENDS

119
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,625
GET THE JUSTICE THEY DESERVE.

120
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,250
- Reporter: THERE HAVE BEEN
FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS,

121
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,750
IN THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION
OF THE R.U.C. MURDER CASE.

122
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,833
ONE OF THE SUSPECTS,
INTEGRA MARTEL,

123
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,208
WAS ARRESTED YESTERDAY,

124
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,958
AFTER FORCING HER WAY
INTO THE R.U.C. BUILDING.

125
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,625
FOLLOWING A VIOLENT STRUGGLE
WITH SECURITY PERSONNEL,

126
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,166
MARTEL WAS CRITICALLY WOUNDED

127
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,375
AND HAS BEEN PLACED IN A
SECURE INTENSIVE CARE FACILITY.

128
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,291
FUGITIVE, AXELA WARRICK,
REMAINS AT LARGE,

129
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,125
AND AUTHORITIES HAVE ISSUED
ARREST WARRANTS,

130
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,833
FOR THE FOLLOWING
FIVE INDIVIDUALS

131
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,458
--SUSPECTED AS HER ACCOMPLICES.
- ( Miranda gasps )

132
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:41,000
- OH, GREAT. NOW, THE COPS
ARE AFTER US AS WELL

133
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,375
- I'M SCARED.

134
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,458
- IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT,
HONEY, DON'T WORRY.

135
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,958
- OKAY JOSEPH.

136
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,916
WHAT'S YOUR FRIEND, LYNX,
TRYING TO GAIN BY ALL OF THIS?

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,333
AND HOW MUCH
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

138
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,000
I THINK IT'S TIME YOU START
LAYING YOUR CARDS

139
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,333
OUT ON THE TABLE.

140
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,625
- YES, I THINK IT IS.

141
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,208
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT,
FIRST I'LL HAVE TO TELL YOU

142
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,958
HOW THINGS REALLY
WORK IN THIS CITY.

143
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,041
- ( beeps )

144
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,625
- Computerized voice:
MAINTENANCE COMPLETE.

145
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,791
COMMENCING RESUSCITATION.

146
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,583
- I TRUST YOU'RE
FEELING ALL RIGHT, ROSE?

147
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,833
- NOT TOO BAD.

148
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,291
- WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING
READY TO BEGIN.

149
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,166
IT'S ALL UP TO YOU, NOW.

150
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,916
- I'D LIKE TO MEET SOMEONE,
BEFORE WE START.

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,125
- AND WHO'S THAT?

152
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,916
- TAKE ME TO MEET OUR ENEMY.

153
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,750
- THIS IS OUR ENEMY.
THIS IS EUNOMIA.

154
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,500
- INCREDIBLE.

155
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,208
- IT'S THE BEATING HEART
OF THE WHOLE CITY,

156
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,708
AND THE CORE COMPUTER
FOR ALL OF R.U.C.

157
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,208
- IT'S CALLED EUNOMIA.

158
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,416
IT'S BEEN THE MASTER
COMPUTER OF THE CITY,

159
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,791
EVER SINCE THE DAYS OF
THE ORIGINAL COLONISTS.

160
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,958
IT HAS ABSOLUTE CONTROL
OF THE CITY'S ENERGY SOURCES,

161
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,000
THE POWER GRID, THE WATER
SUPPLY, YOU NAME IT.

162
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,500
YOU MIGHT CALL IT
THE CITY'S LIFELINE.

163
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,750
- EUNOMIA WAS CHARGED
WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY

164
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,416
OF DOING WHATEVER
WAS NECESSARY

165
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,000
TO KEEP THE HUMAN RACE
FROM EXTINCTION.

166
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,250
INCLUDING CONTROLLING
AND DIRECTING THEIR LIVES.

167
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,625
BUT, OF COURSE,

168
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,875
YOU CAN'T CONTROL PEOPLE
JUST WITH ENERGY AND WATER.

169
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,291
SO, R.U.C. WAS CREATED
TO BE THE CITY'S CENTRAL ENTITY.

170
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,666
R.U.C. IS A SHADOW GOVERNMENT
WITHIN A CORPORATION.

171
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,750
IT ACTS ON EUNOMIA'S BEHALF.

172
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,333
SHAPING AND MANAGING
HUMANITY AND SOCIETY.

173
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,125
EUNOMIA ESTABLISHED THE SYSTEM
OF CITIZEN REGISTRATION

174
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,708
THROUGH R.U.C.

175
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:14,583
IT IS THE CAUSE OF THE SUFFERING
OF THE UNREGISTERED CITIZENS.

176
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:18,083
- WHY CREATE SUCH A SYSTEM?
- AS THE POPULATION GREW,

177
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:22,125
VARIOUS INEQUITIES AROSE
IN ENERGY, IN

178
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,416
FOOD, MEDICINE AND SERVICES.

179
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,958
IT USED THE SYSTEM
TO CONTROL THESE INEQUITIES,

180
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:31,208
BY GUARANTEEING THAT SUPPLY
WOULD ALWAYS MEET DEMAND.

181
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,416
- THAT'S HORRIBLE.

182
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,083
- PEOPLE ARE PRONE
TO NEGATIVE EMOTIONS.

183
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,166
ENVY, HATE, CRUELTY,

184
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,125
THEY HAVE A DEEP NEED TO
FEEL SUPERIOR TO OTHERS.

185
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,833
BY DELIBERATELY CREATING
A CLASS OF HAVE-NOTS

186
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,333
TO LOOK DOWN ON,

187
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,666
EUNOMIA WAS ABLE TO CONTROL
THE DISCONTENT OF THE HAVES.

188
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,583
- BUT THAT'S ABSURD. THAT'S
THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS PAIN?

189
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,208
- IT DOESN'T STOP THERE.

190
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,666
NOW, EUNOMIA IS TRYING
TO EXTEND ITS CONTROL

191
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,791
--OF HUMANITY.
- HUH?

192
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,208
- AND THIS IS WHAT
IT'S GOING TO USE.

193
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,791
- RESEMBLE.

194
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,583
- ANYONE EQUIPPED WITH ANY
SORT OF RESEMBLE TECHNOLOGY

195
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,208
IS LINKED DIRECTLY TO EUNOMIA.

196
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,208
OF COURSE, THIS HASN'T
BEEN REVEALED TO ANYONE.

197
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,583
- HOLD ON.

198
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,541
IF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
SUCH A DEEP, DARK SECRET,

199
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,583
THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT IT?

200
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,958
LIKE BEFORE, WHEN YOU STROLLED
INTO A HIGH SECURITY AREA

201
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,458
THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE
ABLE TO ACCESS.

202
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,791
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

203
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,666
- FOR THE PAST
TWO HUNDRED YEARS,

204
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,291
EVER SINCE THE FIRST SHIP
CAME TO COLONIZE THIS PLANET,

205
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,291
IT HAS BEEN MY DUTY TO
OVERSEE THE GROWTH

206
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,125
OF THE CITY AND ITS PEOPLE.

207
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,708
- ( gasps )

208
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,083
- BUT, IF THAT'S TRUE THEN
THE REGISTRATION SYSTEM...

209
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,708
- IS PARTLY MY DOING, YES.

210
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,916
- AND NOW YOU WANT
TO DESTROY IT? WHY?

211
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,625
- BECAUSE I WAS WRONG.
I MADE A MISTAKE.

212
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,708
WE CAN CHANGE IT, THE TWO OF US.

213
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,916
WE CAN FREE THIS WORLD OF
ITS MACHINE-MADE SHACKLES.

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,875
- YOU AND I, TOGETHER CAN DO IT.
- YOU AND I, TOGETHER?

215
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,291
- Andy: SO, WHAT DOES
THIS ASHLEY GUY

216
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,041
THINK HE'S GOING TO DO
WITH THIS EUNOMIA THING?

217
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,916
- TO PUT IT AS
SIMPLY AS POSSIBLE,

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,833
I BELIEVE HE WANTS
TO TURN IT OFF.

219
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,041
- ( gasps )

220
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,791
- WAIT, BUT THAT'S JUST CRAZY.

221
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,500
IF HE TAKES THE
WHOLE CITY DOWN,

222
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,750
THEN HE'S GOING
TO GO DOWN WITH IT.

223
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,000
- NEVERTHELESS,
THAT'S WHAT HE'S AFTER.

224
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,416
ASHLEY HAS ALWAYS LOATHED BEING
UNDER THE CONTROL OF A MACHINE,

225
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,833
EVER SINCE THE OLD DAYS.

226
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,250
- SINCE THE OLD DAYS?

227
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,541
- ASHLEY AND I WERE
COLLEAGUES A LONG TIME AGO.

228
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,583
- WHAT THE...

229
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:39,000
- BUT WE HAD A
PARTING OF THE WAYS.

230
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,500
- ROY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

231
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,458
- I JUST DON'T KNOW, IT'S A
LOT TO SWALLOW, BUT STILL.

232
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,500
- STILL WHAT ?

233
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,458
- BUT STILL IT'S POSSIBLE AND
WE CAN'T SIMPLY LAUGH IT OFF.

234
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,041
- AND I CAN'T SHAKE
THE FEELING,

235
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,166
THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO
BE SATISFIED WITH SIMPLY

236
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,208
TURNING IT OFF.

237
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,750
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

238
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,125
- MAYBE HE'S PLANNING TO
MAKE HIMSELF A DICTATOR.

239
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,666
- ( sighs ) MAYBE HE IS.

240
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,375
- BUT THERE'S STILL ONE OTHER
THING I CAN'T FIGURE OUT.

241
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,708
- WHAT'S THAT?

242
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,708
- IT'S ROSE.

243
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,375
- ( gasps )

244
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,916
- I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW ROSE
FITS INTO THIS WHOLE SCHEME.

245
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,666
- OF COURSE, I KNEW.

246
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:28,291
I KNEW WHY ROSE WAS NECESSARY.
I KNEW BECAUSE OF THE PROJECT.

247
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,416
THE PROJECT I WAS A PART OF,
AND THAT ROSE REPLACED ME IN.

248
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,791
- ROSE, ARE YOU READY TO GO?

249
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,291
- I TAKE IT THIS IS A MACHINE

250
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,333
THAT ISN'T UNDER
EUNOMIA'S CONTROL.

251
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,958
- ABSOLUTELY NOT. THIS SYSTEM
HAS NO CONNECTION TO EUNOMIA,

252
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,833
BECAUSE I BUILT IT FROM THE
GROUND UP, IN TOTAL SECRECY.

253
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,791
IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME,
BUT, IN THE END,

254
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,541
I THINK IT WILL BE WORTH IT.

255
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,583
- WHAT IS IT?
- NOTHING, LET'S GET STARTED.

256
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,708
- THE PROJECT I WORKED ON
WAS A RADICAL EFFORT.

257
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,125
AN ATTEMPT TO USE
A PROCEED'S PROCESSING ABILITY,

258
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,833
TO LINK THE MIND DIRECTLY
INTO A COMPUTER.

259
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,416
- Researcher:
BEGINNING INITIAL START UP.

260
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,000
TRANSFER OF BIO
PATTERNS CONFIRMED,

261
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,916
PUPIL CONTRACTION RATIO GREEN,

262
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,250
BRAINWAVE PATTERN GREEN.
INITIATING FIRST CONTACT.

263
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,708
- ( gasps )

264
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,500
- Researcher 2:
FIRST CONTACT STAGE COMPLETE.

265
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,125
- Axela: AND NOW, ROSE HAS
TAKEN MY PLACE IN THE PROGRAM.

266
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,625
JOSEPH'S STORY MADE
EVERYTHING CLEAR TO ME.

267
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,625
ASHLEY WANTED AN INDEPENDENT
COMPUTER TO CHALLENGE EUNOMIA,

268
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,958
BUT HE COULDN'T FIND A MACHINE
THAT COULD MATCH ITS POWER.

269
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,375
PROCEED ABILITY GAVE HIM
A NEW ALTERNATIVE.

270
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,958
A LIVING INTERFACE TO CONNECT
WITH A COMPUTER,

271
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,166
WHICH MEANS
HE'S GOING TO USE ROSE.

272
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,208
- Researcher: PREPARATIONS
FOR FINAL CONTACT COMPLETE.

273
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,750
TRANSFERRING OPERATIONAL
CONTROL TO SUBJECT.

274
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,708
- SEND ME IN.

275
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,958
- Axela: TO HACK INTO
EUNOMIA'S OPERATING SYSTEM.

276
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,666
- INITIATE DIVE.

277
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,875
- ONCE PAST IT'S DEFENSES,

278
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,125
HE CAN BYPASS ITS ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM,

279
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,291
AND DESTROY
IT'S CORE PROGRAMMING.

280
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,833
SHUT IT DOWN SO THAT EUNOMIA'S
NOTHING BUT USELESS BOX,

281
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,541
THAT HE CONTROLS.

282
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:00,000
- IT SETS UP FIREWALLS ALMOST
AS FAST AS I CAN BREACH THEM.

283
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,083
WITH THIS KIND OF POWER,

284
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,333
NO WONDER IT CAN
RUN AN ENTIRE CITY.

285
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,916
- Researcher: FIREWALL
NUMBER 127 HAS BEEN BREACHED.

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,583
PREPARING TO INSERT TERTIARY
SUB-VIRUS. SHE'S ATTACKING.

287
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,000
- HER SPEED, IT'S INCREDIBLE.

288
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,416
FASTER THAN ANY
ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN.

289
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,375
- SO FAR, SO GOOD.
THE QUESTION NOW IS,

290
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,958
WHAT WILL EUNOMIA DO NEXT,
TO DEFEND ITSELF.

291
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,333
WHATEVER YOU DO, I'LL BE READY.

292
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,625
- IT WORKED, YOU'RE OKAY.

293
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,291
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU
FEELING, SOLTY?

294
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,708
- YOU STILL LOOK WEAK.

295
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,458
ARE YOU SURE YOU SHOULD
BE UP AND WALKING?

296
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,791
- Yuto: SHE'S RIGHT.

297
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,416
MAYBE THAT MACHINE HAD
SOME KIND OF SIDE EFFECT.

298
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,750
- WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?

299
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:52,250
- QUIT KIDDING AROUND, SOLTY.
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

300
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,916
- SOLTY?

301
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,875
- ( gasps ) GET OUT!

302
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,958
YOU'VE GOT TO GET AWAY
FROM HERE. RIGHT NOW!

303
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,291
- ( screams )

304
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,791
- Woman 1: WHAT'S HAPPENING?

305
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,625
- Woman 2: I DON'T KNOW.
THEY JUST STARTED SCREAMING.

306
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,958
- HUH?
