1
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,375
- Integra: I'M GOING OUT.

2
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,416
THERE'S SOMETHING 
I NEED TO CHECK ON.

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,416
- INTEGRA?

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,208
- DO YOU THINK YOU CAN PUT THIS
TOGETHER IN ONE DAY, AXELA?

5
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,375
- SURE, SHOULDN'T BE
TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM.

6
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,666
- GOOD, THEN I'LL
LEAVE YOU TO IT.

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,291
I SHOULD BE BACK BY THEN, OKAY?

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,000
- HEY, WAIT. I'LL GO WITH YOU.

9
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,666
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

10
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,625
- NO, WAIT.

11
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,291
- ( door closes )

12
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,541
- ( theme song playing )

13
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:09,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

14
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:51,208
- MIRANDA, I NEVER
EXPECTED TO SEE YOU HERE.

15
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,791
- ( chuckles ) I COULD SAY
THE SAME. HOW ARE YOU, ROSE?

16
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,458
HONESTLY, IT WAS A
BIT OF A SHOCK

17
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,375
TO US TO HEAR THAT YOU
WERE WORKING FOR R.U.C.,

18
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,416
I MEAN, CONSIDERING
YOUR PAST AND ALL.

19
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,083
- WELL, A LOT HAS CHANGED.

20
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,250
- SO, WHEN ARE YOU
COMING BACK HOME, DEAR?

21
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,541
THE APARTMENT IS FAIRLY CLOSE,

22
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,958
SO, IT SHOULD BE
AN EASY COMMUTE.

23
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,375
WHEN YOU LEFT, EVERYONE
WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU,

24
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,083
ESPECIALLY ROY. WHY DON'T
YOU STOP BY TONIGHT,

25
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,875
JUST TO SHOW
EVERYONE YOU'RE OKAY?

26
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,250
COME ON, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

27
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,875
- SORRY, MIRANDA.

28
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,791
I WON'T BE GOING BACK
THERE ANYTIME SOON.

29
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,375
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE WORK TO DO.

30
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,291
- BUT, ROSE, WAIT.

31
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,541
HMM. HUH?

32
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,708
( gasps )

33
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,416
- Andy: OH, I SEE THEM NOW.
CRAWLING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

34
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,708
- Roy: R.U.C.?

35
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,750
- OH, YEAH.

36
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,125
- ROSE TIPPED ME OFF ABOUT
THEM THIS MORNING, ROY.

37
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,583
- IF THEY'RE OUT THERE,
IT CAN ONLY MEAN,

38
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,208
THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR INTEGRA AND AXELA.

39
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,666
QUESTION IS HOW DID
THEY KNOW WHERE TO LOOK?

40
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,833
- ( sighs ) DAMN IT, I GUESS,
THAT'D BE MY FAULT.

41
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,375
- YOU, ROY?

42
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,541
- WHAT'D YOU DO? YOU TRYING
TO GET US ALL KILLED, OLD MAN?

43
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,375
- SAVE THE FINGER-POINTING
FOR LATER.

44
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,500
RIGHT NOW, WE JUST NEED TO
KNOW WHAT BROUGHT THEM HERE,

45
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,750
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

46
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,916
- IF R.U.C. SECURITY
IS OUT THERE

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,125
WATCHING EVERYTHING WE DO,
DOES THAT MEAN WE CAN'T

48
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,250
GO ANYWHERE? AM I GOING TO
HAVE TO MISS SCHOOL AGAIN?

49
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,000
- NO, THINK ABOUT IT,

50
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,416
IF THEY REALLY KNEW
INTEGRA AND AXELA WERE HERE,

51
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,333
I DOUBT THEY'D BE
WAITING OUTSIDE.

52
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,458
THEY COULD HAVE EASILY
STORMED THIS PLACE HOURS AGO

53
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,958
BUT FOR SOME REASON, THEY
HAVEN'T. IF I HAD TO GUESS,

54
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY STILL
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE

55
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,500
TO JUSTIFY MOVING IN.

56
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,583
- SO, LET'S NOT GIVE THEM ANY,
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

57
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,791
- THAT'S RIGHT.

58
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,208
- SO, WHAT THE HECK
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

59
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,916
- JUST ACT NORMALLY.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,833
- IF WE DO ANYTHING
THAT LOOKS SUSPICIOUS,

61
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,458
IT COULD BE ALL THE
REASON THEY NEED

62
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,750
TO COME SEARCH THIS PLACE.

63
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,708
- YEAH, BUT STILL,
DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

64
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,125
IT'S PROBABLY SAFE TO ASSUME

65
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,958
THEY'RE TAPPING THE PHONES
AND READING THE MAIL.

66
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,041
- JOSEPH SAID HE WAS SENDING
US A PACKAGE.

67
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,458
- RIGHT.

68
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,875
- I'LL GO TO THE POST OFFICE

69
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,250
AND MAKE A REQUEST THAT
THEY HOLD ALL OUR MAIL.

70
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,958
COME ON, KASHA. LET'S GO.

71
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,541
- NOW, AS FOR AXELA
AND INTEGRA THEMSELVES.

72
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,375
- WHERE'S INTEGRA?
- UH, YOU SEE, SHE, UH...

73
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,833
- DID SHE LEAVE?
- WELL, UM SHE SAID THAT, UH...

74
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,083
- SOLTY!

75
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,166
- UH, SHE SAID
SHE'D BE BACK SOON.

76
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,375
- WHERE'D SHE GO?

77
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,250
- WE NEED TO KNOW, SPIT IT OUT.

78
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,625
- SHE ASKED ME ABOUT JOSEPH,

79
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,291
SO, I TOLD HER WHERE
HE LIVED. THEN SHE...

80
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,291
- AND HE'S THE GUY WHO LEFT
THE MESSAGE ABOUT THE PACKAGE?

81
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:41,041
- THAT'S HIM. BUT WHY WOULD
SHE GO OUT TO HIS PLACE?

82
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,500
- ( gasps )

83
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,375
- MAN, I DON'T GET IT.

84
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,000
WHY COULDN'T THE OLD GUY
CHECK THIS OUT HIMSELF?

85
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,583
- ( gadget beeps )

86
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,208
- BEATS ME. JUST KEEP
FOLLOWING THIS ROAD, OKAY?

87
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,250
- YEAH, I KNOW AND WHY'D
HE HAVE TO STICK ME WITH YOU?

88
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,625
- MAYBE HE WAS WORRIED YOU
COULDN'T HANDLE IT BY YOURSELF.

89
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,958
- SHUT UP, YOU GEEK.

90
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,375
- Yuto: KEEP YOUR EYES
ON THE ROAD.

91
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,833
- OKAY, THEN. YOU WANT US TO
STOP ALL MAIL FOR MR. ROY REVANT

92
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:13,916
AND HOLD IT HERE, HUH?

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,208
- YES. HE'S ALSO
EXPECTING A PACKAGE,

94
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,875
WE'LL BE PICKING UP LATER.

95
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,291
- HIS ADDRESS IS...

96
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,916
- ALREADY HAVE IT, MA'AM. 2015
CONNAGER STREET , RIGHT?

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,291
THAT'S RIGHT.

98
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,333
SOMEONE CAME IN EARLIER
ASKING FOR THE SAME THING.

99
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,041
FRIEND OF YOURS, MAYBE.

100
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,833
ANYWAY, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I TOLD THEM.

101
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,291
PACKAGES THAT ARRIVED LAST NIGHT

102
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,666
HAVE ALREADY GONE
OUT ON THE TRUCKS,

103
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,791
SO, IT'S TOO LATE TO STOP THEM.
SORRY, MA'AM.

104
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:42,958
- Integra: SO, THIS IS IT.

105
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,041
- Man: ASHLEY LYNX?
- Roy: YEAH, OPERATION DIRECTOR.

106
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,958
- THE R.U.C. DIRECTOR
I'VE SEEN ON THE NEWS?

107
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,791
THE ONE HANDLING
THAT MURDER CASE?

108
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,416
- YOU THINK HE'S DIRTY?

109
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,833
- JUST CHECK HIM OUT
FOR ME, SEE WHAT TURNS UP.

110
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,958
- YEAH, SEEMS LIKE YOUR TYPICAL
R.U.C. ELITE, YOU ASK ME.

111
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,500
- OH, NO. TRUST ME, THERE'S
NOTHING TYPICAL ABOUT THIS GUY.

112
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,791
ANYWAY, START ASKING AROUND.

113
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,750
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT HIM.

114
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,708
- YEAH, YEAH. HOW CAN I SAY NO
WHEN YOU ASK ME SO NICE?

115
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:15,916
- THANKS.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,333
- I OWE YOU ONE.

117
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:25,791
- ( gasps )

118
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,750
- I WISH THERE WAS
SOMETHING MORE

119
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,166
I COULD DO TO HELP RIGHT NOW.

120
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,083
BUT FOOD ALWAYS SEEMS
TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL BETTER.

121
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,125
SO, I'LL MAKE THEM
A GOOD DINNER TONIGHT.

122
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,041
- Ashley: EXCUSE ME.
- YEAH?

123
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,625
CAN I HELP YOU?

124
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:01,166
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE, DIIKE.
- DIIKE?

125
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,291
- HAS TO BE IT.

126
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,166
( grunting )

127
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,125
( panting )

128
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,458
THIS IS IT.

129
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,708
THERE'S NO MISTAKING IT.

130
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,041
THIS WAS THE PROCEED
RESEARCH LAB.

131
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,166
IT'S WHERE THEY
WORKED ON US.

132
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,833
- Yuto: SO, TELL ME.
- Andy: WHAT?

133
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:56,250
- Yuto: BE HONEST. YOU'VE GOT
A THING FOR ROSE, DON'T YOU?

134
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,583
- WHAT? WHAT THE HELL
WOULD GIVE YOU THAT IDEA?

135
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,208
- OH, IT'S JUST A LITTLE HUNCH.

136
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,541
SEEMS LIKE ALL SOMEONE
HAS TO DO IS MENTION HER NAME,

137
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,333
AND YOU BREAK OUT
IN A SWEAT, LIKE NOW.

138
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,333
- SO, WHAT IF I DO HAVE
A THING FOR HER?

139
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,916
WE'RE NOT BLOOD RELATIVES.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,041
- I REST MY CASE.

141
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,750
- SHUT YOUR TRAP,
YOU FREAKING NERD.

142
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,458
- Kasha: SOLTY'S SURE IS TAKING
A LONG TIME AT THE MARKET, HUH?

143
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,291
- ( laughs ) OH, I'M SURE SHE'S
JUST HAVING TROUBLE DECIDING

144
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,750
WHAT TO MAKE FOR DINNER.

145
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,833
- GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. HUH?

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,958
- ( both gasp )

147
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,833
- S... SOLTY?

148
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,291
( screams ) SOLTY!

149
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,333
- Andy: GREAT. SO, WHAT NOW?

150
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,500
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSE
TO EXPLAIN THIS? COME ON.

151
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,250
- WE'LL TELL THE TRUTH. IT WAS
LIKE THIS WHEN WE GOT HERE.

152
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,916
WE FOUND THE COTTAGE AND IT
WAS ALL BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS,

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,958
AND THERE WAS NO SIGN
OF INTEGRA, ANYWHERE.

154
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,958
- Ashley: HOW'S YOUR PROGRESS?

155
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,208
- Researcher: SLOW.

156
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,375
IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME
TO ADJUST EVERY NERVE.

157
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:23,583
- HOW LONG?
- TWELVE HOURS. PERHAPS LONGER.

158
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,375
- WHERE WERE YOU?

159
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,750
- THERE WAS SOME BUSINESS
THAT REQUIRED MY ATTENTION.

160
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,041
NOW THAT IT'S RESOLVED,
YOU'RE MY ONLY CONCERN.

161
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,916
- I SEE.

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,291
- GET SOME REST NOW.

163
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,416
WHEN YOU AWAKEN NEXT,
OUR GRAND ENDEAVOR BEGINS.

164
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,041
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
ALL OF YOUR STRENGTH.

165
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,041
- YES, REST SOUNDS GOOD.

166
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,583
- TELL ME, JUST HOW
FEASIBLE IS BRAINWASHING?

167
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,375
- WE COULD TRY IT, SIR,
BUT THERE'S THE POTENTIAL

168
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,625
FOR SIDE EFFECTS.

169
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,875
THERE'S A CHANCE, IT
COULD INTERFERE

170
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,708
WITH HER PROCEED ABILITIES.

171
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,833
- YES, I SEE.

172
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,750
- SOLTY.

173
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,625
( gasps ) WHA,
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

174
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,750
- WHEN WE FOUND HER,
SHE WAS ALREADY LIKE THAT.

175
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,583
- SHE'S NOT DEAD, IS SHE, ROY?
IS SHE? ROY?

176
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,708
- ( sobs ) NO, SHE CAN'T BE.

177
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,666
DAMMIT, ISN'T THERE ANYONE
AROUND HERE THAT CAN FIX HER?

178
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,291
- I'M SORRY.

179
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,916
I JUST WASN'T EVER TRAINED
AS A RESEMBLE TECHNICIAN.

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,750
- IF YUTO WAS HERE, HE MIGHT BE
ABLE TO DO SOMETHING.

181
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,458
- ( sobs )

182
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,041
- ( doorbell rings )

183
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,166
- HOLD ON A SECOND.

184
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,125
OH, I'M SORRY, CAN I HELP YOU?

185
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:43,500
- IF ROY REVANT IS HERE,
YOU CAN TELL HIM,

186
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,625
JOSEPH IS HERE TO SEE HIM.

187
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,958
- HOW IS SHE?

188
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:54,666
- BAD, I'M AFRAID. I SUSPECT
THIS IS ASHLEY'S DOING.

189
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,416
- ASHLEY?

190
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,083
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN REPAIR HER,

191
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,166
BUT I CAN AT LEAST
TAKE A LOOK.

192
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,041
- JUST... JUST DO IT.

193
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,125
- ROY, HOW DO WE KNOW
WE CAN TRUST THAT GUY?

194
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,833
- WE DON'T EXACTLY
HAVE A CHOICE, DO WE?

195
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,541
- Axela: THAT THING IS NOT
GOING TO PUT ITSELF TOGETHER.

196
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,541
- Integra: AXELA.

197
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,333
- INTEGRA, HOW'D YOU GET INSIDE?

198
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,458
THOSE LOOKOUTS,
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

199
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,791
- DON'T WORRY.

200
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,750
I JUST PUT THOSE GUYS TO
SLEEP FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

201
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,583
- TO SLEEP? BUT,
IF ANYONE NOTICES...

202
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,416
- HERE, ROY SHOULD BE
EXPECTING THIS PACKAGE.

203
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,583
NOT SURE WHAT IT IS,
BUT IT'S OF NO USE TO ME.

204
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,625
PLEASE GIVE IT TO HIM, OKAY?

205
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,750
NOW, DO YOU HAVE WHAT I NEED?

206
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,916
- OH, RIGHT IT'S
ALMOST FINISHED.

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,875
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
CONNECT THE FINAL CORD,

208
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,375
AND YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

209
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,791
- THANKS, BUT DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT. I CAN DO IT MYSELF.

210
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,625
- UM, NO WAIT. PLEASE TAKE
ME WITH YOU, INTEGRA.

211
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,875
LET'S, LET'S
WORK TOGETHER.

212
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,625
- HUH. AXELA.
- INTEGRA, I'M COMING.

213
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,250
- ALL RIGHT THEN.
HURRY UP AND GET READY.

214
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,666
- ( sighs ) THANKS.

215
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
- I HOPE YOU'LL
FORGIVE ME, AXELA.

216
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,541
- HUH?

217
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,250
- COMPLETELY BURNED OUT.

218
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,500
BUT STILL, BETTER THIS CHIP

219
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,625
THAN THE REST OF
YOUR CIRCUITRY, HUH?

220
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,708
I GUESS WE SHOULD BE
THANKFUL IT WASN'T WORSE.

221
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,666
THIS ISN'T A FACTORY
PART, LITTLE ONE,

222
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,208
BUT HOPEFULLY, IT WILL
GET YOU UP AND RUNNING.

223
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,375
SOLTY? ARE YOU CONSCIOUS?

224
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:53,041
- SOLTY? NOT RECOGNIZED.
MY NAME IS DIIKE.

225
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,125
- HUH? IT CAN'T BE.

226
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,916
- I HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE
SURFACE FOR THE PURPOSE OF...

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,541
- ( buzzes )

228
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,791
- HUH?

229
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,708
- SHE OKAY?

230
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,125
- I HAVE NEITHER
THE RIGHT PARTS,

231
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,916
NOR THE TOOLS TO
REPAIR HER HERE.

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,458
- DAMMIT.

233
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,666
- HEY, WHERE IS SHE? THE GIRL,
THE ONE WITH THE SHORT HAIR.

234
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,916
WHERE DID SHE GO?

235
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
- ( gasps )

236
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,208
- ( tires screeching )

237
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,583
- HUH? RUN FOR YOUR LIFE.

238
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,750
- HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE SMOKE?

239
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,750
- IT'S COMING FROM
THE R.U.C. BUILDING.

240
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,625
- ( beeping )

241
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,250
- YES, WHAT IS IT?

242
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,791
- Man: A SECTION 7
COMMAND VEHICLE

243
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,625
JUST CRASHED INTO
THE LOBBY, SIR.

244
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,625
- WHAT?

245
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,791
- Man: WE'VE SECURED
THE VEHICLE,

246
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,250
BUT THE DRIVER HAS
FLED INTO THE BUILDING.

247
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,458
WE ARE IN PURSUIT AT THIS TIME.

248
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,375
- ( beeping )

249
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,000
- SIR, UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

250
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,375
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ARE
ACTIVATING YOUR TRANSPONDER?

251
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,041
- WE DON'T WANT OUR GUEST
GETTING LOST, NOW, DO WE?

252
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,791
I SHOULD GO WELCOME HER.

253
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,458
- ( siren wailing )

254
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:14,958
- GOT IT.

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,625
- Roy: HEY, HEY, WAKE UP.

256
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,083
- HEY, WHAT'S THIS? IS THIS THE
PACKAGE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR?

257
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,666
THIS IS IT, RIGHT?

258
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,000
- HMM.

259
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,000
- BUT HOW IN THE WORLD
COULD IT HAVE GOTTEN HERE?

260
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,916
- YOU OKAY, WHAT HAPPENED?
- WHERE'S INTEGRA?

261
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,500
- INTEGRA, WHERE IS SHE?
- INTEGRA?

262
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,958
- AH, THEN I GUESS
THAT MAKES YOU AXELA.

263
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:48,541
- WAIT, HOW DO YOU KNOW THESE
GIRLS? WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

264
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,083
JOSEPH, TALK.

265
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,541
- ( beeping )

266
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,333
- COME ON, WORK FOR ME.

267
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,250
- Joseph: THESE GIRLS
ARE PROCEED.

268
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,166
I WAS THE SCIENTIST
WHO AUGMENTED THEM

269
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,750
YEARS AGO AT R.U.C.

270
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,000
THE PROCEED ARE A
NEW CLASS OF HUMANS,

271
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,250
CREATED BY THE BLAST FALL.

272
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:17,333
WHEN IT HAPPENED, DROPLETS OF
LIGHT RAINED DOWN UPON THE CITY.

273
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,375
THESE DROPLETS, THEY WERE
ACTUALLY THE NANOMACHINES

274
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,041
THAT FORM THE AURORA SHELL.

275
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,458
- NANOMACHINES?

276
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,375
- Joseph: MACHINES THE
SIZE OF MOLECULES.

277
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,583
- SO SMALL, THEY'RE INVISIBLE
TO THE NAKED EYE.

278
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,458
- HUH?

279
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,041
- IT SEEMS, FOR CERTAIN YOUNG
GIRLS EXPOSED TO THE BLAST FALL,

280
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,875
THE ABSORPTION OF
THESE NANOMACHINES

281
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,583
HAD A DNA ALTERING EFFECT.

282
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,416
WE DUBBED THESE GIRLS
PROCEED. THEY'RE SUPERHUMAN.

283
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,083
EACH ONE OF THEM MANIFESTING
DISTINCT SPECIAL ABILITIES.

284
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,708
SOME POSSESS ENHANCED
STRENGTH AND SPEED,

285
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,291
FOR OTHERS, IT WAS ENHANCED
VISION AND REFLEXES.

286
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:56,458
SOME DEVELOPED SUPERIOR
INTELLIGENCE. THEY'RE PERFECT.

287
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,333
BUT THE STRESS
ON THEIR BODIES IS HUGE.

288
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,041
AS A RESULT, THEIR BODIES
HAVE TO BE AUGMENTED

289
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,708
WITH ENHANCEMENTS TO SURVIVE.

290
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,541
- SO, HOW DOES AN OLD MAN
LIKE YOU KNOW ALL THIS?

291
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,000
- I GREW WEARY OF MY ROLE
AND BECAME A BIT OF AN OBSERVER.

292
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,958
- WHAT THE HECK
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

293
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,166
- HOLD ON,
IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY,

294
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,666
THEN, NANOMACHINES THINGS
MAKE UP THE AURORA SHELL?

295
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,916
IS THE AURORA SHELL MAN-MADE?

296
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,083
- HMM.

297
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,583
- WHAT DO WE NEED IT FOR?

298
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,125
- THE AURORA SHELL IS A MEMBRANE

299
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,166
THAT CONTAINS A
BREATHABLE ATMOSPHERE,

300
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,000
NECESSARY SINCE THIS
PLANET ORIGINALLY

301
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,541
HAD NO AIR OF ITS OWN.

302
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,500
- NO AIR? ARE YOU
REALLY SERIOUS?

303
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,750
- VERY MUCH SO, YOUNG LADY.

304
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:41,125
- WITHOUT THE AURORA SHELL,
WE COULDN'T LIVE HERE.

305
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,333
THAT'S WHY WE, HUMANS,

306
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,416
BUILT IT WHEN WE MOVED
HERE TO THIS PLANET.

307
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
- ( all gasp )

308
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,583
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

309
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,750
- IT'S A SHIP OF HOPE. MY SHIP.

310
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,791
MY MEANS OF ESCAPING
THIS DESPICABLE PLANET.

311
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,958
TRUE, THE FIRST ONE
FAILED, BUT THIS ONE WON'T.

312
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,625
I'VE REMEDIED THE MISTAKES
I MADE TWELVE YEARS AGO.

313
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,166
- TWELVE YEARS? SO, IT WAS YOU.

314
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,416
THE BLAST FALL WAS
YOUR FAULT, WASN'T IT?

315
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,750
- AH, IT SEEMS YOU'VE BEEN
DOING YOUR HOMEWORK.

316
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,708
- I HAD THE FEELING,
SOMETHING WAS ROTTEN.

317
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,708
EVER SINCE THE DAY
OF THE CLOCK TOWER DISASTER.

318
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,958
YOU ORDERED ME
TO RESCUE ROSE. WHY?

319
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,375
- PROCEED REPRESENT THE FUTURE
OF HUMANITY FOR THIS WORLD.

320
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,333
THE OTHERS OUT THERE,
RESEMBLE DRONES,

321
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,291
ALL OF THEM SLAVES TO
THOSE WICKED WITCHES,

322
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,625
WE CALL MACHINES. I NEEDED
YOU AND YOUR ABILITIES TO

323
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,000
HELP ME "BREAK THE
SPELL", SO TO SPEAK.

324
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,708
- WHAT IN THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT? EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

325
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,708
- NO, NO, IT HARDLY MATTERS.

326
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,583
YOU, INTEGRA HAVE
OUTLIVED YOUR USEFULNESS.

327
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,833
- SO, ALL THIS TIME,
WE'VE JUST BEEN TOOLS TO YOU,

328
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,041
TO BE USED AND THROWN
AWAY AT YOUR CONVENIENCE,

329
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,416
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN?

330
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,541
SILVIA, SHE, SHE WAS MY FRIEND,
A CLOSE FRIEND. AND CELICA.

331
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,916
SHE COULD BE HANDFUL SOMETIMES,
BUT WE ALL LOVED HER.

332
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,291
THEY WERE MY FAMILY.

333
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,666
SO, I'M DOING THIS FOR THEM NOW,
YOU BASTARD.

334
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,375
- OH, SUCH FOOLISH EMOTION.

335
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,166
- ( grunts )

336
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,375
- AH, YES, OVERCLOCK.

337
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,916
THE ABILITY TO PERFORM MOMENTARY
BURSTS OF HIGH-SPEED MOVEMENT.

338
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,291
HOWEVER, IT'S
QUITE TAXING, ISN'T IT?

339
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,000
IF MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY,

340
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,916
IT INDUCES A MASSIVE STRAIN
ON YOUR CEREBRAL CORTEX.

341
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,416
IT CAN ONLY BE USED
THREE TIMES, AM I RIGHT?

342
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,166
ANY MORE AND YOUR BODY
COMPLETELY SHUTS DOWN.

343
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,208
AND YOU'VE ONLY GOT
TWO LEFT, INTEGRA.

344
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,125
- ( gasps )

345
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,583
- IT CAN'T BE EASY.

346
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,500
KNOWING THAT YOU'RE ONLY
DESTROYING YOURSELF,

347
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,000
WITH EACH WASTED ATTACK.

348
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,291
- SHUT UP.

349
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,208
- JUST ONE LEFT. BUT,
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL, INTEGRA.

350
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,791
STOP NOW, AND I PROMISE YOU,

351
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,375
YOUR DEATH WILL
BE A PAINLESS ONE.

352
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,583
- NEVER.

353
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,708
( screams )

354
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,750
- OH, NICE TRY.
- NO, HOW DID...

355
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,791
( screams )

356
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,291
( groans )

357
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,375
- NOW, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERGO

358
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,916
REGULAR MAINTENANCE.
YOU PROCEED REALLY ARE

359
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,125
A DELICATE LITTLE
LOT, AREN'T YOU, NOW?

360
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,458
THIS VOLTAGE WAS ENOUGH TO
PUT DIIKE OUT OF COMMISSION

361
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,833
WITH ONE STRIKE.

362
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,666
IT'LL BE MORE THAN
ENOUGH FOR YOU.

363
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,083
- SILVIA. CELICA.

364
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,916
- YOUR TIME'S UP, INTEGRA.

365
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,416
- ( shouting )

366
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,458
- ( screams )

367
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,250
- AH, A FOURTH OVERCLOCK.
I'M IMPRESSED.

368
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:07,208
TOO BAD, MY RESEMBLE COMPONENTS
ARE OF A HIGHER QUALITY

369
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,125
THAN THOSE FOUND
ON THE AVERAGE CITIZEN.

370
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,208
- DAMMIT.

371
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,750
( screams )

372
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:20,041
- STILL ALIVE? BUT YOUR BODY
AND MIND ARE BROKEN.

373
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,833
IN ANY CASE, YOU'LL
MAKE THE PERFECT BAIT

374
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,041
TO LURE AXELA OUT OF HIDING.

375
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,458
- I WON'T FORGIVE YOU,
FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.

376
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,625
ASHLEY LYNX,
YOU'RE GOING TO PAY.

377
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,458
- ( theme song playing )

378
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

379
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,041
- ( music playing )

380
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,291
- Joseph: SO,
WHERE SHOULD I START?

381
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,250
- Axela: IT'S BECAUSE
I WAS THAT WAY, TOO.

382
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,666
- Solty: NEXT TIME,

383
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,666
"THE TIME FOR TRUTH."
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?
