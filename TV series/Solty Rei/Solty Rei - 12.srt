AREN'T YOU TIRED OF IT YET?

7
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,208
- NOT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK
I'LL EVER GET TIRED OF IT.

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,750
WHAT WAS THAT TUNE
YOU WERE HUMMING?

15
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,458
- OH! THAT'S JUST A LITTLE SONG
ROSE TAUGHT ME THE OTHER DAY.

16
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:12,833
SHE SAID SINGING IT HELPS HER
FEEL BETTER WHEN SHE'S TENSE.

17
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,666
- YOU MEAN ROSE WAS
SINGING THAT SONG?

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,666
- AS YOU CAN SEE,
MISS ROSE HAS JOINED THE GAME.

YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME

24
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,083
- OF COURSE WE CAME, DEAR.

25
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,166
YOUR MOTHER AND I LOVE
OUR PRECIOUS LITTLE GIRL!

26
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,833
- LOOK HERE. WE BROUGHT YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

27
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,250
- YOU USED TO LOVE THESE
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE.

- Silvia: YEAH, THEY'RE SWEET.

31
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,000
SO HOW'S THE CASE GOING?
YOU GOT A LINE ON THE PERP YET?

32
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,583
- YES, AND WE'VE
ALREADY PROCESSED

33
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,791
THE FORMAL ARREST WARRANT.

34
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,458
IT SHOULD ONLY BE
A MATTER OF TIME.

35
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,041
- OH.

36
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,916
- SYLVIA, JUST TRY TO
ENJOY YOUR TIME OFF.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,916
- YEAH, I KNOW. I'D PROBABLY
JUST GET IN THE WAY, ANYHOW.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
- I KNOW THIS IS KILLING YOU,
BUT AXELA AND I CAN HANDLE IT.

39
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,666
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, AXELA?

40
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,708
- RIGHT.

41
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,708
- GOOD LUCK.

42
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,583
- Larry: WELL, YOU'RE
LOOKING A LOT BETTER.

43
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,333
- JEEZ, THEN I HATE TO THINK
WHAT I LOOKED LIKE BEFORE.

44
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,208
IF I'D BEEN ONE
SPLIT SECOND SLOWER,

45
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,333
YOU'D BE TALKING TO JUST A PAIR
OF EYEBROWS RIGHT NOW.

46
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,916
- IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
EASIER TO CARRY YOU BACK

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,583
FROM THE HOSPITAL LIKE THAT.

48
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,875
I PROMISE YOU, THAT FREAK
WILL PAY FOR THIS.

49
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,875
- JUST PROMISE YOU'LL
BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

50
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,916
- COURSE.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,958
- BY THE WAY, I'VE GOT...

52
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,041
- YOU MEAN THIS?

53
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,416
- YEAH, THAT'S THE OFFICIAL
BLAST FALL INQUIRY.

54
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,750
IT'S LIKE WE THOUGHT,
IT WAS ALL A SECRET.

55
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,958
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF
GIRLS WHOSE DNA MUTATED

56
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,666
AS AN AFTER EFFECT
OF THE EXPLOSION.

57
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,208
- YEP.

58
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,375
- YOU DON'T SEEM VERY SURPRISED.

59
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,291
YOU WERE EXPECTING THIS,
WEREN'T YOU?

60
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,208
- MM-HMM.

61
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,083
- THE DETAILS ARE RIGHT THERE.
THERE WERE EVEN SOME GIRLS

62
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,583
WHO HAD THEIR HAIR COLOR
CHANGED BY THE MUTATION.

63
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,958
YOU'VE EXPECTED THIS
FOR A LONG TIME, HAVEN'T YOU?

64
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,333
THAT ROSE MIGHT BE...

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,208
- ROY, THE ADDRESS HO SPECIFIED,

66
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,041
THAT WHOLE AREA IS ABANDONED,
IT'S A GHOST TOWN.

67
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,500
- I KNOW.

68
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,625
- THEN YOU KNOW HE'S GONNA
HAVE THAT PLACE LOADED UP

69
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,166
WITH ALL KINDS OF BOOBY TRAPS.

70
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,625
- UH-HUH.

71
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,416
- HOLD ON, I'M COMING TOO.

72
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,458
- NO SOLTY, YOU'RE NOT.

73
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,583
I'LL HANDLE THIS ALONE.

74
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,666
- ROY.

75
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,125
- LOOK, THIS IS MY
RESPONSIBILITY. I'LL SETTLE IT.

76
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,083
- ROY, YOU AND ROSE
COME BACK SAFE, OKAY?

77
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,666
- WE'LL SEE.

78
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,708
- GOOD LUCK.

79
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,750
- ( door slams )

80
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,875
- ( exhales )

81
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,750
OH, IT'S YOU.

82
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,750
- SORRY TO STARTLE YOU,

83
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,375
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

84
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,416
- WHAT?

85
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,041
- IT'S ROSE.

86
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,083
WE THINK SHE MAY BE
YOUR DAUGHTER.

87
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,458
- I KNOW.

88
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,083
- SO YOU KNEW?

89
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,666
- I WASN'T CERTAIN.

90
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,333
I JUST FOUND OUT RECENTLY.

91
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,958
- WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN ROSE
ISN'T OUR REAL SISTER.

92
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,083
I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT DAY.

93
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,333
IT WAS RIGHT AFTER
THE BLAST FALL.

94
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,833
SHE WAS JUST A TINY GIRL
WHEN DAD BROUGHT HER HOME.

95
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,541
SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER

96
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,750
AND COULD HARDLY EVEN SPEAK.

97
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,958
SO MOM AND DAD
DECIDED TO ADOPT HER.

98
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,041
AND THEY NAMED HER ROSE.
THESE ARE THE CLOTHES

99
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,541
SHE WAS WEARING WHEN
DAD FOUND HER IN THE STREET.

100
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,666
DO THEY LOOK FAMILIAR?

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,958
- YEAH.

102
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,625
THEY'RE MY DAUGHTER'S.

103
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,250
I'M SURE OF IT.

104
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,916
- MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS,
BUT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF YOUNG

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,458
GIRLS WHOSE DNA WAS MUTATED
AFTER THE BLAST FALL.

106
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,750
NO ONE'S EVER FIGURED OUT
THE CAUSE OF IT,

107
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,000
BUT THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE

108
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,541
ROSE IS ONE OF THE
GIRLS WHO WAS AFFECTED.

109
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
NONE OF THIS IS HARD
PROOF, OF COURSE.

110
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,583
STILL, AS
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE...

111
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,416
- ( car starts )

112
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,750
- ( tires screech )

113
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,291
- SO ROSE IS...

114
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,875
SHE'S ROY'S REAL DAUGHTER?

115
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,166
- ( laughs maliciously )

116
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,708
- Rose: WHAT, YOU STILL
LAUGHING AT YOURSELF?

117
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,458
IT'S KINDA CREEPY.

118
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,583
- SURELY YOU KNOW THE FEELING.

119
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,083
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN
YOU GET SO EXCITED,

120
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,125
YOU CAN'T KEEP YOURSELF FROM
LAUGHING WITH ANTICIPATION.

121
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,708
- YEAH. FINE, WHATEVER.

122
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,375
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE SO WORKED UP

123
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,958
ABOUT THAT OLD GUY
AND I DON'T CARE.

124
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,916
ANYWAY, IT'S NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,208
SO LET ME GO!

126
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,333
- I'M SORRY, BUT I'M
AFRAID I CAN'T OBLIGE YOU,

127
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,208
A TRAP ISN'T MUCH
GOOD WITHOUT BAIT.

128
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,958
- WHY DID YOU PICK
ME OF ALL PEOPLE?

129
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,416
- ( scoffs )

130
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE OF
ROY'S ROOMMATES, OBVIOUSLY.

131
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,125
AND YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
YOURSELF LUCKY,

132
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,875
I SENT A BOMB TO THE OTHER GIRL.

133
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,708
THOUGH, IT SEEMS
SHE ESCAPED SOMEHOW.

134
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,583
- HMM, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

135
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,708
- I'VE NO DOUBT OUR MUTUAL
FRIEND WILL COME TO RESCUE YOU.

136
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,583
THOUGH HE DOESN'T QUITE SEEM
TO BE THE MAN HE USED TO BE.

137
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,750
IT SEEMS UNLIKELY, BUT PERHAPS
HE'S MELLOWING IN HIS OLD AGE.

138
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,833
- WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

139
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,125
- DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

140
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,291
HE USED TO BE A REAL TERROR,
A MADMAN.

141
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,458
PICTURE THE MEANEST
RABID DOG YOU'VE EVER SEEN

142
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,708
AND MULTIPLY THAT BY
TEN AND YOU'D HAVE ROY.

143
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,916
THIS WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO.

144
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,375
HE WAS STILL A COP BACK THEN.

145
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,041
HE SEEMED DRIVEN BY SOME
KIND OF BURNING RAGE.

146
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,166
THOSE WHO WERE UNLUCKY
ENOUGH TO BE IN HIS PATH

147
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,875
WERE SHOWN NO MERCY.

148
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,625
ONLY HE KNOWS HOW MANY
CRIMINALS HE CRIPPLED OR KILLED.

149
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,416
BY NOW YOU MAY HAVE GUESSED THAT
I WAS ONE OF THOSE CRIMINALS.

150
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,958
IN MY CASE, HE FIRED
TWELVE ROUNDS INTO MY ARM

151
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,708
BEFORE HE WAS FINISHED.
MUSCLES, TENDONS, BONES,

152
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:54,750
ALL SHOT TO BITS,
SMEARED OVER A WALL.

153
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,458
AND WHY DO YOU THINK HE DID IT?

154
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,166
I ACTUALLY ASKED HIM
AS I LAY THERE BLEEDING.

155
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,875
HIS ANSWER? "THE BLAST
FALL TOOK MY DAUGHTER,

156
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,833
"BUT ALL THE PIECE OF
SHIT CRIMINALS LIKE YOU

157
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,666
ARE STILL ALIVE!"

158
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,375
THAT'S FUNNY, ISN'T IT?

159
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,291
HE DESTROYED MY RIGHT ARM,
THE ARM I CREATED ART WITH,

160
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,000
AS REVENGE FOR THE
LOSS OF HIS DAUGHTER.

161
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,958
AS IF I WERE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE BLAST FALL.

162
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,833
FOOL, SHOOTING ME TO PIECES
WASN'T GOING TO BRING HER BACK.

163
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,958
I THINK HE WAS
BEING RATHER UNFAIR.

164
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,708
- AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE DOING ALL THIS?

165
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,250
- YES.

166
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,791
IF YOUR GOAL IS TO KILL A MAN,

167
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,333
ONE BULLET IS ALL
IT TAKES, RIGHT?

168
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,041
A SINGLE SHOT TO THE HEAD
OR THE CHEST WILL DO.

169
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,791
HE GAVE ME TWELVE BULLETS.

170
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,416
AND LEFT ME WITH MANGLED
MEAT WHERE MY ARM USED TO BE.

171
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,750
IT'S HIS TURN NOW.
I WON'T REST UNTIL

172
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,375
I'VE MADE HIM FEEL THE
SAME PAIN AND FEAR I FELT

173
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,083
WITH EACH PULL OF THE TRIGGER.

174
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,750
SOON I'LL HAVE MY CHANCE!

175
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,541
AH, IT SEEMS THE MAN OF THE
HOUR HAS FINALLY ARRIVED!

176
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,541
IT'S SHOW TIME.

177
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,291
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

178
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,166
- I OVERHEARD YOU
SAYING THAT ROSE

179
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,958
MIGHT BE YOUR REAL DAUGHTER.
AND IF THAT'S TRUE...

180
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,541
- I WANT TO HELP
YOU, I KNOW HOW

181
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,291
--MUCH THIS MEANS...
- GO HOME!

182
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,375
THIS IS MY JOB, SOLTY.

183
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,166
I'LL HANDLE IT ALONE.

184
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,750
- Integra: OKAY, I'M GOING IN.

185
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,166
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN, AXELA.

186
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,500
- RIGHT.

187
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,833
- Ho Chu: IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE
SOME UNEXPECTED COMPANY.

188
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,416
BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
THE GAME NEEDS VARIABLES.

189
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,750
NOW, IT'S TIME FOR
LEVEL THREE TO BEGIN!

190
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,250
- HMM.

191
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,750
SAME OLD TRICKS.

192
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,000
OH, NO.

193
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,000
( grunts )

194
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,041
( grunts )

195
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,625
OKAY, SO MAYBE HE HAS
LEARNED A THING OR TWO.

196
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,625
- WONDERFUL!

197
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,500
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!

198
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,791
I'M MORE BRILLIANT THAN EVER!

199
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,250
IF ONLY MY WORK WAS APPRECIATED.

200
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,375
WELL, ROY SEEMS
TO BE ENJOYING IT!

201
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,916
( laughs maliciously )

202
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,083
TIME TO UP THE STAKES
A LITTLE, ROY.

203
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,875
I'LL SEE YOUR LIFE
AND RAISE YOU ANOTHER.

204
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:27,333
- Axela: REMEMBER, THE OVERCLOCK
CAN ONLY BE USED THREE TIMES.

205
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,583
I'LL TRY TO KEEP YOU
UPDATED ON THE COUNT.

206
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,625
- Integra: UNDERSTOOD.

207
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,833
- HEY! HEY, ROY?

208
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,208
COME ON. WHERE ARE YOU?

209
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,833
- ROY?
- ( loud thudding )

210
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,916
- ( whirring )

211
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,958
- HA?

212
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,458
( screams )

213
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,541
- Rose: NO! GET BACK!

214
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,958
- Ho Chu: LISTEN TO THE LADY.

215
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,791
I GUESS THEY'RE RIGHT,
FOOLS DO RUSH IN.

216
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,541
- HO.

217
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,083
- EVERY ONE OF THOSE FLOOR
PANELS AROUND THE YOUNG LADY

218
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,416
TRIGGERS A PRESSURE
SENSITIVE MINE.

219
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,708
BUT, UNLIKE LAND MINES,

220
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,416
A PANEL OTHER THAN THE ONE
YOU STEP ON WILL EXPLODE.

221
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,041
WATCH!

222
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,708
- ( Rose screams )

223
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,833
- Ho Chu: VOILA! OF COURSE, THIS
ISN'T TRUE OF ALL THE PANELS.

224
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:51,458
SOME OF THEM ARE LAND MINES,
JUST TO KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES.

225
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,958
WHAT'S MORE, THE
YOUNG LADY'S CHAIR

226
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,541
IS ALSO A PRESSURE
SENSITIVE BOMB.

227
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:01,250
THE MOMENT THE YOUNG LADY
GETS UP, SHE GOES KABOOM!

228
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:05,375
AND, THE CHAIR IS ON A TIMER,
SO DON'T DAWDLE.

229
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,125
- OH, NO. I'VE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

230
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,958
ROSE NEEDS ME!

231
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,375
- ( whirring )

232
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,416
- ( Solty screams )

233
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,666
- Ho Chu: OH, AND
ONE MORE THING.

234
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,333
YOU SEE THOSE STAIRS
BEHIND THE YOUNG LADY?

235
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,166
I'M JUST UP THOSE STAIRS
ON THE NEXT FLOOR.

236
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,166
YOU CAN EITHER RESCUE HER,

237
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,166
OR YOU CAN LEAVE HER TO DIE
AND COME AFTER ME.

238
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,583
- NOW HOLD ON A MINUTE,
YOU'VE GOT TO RESCUE ME FIRST.

239
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,083
OH! WAIT, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD KILL HIM FIRST.

240
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,166
AND THEN YOU COULD COME
BACK HERE AND RESCUE ME.

241
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,416
NO, NO, WAIT!

242
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,291
WHAT IF YOU GET KILLED,
THEN WHAT WOULD I DO?

243
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,041
ARGH! LOOK! I DON'T CARE,
JUST DO SOMETHING!

244
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,666
- Ho Chu: SO WHICH IS IT,
THE LADY OR THE TIGER?

245
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,750
- THERE'S REALLY
NO CHOICE TO MAKE.

246
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,500
- Axela: I'VE GOT HIM!

247
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,291
HE'S NOT IN THE
BUILDING WE THOUGHT!

248
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,041
HE'S IN THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR.

249
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,041
- I'M ON IT!

250
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,833
- ( laughs maliciously )

251
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,958
SO HE DECIDED HE'D
RATHER PLAY THE HERO

252
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,208
AND RESCUE THE LADY.

253
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,458
AS I THOUGHT. GOOD THING
TOO OR ALL THE MAGNIFICENT

254
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,708
BOMBS I CREATED WOULD
HAVE GONE TO WASTE.

255
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,458
WELL, YOU DID A GOOD
JOB OF FINDING ME.

256
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,625
I AM IMPRESSED, MR. ANDERSON.

257
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,125
- FORTUNATELY I LIVE
UNDERGROUND. SO I KNOW

258
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,708
A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE
HABITS OF SEWER RATS LIKE YOU.

259
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,041
- ( gasps )

260
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,083
STOP! THAT'S FAR ENOUGH!

261
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,500
GO BACK THE WAY YOU CAME
AND TAKE CARE OF HO FIRST!

262
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,833
THEN YOU CAN COME BACK FOR ME!

263
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,833
ARE YOU LISTENING?

264
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,666
IT'S MY OWN FAULT
I'M IN THIS MESS!

265
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,375
I WAS CARELESS!
IT'S NOT YOUR JOB TO SAVE ME!

266
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,458
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
RISK YOUR LIFE FOR ME!

267
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,750
WE'RE PRACTICALLY STRANGERS!
YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING!

268
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,416
( gasps )

269
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,750
- ROSE, WE ARE FAR
FROM BEING STRANGERS.

270
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,250
( exhales )

271
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
NOW HOLD STILL.

272
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,666
- WHU... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

273
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,500
- I'M GONNA TRY TO
DISARM THE BOMB.

274
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,583
DON'T MOVE.

275
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,500
- ( screams )

276
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,333
- YOU WILL DISARM
THE BOMBS RIGHT NOW.

277
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,083
- YOU AREN'T SERIOUS, ARE YOU?

278
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,708
REALLY, WHY SHOULD I?

279
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,166
- CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO DIE.

280
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,708
- EH, IT'S TRUE,
I CAN'T SAY THAT I DO.

281
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,875
UNFORTUNATELY EVEN
I CAN'T STOP THEM.

282
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,833
ANY ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE WILL
JUST SET THEM OFF PREMATURELY.

283
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,666
- FUCK YOU.

284
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,916
- ( shot fires )

285
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,708
- Larry: WHO ARE YOU?

286
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,666
- R.U.C. SECURITY.
THIS MAN IS IN MY CUSTODY.

287
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,541
- ( laughs maliciously )

288
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,833
( grunts )

289
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,208
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

290
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,166
- I DON'T WORK FOR R.U.C., LADY.

291
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,625
- LARRY ANDERSON,

292
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,500
I'M PLACING YOU UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER OF HO CHU!

293
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,833
- YOU WANT MY GUN?

294
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,208
- Axela: ONE OVERCLOCK USE
REMAINING! BE CAREFUL!

295
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,958
- Rose: OKAY. OKAY.

296
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,041
YOU DID YOUR BEST,
NOW GET OUT OF HERE!

297
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,875
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
YOUR DAUGHTER, RIGHT?

298
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,208
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT WHAT
STARTED THIS WHOLE THING?

299
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,333
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP ON THAT NOW!

300
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,375
DON'T GET YOURSELF KILLED!
KEEP LOOKING FOR HER!

301
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,208
YOU GOTTA FORGET ABOUT ME, ROY.

302
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,875
GO FIND YOUR DAUGHTER.
SHE NEEDS YOU!

303
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:33,916
- SHUT UP!

304
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,500
SORRY, JUST KEEP STILL
A LITTLE LONGER.

305
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,458
- ( laughs maliciously )

306
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,833
- OH, GREAT, EVEN HIS
SKULL IS RESEMBLE.

307
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,125
- THAT'S RIGHT, I'LL LIVE.

308
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,708
WHICH IS MORE THAN
I CAN SAY FOR YOU.

309
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,291
( yells )

310
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,750
- THIS IS CALLED PAYBACK,
PRICK. ENJOY IT.

311
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,083
- ( screams )

312
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,041
( laughs maliciously )

313
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,916
YOU'LL NEVER STOP MY
BEAUTIFUL WORKS OF ART!

314
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,708
- ( exhales )

315
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,333
DAMMIT, I'VE REACHED MY LIMIT.

316
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,166
WHAT?

317
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,833
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

318
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,708
- IT'S USELESS.
THESE WIRES ARE ALL DUMMIES.

319
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,875
IT CAN'T BE DISMANTLED.

320
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,500
- WHAT? BUT YOU JUST GIVE UP
ON IT AFTER ALL THIS!

321
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,208
- I'M SORRY.

322
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,250
AT LEAST THIS TIME
WE'RE TOGETHER.

323
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,583
- Solty: ARE YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT?

324
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,500
ROY? ROSE?

325
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,708
- ( both coughing )

326
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,750
- SOLTY?

327
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,500
YOU SAVED US!

328
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,208
- YEAH, BUT THAT ONE WAS CLOSE.

329
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,541
- LARRY?

330
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,375
- HO CHU IS DEAD.

331
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:23,750
- I SEE.

332
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
- ROSE.

333
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,458
- YEAH?

334
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,583
- LISTEN, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

335
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,541
- INTEGRA!

336
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,625
- THE MISSION WAS
A COMPLETE FAILURE.

337
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,250
I'M SUCH A FOOL.

338
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:42,916
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

339
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,416
- OKAY.

340
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,041
- Rose: SO WAIT, YOU'RE SAYING
THAT ROY IS MY REAL FATHER?

341
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,791
- THAT'S RIGHT!
ISN'T IT GREAT?

342
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,166
I ALMOST COULDN'T BELIEVE
MY EARS WHEN I HEARD!

343
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,208
I MEAN, WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
THAT YOU AND ROY WOULD...

344
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,958
- SHUT UP!
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

345
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:00,916
THIS GUY?

346
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,500
THIS IS MY REAL FATHER?

347
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,708
AND YOU EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE THAT?

348
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,291
SO I'M NOT RELATED TO THE
BROTHERS I GREW UP WITH,

349
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,541
TO MY FAMILY?

350
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,166
- BUT ROSE, WHAT ABOUT
THE CLOTHES AND THE SHOES

351
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,375
YOU WERE WEARING, THE SONG?

352
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,666
- SO WHAT ABOUT THE CLOTHES?

353
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,416
SO WHAT ABOUT SHOES?

354
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,750
SO MY HAIR CHANGED COLOR!

355
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,166
SO I KNOW SOME OLD SONGS!

356
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,208
SO WHAT?

357
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,458
THOSE THINGS AREN'T ME!

358
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,291
THEY'RE NOT ME.

359
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,916
OR IF THEY ARE,
THEN WHO WAS I ALL THOSE YEARS?

360
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:34,166
I HAD A MOTHER, I HAD A FATHER,
I HAD OLDER BROTHERS.

361
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,708
I'VE BEEN ROSE ANDERSON
MY ENTIRE LIFE!

362
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,166
NOW WHO AM I?

363
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,416
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT RITA REVANT.

364
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,666
HAS MY ENTIRE LIFE BEEN A LIE?

365
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,958
- NO, NOT A LIE.
ROSE, LISTEN.

366
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,625
- SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT!

367
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,583
DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY,
OLD MAN?

368
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,958
( gasps )

369
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,458
- HE DESTROYED MY RIGHT ARM,
THE ARM I CREATED ART WITH,

370
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,083
AS REVENGE FOR THE LOSS
OF HIS DAUGHTER.

371
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,041
- ROSE, WE ARE FAR
FROM BEING STRANGERS.

372
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,583
AT LEAST THIS TIME
WE'RE TOGETHER.

373
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,166
- BUT... BUT ROSE, COME ON.

374
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,833
DON'T TAKE IT LIKE THIS,
ROY RISKED HIS LIFE TO SAVE YOU.

375
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,416
DON'T YOU SEE WHAT THAT MEANS?

376
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
YOU CAN'T JUST TURN YOUR...

377
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,625
- IT'S OKAY.

378
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,708
- BUT, ROY!

379
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,125
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

380
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,083
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THIS JUST GETS DUMPED ON ME.

381
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,541
YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO
KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

382
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,583
( sobbing )

383
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,625
- ROSE.

384
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,083
- ( Solty cries )

385
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,208
- ( theme song playing )

386
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,000
- Roy: WHAT THE HECK AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

387
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,208
- Rose: PERVERT!

388
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,875
- Solty: I WISH THOSE
TWO WOULD GET ALONG!

389
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,375
NEXT TIME, "DISTANCE."

390
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,208
HOW CLOSE TO
SOMEONE CAN YOU WALK

391
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,541
WITHOUT STEPPING ON THEIR FEET?
