2
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:55,916
- ( screams )

3
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,125
- ( theme song playing )

4
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

5
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,708
- ( groaning )

6
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,875
- DALE BOYD,
24 COUNTS OF THEFT,

7
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:05,500
11 COUNTS, ASSAULT,
6 COUNTS, SEXUAL ASSAULT.

8
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:09,208
GAME'S UP. I'M BRINGING YOU IN
FOR THE BOUNTY.

9
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,708
- SINCE WHEN'S THIS
THE WAY YOU HUNTERS WORK?

10
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,833
BOUNTY OR NO BOUNTY,
I'M NOT RESISTING HERE, MAN.

11
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,291
YOU CAN'T SHOOT...

12
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:22,416
UH, YOU... YOU CAN'T SHOOT ME.
THEY'LL REVOKE YOUR LICENSE.

13
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,625
- OH, SHUT UP.
THIS IS THE WAY I WORK.

14
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,375
- HOLD IT!

15
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,333
INTEGRA, WE'RE CLOSING IN.

16
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,000
- SO, WHO IS THIS
WE'RE CHASING, ANYWAY?

17
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,666
- LOOK SHARP OUT THERE,
YOU GUYS.

18
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,583
YOUR TARGET WAS CAUGHT BREAKING
INTO A TOP SECURITY AREA.

19
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,916
WE WANT HER BROUGHT IN
FOR QUESTIONING, IMMEDIATELY.

20
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,875
- ROGER THAT.
CELICA, STAY BACK.

21
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,625
- OKAY. JUST GO EASY
THIS TIME, SILVIA.

22
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,375
I THINK THE IDEA IS,
THEY WANT HER ALIVE.

23
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,333
- YEAH, THANKS. I KNOW.

24
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,791
( groans )

25
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,916
- THAT'S ENOUGH! WHAT IN THE
HECK ARE YOU, SOME KIND OF...

26
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,875
- SORRY, SHE, UH, SHE GOT AWAY.

27
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,458
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE, AXELA?

28
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,500
- NOTHING. WE'RE PICKING UP WAY
TOO MUCH AURORA INTERFERENCE.

29
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,416
IT'S JAMMING UP
ALL OF OUR SENSORS.

30
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,291
WE'VE LOST THE TARGET.

31
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,583
- BASTARD! MY PARTNER'LL HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS!

32
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,500
- YOU SCUMBAGS ARE ALL THE SAME.

33
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,958
LEMME GUESS, THIS IS THE PART
WHERE YOU START MAKING THREATS?

34
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,708
- OKAY, JUST TAKE IT EASY, MAN.

35
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,041
YOU GOT ME.
I... I GIVE UP, ALL RIGHT?

36
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,916
GO AHEAD, TAKE ME IN.

37
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,125
( laughs )

38
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,875
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
WHERE THE HELL DID HE GO?

39
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,000
- NICE TRY, ASSHOLE.

40
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,208
YOU PUNKS GO OUT
AND GET A RESEMBLE ARM,

41
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,708
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU
START THINKING YOU'RE CLEVER.

42
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,958
- DON'T SHOOT!

43
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,250
COME ON, CUT ME A BREAK.
I'M JUST A SMALL-TIMER.

44
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,208
I ONLY STEAL TO GET BY SINCE I
LOST MY ARM IN THE BLAST FALL.

45
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,416
WHATEVER THE BOUNTY ON ME IS,

46
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,250
IT CAN'T BE WORTH
KILLING ME OVER!

47
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,250
- YOU WERE IN THE BLAST FALL?

48
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,916
- TELL YOU WHAT,
LET'S MAKE A DEAL.

49
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,875
WHATEVER THEY'RE PAYING YOU,
I'LL DOUBLE IT, YEAH?

50
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,166
COME ON, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

51
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,625
- WHY ARE YOU STILL BREATHING?

52
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,708
WHY IS A WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT
LIKE YOU STILL ALIVE?

53
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,125
- HEY, WAIT! ( groaning )

54
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,875
WAIT! NO! STOP IT!

55
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:06,958
- Newscaster on TV:
AND NOW,

56
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,416
HERE ARE HIS MORNING'S
TOP HEADLINES.

57
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,541
YESTERDAY, A PANEL OF
LEADING EXPERTS TESTIFIED

58
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,625
BEFORE AN R.U.C.
GOVERNMENT SECTOR SUBCOMMITTEE

59
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,666
IN REGARD TO
THE ALTITUDE CEILING.

60
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,208
ACCORDING TO THEIR FINDINGS,

61
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,708
AURORA WAVE ELECTROMAGNETIC
PRESSURE LEVELS HAVE REMAINED

62
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,625
VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED OVER
THE LAST 12-MONTH PERIOD.

63
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,041
BASED ON THIS EVIDENCE,
THE COMMITTEE AGREED UNANIMOUSLY

64
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,833
TO ONCE AGAIN
POSTPONE REVISION

65
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,666
OF THE ALTITUDE CEILING
UNTIL NEXT YEAR.

66
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,041
TODAY'S WEATHER FORECAST.

67
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,250
CLEAR SKIES AND A LIGHT
SOUTHERLY BREEZE SHOULD MAKE

68
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,750
FOR PLEASANT CONDITIONS
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.

69
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,791
HOWEVER, SOME AREAS
WILL BE STRONGLY AFFECTED

70
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,333
BY THE AURORA...

00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,958

AT A HIGH PRICE!

00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,916

- EH, HE'LL LIVE.

110

- ( grunts ) YOU! SO WHAT?
THAT'S NOT THE POINT!

111
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,833
WE'VE GOT A REPUTATION
TO THINK ABOUT!

112
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,041
IF ONE OF OUR HUNTERS IS
OUT THERE ACTING LIKE A MANIAC,

113
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,375
IT MAKES THE WHOLE OFFICE
LOOK BAD! WRONG WITH YOU?

114
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,875
- THAT S.O.B.'S
AS CRAZY AS EVER.

115
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,708
- YEAH. POOR BASTARD NEVER
GOT OVER HIS DAUGHTER'S DEATH!

116
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,166
WHAT'S IT BEEN, 12 YEARS?

117
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,375
- COOL IT, MISTER!
YOU GOT ME?

118
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,416
- ROY, COULD YOU LINK UP FOR ME?

119
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,666
- YEAH.

120
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,958
- OKAY. THAT CERTIFIES
THE CAPTURE OF DALE BOYD.

121
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,916
I'LL GO AHEAD AND WIRE
THE BOUNTY TO YOUR ACCOUNT.

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,333
AND, ONE MORE TIME

123
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,333
- GREAT. NOW LISTEN.

124
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,708
PLEASE BE MORE CAREFUL.

125
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,250
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED
TO YOU OUT THERE,

126
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,375
SARAH WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME.

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,500
OH, AND, ROY...

128
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,416
IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS,

129
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,541
I STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN
THIS MONTH'S RENT.

130
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,125
- YEAH, WELL TAKE IT OUT OF
MY PAY LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

131
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,833
- OH, COME ON,
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

132
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,875
I DON'T CARE IF HE WAS
YOUR BEST FRIEND'S HUSBAND!

133
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,916
YOU GOTTA STOP BEING
SO EASY ON HIM!

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,125
- I KNOW.

135
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,666
BUT WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?
- ( sighs )

136
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,916
- Roy: SO, UH, HOW DO YOU
LIKE YOUR NEW SHOES?

137
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,666
- I LOVE 'EM, DADDY!
THEY'RE SO PRETTY!

138
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,708
- GOOD. ( chuckles )

139
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,208
( sobs )

140
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,291
- Man onTV: THOUGH THE EXACT
CAUSES ARE STILL UNCLEAR,

141
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,208
THE INVESTIGATION
INTO THE RECENT ACCIDENT

142
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,750
HAS REVEALED AN ABNORMAL RISE

143
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,958
IN AURORA WAVE ELECTROMAGNETIC
PRESSURE LEVELS.

144
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,416
AT PRESENT,
THE DEATH COUNT STANDS...

145
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,541
- ( grunts )

146
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,458
( sobs ) NO. SHE'S NOT DEAD.

147
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,291
MY RITA'S NOT DEAD!

148
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:38,000
I SWEAR, I WILL FIND HER,
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES!

149
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,625
- ( laughs ) OKAY.

150
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,833
BUT WHAT SHOULD WE EAT
FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

151
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,541
- UM, PASGHETTI!

152
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,875
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM!

153
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,041
- ( laughs ) ALL RIGHT.
"PASGHETTI" IT IS.

154
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,000
- ( in sing-song voice )
PASGHETTI, PASGHETTI!

155
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,791
- ( explosion )

156
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,458
- ( groans )

157
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,666
- MY PARTNER DALE SAYS HELLO.
NOW DIE!

158
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:50,208
COME ON, MAN, GIVE IT UP.
I KNOW YOU'RE HERE.

159
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,166
HOW MUCH FURTHER YOU
THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET

160
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,083
ON THAT LEG, HUH?

161
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,916
MIGHT AS WELL COME ON OUT
AND GET IT OVER WITH.

162
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,875
MAKE IT EASY
ON THE BOTH OF US.

163
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,625
HA! HUNTER SCUM!

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,250
- YOU'RE EVEN MORE PREDICTABLE

165
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,333
THAN THAT STUPID-ASS
PARTNER OF YOURS.

166
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,250
AND FOR YOUR SAKE,

167
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,458
YOU BETTER HOPE YOUR BOUNTY'S
ENOUGH TO BUY ME A NEW COAT.

168
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,333
- HOW'S THIS FOR PREDICTABLE?

169
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,541
THAT'S RIGHT, I'VE STILL GOT
A FEW TRICKS UP MY SLEEVE!

170
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,250
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE COAT.

171
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,208
YOU WON'T NEED IT
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

172
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,125
I HEAR IT'S PRETTY WARM IN HELL!

173
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,750
WHA...

174
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:53,916
( groans )

175
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,791
- SHE SAVED MY LIFE.

176
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,750
BUT WHAT THE HELL IS SHE?

177
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,583
- ( sighs )

178
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,833
- SO YOU'RE AWAKE, HUH?

179
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,458
YOU OKAY?

180
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,083
- ( sobs )

181
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,458
- HEY! WHAT'S THE MATTER?

182
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,458
SO WHAT'S WRONG?

183
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,583
YOU IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE,
THAT IT?

184
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,958
DON'T WORRY, I WON'T
CALL THE COPS ON YOU.

185
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,041
LEAST I CAN DO, YOU KNOW,
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

186
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,291
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU DOING OUT THERE?

187
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,666
AND DRESSED LIKE THAT?

188
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,916
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

189
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,750
OKAY, WHERE'RE YOU FROM?

190
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,583
WHAT, CAN'T YOU TALK?

191
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,666
- NO.

192
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,916
NO, I MEAN, I, I CAN TALK.

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,458
- ( sighs )

194
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,750
I HAVE WORK TO DO.
YOU CAN KEEP THE CLOTHES.

195
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,916
FINISH YOUR DRINK
AND GO ON HOME.

196
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,375
DOOR LOCKS AUTOMATICALLY.

197
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,125
DON'T LET IT HIT YOU
ON THE WAY OUT.

198
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,000
- Man: DALE BOYD'S PARTNER.
YEAH, I KNOW HIM.

199
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,208
GRAY WALKER. SMALLTIME CROOK,
TWO RESEMBLE ARMS.

200
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,666
VINDICTIVE S.O.B., THOUGH.

201
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,541
I GUARANTEE
HE'LL COME AFTER YOU AGAIN.

202
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,208
- ANY IDEA WHERE HE'S STAYING?
- NAH. NO ONE PLACE.

203
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,666
LIKES TO KEEP MOVING.
YOU KNOW THE TYPE.

204
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,125
- YEAH, RIGHT.

205
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,541
YOU AGAIN? WHAT THE HELL?

206
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,625
- WHAT? YOU KNOW THAT ONE
OR SOMETHING?

207
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,625
- ( screams )
- NO.

208
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,250
WOULD YOU STOP FOLLOWING ME!

209
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,500
- AND HERE WE ARE!

210
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,625
THIS IS THE BLAST FALL MEMORIAL,

211
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:39,041
BUILT IN COMMEMORATION OF ALL
THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES

212
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,541
IN THE GREAT DISASTER
12 YEARS AGO.

213
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,500
- YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHY YOU'RE FOLLOWING ME?

214
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,500
- Guide: NOW IS THERE
ANYONE IN OUR GROUP

215
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,250
WHO ISN'T ALREADY
FAMILIAR WITH...

216
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,416
- YOU GOT A HOME
TO GO TO, RIGHT?

217
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,666
SO GO. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

218
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,416
( sighs ) I'M LEAVING.

219
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,166
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
TAGGING ALONG, GOT ME?

220
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,291
DON'T!

221
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,458
- COME ON, MAN,
NO SLEEPING ON THE JOB!

222
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:30,583
( laughs ) HEY, BUDDY.
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

223
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,333
- HEY.

224
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,875
WHY'RE YOU STILL FOLLOWING ME?

225
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,125
FOR THE LAST TIME,
JUST GO ON HOME.

226
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,333
DON'T YOU HAVE A FAMILY?
SOMETHING?

227
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:13,500
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
I REALLY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

228
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:17,000
- YEAH, THAT'S SAD.
BUT I CAN'T HELP ANYMORE, KID.

229
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,208
YOU SAVED MY LIFE YESTERDAY,
SO I LET YOU STAY THE NIGHT.

230
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,791
THAT'S ALL.
GO FIND SOMEONE ELSE.

231
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,250
- W-WAIT.

232
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,666
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY?

233
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,541
- WHY DO YOU CARE?

234
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,458
IT'S NONE OF YOUR
DAMN BUSINESS.

235
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,125
NOW GO ON, GET LOST.

236
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,208
- HEY, ROY REVANT!
REMEMBER ME? HA!

237
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,541
- UH, THANK YOU,
BUT YOU REALLY...

238
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,250
- STUPID KID.
GET OUTTA HERE! NOW!

239
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,166
( groans )

240
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,208
- ( laughs diabolically )

241
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,708
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
MY NEW TOY? NICE, HUH?

242
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,125
I STOLE IT FROM R.U.C. SECURITY!

243
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,625
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, ROY?
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN!

244
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,708
YEAH! THAT'S THE WAY!
GO AHEAD AND RUN!

245
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,541
( laughs ) TELL YOU WHAT, WE'LL
EVEN GIVE YOU A HEAD START.

246
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,666
THAT LITTLE SCRATCH I GAVE HIM
IS SLOWING HIM DOWN.

247
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,875
- HA! SO HOW ABOUT WE PUT HIM
OUT OF HIS MISERY?

248
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,416
DIE, ASSHOLE!

249
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,416
- WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?

250
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,041
- YOU DIDN'T LET ME THANK YOU
FOR SAVING ME BACK THERE.

251
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,000
YOU KNEW YOUR LEG WAS HURT,
BUT YOU STILL PROTECTED ME.

252
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,750
SO IT'S MY TURN AND NOW
I'M GOING TO PROTECT YOU.

253
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,750
- WHAT?

254
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,541
- Dale: YO, KID! WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

255
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,541
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE!

256
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,708
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN DIE WITH HIM!

257
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:55,708
SHIT! BOUNCED RIGHT OFF HER!
SHE'S A RES. SHE'S GOTTA BE!

258
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:56,916
- NO. NO WAY!

259
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,958
THEY DON'T MAKE RESEMBLE ARMOR
THAT STRONG!

260
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,500
- DAMMIT!

261
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,250
WHAT THE...

262
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,291
- HOW?

263
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,000
- ( Solty yells )

264
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,458
LIKE I TRIED TO TELL YOU,

265
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:27,041
I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

266
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,416
NOT EVEN WHO I AM.

267
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,958
- YOU MESSED WITH
THE WRONG GUY, KID!

268
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,625
- OR WHY...

269
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,416
- DIE!

270
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,833
- ...I CAN DO THINGS LIKE THIS!

271
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,416
I HATE BAD PEOPLE!

272
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,750
- THE AURORA SHELL!
WE'RE GOING TOO HIGH!

273
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,333
PULL OUT OF IT.
PULL OUT...

274
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,750
- THEY HIT THE ALTITUDE CEILING.
JESUS H. CHRIST.

275
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,375
YOU SAVED MY LIFE AGAIN.

276
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,750
YOU ASKED ME EARLIER
IF I HAD A FAMILY.

277
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,791
WELL, I HAD A WIFE ONCE.
BUT SHE'S DEAD NOW.

278
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,250
CANCER.

279
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,916
TIME WE CAUGHT IT,
IT WAS TOO LATE.

280
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,666
WE HAD A DAUGHTER,
THOUGH, RITA.

281
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,750
SHE'S ALL THE FAMILY
I'VE GOT LEFT.

282
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,708
MEANS I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DEAL
WITH YOU. DON'T FOLLOW ME.

283
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,750
- ( theme song playing )

284
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

285
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,166
- Solty: WHERE DID
I COME FROM? WHERE?

286
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,666
NEXT TIME, "A NEW DAWN."

287
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,250
WOULD YOU MIND IF WE MET?
