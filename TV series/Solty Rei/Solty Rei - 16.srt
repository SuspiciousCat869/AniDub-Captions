1
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,208
- Joseph: IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

2
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,166
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU COULD HAVE DONE.

3
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,166
- DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
WHY THIS HAPPENED?

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,083
- SADLY, I DO.

5
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,708
- PLEASE, TELL ME.

6
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,125
- YOU SEE...

7
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,291
WILL, HE...

8
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,583
HE RAN OUT OF TIME.

9
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,416
- AND YOU STILL HAD SOLTY,
YOU BASTARD!

10
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,000
- THAT HURT.

11
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,291
- ( theme song playing )

12
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,625
- WILL HAD A
TROUBLED CHILDHOOD.

14
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,083
HIS PARENTS ABANDONED HIM
WHEN HE WAS ONLY FOUR.

15
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,125
BY THE TIME HE REALIZED
THEY WERE GONE,

16
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,833
HE'D BEEN WANDERING
THE STREETS FOR DAYS.

17
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,791
IT'S A MIRACLE HE
SURVIVED EVEN THAT.

18
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,916
MUCH LESS THE BLAST FALL.

19
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,416
- ( explosion )

20
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,500
- Joseph: WILL TEETERED ON THE
BRINK OF LIFE AND DEATH,

21
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,458
BUT SOMEHOW HE
FOUGHT THROUGH IT.

22
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,875
WHAT ACTUALLY SAVED HIM
WAS RESEMBLE TECHNOLOGY,

23
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,875
WHICH AT THE TIME WAS STILL IN
ITS EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT.

24
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:40,291
UNFORTUNATELY, HIS APPOINTED
PHYSICIAN WAS A CORRUPT MAN,

25
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,250
MORE INTERESTED IN
THE VICTIMS' CLAIMS

26
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,833
PAID OUT BY THE CITY THAN
IN THE VICTIMS THEMSELVES.

27
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,375
HE USED INFERIOR PARTS,

28
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,041
AND PROVIDED ONLY THE BARE
MINIMUM OF TREATMENT.

29
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:54,125
AS A RESULT, WILL'S BODY BEGAN
TO DETERIORATE INTERNALLY.

30
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,875
BEFORE HE EVEN KNEW
THERE WAS A PROBLEM,

31
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,666
IT WAS ALREADY TOO LATE.

32
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,000
- SO WILL KNEW THIS WAS COMING
ALL THIS TIME?

33
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,750
HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO DIE?
YOU BOTH DID?

34
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,166
- YES, WE BOTH DID.
- THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU...

35
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,916
- I GAVE UP ON THIS WORLD
A LONG TIME AGO.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,750
I'M ONLY A SPECTATOR NOW.

37
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,625
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

38
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,291
- BUT, STILL,
THAT'S NO REASON TO...

39
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,125
- WILL WANDERED INTO THE DESERT
AND FOUND MY HOUSE.

40
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,458
HIS DECISION TO STAY HERE
WAS HIS OWN.

41
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,750
PERHAPS HE LIKED IT HERE
BECAUSE I KEPT TO MYSELF,

42
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,708
OR MAYBE HE JUST ENJOYED
THE ISOLATION OF THIS PLACE.

43
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,916
IN ANY CASE, I'M REMINDED
OF A CONVERSATION WE HAD.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,416
- DID I EVER TELL YOU, GRAMPS,
ABOUT THAT DAY?

45
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,125
ABOUT THE GLOWING SNOW
I SAW FALLING ON THE CITY?

46
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,833
- THE SNOW WAS GLOWING?

47
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,625
- YEAH. YEAH IT WAS.

48
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,541
IT'S A SIGHT I'LL NEVER FORGET.

49
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:49,958
THE BLAST FALL. IT WAS
THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE.

50
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,958
BUT THE PART I REMEMBER,

51
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,125
IT'S LAYING THERE, QUIETLY,
WATCHING THE SNOW.

52
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,708
IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL, MAGICAL.

53
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,666
I KNEW SOMETHING TERRIBLE
HAD HAPPENED,

54
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,291
BUT IN THAT MOMENT,
NOTHING ELSE MATTERED.

55
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,166
CAUSE MY EYES WERE FILLED WITH
A MILLION FALLING LIGHTS.

56
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,291
- SO IS THAT IT? YOU'RE
BUILDING THIS PLANE

57
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,208
SO YOU CAN SEE THIS
GLOWING SNOW AGAIN?

58
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,791
- ( chuckles ) NO.
THAT'S JUST CRAZY.

59
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,125
I'D DIE BEFORE
I EVER GOT HIGH ENOUGH.

60
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,125
- OKAY, THEN WHY?

61
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,250
- I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS,

62
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,000
MAYBE I JUST WANT TO FEEL
THAT PEACE AGAIN.

63
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:29,041
LIKE THE WAY I FELT WHEN
I WAS WATCHING THAT SNOW.

64
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,708
I JUST WANT TO BELIEVE
THAT THE WORLD IS BEAUTIFUL.

65
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,291
- LIKE I SAID, I AM ONLY
A SPECTATOR IN THIS LIFE.

66
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,291
I DON'T CONCERN MYSELF WITH
THE BUSINESS OF OTHERS.

67
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,708
WHATEVER IT IS YOU DECIDE
TO DO FROM HERE,

68
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,041
STAY OR GO, IT'S YOUR CHOICE,

69
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,791
AND YOURS ALONE.

70
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,250
- ( footsteps approaching )

71
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,083
- YOU CLEANED UP. GOOD.

72
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,083
I TAKE IT THIS MEANS
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER?

73
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,083
- YEP. EXCEPT FOR THE
SORE FACE, THAT IS.

74
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,500
YOU PACK A MEAN PUNCH.

75
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,958
- YEAH, WELL, I THINK IT HURT
ME MORE THAN IT DID YOU.

76
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:17,125
- JUST LIKE OLD TIMES, HUH?
HOW LONG'S IT BEEN, MIRANDA?

77
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,625
- WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY REALLY.

78
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,666
YOU WERE JUST STARTING
OUT AS A HUNTER THEN.

79
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,291
- THAT'S RIGHT. YOU HAD TO KNOCK
ME BACK IN LINE THEN, TOO.

80
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,125
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
WITHOUT YOU, MIRANDA.

81
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,958
- HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND?

82
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,666
- YEAH. I'VE COME TO MY SENSES.

83
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,000
- ( keyboard clacking )

84
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,458
- THEY STILL HAVEN'T FOUND HER.

85
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,208
- WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

86
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,750
OH, A MISSING PERSONS
BULLETIN BOARD?

87
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,208
YOU'RE STILL SEARCHING FOR
YOUR PARENTS AREN'T YOU?

88
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,666
FOUND ANY NEW LEADS?

89
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,833
- HEY. YOU CAN CHECK YOUR
EMAIL LATER. WE'VE GOTTA GO.

90
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,791
- UH, RIGHT.
- YEAH, OKAY.

91
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,583
DON'T WORRY, AXELA. I DON'T
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT.

92
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,750
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.
I WON'T TELL ANYBODY.

93
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,041
- THANKS, CELICA.
I APPRECIATE IT.

94
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,000
- BUT IN EXCHANGE
FOR MY SILENCE,

95
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,208
DINNER IS ON YOU TONIGHT.

96
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,958
OKAY? GOOD. IT'S A DEAL.

97
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,333
- WHAT?

98
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,291
- NOW WHERE DID SHE GO?

99
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,375
ARE YOU GOING TO
REPAIR THE PLANE?

100
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,625
- YES.

101
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,750
- AND JUST WHY WOULD
YOU DO THAT?

102
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,791
IS THIS FOR WILL?

103
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,291
- I'M NOT REALLY SURE, I GUESS.

104
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,583
I JUST KNOW THAT IT'S
SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO.

105
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,416
- ( sighs )

106
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,208
WELL, THAT'S THE FRAME
FOR THE FUSELAGE.

107
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,208
IT SUPPORTS THE
ENTIRE STRUCTURE.

108
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,500
UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
DOING, IF YOU ALTER THE SHAPE,

109
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,833
IT MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO BEAR THE LOAD.

110
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,166
YOU UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLES
INVOLVED, CORRECT?

111
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,208
BASIC AERODYNAMICS, FOR A PLANE
TO FLY, IT NEEDS TO PRODUCE

112
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:07,458
ENOUGH LIFT AND THRUST TO
OVERCOME GRAVITY AND DRAG.

113
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,416
TO HANDLE THE ASSOCIATED STRESS,
THE STRUCTURE OF THE AIRFRAME

114
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
NEEDS TO BE
PRECISELY CALCULATED.

115
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,500
IT NEEDS TO BE STURDY,
AND AS LIGHTWEIGHT AS POSSIBLE.

116
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,208
- UM. OH OKAY.

117
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,291
- WILL'S DESIGN SKETCHES

118
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,041
SHOULD BE ON THE
WORKBENCH OVER THERE.

119
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,541
I SUGGEST YOU FAMILIARIZE
YOURSELF WITH THEM.

120
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,125
TRUST ME, IT WILL
BE MUCH EASIER

121
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,250
THAN TRYING TO BUILD
THIS FROM SCRATCH.

122
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,791
- RIGHT. I'LL DO THAT.
THANK YOU.

123
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,750
- OH, IT'S NOTHING. JUST
AN OLD MAN'S RAMBLINGS.

124
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,750
SO MANY OF US HAVE PASTS
WE'D JUST AS SOON FORGET.

125
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,625
BUT THE WEIGHT OF OUR SINS
IS TOO GREAT TO CAST ASIDE.

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,625
YOURS AND MINE, BOTH.

127
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,291
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
SERIOUSLY PLANNING

128
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,166
TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS?

129
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,458
YOU KNOW THE RISKS INVOLVED.

130
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,666
THE CHANCES OF A BACKFIRE
ARE TOO GREAT.

131
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,666
HOW COULD YOU PERSIST?

132
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,375
THEN THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
I CAN DO TO STOP YOU.

133
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,583
I WALKED AWAY FROM YOU THAT DAY,

134
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,708
THE MOMENT OF MY
GREATEST FAILURE.

135
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,708
AND I NEVER LOOKED BACK.

136
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,916
I CHOSE TO BECOME AN
OBSERVER, BUT NOT YOU.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,708
YOUR BLIND AMBITION
KNOWS NO END, ASHLEY.

138
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,291
- Integra: DIRECTOR.

139
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,833
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW,

140
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,083
WE'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS IN
THE CLOCK TOWER INVESTIGATION.

141
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,750
IT SEEMS OUR SUSPECT,
JEREMY KOLBEL,

142
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,916
WAS IN FACT ACTING ALONE.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,458
AND THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE,

144
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,666
COMPARED TO THE AURORA WAVE
POTENTIAL WAS APPROXIMATELY...

145
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,083
- YOU CAN SPARE ME
THE DETAILS FOR NOW.

146
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,125
I TRUST YOUR TEAM HAS
EVERYTHING WELL IN HAND.

147
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,583
ONCE YOUR REPORT
HAS BEEN FINALIZED,

148
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:47,750
I'LL BE HAPPY TO READ IT.

149
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,208
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU HAVE YOUR ORDERS.

150
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,000
HOW'S IT LOOKING?

151
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,875
SHE'S SUPERIOR TO AXELA IN EVERY
WAY, JUST AS I ANTICIPATED.

152
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,916
IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME,

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,791
BUT IT SEEMS I'LL FINALLY
BE FREE OF YOUR CURSE.

154
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,458
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

155
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,791
- SILVIA, I HAVE A QUESTION.

156
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,208
- HMM? WHAT IS IT?

157
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,708
- YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

158
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,916
- DON'T YOU HAVE A REPORT
TO WRITE? GET TO WORK!

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,583
- YEAH, YEAH.

160
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,250
- DID IT SEEM LIKE THE
OPERATIONS DIRECTOR

161
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,750
WAS ACTING A BIT STRANGE?

162
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,125
- NO. I DON'T KNOW.
STRANGE HOW?

163
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,208
- I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

164
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,166
I CAN'T QUITE PUT
A FINGER ON IT.

165
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,416
- HE SEEMED THE SAME
AS ALWAYS, I GUESS.

166
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,416
I MEAN, MAYBE HE
WAS A LITTLE ABRUPT,

167
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,125
BUT THAT'S COMPLETELY
UNDERSTANDABLE.

168
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,291
HE'S HAD HIS HANDS FULL LATELY.

169
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,833
- Celica: MAYBE HE
WAS UPSET BECAUSE

170
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,416
HE GOT IN A FIGHT WITH
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

171
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,583
I HEAR SOMEONE SPOTTED HIM
ON A DATE NOT TO LONG AGO.

172
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,666
- Silvia: SHUT UP AND
GET BACK TO WORK.

173
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,250
- FINE.

174
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,750
- SO NOTHING SEEMED UNUSUAL?

175
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,208
- NO, NOT REALLY.

176
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,416
- AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
AS LONG AS I GET PAID,

177
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,166
HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,833
- UH?
- UH.

179
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,833
- ( computer bleeps )

180
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,250
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

181
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,791
- HERE. IT'S EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER

182
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,583
SO FAR ON SOLTY'S WHEREABOUTS.

183
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,000
- YEAH, GOOD.
THANKS, MIRANDA.

184
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,875
- IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN
THANK ME WHEN YOU GET BACK.

185
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,750
- LOOK, ROY, IF YOU'RE
GOING OUT TO FIND SOLTY,

186
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:44,666
TAKE ME WITH YOU.

187
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,125
- I'M DOING THIS ALONE.
- BUT...

188
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,541
- LISTEN YUTO, SORRY.

189
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,875
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO ON MY OWN.

190
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,125
- THEN GET GOING, WILL YOU?
- KASHA...

191
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,625
- STOP WASTING TIME
AND GO FIND HER.

192
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,750
MOVE IT!

193
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,333
- OKAY. I'M GOING, I'M GOING.

194
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,625
- WHAT TOOK HIM SO LONG?
STUPID.

195
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,625
- THANK GOODNESS. IT'S NOT
NEARLY AS BAD AS I THOUGHT.

196
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,375
I SHOULD HAVE THIS BACK IN
WORKING CONDITION IN NO TIME.

- ( machine beeping )

208
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:18,583
- LINES 42, 42 AND 49
THROUGH 66 ARE IN THE RED.

209
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,125
SEVEN MORE ARE
APPROACHING CRITICAL.

210
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,791
- HEART RATE AND RESPIRATION
RISING RAPIDLY.

211
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:27,250
- STRESS CO-EFFICIENT RISING.
WE'RE SEEING SIGNS OF REJECTION.

212
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,833
- PUPILS DILATED.

213
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,583
CONTROL SPEED DECREASING.

214
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:34,291
- THIS IS AS FAR AS SHE CAN GO.
WE CAN'T PUSH HER ANYMORE, SIR.

215
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,875
- WELL, THEN THAT SETTLES IT.

216
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,333
- ( gasping )

217
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:52,416
- HEY SOLTY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ISN'T THE VIEW AMAZING?

218
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,875
- YEAH. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

219
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:08,500
- I JUST WANT TO BELIEVE
THAT THE WORLD IS BEAUTIFUL.

220
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,291
ANYWAY, MY NAME'S WILL.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

221
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,833
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
WITH WHAT YOU DO HAVE,

222
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,958
WELL THEN THE CURE
FOR THAT IS SIMPLE.

223
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,958
YOU JUST HAVE TO
THROW IT ALL AWAY.

224
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,833
THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE
TO LET IT ALL GO.

225
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,000
WHY'S THAT SO SURPRISING?

226
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,583
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS THAT
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU?

227
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,541
BUT BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THIS,
I WAS HALF SERIOUS, TOO.

228
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,750
- Solty: FLY!

229
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,291
- Will: WELL, HAVE YOU DECIDED
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO YET?

230
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,208
COME ON, LET'S HEAR IT.

231
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,041
- YOU KNOW I REALLY
LOVED YOU, WILL.

232
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,083
MORE THAN YOU COULD
EVER IMAGINE.

233
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,500
- I'M HALF KIDDING.
GOTCHA.

234
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,708
YOU KNEW ALL ALONG,
DIDN'T YOU, WILL?

235
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,166
ABOUT YOUR HEALTH.
THAT MUST HAVE SO BEEN HARD.

236
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,250
WAS IT PAINFUL? DID IT HURT?

237
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,375
- I MADE MY CHOICE
A LONG TIME AGO.

238
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,500
- HUH?

239
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,250
ALL THE PAIN,
ALL THE FRUSTRATION,

240
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,500
I JUST DECIDED TO
THROW IT ALL AWAY.

241
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,458
- BUT WHY?

242
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,666
- CAUSE I REALIZED I HAD BECOME
INCAPABLE OF LAUGHING.

243
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,875
AND SINCE I WAS GOING TO
LIVE A SHORT LIFE,

244
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,791
I WANTED THAT LIFE TO BE
FILLED WITH LAUGHTER.

245
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,458
- YOU'RE A STRONG PERSON, WILL.

246
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,875
NOT ME, I CAN'T
MAKE MYSELF LAUGH.

247
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,333
- BECAUSE YOU
CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING,

248
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,958
YOU'RE JUST A MACHINE!

249
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,625
- I STILL DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO LAUGH ABOUT.

250
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,875
- Will: I'M TELLING YOU.
THROW IT ALL AWAY.

251
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,333
WHETHER IT'S FAMILY,
OR FRIENDS,

252
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,333
LOVE, LIFE, WHATEVER IT IS,

253
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,958
YOU CAN THROW IT ALL AWAY AND
START OVER ANYTIME YOU WANT.

254
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,208
ALL IT TAKES IS THE DECISION TO
DO IT, AND IT'S ALL GONE, BUT...

255
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,208
I REMEMBER THE REST.

256
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,666
BUT IF I'M WORRIED
ABOUT REGRETS,

257
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,500
I SHOULD TRY TO HOLD
ON TO EVERYTHING

258
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,125
A LITTLE BIT LONGER, RIGHT?

259
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,750
THEN I CAN ALWAYS
THROW IT AWAY LATER.

260
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,750
SIMPLE AS THAT.

261
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:00,250
YOU MAKE IT SOUND EASY.
YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT.

262
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,041
- ( chuckles ) YEAH WELL...

263
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,916
- DO YOU THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO
LAUGH AGAIN SOME DAY?

264
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,666
I MEAN, AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED, CAN I?

265
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,291
- ( sobbing loudly )

266
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,208
- ( door opening )

267
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,958
- SO THEN, DID YOU ENJOY
YOUR MAIDEN FLIGHT?

268
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,708
- YES.

269
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:01,041
- CONGRATULATIONS. I'M SURE
WILL WOULD BE HAPPY FOR YOU.

270
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,708
- WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
IF I ASKED YOU A QUESTION?

271
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,250
- GO AHEAD.

272
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,333
- IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING WILL
SAID TO ME, THERE AT THE END.

273
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,875
HE SAID,

274
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,000
HE JUST WANTED TO LEAVE HIS
OWN LITTLE MARK ON THE WORLD,

275
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,750
WHILE THERE WAS STILL TIME.

276
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,708
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE MEANT BY THAT?

277
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,291
- I THINK HE JUST WANTED
SOMEONE TO REMEMBER HIM.

278
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,250
HE WANTED TO KNOW THAT,
AFTER HE WAS GONE,

279
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,666
THERE WOULD BE AT LEAST
ONE PERSON IN THIS WORLD

280
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,666
TO KEEP HIS MEMORY ALIVE.
PERHAPS IT WAS SELFISH,

281
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,333
PLACING THAT
RESPONSIBILITY ON YOU.

282
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,541
- NO. I'LL NEVER FORGET WILL.

283
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,166
I'LL CARRY HIS MEMORY
WITH ME, ALWAYS.

284
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,333
- WELL, GOOD.

285
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,125
- ALL OF MY MEMORIES OF WILL,
OF EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,

286
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,750
I'LL NEVER THROW
ANY OF THEM AWAY.

287
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,291
THEY'RE ALL I HAVE.

288
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,666
- AS FOR YOUR FUTURE PLANS,
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM.

289
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,916
ALL I WILL SAY IS SAFE TRAVELS
AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

290
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,458
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE.

291
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,750
- ( door closes )

292
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:15,250
- TIMES CHANGE, FOR BETTER,
OR FOR WORSE, AND YET I REMAIN,

293
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:19,208
CLINGING HOPELESSLY TO A
PAST I CAN NEVER CHANGE.

294
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,666
AN OLD MAN AND HIS OBSESSION.

295
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,750
- WHERE'S THE DIRECTOR?
HE'S USUALLY NOT LATE.

296
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,625
- HE PROBABLY GOT
TIED UP SOMEWHERE.

297
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,541
THOUGH IT IS A BIT ODD
THAT HE CALLED A MEETING

298
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,750
SO LATE IN THE DAY.

299
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,916
SO, WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA?

300
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,208
- NONE. I'M AS CLUELESS
AS YOU ARE.

301
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,541
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU

302
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,541
BUT I'LL HANG AROUND HERE
ALL NIGHT IF I HAVE TO.

303
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,458
BECAUSE THE MORE WE WAIT,
THE MORE OVERTIME WE GET.

304
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,916
- Silvia: OH SHUT UP, CELICA.

305
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,916
- WHY SHOULD I?
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.

306
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,291
- GOOD EVENING.
PLEASE EXCUSE MY TARDINESS.

307
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,583
I WAS STUCK IN A MEETING
THAT RAN LONG.

308
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,125
- AN APOLOGY ISN'T
NECESSARY, SIR.

309
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:02,291
- NOW THEN, AS FOR THE BUSINESS
AT HAND I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF.

310
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,250
YOU ALL KNOW THAT I
HAVE SPECIFIC STANDARDS

311
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,083
I LOOK FOR WHEN CHOOSING
MY SUBORDINATES,

312
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,875
WHICH MUST ALL BE MET
BEFORE INITIAL CONSIDERATION.

313
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,375
- LIKE THEY HAVE TO BE PRETTY?
- BE QUIET.

314
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,958
- MORE ACCURATELY, THEY HAVE
TO BE SUPERIOR INDIVIDUALS.

315
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:19,166
GENDER, AGE, EDUCATION,
IMPORTANT, BUT NONE OF THESE

316
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,250
FACTORS HAVE ANY BEARING
ON THE SELECTION PROCESS.

317
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,625
THE FOUR OF YOU ARE YOURSELVES
SUPERIOR INDIVIDUALS,

318
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,708
WHICH IS WHY I PERSONALLY
SELECTED YOU TO WORK FOR ME.

319
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,083
IT FOLLOWS THEN, THAT
SHOULD AN INDIVIDUAL APPEAR

320
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,333
WHOSE ABILITIES
EXCEED YOUR OWN,

321
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,416
THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOULD
BE PLACED IN A POSITION

322
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,333
OF HIGHER AUTHORITY.

323
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,833
SO, THAT BEING SAID...

324
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,375
- ( all gasping )

325
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,958
- I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO YOUR NEW SUPERIOR

326
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,708
AS OF TODAY, ROSE ANDERSON.

327
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,958
- ( theme song playing )

328
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

329
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,541
- Rose: I WILL NEVER SEE
YOU AS MY FATHER.

330
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,875
- Axela: SILVIA!

331
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,375
- Solty: NEXT TIME, "LADY."

332
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,083
YOUNG WOMEN BLOSSOM
WHEN THEY FALL IN LOVE.
