1
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,583
- Roy: TWELVE YEARS AGO,
THERE WAS A DISASTER.

2
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,291
PEOPLE CALLED IT THE BLAST FALL.

3
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,541
I WAS A COP WHEN IT HAPPENED.
MY WIFE HAD DIED. CANCER.

4
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,083
SO IT WAS JUST ME
AND MY LITTLE GIRL.

5
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,041
THE LAST THING
MY WIFE ASKED ME TO DO

6
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:40,666
WAS TO TAKE CARE OF OUR RITA.
I PROMISED HER I ALWAYS WOULD.

7
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,625
THEN IT HAPPENED.

8
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,416
I WASN'T ABLE
TO KEEP MY PROMISE.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,875
THE BLAST FALL
TOOK MY LITTLE GIRL.

10
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,333
SHE WAS NEVER FOUND.

11
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:55,125
HOWEVER, I BELIEVE SHE'S
STILL OUT THERE, SOMEWHERE.

12
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,583
SO I KEEP ON LOOKING.

13
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,375
( Roy speaking )

14
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,166
WELL, IT'S NOT BAD, I GUESS.

15
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,000
- I'LL GIVE IT A TWO
ON A SCALE OF TEN.

16
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,333
SEE, IT JUST LACKS THAT
CERTAIN SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

17
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,708
LIKE, "IT FEEDS THE BODY,
BUT NOT THE SOUL", OR SOMETHING.

18
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,541
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- NO, NOT REALLY.

19
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:37,000
ALL RIGHT, THEN, I'LL JUST
HAVE TO PRACTICE HARDER!

20
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,666
I'LL SPEND ALL DAY IF I HAVE TO!

21
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,416
I'LL GET A BETTER SCORE
NEXT TIME, I PROMISE!

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,541
- ( muffled )
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

23
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,666
- ( theme music playing )

24
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,750
- ( woman on PA )
MAINTENANCE IS NOW COMPLETE.

25
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,666
INITIATING REVIVAL MODE.

26
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,208
REVIVAL COMPLETE.

27
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,416
PLEASE STAND BACK UNTIL THE
CHAMBER DOORS ARE FULLY OPEN.

28
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
YOU ARE NOW FREE TO DEPART.

29
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,791
- THESE SESSIONS
REALLY WEAR ME OUT.

30
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,458
SO, INTEGRA,
WHAT'S ON YOUR AGENDA?

31
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,833
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

32
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,625
- WE FINALLY HAVE A DAY OFF.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

33
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,000
- I DON'T KNOW. RELAX A BIT.

34
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,000
MAYBE GO SHOPPING DOWNTOWN
FOR A NEW OUTFIT.

35
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,208
- NOW THERE'S AN IDEA.

36
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,375
- NO, SILVIA, I'M NOT
TAKING YOU WITH ME.

37
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,041
I PREFER TO KEEP MY WORK
AND MY PRIVATE LIFE SEPARATED.

38
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,291
AND COME ON, WE SEE ENOUGH
OF EACH OTHER AS IT IS.

39
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,041
- WELL, IT WAS JUST A THOUGHT.

40
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,666
- LOOKING FORWARD TO DINNER.
I'LL SEE YOU AT EIGHT!

41
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,750
TAKE CARE.

42
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,625
- HEY, AXELA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

43
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,500
- UH, THE USUAL.

44
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,958
MIGHT READ A BOOK, AND
THEN UH, CELICA'S COMING OVER.

45
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,458
- I SEE. YOU HAVE FUN.
- WE WILL.

46
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,083
WONDER WHAT I SHOULD
MAKE? MAYBE STIR-FRY!

47
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,958
- GOING TO WORK?
- NOT TODAY

48
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,583
- OKAY. SO WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

49
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,958
- OUT. I'LL BE BACK.

50
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,166
- WELL, THERE'S A SURPRISE.

51
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,041
SINCE WHEN DOES HE HAVE
ANYWHERE TO GO OTHER THAN WORK?

52
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,708
SOLTY!
- RIGHT HERE.

53
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,875
WHAT DO YOU YOU WANT, ROSE?

54
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,333
- WHAT'S WITH THE OLD MAN?
HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HE'S OFF TO?

55
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,000
- NO, HE DIDN'T TELL ME.
I WAS PRACTICING.

56
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,208
- OKAY THEN.

57
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,125
SOLTY! SOLTY!
- UH, I'M STILL IN HERE!

58
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,083
- I DON'T WANNA STAY
COOPED UP INSIDE ALL DAY.

59
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,625
LET'S GO HAVE SOME FUN!
- I CAN'T.

60
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,500
I'VE GOT TO PRACTICE MY COOKING
SOME MORE BEFORE DINNER, AND...

61
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:29,500
UH, I NEED A DISH TOWEL!
AND THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER!

62
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,875
WATER... WHERE'S THE WATER?

63
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,000
(screams ) IT ONLY
MADE IT WORSE!

64
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:40,208
- GUESS YOU'RE BUSY.
I'LL JUST GO ASK SOMEBODY ELSE.

65
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,500
- IF I CONNECTED
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ACTUATOR

66
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,750
TO THE REAL BALANCER
WITH A FIFTY SYNCHRO CABLE...

67
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,083
DAMN! THAT WOULD JUST OVERLOAD
THE THERMALS AND THE CAPACITORS!

68
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,916
WHY CAN'T I CRACK
THIS STUPID THING?

69
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,708
- OH, WELL, SO MUCH
FOR TRACKING DOWN KASHA.

70
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,333
GEEZ! ARE YOU
SKIPPING WORK AGAIN?

71
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,458
- WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE.
WE MEET AGAIN.

72
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,250
- WHAT, SO I GUESS NOBODY
CARES IF YOU'RE LIKE

73
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,750
SLACKING OFF ALL THE TIME?

74
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,500
- WELL, I ACTUALLY DO HAVE
VALID REASONS FOR BEING HERE.

75
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,666
FIRST AND FOREMOST,
I HATE MY WORK.

76
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,125
- WELL, GOSH, I NEVER
THOUGHT I'D HEAR THAT

77
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,625
FROM AN R.U.C. ELITE.

78
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,583
OKAY, YOU REALLY ARE
AN ODD ONE.

79
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,000
- I'VE ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF
SOMETHING OF AN ICONOCLAST.

80
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,791
- OH, YEAH,
WHAT'S AN ICONOCLAST?

81
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,791
A LAZY BUM WHO LIKES
TO SIT ON A BENCH?

82
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,208
- ( chuckles ) BUT THAT'S NOT
WHY I'M HERE.

83
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,916
- REALLY? THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

84
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,416
- HONESTLY?

85
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,041
I CONFESS, I DID HAVE
AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE

86
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,125
FOR COMING TO THE PARK TODAY.

87
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,375
I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT
I MIGHT SEE YOU AGAIN.

88
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,375
THAT BEING SAID,

89
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,375
I'D LIKE TO SEE IF WE COULD
GET BETTER ACQUAINTED.

90
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,875
YOU SEE MY DAY IS RATHER OPEN

91
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,333
AND I'D LOVE TO
SPEND IT WITH YOU.

92
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,500
- SO I GUESS YOU'RE
ASKING ME OUT ON A DATE?

93
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,750
- TO BE BLUNT, YES.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

94
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,000
- I SHOULD WARN YOU FIRST,
I'M NOT GONNA BE A CHEAP DATE.

95
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,791
- LEAVE THAT PROBLEM TO ME!

96
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,541
- OH, SARAH. ANOTHER YEAR.

97
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,333
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOR SO LONG.

98
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,666
- I'M SORRY.

99
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,583
I'M STILL LOOKING.
HAVEN'T GIVEN UP.

100
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,750
I'LL KEEP MY PROMISE
TO YOU, SARAH.

101
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,208
I WILL FIND RITA,
I SWEAR TO YOU.

102
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,250
SO WHEREVER YOU'RE AT,
WATCH OVER US.

103
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,833
SARAH, I MISS YOU.

104
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,041
- ( knock at the door )

105
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,708
- ( gasps )

106
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,583
SOLTY! WHAT HAPPENED?

107
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:29,000
- I PRACTICED, AND I THINK
I BROKE THE KITCHEN.

108
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,750
- GOODNESS. LET'S GET YOU
CLEANED UP FIRST,

109
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,416
AND THEN WE'LL
TACKLE THE KITCHEN.

110
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,875
SO, THEY DIDN'T LIKE
THE BREAKFAST YOU MADE THEM

111
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,083
AND ROSE GAVE IT A LOW SCORE?

112
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,333
- YES. AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT.

113
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,000
- YOU KNOW, I DON'T EITHER.

114
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:48,208
I'VE TRIED YOUR COOKING BEFORE,
SOLTY. IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

115
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,958
- NO. I JUST DON'T THINK
I HAVE ENOUGH PRACTICE YET.

116
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,625
- IT'S POSSIBLE.
BUT CONSIDER YOUR CRITICS.

117
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,125
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPLIMENTS,

118
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,875
ROY AND ROSE AREN'T
EXACTLY GUSHING,

119
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,416
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

120
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,083
- UM, MIRANDA,
I, UH, I WAS WONDERING IF...

121
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,875
- OF COURSE I WILL, DEAR.

122
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,375
YOU'D LIKE ME TO HELP
YOU MAKE SOMETHING

123
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,333
THEY'LL SAY IS DELICIOUS, RIGHT?

124
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,875
- YES! PLEASE!

125
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,416
- NOW LET'S THINK. I'VE GOT IT!

126
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,250
I HAPPEN TO KNOW A RECIPE
THAT I'M SURE THEY'LL LOVE.

127
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,875
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT!

128
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,208
- HOW EXQUISITE.

129
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:31,083
YOU LOOK TRULY STUNNING.
- OH, UH, THANK YOU.

130
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,875
- AND IF I MAY?
- HUH?

131
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,458
- WHAT A MATCH.

132
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,541
I JUST KNEW IT WOULD
ACCENTUATE THE DRESS.

133
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,833
SO, ARE YOU READY TO GO,
MY DEAR?

134
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,083
- GO WHERE?
- TO EAT LUNCH, OF COURSE.

135
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,291
I HOPE MY CAR WILL SUFFICE.

136
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,333
- ( gasps )

137
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,791
- SHALL WE THEN?
- UH, SURE!

138
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,541
- THANK YOU, SIR! COME AGAIN!

139
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,000
- IS THAT WHO I THINK IT IS?

140
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,458
- Kasha: HANGING OUT ALONE
REALLY STINKS!

141
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,333
MOM'S BUSY TEACHING
SOLTY HOW TO COOK!

142
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,291
ROSE'S GONE OFF
TO PARTS UNKNOWN,

143
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,458
AND YUTO WON'T GET OFF HIS
STUPID COMPUTER! ( grunts )

144
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,875
WHAT'S TH...

145
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,166
- AFTER YOU, I INSIST.

146
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,666
- WHAT? IT'S ROSE!

147
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,000
AND WHO'S THAT STRANGE GUY
SHE'S GETTING IN THE CAR WITH?

148
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,666
- WHO'S THAT GIRL
HE'S GETTING IN THE CAR WITH?

149
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,791
- Ashley: IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

150
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,416
- Rose: THOUGHT
I HEARD SOMETHING.

151
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,666
- WHO'S THAT GUY?
- WHO'S THAT GIRL?

152
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,125
- HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?
- HOW DO YOU KNOW HER?

153
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,458
- WHERE'S HE GOING?
- WHERE'S SHE GOING?

154
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,875
YOU BETTER ANSWER ME,
YOU LITTLE PIPSQUEAK!

155
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,916
- NO, YOU ANSWER ME!
WHO IS THAT GUY, BLONDIE?

156
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,791
- TAXI!

157
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,791
- OH, WELL,
IT'S LIKE CELICA SAYS,

158
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,708
SOMETIMES A GIRL'S
JUST GOTTA SPLURGE!

159
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,875
- AH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DON'T HAVE CAB FARE!

160
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,541
- WELL, YOU DIDN'T OFFER ANY!

161
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,291
I'M JUST OUT OF CASH
AT THE MOMENT!

162
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,083
- YOUR CREDIT CARD?
- YEAH, RIGHT.

163
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,041
I'M ALREADY OVER MY LIMIT
AS IT IS!

164
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,458
- NO, IT'S YOUR DAY OFF.
JUST KEEP WALKING.

165
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,666
KEEP WALKING, KEEP WALKING,
KEEP WALKING, KEEP WALKING.

166
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,208
DAMN, THEY'RE FAST!

167
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,500
- COME ON! COME ON!
WE'RE GONNA LOSE 'EM!

168
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,166
- YOU KNOW, I CAN DROP YOU!

169
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,250
- DO YOU KNOW HER?

170
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,041
- YOU'RE MAKING A SCENE, SILVIA.
JUST GET IN THE CAR.

171
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,333
- YOU'RE A LIFESAVER, INTEGRA!
I OWE YOU ONE!

172
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,708
HEY, KID, HERE'S SOME ADVICE.

173
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,333
ALWAYS BE GOOD FRIENDS
WITH YOUR COWORKERS!

174
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,625
- I WOULDN'T THROW THE WORD
"FRIEND" AROUND TOO MUCH.

175
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,541
ESPECIALLY IF I GET REPRIMANDED
FOR YOUR DUMB BEHAVIOR.

176
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,666
SO TELL ME, HOW DID YOU TWO
GET MIXED UP TOGETHER AGAIN?

177
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,583
- Both: HUH?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

178
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,666
- YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER,
DO YOU?

179
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,500
A FEW WEEKS AGO? DOWNTOWN?
WE MET YOU AND YOUR MOTHER?

180
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:04,333
- ( exclaims )
- WE DID? ARE YOU SURE?

181
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,166
- YOU REALLY NEED TO
REMEMBER THESE THINGS.

182
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,041
SO, HOW'S YOUR MOM DOING
THESE DAYS?

183
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,541
AND THAT GIRL
WITH THE LONG EARS?

184
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,958
- OH, THEY'RE GREAT. UH SUPER!

185
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,291
THESE GUYS ARE FROM R.U.C.

186
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,250
IF THEY FIND OUT WHO ROSE IS,
THEY'LL THROW HER IN JAIL.

187
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,791
I BETTER KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.

188
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,958
- SO KIDS,
WHO ARE WE CHASING TODAY?

189
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,000
- THAT CAR! THE BLACK ONE
THAT WE'RE LOSING!

190
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,291
- AND WHY EXACTLY
ARE WE CHASING IT?

191
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,083
- JUST DO IT, INTEGRA!
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.

192
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,083
IT'S ALREADY SO FAR AHEAD,
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST GIVE UP.

193
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,625
- WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY?

194
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,875
- THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS TOO FAR AHEAD.

195
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,875
WAY HIGH SPEED PURSUIT'S
MY SPECIALTY.

196
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,291
SIT BACK AND RELAX.
- Kasha: SLOW DOWN!

197
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,000
- Silvia: NO, NO, NO, INTEGRA!
- WE'RE GOING TO DIE!

198
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,250
- Sylvia: WAIT, WAIT!
YOU MISSED THE EXIT!

199
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:57,541
- WELL, I THINK I OVERSHOT
A LITTLE BIT. SORRY!

200
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,875
- YOU REALLY CAN'T
GO WRONG HERE.

201
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,791
EVERYTHING ON THE MENU
IS FANTASTIC,

202
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,458
BUT I ESPECIALLY RECOMMEND
THE FILET.

203
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,333
- UH, OKAY, SOUNDS GREAT.

204
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,166
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
IT'S THE OPERATIONS DIRECTOR.

205
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,500
- ( groans ) I FEEL SICK.

206
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,916
- FROM THAT LITTLE RIDE?
SHAKE IT OFF.

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,625
- YOU CALL THAT A "LITTLE RIDE"?
YOU'RE INSANE.

208
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,125
- YOU DO DRIVE
LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.

209
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,958
- THANKS. SO WHO'S THE GIRL

210
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,208
THAT'S GOT THE DIRECTOR'S
UNDIVIDED ATTENTION?

211
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,583
- WHO KNOWS.

212
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:34,000
- THEY STILL DON'T RECOGNIZE
ROSE! MAYBE SHE'S SAFE!

213
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,875
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

214
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,250
IF THE FOOD ISN'T TO
YOUR LIKING,

215
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,666
I COULD SPEAK TO THE CHEF.

216
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,000
- IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S GREAT, IT REALLY IS.

217
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,875
I JUST WANNA SAVOR EVERY BITE!

218
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,166
PULL IT TOGETHER, GIRL!
YOU DON'T GET TO EAT

219
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,708
AT HIGH CLASS JOINTS
LIKE THIS EVERY DAY,

220
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,041
SO DON'T SCREW IT UP!

221
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,458
WHOA, WAS THAT
STATIC ELECTRICITY?

222
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,666
- THERE ARE EXPERTS WHO EXCEL
IN RETRIEVING LOST CUTLERY.

223
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,208
THEY'RE CALLED WAITERS.
- ( chuckles )

224
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,875
OF COURSE! HOW SILLY!
I JUST FORGOT, I GUESS!

225
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,625
- WHAT'S THAT BIMBO
LAUGHING ABOUT?

226
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,208
I'M GONNA GO
WRING HER SCRAWNY NECK!

227
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,791
- WAIT. HOLD ON! NOW I SEE.

228
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,791
- YOU SEE WHAT?
- I LOVE THIS!

229
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,208
- THE OPERATIONS DIRECTOR.

230
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,166
- IT'S SO MUCH MORE FUN
THAN HANGING OUT AT THE PARK!

231
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,916
- ( music playing )

232
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,500
- LAUREL LEAVES, LAUREL LEAVES.

233
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,666
NOT HERE. MAYBE THEY'RE IN
ONE OF THE CANNED AISLES.

234
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,125
( sighs ) THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT.

235
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:51,166
EXCUSE ME!
- HUH? OH, CAN I HELP YOU?

236
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,500
- CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE
I COULD FIND LAUREL LEAVES?

237
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,666
I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER THE STORE
AND I CAN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE.

238
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,583
- Axela: HEY, I KNOW YOU!

239
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,125
AREN'T YOU THE GIRL
FROM THE WATER PARK?

240
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,333
HERE YOU GO.

241
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,208
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
BUT I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION.

242
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,833
- WHAT ARE LAUREL LEAVES?
DO PEOPLE EAT THEM?

243
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,500
- WELL KIND OF, I GUESS.

244
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,291
THEY'RE CALLED HERBS AND YOU USE
THEM TO ADD FLAVOR TO YOUR FOOD.

245
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,000
I ADD A FEW OF THEM
TO MY STIR-FRY

246
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,666
JUST TO SPICE IT UP
A LITTLE BIT.

247
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,500
- YOU KNOW SO MUCH!
I BET YOU'RE A GREAT COOK!

248
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,416
- UH, WELL...

249
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
- I HOPE I CAN BE A GOOD COOK
LIKE YOU ONE DAY,

250
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,458
BUT I THINK I STILL HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO!

251
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,583
- OH, LOOK AT THE TIME!

252
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,250
I'M GONNA BE LATE
FOR THAT, UM, THING!

253
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,583
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
HAVE A NICE DAY!

254
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,166
- PLEASE, AFTER YOU.

255
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,625
- ( grunts )

256
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,958
DAMMIT! THIS IS
A VIP-ONLY ELEVATOR!

257
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,791
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS?
- I'M ALL OUT OF IDEAS.

258
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,250
- WELL, I'M NOT!

259
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,500
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
JUST A FEW STORIES UP.

260
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,000
- THIS IS CRAZY!

261
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,708
- DON'T TRY TO STOP ME, INTEGRA!
- PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU!

262
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,208
- YOU THINK I CARE?
- UH, SHE'S KINDA WEIRD.

263
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,541
- YOU'RE TELLING ME!
- NO, WAIT. WAIT!

264
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,541
- NICE, ISN'T IT?

265
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,375
RESERVING THIS SPACE
CERTAINLY COMES AT A COST,

266
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,916
BUT THE VIEW IS PRICELESS.

267
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,458
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

268
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,250
- YES.

269
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,041
VERY BEAUTIFUL.

270
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,625
- ( grunts ) CAN YOU
SEE ANYTHING?

271
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,583
WHAT COULD THEY BE DOING
UP THERE ALL THIS TIME?

272
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,125
- I BET THEY'RE HOLDING HANDS
AND READING POEMS TO EACH OTHER!

273
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,375
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!

274
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,291
I DON'T EVEN WANNA
THINK ABOUT IT! ( grunts )

275
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,458
- ♪ HOLDING HANDS ♪
- SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

276
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,875
SHUT YOUR TRAP,
YOU LITTLE TWERP!

277
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,416
- THIS WAS A DAY OFF.

278
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,333
- EVERYONE IN THE CITY
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENJOY THIS,

279
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,791
NOT JUST THOSE WHO
SOCIETY DUBS, "ELITE."

280
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,041
THE GAP BETWEEN THE HAVES
AND THE HAVE-NOTS IN THIS CITY

281
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,791
GROWS LARGER EVERY YEAR.

282
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,958
R.U.C TREATS
UNREGISTERED CITIZENS

283
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,458
LIKE THEY WERE SEWER VERMIN,

284
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,625
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER
I CAN CLOSE MY EYES TO IT.

285
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,041
ALL OF IT IS
SO VERY, VERY WRONG.

286
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,291
EVERYONE SHOULD BE EQUAL.

287
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,291
REGISTERED, UNREGISTERED,
RICH, POOR.

288
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,000
TAKE AWAY THE SOCIAL STATUS
AND WE'RE ALL THE SAME.

289
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,500
MAYBE I'M DELUSIONAL, BUT I HOPE
TO COME BACK HERE ONE DAY

290
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:20,500
AND ENJOY THE VIEW WITH
PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE.

291
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,583
NOT WHAT YOU EXPECTED TO HEAR
FROM AN R.U.C. ELITE, WAS IT?

292
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,416
HOPE I DIDN'T BORE YOU WITH
MY "DREAM OF A BETTER TOMORROW."

293
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,875
- NO.

294
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,083
THAT'S A DREAM THAT I'D LIKE
TO SEE COME TRUE ONE DAY.

295
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,208
- WHEN IT DOES,
LET'S COME HERE TOGETHER.

296
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,208
- THEN IT'S A DATE.

297
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,166
- WHY HER AND NOT ME?
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.

298
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,583
- ISN'T IT TIME WE LEFT?
- I'M SO TIRED.

299
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,708
- NICE WORK, SOLTY. YOU GOT
EVERYTHING ON THE LIST.

300
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,125
- THANK YOU.

301
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,750
WELL, WHAT ARE WE GONNA
MAKE FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

302
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,333
- SOMETHING SPECIAL.
IT'S A RECIPE I LEARNED

303
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,708
A LONG TIME AGO
FROM MY BEST FRIEND.

304
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,375
- WELL, IF YOU WON'T
JOIN ME FOR COFFEE,

305
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,875
AT LEAST ALLOW ME
TO DRIVE YOU HOME.

306
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,208
- THANK YOU.

307
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,416
BUT TONIGHT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE
NIGHTS WHEN I FEEL LIKE WALKING.

308
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,541
- HOLD ON. THINK I MIGHT
SEE YOU AGAIN SOMETIME?

309
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,708
- MAYBE IF YOU'RE LUCKY.
GOOD NIGHT.

310
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,791
OH, AND HEY!

311
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,791
I MEANT WHAT I SAID
ABOUT YOUR DREAM TONIGHT.

312
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,458
I REALLY HOPE IT COMES TRUE.

313
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,500
THANKS FOR SHOWING ME
A GOOD TIME TODAY.

314
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,791
AND IF YOU'RE EVER AT THE PARK,

315
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,875
BE SURE TO KEEP THE BENCH
WARM FOR ME.

316
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:42,958
- ( chuckles )

317
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,291
- YOU CAN COME OUT NOW, KASHA.

318
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,333
- BUT HOW'D YOU KNOW I WAS HERE?

319
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,916
- ( scoffs ) ANY GOOD THIEF
KNOWS WHEN THEY'RE BEING TAILED!

320
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,583
- SO, ROSE.
- HUH?

321
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,458
- THAT GUY YOU WERE WITH,
IS HE YOUR BOYFRIEND?

322
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,500
- GET THAT THOUGHT
OUT OF YOUR HEAD!

323
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:12,458
NOW THAT THAT'S BEEN SETTLED,
LET'S GO HOME. I'M STARVING.

324
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,166
- YOU'RE STARVING?
I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO EAT LUNCH!

325
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,125
- ( crying )

326
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,333
- WILL YOU STOP?
GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF!

327
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,000
YOU'RE AN ADULT! TRY ACTING
LIKE ONE FOR A CHANGE!

328
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:28,500
- FINE, THEN I'LL DO WHAT
ADULTS DO! I'LL GO HAVE A DRINK!

329
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,250
- OKAY. THEN I'LL DROP YOU OFF
AT THAT BAR ON THE CORNER.

330
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,083
- DRINK WITH ME!
- ( screams )

331
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,083
- DRINK WITH ME!

332
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,083
- YOU HAVE A SERIOUS
PROBLEM, SILVIA!

333
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,708
- DRINK WITH ME!
WHY DOESN'T HE LOVE ME?

334
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:45,875
- HEY.

335
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,916
I'M GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

336
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,541
YOUR TIMING'S PERFECT.
I HAVE DINNER ALMOST READY.

337
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,833
( humming )

338
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,333
- WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE
SOMEBODY HAD A GOOD DAY.

339
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,458
- WHO?
- YOU.

340
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,250
YOU'RE OVER THERE SINGING
AND SMILING.

341
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,333
- YEAH. IT WAS, SORT OF.

342
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,083
THE CEMETERY, HOW WAS IT TODAY?

343
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:17,333
- THE WEATHER WAS OKAY, I GUESS.
- THAT'S GOOD.

344
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,666
IT'LL JUST BE A FEW MORE MINUTES
TILL WE EAT, OKAY?

345
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,875
- MM-HM.
- ( continues humming )

346
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,375
- THIS THING IS
DRIVING ME NUTS!

347
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,916
IF I LOOK AT IT
FOR ANOTHER SECOND,

348
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,708
MY HEAD'S GOING TO EXPLODE!

349
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:34,041
( sniffs ) HEY,
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

350
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,958
UH, MIRANDA,
WHAT SMELLS SO GOOD?

351
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,166
- WELL, HELLO THERE, YUTO.
IT'S NICE TO SEE

352
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,375
THAT SOMETHING CAN PULL YOU
AWAY FROM YOUR COMPUTER.

353
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,000
- YEAH, MY STOMACH.

354
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,458
- WANNA JOIN US
FOR DINNER, YUTO?

355
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,833
WE'VE GOT A HOMECOOKED MEAL
THAT SOLTY MADE HERSELF.

356
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,375
- SOLTY MADE IT?
I WANT IT! I WANT IT!

357
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,583
- OKAY, GO.

358
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,000
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

359
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,125
- SO DO WE.

360
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,541
- WELL, SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

361
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,041
- IT'S... IT'S ALL RIGHT.

362
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,791
- YEAH, IT'S JUST LIKE
MY MOTHER USED TO MAKE.

363
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,833
THIS TOTALLY REMINDS ME OF HOME.

364
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,291
- WHAT SCORE DO YOU GIVE IT?

365
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,791
- SIX OUT OF TEN!

366
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:32,166
- I DID IT! I GOT BETTER! YAY!
I IMPROVED FOUR POINTS TODAY!

367
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,666
- STILL ROOM TO IMPROVE.

368
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,333
- I KNOW,
AND IF I KEEP PRACTICING,

369
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,333
I BET I'LL BE ABLE TO COOK
A MEAL THAT'S A TEN OUT OF TEN!

370
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,666
- HUH. WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

371
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,333
- YOU GONNA EAT TONIGHT, KID?

372
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,458
- YES!

373
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,333
( giggles excitedly )

374
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,208
I REALLY LIKE IT.
IT'S DELICIOUS!

375
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,250
- ( theme song playing )  

376
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:35,708
- Solty: UM, ROSE,

377
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,250
I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT'S VERY FLATTERING.

378
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,458
- Rose: HEY, A GIRL'S GOTTA DO
WHAT A GIRL'S GOTTA DO.

379
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,875
- NEXT TIME,
"TREASURE AND RESCUE."

380
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,750
I WANNA GO HOME ALREADY.
