1
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,333
- Illumina: JUST THINK,
TOMORROW YOU'LL BE DOWN THERE.

2
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,291
- YEAH.
- HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS?

3
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:38,458
- NO, NO. I DON'T KNOW.

4
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,458
- IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO
BE CHOSEN AS A MEMBER

5
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,583
OF THE FIRST LANDING PARTY.
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

6
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,125
YOU'LL BE WRITING THE
VERY FIRST CHAPTER

7
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,291
IN A NEW HISTORY OF
THE HUMAN RACE.

8
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,625
- DON'T DOUBT YOURSELF.
- IT'S NOT THAT...

9
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,000
YOU HAVE WORK TO DO DOWN THERE.

10
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:55,125
AND I HAVE MY WORK TO
DO UP HERE ON THE SHIP.

11
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,833
NOTHING ELSE NEEDS TO BE SAID.

12
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:57,958
- BUT WHAT IF...

13
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,166
- THERE'S NOTHING TO
WORRY ABOUT, OKAY?

14
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,208
( chuckles ) I'LL BE WITH YOU
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,125
YOU ARE GOING TO
WAIT FOR ME, AREN'T YOU?

16
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,291
- I'LL WAIT AS
LONG AS I HAVE TO.

17
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,125
- GOOD ANSWER.

18
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:15,083
- HMM. BUT, PLEASE DON'T KEEP
ME WAITING TOO LONG.

19
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,708
OR I SWEAR I'LL COME BACK
UP HERE AND GET YOU.

20
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,583
ILLUMINA...

21
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:25,166
I'M FINALLY GOING TO KEEP
THE PROMISE I MADE TO YOU.

22
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,666
- ( theme song playing )

23
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

24
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,250
- SHE'S STILL ALIVE.
THANK GOODNESS.

25
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,458
- ALL RADIO TRANSMISSION
SEEMS TO BE OUT,

26
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,833
BUT I MANAGED TO FIND
A TELEPHONE THAT WAS WORKING.

27
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,958
SO, A RESCUE TEAM SHOULD
BE HERE PRETTY SOON.

28
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,583
- THANK YOU. I THINK
SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

29
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,916
- ( grunts )

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,333
- SOLTY! OH, NO! DID I...

31
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,208
- IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, ROSE.

32
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,333
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
SYSTEM GLITCH.

33
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,750
SEE, EVERYTHING'S BACK
TO NORMAL NOW, I'M FINE.

34
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,375
- I HOPE SO.

35
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,291
- DO ME A FAVOR AND
LOOK AFTER AXELA FOR ME.

36
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,666
- WHOA! HOLD ON!

37
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,875
AT LEAST WAIT FOR THE RESCUE
TEAM BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF!

38
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,916
- I'M SORRY, I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T DO THAT.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,166
I'VE GOT TO FIND HIM. YOU SEE,
I'VE GOT A PROMISE TO KEEP.

40
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,916
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- BYE, ROSE.

41
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,416
- OKAY, YOU TALKED ME INTO IT.

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,416
- WHAT?

43
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,458
- I'M COMING WITH
YOU, OF COURSE.

44
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,166
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
FRIENDS ARE FOR, AREN'T THEY?

45
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,750
HMM. YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE HEAVIER THAN YOU LOOK.

46
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,000
- ( giggles ) REALLY?

47
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,791
- SO, YOU GOING TO TELL ME
WHERE YOU'RE TAKING ME?

48
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,333
- I'M TAKING YOU
TO VISIT EUNOMIA.

49
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,166
IN APPRECIATION FOR
ALL THE HELP YOU'VE GIVEN ME,

50
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,958
I'M INVITING YOU
TO A LITTLE SHOW.

51
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,166
- WHAT SHOW?

52
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,750
- IT'S CALLED "THE DAY
THE WORLD CHANGES."

53
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,166
- STILL SCHEMING, HUH?
HAVEN'T YOU DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE?

54
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,291
- IT'S NOTHING THAT
CAN'T BE FIXED.

55
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,958
ONCE I FINISH WHAT I'VE STARTED.

56
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,125
FROM ALMOST
THE BEGINNING OF THE COLONY,

57
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,416
I'VE WANTED TO RETURN TO SPACE.

58
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,625
I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO
SET FOOT ON THIS WORLD.

59
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,958
I LABORED TO BUILD
THE UNDERGROUND CITY,

60
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,875
SO MY FELLOW COLONISTS
COULD JOIN ME ON OUR NEW HOME.

61
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,125
THEN, ONE DAY,
FOR NO APPARENT REASON,

62
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,458
THE REGULAR LANDING PARTIES
CAME TO A HALT.

63
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,208
- WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON, UP THERE?

64
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,416
LESS THAN A THIRD OF
THE COLONISTS HAVE LANDED YET,

65
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
AND WE'RE STARTING TO
FALL BEHIND SCHEDULE!

66
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,000
- I WISH I COULD TELL YOU, SIR,

67
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,333
BUT IT SEEMS WE'VE LOST
COMMUNICATION WITH THE ORBITER.

68
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,875
- WELL THEN, WHAT DOES
EUNOMIA HAVE TO SAY?

69
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,666
- IT SAYS,
"UNABLE TO DETERMINE."

70
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,166
ITS ORDERS ARE TO CONTINUE
WITH OUR CURRENT ASSIGNMENT.

71
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,666
- NO, NO. THE PIPE ON
THE LEFT, OVER THERE.

72
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,875
- ILLUMINA...
- Man: LOOK OUT!

73
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,625
- ( gasps )

74
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,708
THE ACCIDENT LEFT ME DRIFTING
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.

75
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,500
I WAS SAVED BY EUNOMIA,

76
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,583
THE NUCLEUS OF OUR
COLONIZATION PROGRAM,

77
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,125
AND THE SUPREME
DECISION MAKER FOR THE CITY.

78
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,125
I WAS THE FIRST BENEFICIARY
OF RESEMBLE SURGERY.

79
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,750
THE VERY FIRST RESEMBLE PARTS

80
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,666
WERE INSTALLED IN ME,
TO PROLONG MY LIFE.

81
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,291
SINCE THEN, I HAVEN'T
GROWN ANY OLDER.

82
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,500
AND I'VE RUN R.U.C.
AS EUNOMIA'S PUPPET,

83
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,666
USING DIFFERENT
NAMES AND TITLES.

84
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,041
SO NO ONE WOULD SUSPECT
THAT IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME MAN.

85
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,666
- ( scoffs ) YEAH RIGHT.

86
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,583
AND I SUPPOSE NEXT YOU'RE
GOING TO TRY AND TELL ME

87
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,041
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO CREATED
R.U.C. IN THE FIRST PLACE.

88
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,625
- I DID.

89
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,541
I WAS ONE OF R.U.C.'S
FIRST OVERSEERS.

90
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,375
AND NOW I'M THE LAST.

91
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,333
BUT EVEN AFTER I
BECAME THE DIRECTOR,

92
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,833
THERE WAS NO WORD FROM ABOVE.

93
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,833
MORE TIME PASSED AND STILL THE
LANDING PARTIES DIDN'T RESUME.

94
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,875
SO I DECIDED TO TAKE MATTERS
INTO MY OWN HANDS,

95
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,583
AND MADE PLANS TO HEAD SKYWARD.

96
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,583
I FAILED.

97
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,041
THE SHIP WAS DESTROYED.

98
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:46,041
THE FIRST CASUALTY OF THE
LIGHTNING FROM THE AURORA SHELL.

99
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,083
NEVERTHELESS, I WAS DETERMINED
TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT.

100
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,333
AND TWELVE YEARS AGO,

101
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,291
AFTER CAREFUL PLANNING,
I FINALLY GOT MY CHANCE.

102
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,916
- GOT YOUR CHANCE TO DO WHAT?

103
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,000
- I REMOVED MY ORIGINAL
RESEMBLE COMPONENTS

104
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,041
IN ORDER TO BE FREE
OF EUNOMIA'S CONTROL,

105
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,000
AND TRIED TO HEAD
INTO SPACE MYSELF.

106
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,916
MY CRAFT WAS DESIGNED
TO WITHSTAND

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,625
THE AURORA SHELL'S
LIGHTENING BOLTS.

108
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,958
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY...

109
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,125
- ( loud crash )

110
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,875
- ( loud explosion )

111
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,291
- A BOLT OF LIGHTENING
STRUCK AND DESTROYED

112
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,291
THE OLD R.U.C. BUILDING.

113
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:30,666
MY SPACECRAFT WAS CRUSHED,
AND MY BODY ALONG WITH IT.

114
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,041
I SHOULD'VE DIED.

115
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,541
IRONICALLY, IT WAS MY
DESPISED MASTER, EUNOMIA,

116
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,000
THAT SAVED MY LIFE YET AGAIN.

117
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,333
AND THIS TIME NEARLY
MY ENTIRE BODY

118
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,666
WAS TRANSFORMED
INTO RESEMBLE.

119
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,541
- THEN IT WAS YOU...

120
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,125
YOU CAUSED THE BLAST FALL!

121
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,583
YOU BASTARD!

122
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,291
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

123
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,000
SOON I'LL HAVE THE POWER
TO SET EVERYTHING RIGHT.

124
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,125
HERE WE ARE.

125
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,500
I'VE SAVED YOU A FRONT ROW SEAT.

126
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:07,958
- Rose: THIS IS IT.

127
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,291
THIS IS WHERE HE BROUGHT ME.

128
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,791
- EUNOMIA IS LOCATED
DIRECTLY BELOW.

129
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,666
- HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS?

130
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,416
- THIS IS WHERE
IT GETS DANGEROUS.

131
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,083
I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU TO
STAY HERE AND NOT FOLLOW.

132
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,125
- HUH?
- THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP!

133
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,333
- WAIT A MINUTE!

134
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,458
- ROSE, WHAT ARE YOU...
- SOLTY! NO...

135
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,833
- THANKS TO YOU, EUNOMIA
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY DISABLED.

136
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,958
RIGHT NOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY
TROUBLE AT ALL TAKING CONTROL.

137
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,000
- ALL I NEED IS THIS.
- YOU SON OF A BITCH...

138
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,708
YOU SUCKED ROSE AND ME
INTO YOUR TWISTED LITTLE SCHEME.

139
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,291
YOU SACRIFICED AND RUINED
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY LIVES.

140
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,458
- THE CITY AND ITS CITIZENS
ARE UNDER MY SUPERVISION.

141
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,541
THEIR LIVES ARE MINE TO
DISPOSE OF AS I SEE FIT.

142
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,625
- ( grunts )

143
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,458
( screams )

144
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:07,375
- YOU'RE WASTING TIME AND
AMMUNITION TRYING TO STOP ME.

145
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:11,000
I SUGGEST YOU SIT QUIETLY
AND ENJOY THE SHOW.

146
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,291
- DAMN!

147
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,416
- I GET THE FEELING YOU'RE
NOT LISTENING TO ME.

148
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,000
- ( groaning )

149
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,041
- DON'T MAKE ME RAISE MY VOICE!

150
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,583
- ( both screaming )

151
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,750
- WELL, WELL, WELL.
WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE ENTRANCE.

152
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,291
I THOUGHT I
POWERED YOU OFF, DIIKE.

153
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:35,333
AND YOU, ROSE, I'M DISAPPOINTED.
I HAD SUCH GREAT PLANS FOR US.

154
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,291
- OH, I QUIT. TURNS OUT
A CAREER AT R.U.C.

155
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,958
WASN'T REALLY A
GOOD MATCH FOR ME.

156
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,166
- JOSEPH WAS ABLE TO REPAIR
THE DAMAGE TO MY SYSTEMS.

157
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,625
- DEAR OLD JOSEPH...

158
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,666
- WHAT DO YOU TWO
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

159
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,541
- NOW, THAT'S NO WAY TO GREET
YOUR LONG-LOST DAUGHTER, DADDY.

160
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,375
- DADDY? OH LOOK, GIRLS
ITS DANGEROUS HERE.

161
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,458
YOU NEED TO GET...

162
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,625
- SOLTY!
- SOLTY!

163
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,500
- IT'S NOTHING, I'M FINE.

164
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,708
I JUST CAME DOWN HERE
TO HELP YOU, DADDY.

165
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,541
- WOULD YOU KNOCK OFF
THE "DADDY?"

166
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,083
IT'S JUST NOT GOOD TIMING.

167
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,250
- ( giggles ) OH, HE'S BLUSHING!
- ( giggles ) HE'S BRIGHT RED!

168
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,208
- BACK TO THE MATTER AT HAND.

169
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,208
YOU TWO WEREN'T
IN MY CAST LIST,

170
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,750
BUT LET'S GO AHEAD
AND START THE SHOW.

171
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:22,125
OH AND, ROY, I'VE DECIDED TO
MAKE YOU THE STAR OF THE SHOW.

172
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,500
- ( both groaning )

173
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,708
- AND IN TODAY'S PERFORMANCE...

174
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:30,000
I WANT YOU TO KILL
ONE OF THE GIRLS.

175
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,875
KILL ONE, AND I'LL LET YOU AND
THE OTHER ONE LEAVE HERE ALIVE.

176
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,458
- YOU'RE CRAZY.

177
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,833
- WHO LIVES? AND WHO DIES?

178
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:41,000
YOUR DECISION WILL BE
THE CLIMAX OF THE SHOW.

179
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,208
NOW CHOOSE!

180
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,208
- ( groaning )

181
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:58,250
- QUICKLY NOW. MAKE YOUR CHOICE!
- STOP IT!

182
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,666
- HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND?

183
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,541
- ROY, DON'T DO IT.

184
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,000
- HOLD ON, OLD MAN. WHAT
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

185
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,541
- ( gunshots )

186
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,875
- SORRY, BUT THAT WASN'T
ONE OF THE CHOICES.

187
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,708
- WHAT THE...

188
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,541
- HERE. TRY AGAIN.

189
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,125
COME ON, JUST PULL THE TRIGGER
ANY TIME YOU WANT.

190
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,791
BUT I SUGGEST
YOU HURRY BEFORE

191
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,500
BOTH OF THEIR BODIES
ARE TORN TO PIECES.

192
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,208
WELL? MAKE UP YOUR MIND!

193
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,333
TIME'S RUNNING OUT.

194
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,458
- ( both screaming )

195
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:55,916
- ( yelling )

196
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,500
- OH, NO!

197
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,875
- SORRY, PAL, BUT I LIKE
TO MAKE MY OWN CHOICES.

198
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,916
AND SHOOTING EITHER
ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,333
FOR SOME SICK LITTLE FREAK'S
AMUSEMENT ISN'T ONE OF THEM!

200
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,000
- AS YOU WISH.
THEN YOU'VE CHOSEN DEATH.

201
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:19,916
- ( groans )

202
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,916
- ( gasps )

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
- NO!

204
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,291
- AND NOW THEY'LL BOTH DIE.

205
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,166
- Solty: ROY.

206
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,166
- ( both yelling )

207
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,208
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

208
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,875
WHAT'S THIS...

209
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,291
( screams ) I WON'T LET YOU
CONTROL ME AGAIN!

210
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,041
( panting )

211
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:13,041
- PLEASE, PUT A STOP TO THIS.
- NOT UNTIL I GET WHAT I WANT.

212
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,083
- ASHLEY!

213
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,833
- NOW, DIIKE.

214
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,625
THIS TIME I'LL REDUCE YOU
TO A PILE OF SCRAP.

215
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,666
( laughing maniacally )

216
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,875
- ROY.

217
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,541
- SOLTY, ARE YOU...
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

218
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,166
- NICE TRY, REVANT.

219
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,250
- ( crackling )

220
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,375
- DAMN YOU. DAMN YOU, EUNOMIA.

221
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,708
IF YOU'RE GOING TO
KILL ME, JUST DO IT.

222
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,333
- ASHLEY...

223
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,875
THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

224
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,125
- THE PEOPLE ON THE ORBITER...

225
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,875
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THEM,
THEY'RE ALL DEAD, AREN'T THEY?

226
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,583
- ( gasps ) HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY HAVE KNOWN?

227
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,708
- IT'S WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF.

228
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,583
I SUSPECTED IT
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

229
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,625
BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT
MAKE NOW, WHAT I THOUGHT OR DID?

230
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:41,291
ALL I WANTED,
WAS TO GO BACK.

231
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,041
TO KEEP THE PROMISE I MADE TO
HER ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

232
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,666
- Roy: YOU POOR FOOL...

233
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,500
- SAVE YOUR PITY. I'M NO
MORE A FOOL THAN YOU WERE.

234
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,000
- HOW'S THAT?

235
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,833
- YOU SPENT TWELVE YEARS
SEEKING YOUR DAUGHTER.

236
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,250
I SPENT EVEN MORE
SEEKING ILLUMINA.

237
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,833
( coughs )

238
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,458
FOR ALL THAT TIME
THEY WERE LOST TO US,

239
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,916
OUR HEARTS ACHED
FOR THEM INCESSANTLY.

240
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,416
IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE OVER
A DECADE FOR YOU.

241
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,541
BUT IT WAS TWO CENTURIES FOR ME.

242
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,500
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
THE HELPLESSNESS,

243
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,875
THE LONELINESS,
THE UNBEARABLE SORROW.

244
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,000
THAT CRUSH YOU WHEN YOU
LOSE THE ONE YOU LOVE.

245
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,291
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
THE FURIOUS LONGING,

246
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,708
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU DO ANYTHING,
ANYTHING AT ALL,

247
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,416
TO GET THAT LOVE BACK,
HAVEN'T YOU?

248
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,791
- IT'S TRUE. YOU'RE RIGHT.

249
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,541
ONCE I WAS LIKE THAT,
I WAS JUST LIKE YOU.

250
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,458
BUT, I'M DIFFERENT NOW.
I'VE CHANGED.

251
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,250
I'VE GOT THESE TWO
TO SHARE MY LIFE NOW.

252
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,291
AND THAT'S WHAT CHANGED ME.

253
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,208
- Rose: YOU HAD A CHANCE
TO CHANGE TOO.

254
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:55,000
YOU HAD INTEGRA AND SILVIA.
CELICA AND AXELA.

255
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:59,041
THEY LOVED YOU.
THEY'D HAVE STOOD BY YOU.

256
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,875
BUT YOU CHOSE TO
THROW THAT AWAY.

257
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,708
- ( chuckles ) WHY, YES I DID.

258
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:11,833
- I'VE GOT A MESSAGE, ASHLEY,
FROM THE SHIP, FOR YOU.

259
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,083
I PROMISED ILLUMINA
I'D GIVE IT TO YOU.

260
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,958
- WHAT'S THAT?

261
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:20,708
- ILLUMINA, SHE LEFT IT FOR
YOU, JUST BEFORE SHE DIED.

262
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,750
- DARLING.

263
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,333
- ILLUMINA.

264
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,500
- I LOVE YOU.

265
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:34,083
FORGIVE ME. I WASN'T
ABLE TO JOIN YOU,

266
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:38,541
EVEN THOUGH I WANTED SO MUCH
TO LIVE IN THE CITY YOU BUILT.

267
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,666
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS LOVED
THAT SMILE OF YOURS.

268
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,666
IT'S SUCH A LOVELY THING.

269
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,916
THAT BEAUTIFUL,
SHY, GENTLE SMILE.

270
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,208
I'M SO SORRY I'LL
NEVER SEE IT AGAIN.

271
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,791
I THINK THAT'S WHAT
I'LL MISS THE MOST.

272
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,166
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU
ALWAYS TO SMILE.

273
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,583
NO MATTER HOW HARD THINGS ARE,
OR HOW SAD YOU ARE,

274
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:05,083
I PRAY THAT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
SMILING. CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

275
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,500
- ILLUMINA.

276
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,791
- SO WE FINALLY MEET, EUNOMIA.

277
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,500
I'M SORRY IT TOOK
ME A LITTLE LONGER

278
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,625
TO GET HERE THAN I'D PLANNED.

279
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:37,041
I KNOW YOU WERE TRYING TO
PROTECT THE HUMAN RACE,

280
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,750
BUT I'M AFRAID
YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE.

281
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,333
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT, THOUGH.

282
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,000
I THINK HUMAN BEINGS
ARE STRONGER

283
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,833
AND KINDER THAN YOU REALIZED.

284
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,583
I'VE LEARNED YOU CAN TRUST THEM.

285
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,416
AND SO...

286
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,791
GOODNIGHT.

287
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,291
- ( whizzing )

288
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,916
- AND PLEASANT DREAMS,
MY BELOVED SISTER.

289
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,708
- ( Japanese song playing )

290
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,083
- THERE. IT TOOK AWHILE

291
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,416
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I'M
BACK IN BUSINESS AGAIN.

292
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,000
HOLD IT!

293
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,000
- ( laughing nervously )

294
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,500
- HERE YOU GO. WE SHOULD
ALWAYS LEND A HAND

295
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,625
WHEN SOMEONE'S IN
NEED, SHOULDN'T WE?

296
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,166
- YEAH! THANKS A LOT!

297
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,666
- REFERRING TO THE INCIDENT,

298
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,375
AN R.U.C. SPOKESPERSON TODAY
ASSURED THE CITY'S RESIDENTS

299
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,333
THAT THE COMPANY
WILL REPAIR OR REPLACE

300
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,625
ALL RESEMBLE PARTS
FREE OF CHARGE.

301
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,000
WHAT'S MORE,

302
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,000
HE STATED THE COMPANY
WOULD WORK ROUND THE CLOCK,

303
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,416
IN A CEASELESS EFFORT
TO RESTORE ALL NECESSARY

304
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,916
SERVICES TO THE CITY.

305
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,958
R.U.C. HAS PLEDGED THAT ALL
ITS TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES

306
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,416
WILL BE BROUGHT TO BEAR IN
THE CURRENT REBUILDING EFFORT.

307
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
- Kasha: YOU MEAN
THAT'S EUNOMIA?

308
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,916
- Joseph: YEP, BUT IT'S
COMPLETELY OFF LINE NOW.

309
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,500
- Miranda: AND YOU'RE
TRANSFERRING DIRECT CONTROL

310
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,958
OF THE WATER AND ENERGY SYSTEMS
TO THE CITY'S ENGINEERS, RIGHT?

311
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,958
- THAT'S RIGHT.
AND WHEN WE'RE DONE

312
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,250
WE'LL HAVE REGAINED CONTROL
OF OUR OWN DESTINY.

313
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,583
AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS
SITTING ON THE SIDELINES,

314
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,083
IT FEELS GOOD TO BE
USING MY KNOWLEDGE

315
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,541
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AGAIN.

316
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,333
I'LL TELL YOU,
WITH R.U.C.'S TOP ENGINEERS,

317
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,333
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
TO GET EVERYTHING BACK

318
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,916
TO THE WAY THINGS USED TO BE.

319
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,166
- ( chuckles ) NOW DON'T FORGET
THE TEAM OUR OFFICE PROVIDED!

320
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,333
- FEEL FREE TO WORK 'EM
AS HARD AS YOU WANT TO.

321
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,750
- WHY ME? I DON'T EVEN
WORK FOR YOUR STUPID OFFICE.

322
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,375
- YOU'RE ALL WE COULD FIND.
NOW SHUT UP AND WORK.

323
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,125
- INTEGRA.

324
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,416
- THAT'S A DREAM THAT I'D LIKE
TO SEE COME TRUE ONE DAY.

325
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,833
- THEN I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST

326
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,416
THAT WE BOTH COME
BACK HERE TOGETHER.

327
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,500
- ( gasps )

328
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,250
WHAT ARE YOU...

329
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,375
- LET'S GO HOME.

330
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,333
- I DON'T KNOW.
TRY THE REVERSE.

331
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,875
- Roy: SO HOW'S
EVERYTHING COMING?

332
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,458
- IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY FOR
SURE. THIS SYSTEM DATES BACK

333
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,166
TO THE ORIGINAL
COLONISTS, YOU KNOW?

334
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,166
IT'S MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN
TODAY'S ENGINEERS ARE USED TO.

335
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,041
- YOU GOING TO LET HIM
TALK ABOUT YOU LIKE THAT?

336
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,791
- HECK NO, I CAN CRACK IT!

337
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,666
- SO WHERE'D SOLTY GO?
- SHE'S OVER THERE.

338
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,250
- HUH?
- OH, WHAT'S SHE DOING?

339
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,750
- Yuto: I DON'T KNOW.
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S INTERFACING

340
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:24,000
WITH SOME OF
EUNOMIA'S CIRCUITRY.

341
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,208
- YOU CAN'T.

342
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,458
- ( rumbling )

343
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,750
- BUT THAT'S NOT...

344
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,500
- ( rumbling )

345
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,041
- YOU MUSTN'T! YOU CAN'T DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT!

346
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,708
- ( rumbling )

347
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,541
- ( footsteps approaching )

348
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,208
- WHAT'S WRONG? SOLTY!

349
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:50,041
- EIRENE... SHE...
SHE'S COMING DOWN...

350
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,250
SHE'S COMING TO
DESTROY THE CITY.

351
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,166
- ( theme song playing )

352
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

353
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,458
- Roy: I LOVE YOU, ALL RIGHT?

354
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,666
- Rose: DO YOU MIND
IF I LOVE YOU, TOO?

355
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,750
- Solty: NEXT TIME.
THE FINAL EPISODE. "THE FUTURE."

356
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,541
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
