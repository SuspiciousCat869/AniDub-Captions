1
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,041
- Solty: NOW LET'S SEE.

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,083
THE BALLOONS WOULD
LOOK GOOD OVER THERE.

3
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,000
AND WHAT ELSE WILL WE NEED?

4
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,041
( giggles )

5
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,833
- HEY, WHAT'S UP WITH HER?

6
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,083
- HMM? DUNNO.

7
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,583
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
ASK HER YOURSELF?

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,125
( yawns )

9
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,625
- Roy: SOLTY.

10
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,666
- YEAH? WHAT DO YOU NEED?

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,375
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHY'RE YOU SO...

12
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,041
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN...

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,916
AW, HELL.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,500
- HE WANTS TO KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SO DAMN CHIPPER.

15
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,583
- UH, YEAH.

16
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,916
YEAH, THAT'S IT.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,166
- WELL, IT'S BECAUSE...

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,291
- BECAUSE OF WHAT?

19
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,000
- ( giggles )

20
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,250
IT'S A SECRET!

21
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,666
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED.

22
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,625
- OH! I REMEMBER NOW!
IT'S BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST YOUR...

23
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,000
- ( Solty laughs nervously )

24
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,208
OH, GOSH, LOOK AT THE TIME!
WE'VE GOT TO GET GOING!

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,750
- Rose: HEY!

26
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,958
- WELL, WE'LL SEE YOU LATER!

27
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,208
( laughs nervously )

28
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,166
- SOLTY, WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

29
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,416
- WHAT THE...

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
WHY? WHY GIRLS?

31
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,041
- ( theme song playing )

32
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

33
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,500
- ROSE, YOU'VE GOT TO
TRY TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

34
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,041
PLEASE WILL YOU?

35
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,750
- YEAH, OKAY. IT WAS MY BAD,
BUT HEY, NO HARM DONE, RIGHT?

36
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,791
- COME ON,
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SECRET!

37
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,125
WE CAN'T LET HIM FIND
OUT WHAT WE'RE UP TO!

38
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,250
IT WOULD MESS UP
THE SURPRISE PARTY!

39
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,208
- I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT.

40
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,958
BESIDES, YOU NEARLY
GAVE THE WHOLE THING AWAY

41
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,791
WITH YOUR LITTLE
MISS SUNSHINE ROUTINE.

42
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,833
AND ANYWAY,

43
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,666
NOBODY DOES BIRTHDAY PARTIES
ANYMORE, IT'S OLD FASHIONED.

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,333
- Miranda: WHO SAYS?

45
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,500
WE HAVE A BIRTHDAY
PARTY HERE EVERY YEAR.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
RIGHT, KASHA?

47
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,208
- MM-HMM.

48
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,208
- WELL, SURE, THAT'S
FINE KIDS AND ALL,

49
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,750
BUT LET'S BE REALISTIC,

50
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,625
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
AN OLD GUY HERE,

51
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,166
HE'S STARING
RETIREMENT IN THE FACE.

52
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,875
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

53
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,875
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW OLD YOU ARE.

54
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,333
WHAT COUNTS IS HOW
YOUNG YOU ARE AT HEART!

55
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,833
- GEEZ LOUEEZ.
DON'T YOU SOUND PROFOUND.

56
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,958
ACTUALLY, THAT'S
WHAT MIRANDA SAID.

57
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,500
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

58
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,000
- I'LL BET ROY THINKS
WE FORGOT HIS BIRTHDAY.

59
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,291
WE'LL WORK ALL DAY AND
ALL NIGHT IF WE HAVE TO,

60
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,208
AND THROW HIM THE
BEST PARTY EVER!

61
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,291
HE'LL BE SO SURPRISED HE
WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP SMILING!

62
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,041
- WELL, WHOOP-DE-DOO.

63
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,958
- I CAN HARDLY WAIT
TO SEE HIS FACE.

64
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,750
- THIS IS GOING TO
BE SO MUCH FUN!

65
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,625
- YEAH!

66
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,500
- ARE YOU IN ON THIS ONE TOO?

67
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,708
- HEY, I'M JUST A KID. I GOTTA
DO WHAT THE ADULTS TELL ME TO.

68
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,250
- ( Rose grunts )

69
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,791
- OH, COME ON, ROSE.
YOU'LL HELP US, WON'T YOU?

70
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,416
PLEASE SAY YOU WILL!

71
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,375
- YEAH, SURE. WHATEVER.

72
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,458
- ( giggles )

73
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,875
- Solty: MIRANDA,

74
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,000
I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE
FOOD SO I CAN START SHOPPING.

75
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,458
- Miranda: DON'T WORRY.
I'VE GOT IT ALL WRITTEN DOWN.

76
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,000
- Solty: WHAT ABOUT
THE DECORATIONS?

77
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,916
- Miranda: KASHA AND I
WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,666
- Miranda: DON'T WORRY ABOUT
A THING, IT'S ALL COVERED.

79
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,708
- Kasha: DON'T STRAIN YOURSELF.

80
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,291
- NASTY!

81
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,333
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

82
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,458
- IS ALL THIS BLOOD?

83
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,875
- Axela: THE VICTIM'S NAME
IS EREL BEANE.

84
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,291
ENGINEER FOR R.U.C. RESEMBLE
RESEARCH, NO CRIMINAL RECORD,

85
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,833
HIS FAMILY FILED A MISSING
PERSONS REPORT A FEW DAYS AGO.

86
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,500
- AH, SO HE WAS AN R.U.C. MAN,
WAS HE?

87
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,333
HMM, WELL, THERE YOU ARE.

88
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,750
GUESS THAT EXPLAINS WHY
THEY CALLED US IN ON THIS.

89
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,333
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING.

90
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:13,833
- JESUS, HOW CAN THERE BE SO
MUCH BLOOD BUT NO CORPSE?

91
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,041
- THERE WAS A CORPSE,
MORE OR LESS.

92
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,000
ACCORDING TO CSI, SOMEBODY PUT
A BOMB INSIDE THE GUY'S BODY

93
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,583
AND THEN DETONATED IT.

94
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,291
WHEN THEY FIRST GOT HERE, THE
POLICE FOUND THE VICTIM'S SCALP,

95
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,625
BOTH OF HIS ARMS, BOTH LEGS
FROM THE THIGH DOWN, AND UH...

96
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,875
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

97
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,666
THE PIECES HAVE ALREADY
BEEN SENT TO THE MORGUE.

98
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,208
- OH, GOD.

99
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,166
- HAVE THEY GOT AN
ESTIMATED TIME OF DEATH?

100
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,666
- BASED ON THE DEGREE OF RIGOR
IN THE PARTS THAT WERE LEFT,

101
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,625
DEATH MUST HAVE OCCURRED
BETWEEN 28 AND 36 HOURS AGO.

102
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,625
- OH, GOD.

103
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,250
- SO WE'VE GOT AN ISOLATED
ABANDONED BUILDING.

104
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,166
SOMEBODY ABDUCTS
A RESEMBLE ENGINEER

105
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,916
AND MURDERS HIM IN A ROOM
FULL OF SURGICAL EQUIPMENT.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,500
THIS GUY WAS AFTER ONE THING.

107
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,291
- A RESEMBLE OPERATION.

108
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,791
- Integra: RIGHT, BUT THEN HE
GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO MURDER

109
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,458
THE VICTIM WITH A BOMB.

110
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,458
NOT EXACTLY YOUR TYPICAL M.O.

111
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,250
SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO START
NARROWING A LIST OF SUSPECTS.

112
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,666
- HEY, UH, I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

113
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,666
SERIOUSLY, WE
GOTTA GO RIGHT NOW.

114
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,000
- Crime Scene Tech: WHAT'S THIS?

115
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,416
SHIT. OH, SHIT!

116
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,875
- ( whirring )

117
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,041
- EVERYONE, RUN! GET OUT!

118
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:18,916
- ( exhales )

119
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
- Larry: HERE YOU GO.

120
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,416
I DID THE BEST THAT I COULD.

121
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,166
IT'S A LIST OF WOMEN
FROM THE LOWER LEVELS

122
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,625
WHO MATCH THE
CONDITIONS YOU SPECIFIED.

123
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,416
EVEN SO, IT'S FAR FROM COMPLETE.

124
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,125
YOU REALLY THINK YOUR DAUGHTER
COULD BE ONE OF THEM?

125
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,500
- Roy: WHO KNOWS?

126
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,958
- YOU OWE ME BIG FOR THIS.

127
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,041
- YOUR SISTER STILL
LIVES AT MY PLACE.

128
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,375
I FIGURE WE'RE SQUARE.

129
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,000
- Toy Robot: HAPPY
BIRTHDAY TO YOU.

130
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,333
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.

131
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:01,041
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR ROY!

132
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,458
- LOOK OUT!

133
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,125
- ( Roy and Larry coughing )

134
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,833
- Roy: IF THAT'S YOUR IDEA
OF A BIRTHDAY PRANK,

135
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,458
I AM NOT A FAN OF IT.

136
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,083
( grunts )

137
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,083
- WHAT THE HELL WAS
THAT ALL ABOUT?

138
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,458
- ( telephone rings )

139
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,791
- ROY, MY OLD FRIEND.

140
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,333
DID YOU LIKE THE BIRTHDAY
PRESENT I SENT YOU?

141
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,958
- HO CHU?

142
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,291
- ( Ho Chu chuckles )

143
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,000
YOU REMEMBER ME! I'M SO GLAD!

144
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,041
- ( door bell dings )

145
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,083
- Solty: COMING!

146
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,458
JUST A MINUTE!

147
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,833
- Kasha: WE ARE JUST
BAKING A CAKE.

148
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,958
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO
BE SUCH A BIG SECRET?

149
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,416
- Miranda: WE DON'T WANT ROY TO
FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON, DO WE?

150
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,000
- CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?

151
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,291
- YEAH, GOT A PACKAGE
FOR YOU HERE, LITTLE LADY.

152
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,666
- OH?

153
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,333
- THAT'S RIGHT,
SPECIAL DELIVERY.

154
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,083
- Ho Chu: FOR REVENGE,
OF COURSE.

155
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,750
OH, AND I'VE REPLACED
THE ARM YOU MUTILATED.

156
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,541
ISN'T THIS RESEMBLE
TECHNOLOGY AMAZING?

157
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,791
I HAVE TO SAY, I'M A VERY
SATISFIED CUSTOMER.

158
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,708
I'M ABLE TO CREATE
EVEN MORE INTRICATE

159
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,833
AND BEAUTIFUL BOMBS THAN BEFORE.

160
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,291
- WHEN DID YOU GET OUT?

161
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,625
- Ho Chu: ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

162
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,375
I, UH, LET MYSELF OUT.

163
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,291
- AND WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

164
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,875
- WHO KNOWS?
WHERE DO YOU THINK?

165
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,291
- ( grunts )

166
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,666
- Ho Chu: EASY, ROY. I'M SAVING
YOU FOR THE MAIN COURSE.

167
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,041
BUT BEFORE I SAVOR
THAT PARTICULAR MEAL,

168
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,000
I THINK I'LL START
WITH AN HORS D'OEUVRE.

169
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,666
- YOU WOULDN'T!

170
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,916
- Ho Chu: OH, YES!

171
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,416
- Miranda: WHO WAS
THAT AT THE DOOR?

172
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,000
- Solty: OH, IT WAS A PACKAGE,
FOR ROY.

173
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,708
- Miranda: FOR ROY?
HERE? WHO'S THE SENDER?

174
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,958
- Solty: LET'S SEE.
LOOKS LIKE A MISTER HO CHU.

175
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,000
- HO?

176
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,583
- THAT'S RIGHT.

177
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,958
- GET RID OF IT! THROW IT
OUT THE WINDOW, QUICKLY!

178
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,000
- HUH?

179
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,166
- ( explosion booms )

180
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,041
- ( laughs )

181
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,000
OH, THAT IS SUCH A LOVELY
SOUND, DON'T YOU AGREE?

182
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,291
MY BOMBS ARE TRULY WORKS
OF SWEET CHAOTIC ART!

183
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,333
- BASTARD!

184
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,791
- ( Ho Chu laughs )

185
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,541
OH, I WISH I COULD SEE THE
LOOK ON YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW!

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,916
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
GET AHEAD OF MYSELF.

187
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,666
ALWAYS SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST,
THAT'S WHAT I SAY.

188
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,750
- HO!

189
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,916
- SO, PLEASE, TRY NOT
TO DIE TOO SOON.

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,666
- STOP THIS!

191
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,083
- IF YOU DON'T MIND.

192
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,333
- WE CAN MAKE A DEAL.

193
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,000
JUST TELL ME WHERE YOU
ARE. WE CAN MEET YOU.

194
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,041
- ( beeping tone )

195
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,458
- WHAT'S THAT?

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,958
AH!

197
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,416
- ( police sirens wailing )

198
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,041
- ( exhales )

199
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,125
- HELLO LADIES,
YOU'RE LOOKING BETTER.

200
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,416
I BROUGHT THESE TO
BRIGHTEN UP YOUR ROOM.

201
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,458
HOPE YOU LIKE THEM.

202
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,583
- UH, THANK YOU,
THEY'RE LOVELY, I...

203
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,500
- HEY, JUST, TAKE IT EASY.

204
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,458
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER SILVIA.

205
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,875
I WISH I COULD STAY BUT I HAVE
A MEETING I HAVE TO GET TO.

206
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,208
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY?

207
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,958
- YEAH, SURE,
AND THANK YOU FOR THE FLOWERS!

208
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,000
- IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

209
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,625
- HOPE WE'RE NOT
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.

210
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,708
- UH...

211
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,208
- OH, THANKS FOR THE FLOWERS!

212
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,375
- WHA... DON'T BE AN IDIOT,
YOU MUST HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE!

213
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,958
- OKAY, THEN!
WHAT GOODIES DID YOU BRING US?

214
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,666
- OW, OW, OW...
- HA, HA, HA, HA.

215
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,541
- WHAT A RELIEF! YOU TWO ARE
DOING BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.

216
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,791
- NO, WE'RE NOT,
WE FEEL TERRIBLE.

217
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,958
DID YOU BRING US A CAKE?
A MELON?

218
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,166
SOME NUTS?
YOU MUST'VE BROUGHT SOMETHING!

219
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,125
- YEP, WE BROUGHT YOU
YOUR INSURANCE FORMS.

220
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,625
- THAT REALLY SUCKS.

221
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,041
- SO WHAT ABOUT THE CASE?
YOU STILL ON IT?

222
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,166
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

223
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,625
FOR NOW, YOU TWO
JUST TAKE IT EASY

224
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,000
AND CONCENTRATE ON
GETTING WELL SOON, OKAY?

225
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,041
HERE YOU GO.
WE'LL BE BACK LATER.

226
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,625
- I, UH... GLAD YOU GUYS
DIDN'T GET BLOWN UP.

227
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,750
- NO MELON?

228
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,000
- Integra: WHERE ARE YOU ON
THE ANALYSIS OF THE PERP'S MO?

229
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,125
- Axela: ALL DONE.

230
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,791
- DID YOU TURN UP
ANY LIKELY SUSPECTS?

231
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,833
- FOUND ONLY ONE MAN THAT
COMBINES THESE METHODS

232
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,000
WITH THIS KIND OF SADISM.
HIS NAME IS HO CHU.

233
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,458
HE WAS THE MASTERMIND BEHIND
THOSE SKYSCRAPER BOMBINGS

234
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,833
A FEW YEARS AGO.

235
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,583
EXCEPT HE BROKE OUT OF
CERBERUS PRISON LAST MONTH,

236
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,958
AND NO ONE'S SEEN HIM SINCE.

237
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,708
- THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO TRACK HIM DOWN.

238
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:40,750
- RIGHT!

239
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,375
- ( both grunt )

240
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,208
( panting )

241
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,875
- A NICE MESS YOU GOT ME INTO!

242
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,583
- FILE A COMPLAINT
WITH MY OFFICE.

243
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,375
- I SWEAR TO GOD
IF ROSE IS HURT...

244
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,291
- JUST ABOUT TO CALL
'EM CHECK ON THAT.

245
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,250
IF YOU'D GET OUT OF MY WAY.
WOULD YOU MOVE OR SOMETHING!

246
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,458
- I'M STUCK.

247
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,291
- ( phone rings )

248
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,083
- Roy: COME ON. DAMN IT!

249
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,333
THERE'S NO ANSWER!

250
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,208
- I WARN YOU, IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO ROSE...

251
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,750
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP!

252
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,875
TRY THE HUNTERS' OFFICE.

253
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,416
DISCONNECTED.

254
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
- ROY, I HAVE TO...
- DO IT.

255
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,708
- Man: WAIT, PLEASE.

256
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,291
YOU MUSTN'T GO. PLEASE DON'T.

257
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,791
HE'LL KILL ME IF YOU DO.

258
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,750
- KNOW THIS GUY?

259
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,500
- ( phone rings )

260
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,083
- ANSWER IT.

261
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,708
ANSWER THE PHONE. QUICKLY.

262
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,500
PLEASE!

263
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,666
HE'LL KILL ME.

264
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,375
- ( phone rings )

265
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,958
- Man: PICK UP THE PHONE.

266
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,958
- ( phone continues to ring )

267
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,625
- SAVE ME.

268
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,666
I'M BEGGING YOU!

269
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,708
- ( phone continues to ring )

270
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,416
- Ho Chu: ROY, MY FRIEND,
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE. WELL DONE!

271
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,541
- HO, WHAT'S GOING ON?

272
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,500
- AREN'T YOU ENJOYING THE GAME?

273
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,041
BUT YOU'RE DOING SO WELL,

274
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,708
YOU MADE IT PAST
THE FIRST LEVEL.

275
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,500
NOW IT'S TIME FOR LEVEL TWO.

276
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,875
- WHAT?

277
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,833
- DO YOU SEE THAT BOX
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET,

278
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,208
SITTING ON THE MEDIAN?

279
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,000
THAT'S RIGHT.

280
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,375
THE ONE THAT ADORABLE LITTLE
BOY IS LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.

281
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,958
THERE'S A BOMB IN THAT BOX.

282
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,375
WHAT'S MORE, IT'S
SYNCHRONIZED WITH

283
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,791
THE BOMB THAT'S STRAPPED
TO THAT MAN BEHIND YOU.

284
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,083
IF YOU DON'T DISARM BOTH BOMBS
AT THE EXACT SAME MOMENT...

285
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,791
KA BOOM.

286
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:40,833
- YOU SON OF A...

287
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,125
- IT'S LIKE I TOLD YOU,
IT'S A GAME.

288
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,458
JUST RELAX, YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

289
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,000
I'LL TELL YOU HOW
TO DISARM THEM.

290
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,791
- AND IF I REFUSE TO PLAY?

291
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:53,166
- OH, LOOK, I HAVE
A REMOTE CONTROL DETONATOR.

292
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,791
I WONDER IF IT WORKS?

293
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,083
ARE WE ON THE
SAME PAGE NOW, ROY?

294
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,541
- BUT I CAN'T DISARM THEM
BOTH AT THE SAME TIME!

295
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,875
- YOU HAVE AN ASSISTANT
RIGHT NEXT YOU.

296
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,875
I'M SURE MR. ANDERSON WILL
BE DELIGHTED TO LEND A HAND.

297
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,375
- Larry: SCREW YOU.

298
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,666
- HEY! WHAT ARE YOU...

299
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,041
- THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

300
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,666
- ( explosion booms )

301
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,791
- ( phone rings )

302
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,125
- Ho Chu: YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE, LARRY.

303
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,208
IF YOU PULL ANOTHER
STUNT LIKE THAT,

304
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,875
I'LL DETONATE THE BOMB
ON THAT MAN'S CHEST.

305
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,500
- YOU WIN, FREAK.

306
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,541
I'LL PLAY ALONG WITH YOUR
GAME FOR THE TIME BEING.

307
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,250
- OKAY! LET THE GAME BEGIN!

308
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,833
ROY, YOU TAKE THE
ONE ACROSS THE STREET.

309
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,833
A PANEL INSIDE THE BOX WILL
TELL YOU HOW TO DISARM IT.

310
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,791
- ( cars honking )

311
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,375
- Driver: ASSHOLE!

312
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,666
- Little Boy: HEY, GRAMPS.

313
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,875
DON'T YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD
CROSS AT THE CORNER?

314
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,791
- ACTUALLY, THAT
PACKAGE THERE IS MINE.

315
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,541
GUESS I MUST HAVE DROPPED IT.

316
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,125
- REALLY?

317
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:08,083
- Ho Chu: OKAY, FIRST, PULL THE
PIN ATTACHED TO THE BLUE CABLE.

318
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,500
- HOLD STILL AND STAY CALM.

319
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,125
- ALL RIGHT, TO START WE
GOTTA TAKE OFF THE TOP COVER.

320
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,708
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO STAY CALM!

321
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,083
- THERE, NOW WHAT COMES NEXT?

322
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,625
- WHY IN THE HELL
AM I DOING THIS?

323
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,708
- WHAT'S NEXT? COME ON, WHAT'S
NEXT? HURRY UP AND TELL ME!

324
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,666
- DAMN IT! IS THIS THE ONE?

325
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,791
- ( laughs maliciously )

326
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,125
LARRY, BE VERY CAREFUL
WHEN YOU PULL THAT ONE OUT.

327
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,000
CAREFUL. CAREFUL.

328
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,833
( laughs maliciously )

329
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:06,958
EASY!

330
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,708
SEE THAT LITTLE METAL BALL?

331
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,166
IF THAT METAL BALL TOUCHES
EITHER END OF THAT GLASS TUBE,

332
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,916
IT'S PARTY TIME!

333
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,583
- MOTHER F... STOP MOVING!

334
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,416
- Ho Chu: OOO!
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE!

335
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,958
YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP
LIKE YOUR BROTHER, DO YOU?

336
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,250
- WHAT?

337
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,833
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ANDY,
YOU SICK MANIAC?

338
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,875
- I JUST SENT HIM
A LITTLE PRESENT.

339
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,583
I DON'T MEAN TO BE
HARSH, MY FRIEND,

340
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,125
BUT I REALLY THINK YOU
SHOULD BE WORRYING

341
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,000
ABOUT YOURSELF AT THE MOMENT.

342
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,958
- YOU'RE DEAD. YOU HEAR ME?

343
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,875
- YES, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

344
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,416
- Roy: NO!

345
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,958
I COULDN'T READ IT!

346
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,166
GET OUT OF HERE, KID!

347
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,000
- Ho Chu: OH, WELL PLAYED!

348
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,083
NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE STEP LEFT.

349
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,333
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S
ABOUT ALL I CAN TELL YOU.

350
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,875
- SAY WHAT?

351
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,916
- Ho Chu: MY GAME, MY RULES.

352
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,208
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

353
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,333
- A PLAYER CAN'T WIN
THE GAME IF HE'S FAINT OF HEART.

354
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,250
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
THE PROPER SPIRIT.

355
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,208
YOU CAN ONLY WIN IF
YOU'RE BRAVE ENOUGH.

356
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,250
- YOU HAD IT PLANNED
LIKE THIS FROM THE START!

357
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,166
- YOUR HINT IS BRAVERY.

358
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,625
- ( tone beeping )

359
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,208
- Roy: BRAVERY?

360
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:21,958
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

361
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,291
- ( Man with bomb cries )

362
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,541
- Larry: LOOK, I'M SORRY, MAN.
BUT THERE'S NO TIME LEFT.

363
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,083
GET DOWN INTO THAT MANHOLE.

364
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,833
IT'LL KEEP CASUALTIES
TO A MINIMUM.

365
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,833
- NO. NO, PLEASE.

366
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:33,875
- GET MOVING!

367
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,041
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

368
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,708
PLEASE, I HAVE A FAMILY.

369
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,041
( cries )

370
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,333
DON'T! PLEASE!

371
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,916
- NO, LARRY, DON'T DO IT!

372
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,166
LARRY, DON'T SHOOT!

373
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,500
- ( phone beeps )

374
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,083
- Roy: WE'VE BEEN PLAYED.

375
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,375
THESE BOMBS ARE DUMMIES.

376
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,750
THE WHOLE THING WAS A SET UP.

377
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,500
- Larry: HO CHU.

378
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,666
YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.

379
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,833
WHEN I FIND YOU...

380
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,875
- Rose: HMM.

381
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,458
A BIRTHDAY PRESENT, HUH?

382
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,791
WHAT A PAIN.

383
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,500
OH, WELL, I HAVE BEEN
CRASHING THERE RENT FREE.

384
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,458
IT'S PROBABLY A
PRETTY GOOD IDEA FOR ME

385
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,958
TO TRY AND STAY ON THE
LANDLADY'S GOOD SIDE.

386
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,166
- Ho Chu: EXCUSE ME.

387
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,208
- WHO, ME?

388
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,875
- Roy: HEY.

389
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:47,916
- ROY!

390
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,041
- ARE YOU AND KASHA BOTH OKAY?

391
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,000
- YES, WE ARE THANK GOODNESS.

392
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,833
- WHAT ABOUT SOLTY?
WHERE IS SHE?

393
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:55,875
- RIGHT HERE!

394
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,458
AH, I'M GOOD AS NEW.

395
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,208
- SO, EVERYONE'S OKAY?

396
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,333
- IT WAS SOLTY WHO
SAVED OUR LIVES.

397
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,500
OTHERWISE THINGS WOULD'VE
BEEN WORSE THAN THIS.

398
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,916
- SHE WAS SO AWESOME!

399
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,666
SHE GRABBED THE BOMB AND
THREW IT OUT THE WINDOW

400
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,333
JUST A SECOND
BEFORE IT EXPLODED!

401
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,375
- GET RID OF IT!

402
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,541
- Kasha: IT WAS GREAT! ALL
THE SOOT FROM THE EXPLOSION

403
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,625
MADE HER LOOK LIKE
A CHIMNEY SWEEP!

404
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:22,708
- YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

405
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,000
- ROY, IT'S...
IT'S HO CHU AGAIN.

406
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,375
- OH, I KNOW. MIRANDA,
I WANT YOU TO GET AS MANY

407
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,875
HUNTERS TOGETHER AS
YOU CAN FOR PROTECTION.

408
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,458
CHECK INTO A HOTEL
FOR THE NIGHT.

409
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,125
IT'S NOT GOOD TO STAY HERE.

410
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,416
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER.

411
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,208
- YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT
AFTER HIM, AREN'T YOU?

412
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,750
WELL, I WANT A
PIECE OF HIM MYSELF.

413
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,333
I WHAT THAT BASTARD TO PAY
FOR WHAT HE DID TO MY OFFICE!

414
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,333
- I WANNA HELP TOO,
COUNT ME IN!

415
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,000
- I'M NOT STAYING IN
A HOTEL BY MYSELF

416
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,166
WITH JUST A BUNCH OF
CREEPY HUNTERS AROUND!

417
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,208
- ( grunts )

418
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,208
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I GUESS IT'LL BE

419
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,000
EASIER TO PROTECT YOU IF
YOU ALL IN THE SAME PLACE.

420
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,958
OKAY, FIRST WE
HAVE TO FIND ROSE.

421
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,333
THEN WE NEED ALL THE INFO
WE CAN GET ON HO.

422
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,708
- ( machine beeping )

423
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,166
- Roy: HAVE YOU FOUND OUT
WHERE ROSE IS YET?

424
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,958
- Miranda: I'VE GOT MEN
LOOKING FOR HER NOW.

425
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,375
- AND WHAT ABOUT HO?

426
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,708
- I CAN TRACK HIS WHEREABOUTS
UP UNTIL TWO DAYS AGO.

427
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,708
AFTER THAT, GONE
WITHOUT A TRACE.

428
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,375
- WELL, KEEP ON IT.
- I WILL.

429
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,500
- ( Solty humming )

430
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,500
( humming continues)

431
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,041
- Roy: SOLTY!

432
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,333
- ( stops humming )

433
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,541
- YES? WHAT IS IT?

434
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,125
- WHAT WAS THAT TUNE
YOU WERE HUMMING?

435
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,666
- OH! THAT'S JUST A LITTLE SONG
ROSE TAUGHT ME THE OTHER DAY.

436
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,500
SHE SAID SINGING IT HELPS HER
FEEL BETTER WHEN SHE'S TENSE.

437
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,791
SO I THOUGHT IF I SANG IT,
YOU'D FEEL BETTER.

438
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,708
HUH?

439
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,375
WHAT IS IT?

440
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,875
- YOU MEAN ROSE WAS
SINGING THAT SONG?

441
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,208
- ( Sarah humming )

442
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,791
- Miranda: WHAT'S THAT?

443
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,458
- Yuto: IT WAS IN THE MAILBOX,
ADDRESSED TO ROY.

444
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,916
I SCANNED IT FOR ALL
KNOWN EXPLOSIVES

445
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,625
AND IT CAME OUT CLEAN.

446
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,875
IT'S A VIDEO DISK.

447
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,041
- A VIDEO DISK, HUH?
- YEP.

448
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,625
- HELLO ROY, OLD FRIEND.

449
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,541
I HOPE YOU HAD FUN
THE OTHER DAY. I DID.

450
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,375
AS YOU CAN SEE,
MISS ROSE HAS JOINED THE GAME.

451
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,500
YOU CAN RELAX.

452
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,500
SHE'S STILL ALIVE, FOR NOW.

453
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:50,125
COME TO THE CROWN CENTER
BUILDING ON SOUTH 3RD STREET.

454
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,791
COME ALONE, OF COURSE.

455
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,500
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL LEVEL.

456
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,500
( laughs maliciously )

457
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,166
- ( closing theme playing )

458
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

459
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,541
- Solty: ROSE...

460
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,625
- Roy: I SWEAR, I'LL...

461
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,208
- Solty: NEXT TIME,
"TEARS, AFTER THE SHOWDOWN."

462
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,583
( Solty screams )
