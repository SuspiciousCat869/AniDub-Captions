1
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,791
- "ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?"

2
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,583
THAT'S THE SLOGAN BEING USED FOR
THIS YEAR'S APPRECIATION DAY,

3
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,750
NOW JUST THREE DAYS AWAY.

4
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,125
IN TODAY'S SEGMENT, I WILL
BE OUT ON THE STREETS

5
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,208
ASKING PEOPLE THIS
VERY QUESTION.

6
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,250
THIS IS NANA
ROCKWELL, REPORTING.

7
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:40,583
- ( Solty reading )

8
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,583
- APPRECIATION DAY?
WHAT'S THAT?

9
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:46,916
- IT'S A FESTIVAL, SOLTY.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,291
IT'S BEEN HELD ONCE EVERY
YEAR SINCE I WAS YOUNG.

11
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,708
- IT'S A FUNNY NAME, HUH?
TO CELEBRATE IT,

12
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,833
ALL WE REALLY DO IS DECORATE
THE HOUSE AND HAVE A PARTY.

13
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:58,083
- A PARTY? WHO IS IT
THAT YOU APPRECIATE?

14
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:01,333
- ANYONE, REALLY.
- ANYONE, AT ALL?

15
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,250
- THAT'S RIGHT. YOUR FRIENDS
OR FAMILY, LOVED ONES.

16
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,375
IT'S A TIME WHEN WE SHOW OUR
APPRECIATION TO EVERYONE.

17
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,208
WE GIVE THANKS FOR A SAFE YEAR,
AND FOR THE TIME WE GET TO SPEND

18
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,875
TOGETHER WITH THE
PEOPLE AROUND US.

19
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,750
IT'S A DAY TO
APPRECIATE EVERYTHING.

20
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,250
- APPRECIATE EVERYTHING?

21
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,625
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

22
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:21,166
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY YOU'LL
BE COMING TO OUR PARTY.

23
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,375
ROY, AND ROSE, AND YOU, SOLTY.

24
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,541
ALL OF US. IT WOULDN'T BE
THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.

25
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,750
- YOU WANT ME TO COME?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN? OF COURSE.

26
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,291
LIKE THEY SAY,
"THE MORE THE MERRIER".

27
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,541
- WELL, OKAY. I ACCEPT.
I'D LOVE TO COME TO THE PARTY.

28
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,833
- THAT'S GREAT.
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

29
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,291
- ( doorbell ringing )

30
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,125
- HUH. NOW I WONDER
WHO THAT COULD BE.

31
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,666
- UH, I'LL GO AND FIND OUT.

32
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,625
- COMING. HELLO, MAY I HELP YOU?

33
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,958
- IT'S YOU.
THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE?

34
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,083
- ( exclaims )

35
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,083
- WELL THEN, MIND IF I COME IN?
I WAS...

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,375
HEY, WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

37
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,083
- ( theme music playing )

38
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

39
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,958
- Miranda: I'M SURE
IT WAS JUST A MISTAKE.

40
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,000
- Woman: SHE SLAMMED
THE DOOR IN MY FACE.

41
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,416
- Solty: I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT YELL AT ME AGAIN.

42
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,708
- SO, YOU'RE AN ACQUAINTANCE
OF SOLTY'S, I TAKE IT?

43
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:44,666
- YEAH, THE NAME'S AMU TRANFA.
I RUN THE A.T. HUNTER'S AGENCY.

44
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,250
- YOU KNOW, I THINK I MAY
HAVE HEARD OF YOU, MISS TRANFA.

45
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,875
YOU'RE WITH THE RED FOUR,
AREN'T YOU?

46
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:53,208
- INDEED I AM. AND YOUR
REPUTATION PRECEDES YOU, TOO.

47
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,916
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT
YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,750
WITH MAVERICK
HUNTERS' AGENCY,

49
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,208
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE
INCIDENT WITH NOYMANN.

50
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,541
- OH, WELL, WE
OWE THAT TO SOLTY.

51
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,416
CERTAINLY COULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT HER.

52
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,708
- ( laughing sheepishly )

53
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,083
- SO I'VE HEARD.

54
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,041
AND AFTER MY ENCOUNTER WITH HER
I DON'T DOUBT IT FOR A SECOND.

55
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,125
- YOU'VE HAD AN "ENCOUNTER"
WITH HER? LIKE A FIGHT?

56
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,291
- YEP.

57
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,333
- LET'S JUST FORGET
ABOUT THAT FOR NOW.

58
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,750
I BELIEVE YOUR NAME
IS KASHA MAVERICK?

59
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,833
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

60
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,958
- WELL, I'M GOING TO
BE BLUNT WITH YOU.

61
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,833
KASHA, ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

62
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,041
- HUH?

63
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,000
- Rose: WHAT? AM I HAPPY NOW?

64
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:34,208
WELL, ISN'T THAT OBVIOUS?
I'M SO HAPPY NOW.

65
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,541
IF YOU DON'T THINK
I'M FEELING PURE HAPPINESS,

66
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,125
THEN PLEASE SHOW ME
SOMEBODY WHO IS.

67
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:42,333
- WELL, I...
- BUT I MEAN REALLY.

68
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,541
ISN'T IT NONSENSE TO ASK THAT
QUESTION IN THE FIRST PLACE?

69
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,625
LET'S BE SERIOUS.

70
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,375
HAPPINESS DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN,

71
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,666
HAPPINESS IS SOMETHING THAT
YOU CAN GRAB A HOLD OF

72
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,000
AND TAKE FOR YOURSELF.

73
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,125
UNDERSTAND ME?
I MEAN, COME ON. 

74
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,708
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

75
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,833
YOU PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OF JUST HOW EASY YOU'VE GOT IT.

76
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,375
- THAT'S PROBABLY THE REASON...

77
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,166
- WELL, THAT'S JUST ABOUT ALL
THE TIME WE HAVE FOR TODAY.

78
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,250
- HEY, I WASN'T DONE TALKING.

79
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,291
LIKE I WAS SAYING, BEFORE I
WAS SO RUDELY INTERRUPTED...

80
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,666
- Roy: WHAT DOES THAT
STUPID GIRL THINK SHE'S DOING?

81
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,083
- Nana: WE SEEM TO

82
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,041
BE HAVING SOME TECHNICAL
DIFFICULTIES. PLEASE STAND BY.

83
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,541
- NOW, WHERE IS SHE?

84
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,000
- EXCUSE ME.

85
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,416
WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO BE FROM
MAVERICK HUNTER'S AGENCY?

86
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,708
- OH, THERE YOU ARE.

87
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,125
YES, I AM AND I WAS
CONFUSED BY YOU MESSAGE...

88
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,625
- I'M SORRY ABOUT BEING LATE.

89
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,166
IT TOOK ME LONGER
THAN USUAL TO GET READY.

90
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,875
- ( gasps ) SARAH.

91
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,875
- SARAH, HUH?
STRANGE NAME FOR A GUY.

92
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,541
- NO. SORRY.
MY NAME'S ROY REVANT.

93
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,916
- ROY. NOW THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

94
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,375
- WHY DON'T WE HAVE A SEAT?

95
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,875
- YOU CAN FILL ME IN
ON THE DETAILS.

96
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,333
- SURE.

97
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,750
- Kasha: SO, YOU WANNA KNOW
IF I'M HAPPY? IS THAT IT?

98
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,333
- Amu: YEP.

99
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,541
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO GET AT?
I'M JUST A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL.

100
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,500
I DAYDREAM AND FANTASIZE
ALL THE TIME.

101
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,041
WELL, I GUESS I MIGHT BE
A LITTLE MORE PRONE TO DAYDREAM

102
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,291
THAN SOME OF THE
OTHER GIRLS MY AGE.

103
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,041
AND, BECAUSE OF
THE BUSINESS WE'RE IN,

104
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,208
I DO TEND TO SEE
THE DARK SIDE OF PEOPLE.

105
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,166
YOU KNOW MOST OF MY FRIENDS
ARE MORE INTO THINKING ABOUT

106
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,708
THEIR FUTURE AND STUFF,

107
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,666
OR ABOUT WHAT CUTE DRESS
THEY'RE GONNA ASK FOR.

108
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,458
BUT NOT ME. WELL, MAYBE
I THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE,

109
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,250
BUT NOT SO MUCH
ABOUT THE DRESSES.

110
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,041
MM.

111
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,708
WORKING IN THIS OFFICE
HAS MADE AN IMPRESSION ON ME.

112
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,375
I'VE SEEN WAY MORE
DOWNTRODDEN FOLKS

113
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,083
THAN PEOPLE WHO'VE
REALIZED THEIR DREAMS.

114
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,500
SO, ASKING ME ABOUT MY
HAPPINESS IS KINDA SILLY.

115
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,250
IT'S NONSENSE. GET ME?

116
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,625
- YES. PERFECTLY.

117
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,625
SORRY TO HAVE BOTHERED YOU.
OH, AND THANKS FOR THE CAKE.

118
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,333
- WHY WAS SHE HERE?
DO YOU KNOW?

119
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,416
- NO. I DON'T.

120
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,666
- Miranda: KASHA.
- ( door closes )

121
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,250
- HUH?

122
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,750
- I HAD NO IDEA THAT THAT'S THE
WAY YOU FELT ABOUT THINGS.

123
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,458
- I'M A TERRIBLE MOM.
- MIRANDA.

124
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,541
- UH, OH, COME ON, MOM.

125
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,750
DON'T TAKE WHAT I
SAID SO SERIOUSLY.

126
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:56,208
ALL KIDS THINK STUFF LIKE THAT.
IT'S NORMAL, NORMAL.

127
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,333
- YOU MEAN IT?
- YES, TOTALLY.

128
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,583
- THEN, YOU ARE HAPPY?

129
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,041
- WHAT A SILLY QUESTION.
OF COURSE I AM.

130
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,416
- REALLY? OH, I'M SO GLAD.

131
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,250
- EASY, MOM. YOU'RE
HURTING ME. LET GO.

132
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,916
- HAPPY?

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,458
- IT WAS ROSE ANDERSON...
- THEY NEVER GIVE UP, DO THEY?

134
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,750
THAT'S WHAT I GET
FOR BEING ON TV.

135
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,583
SILLY BOYS. THEY'LL HAVE TO
DO A LOT BETTER THAN THAT

136
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,375
IF THEY THINK THEY'RE
GONNA CATCH ME.

137
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,416
- ( gasps )
WHAT IN THE... HELLO.

138
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:41,916
- HAPPINESS.

139
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,458
- Rose: I'M HOME.
- HUH. HEY, WELCOME BACK.

140
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:50,250
- SOLTY, JUST THE PERSON
I WANTED TO SEE. COME ON IN.

141
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,500
- UH, ROSE, WHO'S THAT WITH YOU?

142
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,791
- WAIT, YOUR DAUGHTER?

143
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,250
- YES. SHE'S THE REASON THAT I
CONTACTED YOU. I NEED YOUR HELP.

144
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,375
- ( sighs )

145
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:04,541
- WHAT IS IT? YOU'RE STARING
AT ME. WHAT'S WRONG?

146
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,083
- UH, IT'S NOTHING.

147
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,500
- ROSE, WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

148
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,708
- WELL, I WAS ON THE WAY BACK
AND I RAN INTO THIS GIRL.

149
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,208
SHE NEEDS SOME HELP. SOMETHING
ABOUT HER MOTHER OR SOMETHING.

150
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,791
- HELLO.
- HER MOTHER?

151
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,916
- I LOST MY HUSBAND
IN THE BLAST FALL.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,875
- SINCE THEN, IT'S JUST BEEN
MY DAUGHTER AND I.

153
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,750
- AND I TAKE IT SOMETHING
HAS HAPPENED TO HER. WHAT IS IT?

154
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,166
- IT WAS ABOUT
THREE YEARS AGO, I GUESS.

155
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,833
I FIGURED IT WAS TIME TO PACK
UP MY THINGS, LEAVE THE HOUSE,

156
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,000
AND GO OUT ON MY OWN IN HOPES
OF FULFILLING MY BIGGEST DREAM.

157
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,208
- WOW, THAT'S REALLY
BRAVE OF YOU.

158
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,458
- SO, WHAT WAS THIS DREAM
YOU WANTED TO FULFILL?

159
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,166
- IT'S A SECRET.

160
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,750
- MY DAUGHTER IS A VERY
SWEET AND CARING GIRL.

161
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,125
EVEN AFTER SHE LEFT HOME,

162
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,625
SHE ALWAYS CALLED ME ONCE
A WEEK, LIKE CLOCKWORK.

163
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,416
- AND SHE, SHE SENT ME MONEY
EVERY MONTH,

164
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,541
EVEN AFTER I TOLD HER ALL THE
TIME THAT I DIDN'T NEED IT.

165
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,750
INSTEAD OF ALWAYS
WORRYING ABOUT ME SO MUCH,

166
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,791
I JUST WISH MY MOTHER WOULD FIND
A LITTLE HAPPINESS OF HER OWN,

167
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:05,708
YOU KNOW?

168
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,416
- HAPPINESS?

169
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,083
- I APPRECIATE HER CONCERN,

170
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,333
BUT THE WHOLE SITUATION'S
A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR ME.

171
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,666
I KEEP THINKING I MIGHT BE
HOLDING MY DAUGHTER BACK

172
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,500
FROM PURSUING HER DREAMS.

173
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,708
- OKAY. SO WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT ME TO DO?

174
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,250
- HUH? WAIT, YOU
WANT ME TO DO IT?

175
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,041
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

176
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:28,208
- IF YOU DID, MY MOTHER WOULD
SERIOUSLY HAVE A HEART ATTACK.

177
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,500
- THEN, WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

178
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,666
- SHE HAS A PLAN THAT I
THINK JUST MIGHT WORK,

179
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,041
AND YOU AND I ARE GOING
TO HELP HER WITH IT.

180
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,333
- I SEE. OF COURSE, I'LL DO IT.

181
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,375
- SO IF EVERYTHING
GOES AS PLANNED,

182
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,791
THEN THIS WILL HELP MOTHER
TO STOP WORRYING ABOUT ME

183
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,666
AND START LOOKING
AFTER HER OWN HAPPINESS.

184
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,833
SO YOU ACTUALLY MEAN IT?
YOU'LL BOTH HELP ME OUT?

185
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,375
- NOW WHAT KIND OF
WOMEN WOULD WE BE

186
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,791
IF WE IGNORED YOUR CRY FOR HELP?

187
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,375
OF COURSE, WE WILL.
RIGHT, SOLTY?

188
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,875
- THAT'S RIGHT.
JUST LEAVE IT TO US.

189
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,583
- WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING.

190
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,541
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

191
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,750
- HAPPINESS.

192
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:08,750
- PLEASE, ROY. HELP ME.
YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE.

193
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,458
- I...

194
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:15,041
- WHAT'RE YOU...
- ( exclaims ) FORGIVE ME.

195
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,583
- I'LL, UH, I'LL GIVE YOU
MY ANSWER TOMORROW.

196
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,958
- ALL RIGHT.

197
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,041
- Silvia: ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

198
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,750
- WHAT? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

199
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,666
- I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SLOGAN
FOR APPRECIATION DAY,

200
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,541
WHICH I ASSUME
YOU'RE SPENDING ALONE.

201
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,166
- THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

202
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,166
AND I BET YOU'RE
DOING THE SAME THING.

203
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,958
- WHAT ABOUT YOU? CELICA?
- WHAT'S THAT?

204
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,041
- ARE YOU SPENDING APPRECIATION
DAY WITH YOUR PARENTS AGAIN?

205
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,416
- HMM. SURE AM.
THAT'S THE PLAN, ANYWAY.

206
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,625
- SHE DOESN'T SEEM
TOO THRILLED ABOUT IT.

207
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,708
- WHOA, SHE'S USUALLY THE MOST
EXCITED OUT OF ALL OF ALL OF US.

208
00:10:55,791 --> 00:11:00,291
- I'VE HAD A LOT ON MY MIND.
SO, AXELA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

209
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,291
- I DON'T REALLY
HAVE ANYTHING PLANNED.

210
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,416
- WELL NOW YOU DO.
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

211
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,416
- WHAT'S WRONG? DID I JUST
SAY SOMETHING STUPID AGAIN?

212
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,666
- IT'S A LITTLE UNUSUAL.

213
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,250
- JUST THAT MOST OF THE TIME,

214
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,041
FRIENDS AREN'T INVITED TO ATTEND
THESE TYPES OF FAMILY EVENTS.

215
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,583
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

216
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:21,125
- NOT REALLY. NOTHING HAPPENED.
I MEAN, NOT EXACTLY.

217
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,416
- ARE YOU AND YOUR PARENTS
HAVING SOME SORT OF TROUBLE?

218
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,375
- NO. NO. NO.

219
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,458
- LOOK. THEY'RE
NICE PEOPLE. REALLY.

220
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,750
EVEN IF THEY ARE ONLY MY
FOSTER PARENTS.

221
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,625
THEY'RE JUST TOO NICE.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

222
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,500
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
- YOU GOT ME.

223
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,125
- ( doorbell ringing )

224
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,000
- MY GOODNESS.
WHO COULD IT BE THIS TIME?

225
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,041
- JUST A SEC. HELLO,
HOW MAY I HELP YOU, SIR?

226
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,666
- HOW DO YOU DO, MA'AM?
MY NAME IS ORVIS CLAYMAN.

227
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,500
I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE
CLAYMAN AND YOUNG LAW OFFICE.

228
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,416
I'VE COME HERE TODAY IN
THE HOPES OF SPEAKING

229
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,041
TO A MISS KASHA MAVERICK.

230
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:57,916
- OH.

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,833
- A LAWYER? YOU'RE HERE FOR ME?

232
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,833
- Andy: NUH-UH. NO WAY.
- OH, COME ON.

233
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,083
- YOU HEARD ME. PRETEND TO BE
HER BOYFRIEND? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

234
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,166
WHY WOULD I DO SOMETHING
STUPID LIKE THAT

235
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,041
FOR A COMPLETE AND
TOTAL STRANGER?

236
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,500
- ACTUALLY,

237
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,625
I WAS KINDA HOPING YOU WERE
GONNA ASK LARRY TO DO IT.

238
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,833
- OH. YOU WERE?

239
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,250
- WON'T YOU HELP ME?
PLEASE, LARRY.

240
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,500
- SORRY, BUT I'M
AFRAID I JUST CAN'T.

241
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,250
- WHAT? BUT, WHY NOT?

242
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,666
- IT'S TOO CRUEL,

243
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,083
EVEN IF I JUST BRIEFLY
PRETENDED TO BE YOUR BOYFRIEND.

244
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,625
YOU COULDN'T HANDLE IT.

245
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,625
YOU'D NEVER BE ABLE TO PULL
YOURSELF AWAY FROM ME.

246
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,500
- YOU'RE SO... SO HOT.

247
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,041
- VAIN.
- COCKY.

248
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,583
- WAIT. I DON'T GET IT.

249
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,416
- WITH MY CHARM AND LOOKS,
I'M JUST TOO IRRESISTIBLE.

250
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,916
- HE IS SO HOT.

251
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,708
- OH COME ON.
KNOCK IT OFF, LARRY.

252
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,916
- BUT I GUESS, I'LL JUST
SETTLE FOR ANDY THEN.

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,583
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "SETTLE FOR"?

254
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,375
- Rose: HEY, ISN'T THIS GREAT?

255
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,791
YOU GOT YOURSELF A CUTE PRETEND
GIRLFRIEND, ANDY. WAY TO GO.

256
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,208
- THIS IS SO WRONG.

257
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,041
- UH, IF HE DOESN'T
WANT TO DO IT,

258
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,583
THEN WHY DON'T WE
ASK SOMEONE ELSE?

259
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,041
- All: LIKE WHO, SOLTY?

260
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,875
- LIKE ME?
- NOT LIKE YOU.

261
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,833
- SORRY, ROSE, BUT HE'S
NOT REALLY MY TYPE.

262
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,416
- ALL RIGHT.

263
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,041
THEN WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE DO WITH MY BROTHER, ANDY.

264
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,041
- I GUESS SO.

265
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,375
- HEY, WAIT. MY
PLAN DIDN'T WORK?

266
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,958
- WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT PLAN?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

267
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,333
- Kasha: WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

268
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,416
- LIKE I SAID, MY OFFICE HAS
RECENTLY BEEN APPROACHED

269
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,541
BY SOMEONE WHO WOULD
LIKE TO ADOPT YOU.

270
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,583
- WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF MORON?

271
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,083
THERE IS NO WAY I'D DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

272
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,000
- ACTUALLY, I HAVE A REPORT HERE
THAT STATES YOU AREN'T SATISFIED

273
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,208
WITH YOUR LIFE HERE.

274
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,166
IT WAS GIVEN TO
ME BY AMU TRANFA,

275
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,291
WHOM I HIRED TO INVESTIGATE.

276
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,875
- YES, SHE WAS JUST HERE.

277
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,750
- I SEE NOW. THAT'S WHAT
THAT LOSER WAS UP TO.

278
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,458
- THROUGH OUR INVESTIGATION,
WE'VE ALSO COME TO DETERMINE

279
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,875
THAT YOU AND MIRANDA ARE NOT,
IN FACT, RELATED BY BLOOD.

280
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:56,958
- ( gasps )

281
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,291
- KASHA, I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT WANT TO KNOW

282
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,250
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO
WISH TO ADOPT YOU,

283
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,375
ARE YOUR REAL FATHER'S
OLDER BROTHER AND HIS WIFE.

284
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,833
- MY FATHER? REALLY?

285
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,208
- YOUR FATHER WAS BORN INTO
A WEALTHY AND POWERFUL FAMILY.

286
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,833
HE MET AND FELL IN LOVE
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

287
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,375
BUT, BECAUSE SHE WAS AN
UNREGISTERED CITIZEN

288
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,958
AND NOT PART OF
THE ELITE SOCIETY,

289
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,875
THE DISAPPROVING FAMILY
FORCED THEM APART.

290
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,041
BUT BY THAT TIME,
IT WAS TOO LATE.

291
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,083
YOUR MOTHER WAS ALREADY
PREGNANT WITH YOU.

292
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,375
YEARS LATER,
YOUR FATHER PASSED AWAY.

293
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,125
MORE RECENTLY, YOUR GRANDPARENTS
PASSED AWAY, AS WELL.

294
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,000
IT WAS AT THAT TIME THAT THE NEW

295
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,041
AND CURRENT MASTER
OF THE HOUSEHOLD,

296
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,833
EXPRESSED HIS WISHES TO
ADOPT THE FORGOTTEN CHILD

297
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,416
OF HIS YOUNGER
BROTHER. YOU, KASHA.

298
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,750
THAT'S THE WHOLE STORY.
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

299
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,708
WILL YOU AT LEAST AGREE TO MEET
WITH THEM ONCE TO DISCUSS?

300
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,791
- WHY?
- WELL, BECAUSE...

301
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,625
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
THOSE PEOPLE BEFORE.

302
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,250
THEY DON'T MEAN A THING TO ME.

303
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,041
MY ONLY PARENTS ARE
THE ONES WHO DIED,

304
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,791
AND MY MOM SITTING RIGHT HERE.

305
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,416
THIS DISCUSSION IS OVER.
NOW, GET OUT OF HERE.

306
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,708
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
- SURE ABOUT WHAT, MOM?

307
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,166
- ABOUT BEING ADOPTED.

308
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,583
IF YOU AREN'T HAPPY...
( crying )

309
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,333
- OH, STOP CRYING.
I CAN TELL YOU'RE FAKING IT.

310
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,541
- REALLY? IT'S THAT OBVIOUS?

311
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,708
- GET REAL. NOW LET'S
STOP FOOLING AROUND

312
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,208
AND GET BACK TO PUTTING
UP THESE DECORATIONS.

313
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,041
- RIGHT.
- ( giggles )

314
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,208
- Solty: IS IT ANY GOOD?

315
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,250
- Rose: I'D GIVE IT A
THREE OUT OF TEN.

316
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,083
- ( Roy sighs )

317
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,791
- ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU, OLD MAN?

318
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,333
- IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S NOTHING.

319
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,000
- OH, I JUST
REMEMBERED SOMETHING.

320
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,875
WE'RE INVITED TO A PARTY.

321
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,083
MIRANDA WANTS ALL OF US TO JOIN
THEM FOR APPRECIATION DAY.

322
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,708
- YEAH? A PARTY?
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN.

323
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,000
- I THINK SO, TOO. WHAT DO
YOU THINK, ROY? CAN WE GO?

324
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,708
- WHA... YEAH, OKAY.

325
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,625
- THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN.

326
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,208
- UGH, NOTHING
BUT WORK WITH YOU.

327
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,250
- SO WHAT? I LOVE IT.

328
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:12,416
- CELICA, WHAT'S WRONG?
- SORRY, I GOT TO RUN. SEE YOU.

329
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,958
- OKAY.

330
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,375
- CELICA, WAIT.
- AXELA?

331
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,041
WHAT'S GOING ON?
CELICA'S ACTING STRANGE.

332
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:26,125
SHE JUST GOT A CALL FROM HOME,
AND SHE GOT UP AND RAN OFF.

333
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,583
- DO YOU THINK THERE MAY HAVE
BEEN A DEATH IN THE FAMILY?

334
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,041
- NO. I DON'T THINK SO.

335
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,125
- IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT.
- I SEE.

336
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,375
- WELL, THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

337
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,083
- WAIT. NOW WHAT?

338
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,333
- Rose: WE'RE GONNA
STEP OUT FOR A WHILE.

339
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,666
- Solty: BYE.

340
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:50,875
- HMM.

341
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,541
- ( all laughing )

342
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,708
- NICE OUTFIT.
- YOU LOOK LIKE A VALET.

343
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,208
- COME ON.
THAT'S ENOUGH ALREADY.

344
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,916
NOW EXPLAIN TO ME AGAIN
WHY I HAVE TO WEAR THIS THING.

345
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,041
- IT LOOKS VERY NICE
ON YOU, ANDY.

346
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,708
- YOU'LL BE MEETING
HER MOTHER AT DINNER, BRO.

347
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,041
YOU HAVE TO MAKE
A GOOD IMPRESSION ON HER.

348
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,333
- OH, AND IN THAT, HE WILL.
- I'M GOING HOME.

349
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,208
- OH, STOP. WE'RE ONLY KIDDING.

350
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,750
OKAY.

351
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,041
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
ACT LIKE HER BOYFRIEND, GOT IT?

352
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,625
YOU ONLY GET ONE SHOT AT THIS.

353
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,333
- I GOT IT.
- LET'S GET GOING.

354
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,666
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

355
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,041
- THAT'S FUNNY. I WAS JUST
ABOUT TO ASK YOU THE SAME THING.

356
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,166
- CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY YOU'RE DRESSED AS BUS BOY?

357
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,125
- LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

358
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,833
- FESS UP, OLD MAN.

359
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,375
ARE YOU DATING THIS
GIRL'S MOTHER, OR WHAT?

360
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,875
- ALL OF YOU ARE HERE, TOO?

361
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,458
- Isabelle: ARE THESE
FRIENDS OF YOURS?

362
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,416
- Roy: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

363
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,041
- ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU.

364
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:49,541
THIS IS MR. ROY REVANT.
HE'S A HUNTER.

365
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,750
- I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE SOMEONE,
TOO. THIS IS ANDY ANDERSON.

366
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,041
HE'S A PROFESSIONAL THIEF.

367
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,000
- A THIEF?
- NICE ONE.

368
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,791
- ROY, WHAT ARE YOU?
- THERE'S A GOOD REASON...

369
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,208
- I HAD A HUNCH SOMETHING
LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

370
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,708
GOOD THING I CAME. AND IT SURE
BEATS STAYING HOME WITH MIRANDA.

371
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,000
- KEEP THAT MOUTH OF YOURS SHUT.

372
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,000
- WELL, THIS IS WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN UP TO?

373
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,750
- SO, I GUESS THE TWO
OF YOU ARE DATING?

374
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,375
- THAT'S RIGHT, MOTHER.
AND I'M SO HAPPY.

375
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,291
- HA. YOU'RE STARTING
TO BLUSH THERE, TIGER.

376
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,041
- SHUT UP. NOW,
WHAT ABOUT YOU, OLD MAN?

377
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,875
DON'T TELL ME YOU TWO
ARE TOGETHER.

378
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,291
- ACTUALLY, WE ARE.

379
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,500
AT FIRST WE WERE JUST DATING,
BUT NOW, WE'RE A COUPLE.

380
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,875
- OH, QUITE THE LADIES' MAN.

381
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,500
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP
AND EAT YOUR DINNER.

382
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,166
- ( crying )

383
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,916
- HEY, SOLTY. ARE YOU OKAY?

384
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,791
OH, NO. WHAT'S THE
MATTER? DON'T CRY.

385
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,000
- WHY IS SHE CRYING?
WHAT'S WRONG?

386
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,541
- THAT'S HIS DAUGHTER.
AND SHE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T KNOW.

387
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,750
- ROY, IS THAT TRUE?

388
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,958
- YEAH.

389
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,541
- YOU DIDN'T TELL HER
YOU HAD A DAUGHTER?

390
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,041
- THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE...

391
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,666
- IF HE DIDN'T TELL YOU
SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT

392
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,000
AS HAVING A DAUGHTER,

393
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,958
THEN HE'S PROBABLY JUST
USING YOU FOR A GOOD TIME

394
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,958
UNTIL HE DECIDES TO
DUMP YOU, MOTHER.

395
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,375
- WHOA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

396
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,541
- JUST LIKE I THOUGHT.
THIS IS BETTER THAN TV.

397
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,000
- I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP.

398
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,375
- IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT
YOUR DAUGHTER'S HAPPINESS,

399
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,500
THEN YOU SHOULD MAKE HER BREAK
UP WITH THIS GUY IMMEDIATELY.

400
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,416
YOU CAN'T TRUST A
THIEF LIKE HIM, HONEY.

401
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,541
THEY'RE ALWAYS
UP TO NO GOOD.

402
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,041
- WHAT?

403
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,500
- YOU HEARD ME. YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE HER FOR ALL SHE'S WORTH

404
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,250
AND DUMP HER IN THE TRASH.

405
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,916
- WHAT A PILE OF CRAP.
I'D NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

406
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,833
AND WHY AM I STANDING
HERE TAKING ALL OF THIS

407
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,250
FOR SOME DIMWITTED TART?

408
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,333
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?
- ( gasps ) UH-OH.

409
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,875
- I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
BUT IF YOU THINK YOU CAN

410
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,375
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
MY DAUGHTER'S FEELINGS,

411
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,708
YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER THING COMING.

412
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,000
- ANDY, HOW COULD YOU.
YOU'RE DESPICABLE.

413
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,375
- WHY CAN'T YOU SHUT UP?

414
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,333
I'D NEVER DO ANY OF
THOSE HORRIBLE THINGS.

415
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,666
TELL THEM, LARRY.

416
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,000
- HE'S RIGHT. HE WOULDN'T
DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

417
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,208
- THANKS, BRO.

418
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,375
- IF HE WAS GOING TO
ROB HER AND DUMP HER,

419
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,916
HE'D BE LESS OBVIOUS ABOUT IT.

420
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,708
- WHAT?

421
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,916
- Isabelle: I KNEW IT. I WANT
YOU TO BREAK OFF EVERYTHING

422
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,583
WITH THIS MAN. RIGHT NOW.

423
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,375
JUST COME HOME, AND I PROMISE
TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.

424
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,958
- I DON'T THINK SO.

425
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,916
THERE'S NO WAY I'M COMING HOME
UNTIL YOU GOT RID OF THAT LOSER.

426
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,666
- BUT WHY SHOULD
I HAVE TO DO THAT?

427
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,875
- WHY DOES EVERYTHING
HAVE TO BE YOUR WAY?

428
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,083
- UH-OH. LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
ABOUT TO THROW DOWN IN HERE.

429
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,541
- I SAY WE ABORT THE MISSION.
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

430
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,291
- Girl: HOW? BY SUFFOCATING ME?
- Isabelle: WHAT?

431
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,416
- GOODNIGHT.
- SEE YOU.

432
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,750
- WHAT? YOU'RE LEAVING?

433
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,708
- WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
LISTEN TO ME.

434
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,208
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WON'T
UNDERSTAND OR LISTEN TO ME.

435
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,208
- I JUST WANT YOU TO
BE SAFE AND HAPPY.

436
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,666
I DON'T WANT TO GET IN YOUR WAY.

437
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,833
- AND I DON'T WANT TO GET
IN YOUR WAY, MOTHER.

438
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,916
THAT'S WHY I FAKED
THIS WHOLE THING.

439
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,166
- ( gasps )

440
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,958
- SO, THIS WAS ALL AN ACT?
- YEAH.

441
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,625
- THANKS, ROY.

442
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,375
- I WON'T NEED YOUR
ASSISTANCE, ANYMORE,

443
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,208
BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP.

444
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,541
- ALL RIGHT.
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

445
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,833
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

446
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,125
- IT APPEARS THAT
WE THINK ALIKE.

447
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,208
- MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
WE'RE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.

448
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,541
- SO, YOU WERE FAKING IT, TOO?
- WELL, YEAH.

449
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,833
- UH, WHAT?
- IT WAS ALL JUST AN ACT, OKAY?

450
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,916
- IT'S OVER, SOLTY.
WOW, THAT WAS EXHAUSTING.

451
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:13,458
- UH? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
- MIND IF WE COME IN FOR A BIT?

452
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,291
- TEA, PLEASE. NO SUGAR.

453
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,333
- AND USE THE GOOD
STUFF THIS TIME.

454
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,208
- COMING RIGHT UP.
- WHERE ARE THOSE SNACK CAKES?

455
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,458
- THIS ISN'T A RESTAURANT,
YOU KNOW.

456
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,875
- WHAT BRINGS ALL OF YOU HERE
TOGETHER LIKE THIS?

457
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,916
- A LITTLE SIDE PROJECT.
NO BIG DEAL.

458
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,375
- SOLTY, WHAT IS IT?
- HMM.

459
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,458
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

460
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:37,416
- UH, MIRANDA? THERE'S SOMETHING
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU.

461
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,041
- SURE. ANYTHING?
- JUST WHAT IS HAPPINESS?

462
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,375
- UH...
- ( doorbell ringing )

463
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:48,500
- MORE COMPANY? I'M COMING.
I'M COMING. JUST A MINUTE.

464
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,416
- YOU MUST BE KASHA
MAVERICK. NICE TO MEET YOU.

465
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,458
- YO.

466
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:56,916
- HUH?

467
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,875
- SO, WHY DON'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

468
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,750
DID YOU COME HERE TO TALK
TO ME OR JUST STARE AT ME?

469
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,583
- WHY DID YOU TELL THAT LAWYER
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE ADOPTED?

470
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,875
- HEY, HOW'D YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

471
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,708
IS R.U.C. SPYING ON ME
OR ARE YOU SOME KINDA STALKER?

472
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:24,083
- Celica: NEVER MIND HOW I KNOW
ABOUT IT. THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

473
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,875
I JUST WANTED TO ASK
YOU WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT

474
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,750
TO BE ADOPTED, OKAY? SO, SPILL.

475
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,000
- Kasha: I DON'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU THAT.

476
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,500
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

477
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,166
- ARGH. KNOCK IT OFF.

478
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,041
- OH, CELICA, YOU STABBED
CELICA RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES.

479
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,500
- YEAH, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE NEXT
IF YOU DON'T KNOCK IT OFF.

480
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,375
- OH, SORRY.

481
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,708
- DID YOU GUYS COME HERE
TO DO A COMEDY ROUTINE?

482
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,291
- NO, I CAME HERE BECAUSE THE
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ADOPT YOU,

483
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,250
ARE THE SAME ONES
WHO ADOPTED ME.

484
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,458
- HUH?
- THEY TOOK ME IN YEARS AGO.

485
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:53,041
I WAS VERY LITTLE. MUCH
YOUNGER THAN YOU ARE NOW.

486
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,250
- YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS, RIGHT?

487
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,500
- ACCORDING TO THE CITY'S
REGISTRATION LAWS,

488
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,708
A REGISTERED COUPLE IS
ONLY ALLOWED TO ADOPT

489
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:04,833
ONE UNREGISTERED CHILD.

490
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,541
- SO THAT MEANS YOU.

491
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:11,375
- THAT'S RIGHT, KID. I WAS
UNREGISTERED LIKE YOU.

492
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,375
THAT'S WHY MOM AND DAD
COULDN'T ADOPT YOU RIGHT AWAY.

493
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:17,250
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT
ABOUT YOU, IT WAS TOO LATE,

494
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,666
THEY ALREADY HAD ME.

495
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,416
BUT NONE OF THAT
MATTERS ANYMORE.

496
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,291
YOU'RE A LEGAL CITIZEN NOW,
YOU'RE ALL SIGNED UP.

497
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,708
A COUPLE CAN ADOPT AS MANY
REGISTERED CHILDREN

498
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:30,791
AS THEY WANT TO. SO,
THERE'S NO PROBLEM ANYMORE.

499
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,250
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

500
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,000
- WELL, NO, I DON'T.

501
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,375
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU WANT
ME TO ACCEPT THEIR OFFER,

502
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,875
IS THAT IT?

503
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,833
- YES I DO. IF ADOPTING YOU
WILL MAKE MOM AND DAD HAPPY,

504
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,500
THEN THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

505
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:44,916
THEY'VE BEEN SO GOOD TO ME

506
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,250
EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T
THEIR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD.

507
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,250
- BUT WHY ARE THEY
DOING THIS NOW?

508
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,791
- THEY DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET
GRANDPA AND THE OTHERS.

509
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:52,916
- OH.

510
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,666
- YOU KNOW, TO SPARE
THEIR FEELINGS.

511
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,708
THAT'S HOW KIND
HEARTED THEY ARE.

512
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:57,958
- KIND HEARTED, HUH?

513
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,750
THEN WHY DIDN'T THEY
THINK ABOUT MY FEELINGS?

514
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:03,041
I'VE GOT MY MOM
AND I'LL NEVER LEAVE HER.

515
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,666
AND NOTHING IN THE WORLD
COULD EVER MAKE ME.

516
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,333
- NO MATTER WHAT?
- NO MATTER WHAT.

517
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,041
- I UNDERSTAND.

518
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,916
- CELICA, I DIDN'T...
HEY, WAIT UP.

519
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,791
- KASHA, I'M SORRY.

520
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,541
- CELICA.
- OH, ARE YOU LEAVING ALREADY?

521
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:28,875
JUST MADE SOME FRESH COOKIES

522
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,708
THEY'LL BE READY TO EAT
IN A COUPLE MINUTES.

523
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,875
- Silvia: UH, THANKS,
BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO LEAVE.

524
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,541
WE'RE SORRY TO HAVE
BOTHERED YOU.

525
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,916
COME ON, CELICA.
WAIT UP, WILL YOU?

526
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,875
- OKAY, ROSE.

527
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,750
OUR GUESTS ARE GONE
AND THE COAST IS CLEAR.

528
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,125
YOU CAN RELAX NOW.

529
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,541
- ( all sighs )

530
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:45,791
- ( exclaims softly )

531
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,625
- SOLTY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

532
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:55,458
DID KASHA SAY WHAT THOSE
R.U.C. PEOPLE WANTED WITH HER?

533
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:58,916
- UH, THEY SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT ADOPTING KASHA.

534
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,750
I DIDN'T HEAR IT ALL, BUT I
THINK SHE TURNED THEM DOWN.

535
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,333
- ADOPTING HER?

536
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:05,500
- THIS HAS GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH KASHA'S REAL FAMILY

537
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,916
TURNING UP ALL OF A SUDDEN.

538
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,708
- HUH? YUTO, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

539
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:13,125
- MIRANDA AND KASHA AREN'T
REALLY BLOOD RELATIONS.

540
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:16,208
- Rose: YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
- Miranda: ACTUALLY, IT'S TRUE.

541
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:18,666
- KASHA ISN'T MY REAL DAUGHTER,
AT LEAST NOT BY BIRTH,

542
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,708
THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

543
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:21,291
- REALLY?

544
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:24,708
- YUP. NOW WHO'S GONNA EAT SOME
OF THESE HOT HOME-MADE COOKIES?

545
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:25,916
- Rose: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

546
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,375
ARE YOU OKAY WITH ALL
THIS ADOPTION TALK?

547
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:32,791
- NO, I'M NOT WORRIED. IN FACT,
AN ATTORNEY WAS HERE YESTERDAY,

548
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,708
REPRESENTING KASHA'S UNCLE.

549
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:37,375
KASHA SENT HIM HOME
PRETTY QUICK. ( chuckling )

550
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:40,708
- SO, YOU DON'T SEEM TOO UPSET
THAT HE WANTS TO TAKE KASHA.

551
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,000
- NICE.

552
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,708
- BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT.

553
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,416
I KNOW I CAN TRUST KASHA
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

554
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,708
- ARE YOU SURE?
- ABSOLUTELY.

555
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:59,083
- MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD. WHOA.

556
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:05,708
- SORRY I'M LATE.

557
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:11,208
- Integra: SO THAT'S IT.
POOR CELICA.

558
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:14,916
- YEAH, SHE ALWAYS ACTS SO BLASE
AT WORK. HOW'S SHE REALLY DOING?

559
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,041
- PRETTY MUCH THE WAY YOU'D
EXPECT. SHE'S REALLY DEPRESSED.

560
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,875
- WOW.

561
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:22,416
- Silvia: YOU KNOW, I THINK
ALL OF US HAVE SOME KIND OF

562
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,083
A SKELETON IN OUR CLOSET.
BUT WE JOINED R.U.C.,

563
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:30,416
BECAME A TEAM, AND AT THAT POINT
OUR BACKGROUNDS DIDN'T MATTER.

564
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,625
TOGETHER WE MADE PEOPLE RESPECT
US FOR WHAT WE COULD DO.

565
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,333
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS

566
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:38,041
I THINK OF YOU GUYS AS A LOT
MORE THAN JUST COLLEAGUES.

567
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:41,125
- OH, JEEZ, SILVIA, THIS IS
GETTING REALLY EMBARRASSING.

568
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,708
- ( exclaims ) I FEEL EXACTLY
THE WAY YOU DO, SILVIA,

569
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:45,291
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

570
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,125
- THANKS, AXELA,
I APPRECIATE IT.

571
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:50,041
WHAT ABOUT YOU, BOSS LADY?

572
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,458
- LOOK, SILVIA, IF I DIDN'T
FEEL THE SAME WAY,

573
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,291
DO YOU THINK I'D BE
SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW?

574
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,541
LET ME GUESS. YOU WANT
US ALL TO GET TOGETHER

575
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:59,541
AND THROW AN APPRECIATION DAY
PARTY FOR CELICA, DON'T YOU?

576
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,125
- AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE THE LEADER.

577
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,916
- YOU JUST HAD TO MAKE ME SAY
ALL THAT OUT LOUD, DIDN'T YOU?

578
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,208
- OH, AND I'LL COOK. I'LL MAKE
THE BIGGEST FEAST EVER.

579
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,000
OH, THIS IS GONNA BE FANTASTIC.

580
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,625
- YEAH, YOU DO THAT.

581
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:13,125
HERE'S TO THE GREATEST
PARTY EVER THROWN.

582
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:14,458
- YEAH.

583
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:16,333
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
STARTING A LITTLE EARLY.

584
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:17,541
- ( phone ringing )

585
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:23,291
- OLD GUY, PHONE'S RINGING.

586
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,000
- ( sighs ) YOU'RE
RIGHT NEXT TO IT.

587
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,166
- SO?

588
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,291
- WHY DON'T I JUST GO
AHEAD AND GET IT?

589
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:29,833
- DON'T YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

590
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:32,833
IT'S HIS PHONE AND THE CALL'S
BOUND TO BE FOR HIM ANYWAY.

591
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:35,958
COME ON, GRANDPA.
IT'S ANNOYING.

592
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:39,666
- ARGH, YEAH, YOU'D KNOW ALL
ABOUT ANNOYING, WOULDN'T YOU?

593
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,583
HELLO, THIS IS ROY.

594
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:48,208
OH, HEY. UH, HOW ARE YOU?
NOW? I'M ON MY WAY.

595
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:51,916
- SO, WHO WAS THAT?

596
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,791
- NO ONE. I GOT TO
GO OUT FOR A WHILE.

597
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,375
- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA BE BACK?

598
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,166
- I'LL SEE YOU
AROUND DINNER TIME.

599
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:01,041
- HMM?
- BYE, ROY.

600
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:04,833
- YOU KNOW WHAT, SOLTY?
- WHAT? IS SOMETHING WRONG?

601
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,166
- I'M BORED.
- AH.

602
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,708
- WELL, IF YOU WANT TO,

603
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,250
YOU CAN COME ALONG WITH ME WHILE
I GO SHOPPING FOR GROCERIES.

604
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,291
- HMM.

605
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,791
- HAPPINESS? REALLY?
- YEAH.

606
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,625
- I THOUGHT THERE WAS
SOMETHING BUGGING YOU.

607
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,041
- YEAH.

608
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,625
- HMM.

609
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:26,250
- SO, TELL ME, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA OF WHAT HAPPINESS IS?

610
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,041
- OF COURSE I DO.

611
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:31,791
- BECAUSE I KNOW EVERYTHING.
- DO YOU REALLY KNOW, ROSE?

612
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:34,416
- YOU'RE NOT JUST KIDDING
AROUND WITH ME? WHAT IS IT?

613
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,125
- THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
IT COULD BE. COLD HARD CASH.

614
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:44,875
- ( exhales )
- RIGHT. EXCUSE ME.

615
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:47,541
- JUST A MINUTE. HEY,
WHAT'S WITH THE ATTITUDE?

616
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,708
YOU THINK I'M SHALLOW,
DON'T YOU?

617
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:52,833
- OH, NO. I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE SHALLOW AT ALL.

618
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,833
- YOU DO SO THINK I'M SHALLOW.

619
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,208
- COME ON, SPIT IT OUT.

620
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,958
- ( grunting )
- OKAY, I DO, OW. OW.

621
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,041
- HAPPINESS...

622
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:09,041
I STILL DON'T KNOW.
WHAT CAN IT POSSIBLY BE?

623
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:12,208
- HEY. WHAT?
- HOLD ON A SEC. LOOK THERE.

624
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,625
- THERE, ACROSS THE STREET.

625
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:18,250
- SEE YOU TOMORROW.
- THANKS.

626
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,875
- THAT WOMAN HE'S WITH,
ISN'T SHE THAT BUSY BODY MOTHER

627
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,791
WE HAD DINNER WITH
THE OTHER NIGHT?

628
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,291
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON?

629
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,583
- NOW WHAT?

630
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:44,500
- OH, NOTHING. WE WERE JUST
WONDERING IF YOU LIKED DINNER.

631
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,125
- AREN'T YOU GOING TO ASK HIM?

632
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:49,041
- I CAN'T JUST COME
RIGHT OUT WITH IT.

633
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:50,958
- GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU.
- AH.

634
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,166
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

635
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,916
- NO, NOT AT ALL, EVERYTHING
IS JUST FINE. ISN'T IT, ROSE?

636
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:03,416
- OKAY THEN. OH, UH,
I'M GOING OUT TOMORROW.

637
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:10,625
- HAPPY APPRECIATION DAY
TO EVERYONE IN OUR VIEWING AREA.

638
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,541
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME
OF THE SPECIAL EVENTS.

639
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,416
- I'M OFF, GIRLS. I'LL TRY AND
BE BACK SOME TIME BEFORE EIGHT.

640
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,541
- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

641
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,375
HE'S SNEAKING AWAY TO GO
ON A DATE WITH THAT WOMAN.

642
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,208
- DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S IT?

643
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,291
- OF COURSE. WHY ELSE WOULD HE
MEET HER ON APPRECIATION DAY?

644
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:33,708
- NOW, COME ON. LET'S GO.
- HUH? GO WHERE?

645
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,083
- TO FOLLOW THEM, OF COURSE.

646
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,083
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET
HER GET AWAY WITH THIS?

647
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,916
I SEE. OKAY, JUST FORGET IT.

648
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,291
IT'S YOUR LIFE,

649
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,041
SEE IF I CARE IF THAT WOMAN
STEALS YOUR HAPPINESS,

650
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,541
NO SKIN OFF MY NOSE.

651
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,208
- HUH?
- SEE YOU.

652
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:51,833
- ( door opens )

653
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:56,166
- Kasha: SOLTY?
- ( gasps )

654
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,875
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

655
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:01,208
- I WAS WONDERING IF
YOU COULD HELP ME.

656
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,958
- Integra: SO, HOW CAN I HELP?
JUST SAY THE WORD.

657
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:07,041
- OH. WELL, YOU COULD START
CHOPPING UP THE VEGGIES FOR ME.

658
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,583
- OKAY, THEN I'M ON IT.

659
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,208
- WHAT ABOUT ME?
- YOU CAN TOSS THE SALAD.

660
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,916
- ALL RIGHT.
TOSSING SEQUENCE INITIATED.

661
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,000
- I'M SORRY IF I KEPT
YOU WAITING, ROY.

662
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,041
- IT'S OKAY.

663
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,458
- WELL, THEN, SHALL WE GO?
- SURE.

664
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,291
- ( rustling )

665
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:31,625
- AHA, I KNEW IT.

666
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,583
- OVER HERE, LARRY.

667
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:38,375
- YOU'RE A VERY NAUGHTY
LITTLE GIRL

668
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,875
FOR MAKING A THIEF LIKE ME
COME OUT IN PUBLIC LIKE THIS,

669
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:44,291
BUT THEN AGAIN,
DANGER IS MY BUSINESS.

670
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,250
- OH MY GOD. YOU'RE COOL.

671
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:49,625
- SO WHERE DO YOU
WANT TO GO, HONEY?

672
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,041
- YOU CAN TAKE ME
ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO.

673
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:54,541
- HONEY? DAMN.

674
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,083
- LOOKS SERIOUS.
- HAS SHE REALLY FALLEN FOR HIM?

675
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,458
- HEY, WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE, YUTO?

676
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,833
- SPYING LIKE YOU.
OH, THEY'RE GETTING AWAY.

677
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:05,250
- LET'S GO.
- GO WHERE?

678
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,291
- ( screams )

679
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:14,166
- PLEASE, KASHA. CAN'T YOU
TELL ME WHERE WE'RE GOING?

680
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,250
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
JUST STAY WITH ME.

681
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,916
- Miranda: KASHA, WHERE ARE YOU?

682
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:27,250
SORRY I TOOK SO LONG, BUT THE
STORE WAS PACKED. ( chuckles )

683
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,916
THAT'S STRANGE.

684
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:38,458
- Solty: WOW. DO YOU REALLY
KNOW SOMEONE WHO LIVES HERE?

685
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,625
- I DON'T KNOW.
WE'RE SNEAKING IN.

686
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:44,458
- HUH?
- OPEN THE GATE.

687
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,625
- COME ON.

688
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:48,916
- ( metal twisting )

689
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:58,708
- CAN WE GO HOME?
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

690
00:32:58,791 --> 00:32:59,958
WHAT IF SOMEONE CATCHES US?

691
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:02,625
WE'RE GONNA GET IN
A WHOLE... OUCH.

692
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:03,750
- OOPSIE.

693
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,958
- HUH?

694
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:13,875
- HEY, YOU.

695
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,458
WE HAVE A FRONT DOOR,
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE.

696
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,541
- I WAS WONDERING
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

697
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,875
SO, THIS IS WHERE YOU'VE
BEEN HIDING ALL THIS TIME.

698
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:27,583
TELL ME. DO YOU THINK I'LL
END UP ALL ALONE AGAIN? HMM?

699
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,708
- HERE. THIS IS A PHOTO
OF YOUR FATHER.

700
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:34,750
- HUH?

701
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,250
- YOU CAME HERE BECAUSE
YOU WERE WONDERING ABOUT

702
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,041
YOUR FATHER, DIDN'T YOU?

703
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,208
- OH MY GOSH. THIS IS
MY REAL FATHER.

704
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,291
- HE WAS A VERY NICE MAN.

705
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,916
A LOT OF WOMEN
WANTED TO MARRY HIM,

706
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,041
BUT HE TURNED THEM ALL DOWN.

707
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:51,500
I THINK THAT HE LOVED
YOUR MOTHER SO MUCH

708
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:54,625
HE COULD JUST NEVER BE
INTERESTED IN ANY OTHER WOMAN.

709
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:56,500
AND I SHOULD TELL YOU, KASHA.

710
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:59,750
ALTHOUGH YOUR FATHER NEVER SAID
ANYTHING TO MY DAD ABOUT YOU,

711
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:02,291
TO SPARE HIS FEELINGS
HE KNEW ABOUT YOU.

712
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,166
YOUR DAD'S LAST WORDS WERE
"MAKE SURE SHE'S HAPPY."

713
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:13,166
HE MEANT IT. YOUR HAPPINESS
WAS HIS FINAL REQUEST.

714
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:19,500
YOU'RE HAPPY WITH MIRANDA.
SO, YOU SHOULD GO BACK THERE.

715
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:22,458
I'M KIND OF USED TO HAVING
FATHER AND MOTHER ALL TO MYSELF.

716
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:25,000
I DON'T THINK I COULD
GET USED TO SHARING.

717
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,500
PLUS, IF THEY COME HOME NOW,

718
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:30,375
THEY MIGHT GET THE WRONG IDEA.
ABOUT YOU STAYING, I MEAN.

719
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,708
YOU CAN HAVE THAT PHOTO.

720
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:36,208
AND YOU CAN VISIT HERE
ANYTIME YOU LIKE.

721
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:39,708
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW, I THINK
YOU SHOULD GO HOME SO, UH...

722
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,333
- YOU OKAY?
- I DON'T WANT THIS.

723
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,875
- YOU CAN KEEP YOU HAND OUTS.

724
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,291
- KASHA, WAIT.
- AND I WON'T COME BACK EITHER.

725
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:50,875
- I SEE.

726
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:53,625
I'M SORRY.

727
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:57,541
- WAIT FOR ME. KASHA.

728
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:00,333
- GO AWAY. I WANNA BE ALONE
RIGHT NOW.

729
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:05,250
I SAID I WANNA BE ALONE. SORRY.

730
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,125
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

731
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:22,875
WHY DID I FEEL HAPPY
FOR A SECOND?

732
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,541
STUPID.

733
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:29,958
- ( crying ) STUPID, STUPID,
STUPID. I'M SO STUPID.

734
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,291
- PERFECT.

735
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,000
- HIS LAST WORDS WERE
"MAKE SURE SHE'S HAPPY."

736
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:52,250
- HAPPINESS.
- Rose: SOLTY.

737
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:56,708
- ROSE?
- COME ON, I NEED YOU.

738
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,250
- WHY ARE YOU
HIDING IN THAT ALLEY?

739
00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, ANYWAY?

740
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:02,916
- NEVER MIND ALL THAT.
YOU GOT HERE JUST IN TIME.

741
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,125
DO YOU HAVE YOUR
CITIZEN'S I.D. CARD?

742
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,916
- YEAH. BUT WHY DO I NEED
MY CARD?

743
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,125
- SO, YOU CAN PAY
FOR MY COFFEE OF COURSE.

744
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,875
- COFFEE?
- CHECK IT OUT.

745
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,500
- ROY?

746
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:19,375
- CARE FOR MORE COFFEE?
- NO THANKS. I'M FINE.

747
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:20,875
- COME ON. LET'S
GET OUT OF HERE,

748
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:22,541
THIS IS NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.

749
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,291
- SUSH, WILL YOU KEEP IT DOWN.

750
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:27,625
- SO, THANKS. I MEAN,
FOR TODAY, I MEAN.

751
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:31,416
- OH, NO. PLEASE DON'T
MENTION IT, I REALLY ENJOYED IT.

752
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,416
- SO, GET THIS, THOSE TWO WALKED
ALL OVER THE CITY TOGETHER

753
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,875
AND EVEN WENT SHOPPING.
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

754
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:39,583
IT WASN'T THAT EASY FOLLOWING
THEM WITHOUT BEING SPOTTED.

755
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,125
- OH.

756
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:43,125
- SO, ROY. TELL ME, HAVE
YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT

757
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,333
GETTING MARRIED AGAIN?

758
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,916
- ( gasps )

759
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,541
- GETTING MARRIED? OH MY GOSH,

760
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,541
THIS IS EVEN MORE
SERIOUS THAN I THOUGHT.

761
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,333
- I DON'T KNOW.
HAVE YOU, YOU KNOW,

762
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:54,875
CONSIDERED, UH, RE-MARRIAGE?

763
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:58,250
- OH, MY, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.

764
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:02,208
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
- NO, YOU IDIOT. SHUT UP.

765
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,916
- PLEASE, ROY. DON'T DO IT.
IT'S A MISTAKE.

766
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,583
- WHERE'D YOU TWO COME FROM?

767
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,875
- Girl: I'M AGAINST IT TOO.
- Both: HUH?

768
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:10,166
- PLEASE DON'T.

769
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,375
- REVANT, YOU DOG. YOU'RE
PRETTY SLICK, CHIEF.

770
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,750
- NOT YOU TOO.

771
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:16,041
- NOW WAIT A MINUTE,
ROY'S ON A DATE, TOO?

772
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:17,916
- I GUESS LIFE REALLY
DOES BEGIN AT FORTY.

773
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,791
- NOW THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

774
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:23,375
- YOU MUST NOT DO IT, MAMA. YOU
MUSTN'T MARRY A MAN LIKE HIM.

775
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,083
I KNOW HIS KIND, HE'LL SUCK
YOU DRY AND SPIT OUT THE PITS,

776
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:27,458
LIKE AN OLD SHOE.

777
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:29,875
- SHE'S GOT QUITE A WAY
WITH WORDS, HASN'T SHE?

778
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,458
- NOW WAIT A MINUTE,

779
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,333
I THOUGHT YOU SAID BEFORE YOU
WANTED HER TO GET RE-MARRIED.

780
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:34,666
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
LOOK AT HIM.

781
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,291
YOU CAN SEE WHAT
KIND OF MAN HE IS.

782
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,833
- Solty: ROY ISN'T THE KIND
OF PERSON HE LOOKS LIKE.

783
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:41,416
- THANKS.

784
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,541
- SO, PLEASE DON'T,
I'M BEGGING YOU, MAMA.

785
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:45,750
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

786
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:50,208
- NOW HOLD ON A MINUTE. WHERE IN
THE WORLD DID YOU GET THE IDEA

787
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,083
I WAS PLANNING
TO RE-MARRY?

788
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:54,875
ROY HERE JUST ASKED ME
TO GO SHOPPING WITH HIM TODAY,

789
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:57,041
THAT'S ALL. NO BIG DEAL.

790
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,625
HE ASKED ME TO HELP
HIM CHOOSE GIFTS

791
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:02,208
FOR A COUPLE OF YOUNG
LADIES HE KNEW.

792
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,750
- UH.
- HOLD ON, DID YOU SAY GIFTS?

793
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:08,208
- HERE. I KNOW
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY, BUT...

794
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:10,375
- THANK YOU.
OH, THANK YOU, MOM.

795
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,333
- IT'S YOUR TURN, ROY.

796
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,791
- HERE YOU GO.

797
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:23,958
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT. THERE'S
ONE FOR ME, AND ONE FOR SOLTY.

798
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:28,875
- WELL, IT'S KINDA
APPRECIATION DAY.

799
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,125
- YOU REALLY
HAVE A WONDERFUL FATHER.

800
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,375
- YEAH.

801
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:39,250
- Miranda: KASHA! YOU'RE SOAKED.
GOODNESS, WHAT HAPPENED?

802
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,500
GET IN HERE RIGHT AWAY.
I'LL GO FILL THE BATH TUB.

803
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:45,083
- UH, MOM?
- HMM, WHAT?

804
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,791
- UM-UM. NOTHING.

805
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:54,333
- HERE WE GO,
DO YOU FEEL BETTER NOW?

806
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,708
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

807
00:38:56,791 --> 00:39:01,791
- MOM, I... - KASHA, PLEASE
FORGIVE ME. I'M AFRAID THAT I...

808
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:04,208
I THOUGHT YOU DECIDED TO
ACCEPT THE ADOPTION OFFER

809
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,625
AND WEREN'T GOING TO COME BACK.

810
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:09,250
I GUESS I WAS SO FRIGHTENED
I DIDN'T TRUST YOU THE WAY

811
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:12,833
I SHOULD HAVE. I'M SORRY.

812
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:16,541
- ( crying ) NO, I'M THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE SORRY.

813
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,250
- WHAT? KASHA.

814
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:23,958
- I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. OH, MOM.

815
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,708
- OH, SWEETIE, I'M SO
GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

816
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:28,833
HAVING YOU HERE MAKES ME HAPPY.

817
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:34,666
- ME, TOO. ME, TOO.
- KASHA, I LOVE YOU.

818
00:39:56,041 --> 00:40:00,166
- Yuto: MOM? IT'S ME.
NO, EVERYTHING IS JUST FINE.

819
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:04,125
I JUST WANTED TO HEAR
YOUR VOICE, THAT'S ALL.

820
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:07,875
- Celica: WAIT. HANG ON.
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

821
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:12,208
DAD. STOP IT. PUT THOSE MELONS
DOWN. MOM GOT THEM FOR ME.

822
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:14,416
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING
A PRETTY GOOD TIME.

823
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,791
- YEAH, I AM, THANKS.
SO, WHAT'S UP?

824
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,250
- OH, NOTHING SPECIAL.

825
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,583
- SO, WE'LL SEE YOU
AT THE OFFICE TOMORROW?

826
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,250
- YOU BET. THANKS FOR CALLING.

827
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,958
- WELL, SO MUCH FOR THAT IDEA.

828
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,666
- Integra: IT'S LIKE THEY SAY,
THE BEST LAID PLANS.

829
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,791
- I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO
PARTY BY OURSELVES.

830
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,333
- Axela: YEAH.

831
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:43,208

833
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:48,166
- AND I LOVE YOU, A LOT, KASHA.

834
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,416
- ( both giggling )

835
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,125
- Rose: OH, A WATCH.

836
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,541
- IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT
YOU CAN ALWAYS GIVE IT BACK.

837
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:58,208
- HEY, THIEVES NEVER GIVE
THINGS BACK. THANK YOU.

838
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,791
- OH, ROY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
I LOVE IT.

839
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,125
I'LL TREASURE IT ALWAYS.

840
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,708
- ( chuckles awkwardly )
OH, WELL.

841
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:11,458
IT'S NOT REALLY A BIG DEAL.

842
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:13,916
- IF IT'S NO BIG DEAL
THEN WHY ARE YOU BLUSHING?

843
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,791
- HEY, ROSE.
- HUH?

844
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:18,333
- GUESS WHAT?
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

845
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:21,208
I THINK I'VE FINALLY KIND OF
FIGURED OUT WHAT HAPPINESS IS.

846
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:24,083
- OH? YOU KINDA DID, HUH?
- YEAH.

847
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:28,083
ROY, I LOVE YOU.

- I LOVE YOU, ALL OF YOU.

853
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:48,125
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO EMBARRASS ME?

854
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:56,541
- BE HAPPY, EVERYONE BE HAPPY.
RIGHT, ROSE?

855
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,250
- SURE. WHY NOT?

856
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:08,125

857
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:18,166
