1
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,791
- Yuto: TWELVE YEARS AGO,
OUR CITY WAS STRUCK BY DISASTER.

2
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,958
THE INCIDENT CAME TO BE
KNOWN AS THE BLAST FALL.

3
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,791
MANY PEOPLE DIED THAT DAY.
AND STILL MORE WERE NEVER FOUND.

4
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:34,625
FOR THE SURVIVORS, MANY OF
THEIR INJURIES WERE SO SEVERE

5
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,750
THAT REGAINING A NORMAL QUALITY
OF LIFE SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE.

6
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,958
BUT WHERE FLESH
AND BONE PROVED TO FAIL,

7
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:46,250
TECHNOLOGY PROVIDED THE
ANSWER THROUGH ENHANCEMENTS.

8
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,833
CYBERNETICS.

9
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:52,250
( Yuto speaking )

10
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,791
- ( beeping )

11
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,583
- THIS MEANS THAT SHE'S...
- SHE'S A CYBORG.

12
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,791
- OUTWARDLY SHE MAY LOOK
AS HUMAN AS ANYONE,

13
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,375
BUT IT'S THE BEST HUMAN
MONEY CAN BUY.

14
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,458
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE
ORGANIC PART ON HER.

15
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,583
SHE'S A PERFECT SPECIMEN
OF RESEMBLE TECHNOLOGY.

16
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,750
- WAIT A SECOND, I DON'T GET IT.

17
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,166
- SEE, RESEMBLE IS
MECHANICAL REPLACEMENTS

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,666
FOR HUMAN BODY PARTS.

19
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,916
YOU CAN REPLACE A PINKY,
OR AN ENTIRE ARM.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,250
BUT, ACCORDING TO THE DATA,

21
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,375
THIS PARTICULAR BODY
ISN'T JUST YOUR ORDINARY,

22
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,916
RUN-OF-THE-MILL RES.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,208
IT'S MAN-MADE. CREATED BY
HUMAN HANDS FROM HEAD TO TOE.

24
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,833
- DOES THAT INCLUDE HER BRAIN?
- ABSOLUTELY.

25
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,250
HERE'S A PUBLISHED ARTICLE
ON RESEMBLE TECHNOLOGY

26
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,166
THAT SAYS THE MAXIMUM
LEVEL OF REPLACEMENT

27
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,750
IS CURRENTLY AT 60 PERCENT.

28
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,666
BUT, AS MY CALCULATIONS CONFIRM,

29
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,250
THIS BODY IS 100
PERCENT RESEMBLE.

30
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,833
DON'T YOU GET HOW COMPLETELY
MIND-BLOWING THIS IS?

31
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
AN UNPRECEDENTED MARRIAGE

32
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,416
BETWEEN STATE-OF-THE
ART TECHNOLOGY

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,958
AND SYNTHETIC HUMANOID SYSTEMS.

34
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:53,000
A TRUE BODY OF ART. AND THE
OWNER OF THAT BODY

35
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,458
IS STANDING RIGHT HERE
BEFORE OUR EYES.

36
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,625
SOLTY!

37
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,833
- IS EATING A...

38
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,458
- OH, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

39
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,000
TODAY'S RESEMBLE TECHNOLOGY

40
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,333
CAN DUPLICATE THE BODY'S ENTIRE
DIGESTIVE SYSTEM PERFECTLY.

41
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,791
- I FIND IT A LITTLE HARD
TO BELIEVE SOLTY IS A MACHINE.

42
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,208
- NO WONDER I THOUGHT
SHE WAS A LITTLE STRANGE.

43
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,375
- ( sighs )

44
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,750
- ( theme song playing )

45
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

46
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,166
- I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT SOLTY.

47
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,708
BUT TO LEARN SHE'S A ROBOT
IS JUST A SHOCK.

48
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,416
- CALLING HER A ROBOT IS AN
INSULT. SOLTY IS A MASTERPIECE

49
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,583
OF RESEMBLE
PROSTHETICS TECHNOLOGY.

50
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,583
- A MASTERPIECE?
YEAH, RIGHT!

51
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,250
- WELL, I SUPPOSE IT ALL
DOES MAKES SENSE NOW.

52
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,333
RIGHT, ROY?

53
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,583
- YEAH. SORT OF.
- COME ON.

54
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,333
YOU MUST BE AT LEAST
SLIGHTLY RELIEVED

55
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,625
TO KNOW THAT SOLTY ISN'T HUMAN.

56
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,125
- OH, SHUT UP.

57
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,250
- ( laughs )

58
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,291
- DOES ANYONE KNOW
WHERE SOLTY WENT?

59
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,500
- PROBABLY OUT ON
HER USUAL WALK.

60
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,166
- ( crying )

61
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,208
- UH, HEY. WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- UH...

62
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,708
- I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE LOST, AREN'T YOU?

63
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,125
- MMM-HMM.

64
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,250
MY MOMMY HURT HER LEG.

65
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,583
SHE TOLD ME TO GO
GROCERY SHOPPING FOR HER,

66
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,250
BUT I GOT LOST AND NOW
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.

67
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,458
IF I COULD GET TO THE STATION,
I KNOW I COULD FIND MY WAY HOME.

68
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,416
- YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A STATION?

69
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,583
- WILL YOU PLEASE TAKE ME THERE?

70
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,250
- I'M SORRY, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE IT IS EITHER.

71
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,666
NO, NO, PLEASE.
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

72
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,625
ALL RIGHT, I'LL HELP YOU.

73
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,750
WE ARE GONNA FIND
THIS STATION TOGETHER.

74
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,125
- REALLY?
- REALLY?

75
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,333
- THANK YOU.

76
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,333
- HI. MY NAME'S SOLTY
REVANT. WHO ARE YOU?

77
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,500
- MERYL TYLER. NICE TO MEET YOU.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,791
- ( train horn whistling )

79
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,708
- ( exclaiming excitedly )

80
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,541
- SOLTY!
- WHAT IS IT?

81
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,875
- YOU GOT ON THE TRAIN WITH ME.

82
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,458
- GUESS I DID. I DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT TO DO,

83
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,125
BUT I GUESS NOW I CAN HELP YOU
ALL THE WAY TO YOUR HOUSE.

84
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,000
- THE RIDE DOES
TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR.

85
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,500
- ( giggles )

86
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,458
EARLIER YOU SAID
YOUR MOMMY WAS HURT.

87
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,375
IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS, I HOPE.

88
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,166
- SHE'LL BE OKAY. SHE JUST
NEEDS TO REST A LITTLE WHILE.

89
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,500
MY DADDY AND I HAVE BEEN DOING
ALL THE SHOPPING FOR HER.

90
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,583
- YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE
A DADDY WHO CARES.

91
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,875
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR DADDY?
IS HE NOT VERY NICE?

92
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,583
- UH, YES. HE'S KINDA NICE.

93
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,875
BUT HE'S ALSO SCARY.

94
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,458
WHEN HE'S REALLY ANGRY.
HE GETS WRINKLES RIGHT HERE.

95
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,541
- MY DAD CAN GET ANGRY TOO.
MAYBE IT'S HIS WORK.

96
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,916
- I GUESS SO.

97
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,250
- HEY, I KNOW A SECRET.

98
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,833
IT WORKS GREAT AND CHEERS
MY DADDY UP EVERY TIME HE'S SAD.

99
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,500
MY MOMMY TAUGHT IT TO ME.

100
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:15,041
- THAT SOUNDS AMAZING. DO YOU
THINK YOU COULD TEACH IT TO ME?

101
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,291
- OKAY. IT'S...

102
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,416
( whispering )

103
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,541
- OH...
- REALLY. IT WORKS!

104
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,458
- THANKS. I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

105
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,875
- JUST AS OUR INTEL PREDICTED.

106
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,333
- ( gasps )

107
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:54,291
- JACKSON MCLEAN.
DEATH ROW INMATE NUMBER 1467.

108
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,791
AND TEST SUBJECT NUMBER 43-85,
AM I CORRECT?

109
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,791
- AND YOU MUST BE R.U.C.

110
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,541
- YOUR BODY IS 78
PERCENT RESEMBLE.

111
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,791
DURING A SYSTEMS TEST,

112
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,458
YOU ESCAPED BY
ILLEGALLY DESTROYING

113
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,875
BOTH THE SAFETY MECHANISM
AND TRACKING BEACON.

114
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,416
IT TOOK QUITE A FEW
MAN-HOURS TO FIND YOU.

115
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,166
- SO, HOW'D YOU KNOW
I'D BE HERE?

116
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,458
- YOU UNDERESTIMATE
OUR RESOURCES, MCLEAN.

117
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,000
- WHAT? WHO TOLD YOU? I...

118
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,500
- AND FRANKLY, YOUR MOVEMENTS
ARE QUITE PREDICTABLE.

119
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,791
- ( beeping )

120
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,041
- GOT THEM. EXCELLENT
WORK, AXELA. - THANKS.

121
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,125
- I ADVISE YOU TO
RETURN QUIETLY!

122
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,125
- ( scoffs ) AND IF I REFUSE?

123
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,208
- ( gunshot )
- ( gasps )

124
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,041
- CHOOSE. WHAT'LL IT BE, MCLEAN?

125
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,875
- ( laughing )

126
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,125
- ( exclaims )

127
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,166
- DAMMIT!

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,125
- THAT WAS PAINFUL. I CAN'T AIM
WITH ALL THE SPOTS IN MY EYES.

129
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,750
I WANNA GO HOME!

130
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,208
- Silvia: CELICA,
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

131
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,541
- CAN YOU STILL TRACK HIM?
- IT'LL TAKE TIME.

132
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,583
- Silvia: WHAT'S YOUR CALL,
INTEGRA?

133
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,791
- Celica: LET'S PACK IT UP
AND TRY AGAIN TOMORROW.

134
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,291
- Silvia: NOBODY ASKED YOU,
CELICA. INTEGRA?

135
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,125
- Integra: LET'S WITHDRAW,
FOR NOW.

136
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,750
- UGH! AFFIRMATIVE.
- Celica: THANK YOU!

137
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,000
- Integra:
WE UNDERESTIMATED HIM.

138
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,125
TIME TO RETHINK OUR STRATEGY.

139
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,125
- ( TV playing indistinctly )

140
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,666
- MOMMY, I'M BACK!
- WELCOME HOME, HONEY.

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,583
THANK YOU FOR
HELPING MY DAUGHTER.

142
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,041
IT'S SUCH A MIRACLE THAT YOU
CAME ALONG WHEN YOU DID.

143
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,666
- IT WAS NOTHING.

144
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,375
- WHY DON'T YOU JOIN
US FOR DINNER?

145
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,416
- ME?

146
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,375
- YEAH, SOLTY.
EAT DINNER WITH US.

147
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,958
- UM, I'M NOT...

148
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,833
- WANT TO HELP YOUR
MOMMY IN THE KITCHEN?

149
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,208
- UH-HUH!

150
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,083
- JUST MAKE YOURSELF COMFY.
I'LL PUT ON SOME TEA.

151
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,541
- UH...

152
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,416
- Man on TV: THIS PROGRAM IS
BROUGHT TO YOU BY R.U.C.

153
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,958
R.U.C. TECHNOLOGY THAT
MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING.

154
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,791
- NOW REMEMBER, MERYL, WHEN
SOMEONE SHOWS YOU KINDNESS,

155
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,583
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS
REPAY IT IN KIND.

156
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,625
- I KNOW.

157
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,958
WHAT'S THE MATTER, SOLTY?

158
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,750
DID WE SAY SOMETHING WRONG?

159
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,416
- UH, NO, MERYL. IT ISN'T THAT.
IT'S JUST...

160
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,750
YOUR HOUSE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL.

161
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,250
I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL
HAPPY JUST BEING HERE.

162
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,083
- WELL, IT MAKES ME FEEL
VERY HAPPY TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

163
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,250
- ( door opens )

164
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,458
- I'M HOME!
AND I SEE WE HAVE A VISITOR.

165
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,750
- ( laughing ) DADDY!

166
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,208
- HELLO MY LITTLE PRINCESS.
HOW'S YOUR LEG, HONEY?

167
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,083
- ACTUALLY, IT'S FEELING
MUCH BETTER TODAY.

168
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:35,000
- GOOD, I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
AND WHO IS THIS YOUNG LADY?

169
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,458
- I'M SORRY, SIR.
MY NAME IS SOLTY REVANT.

170
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,625
- SHE WAS KIND ENOUGH
TO HELP MERYL MAKE IT HOME.

171
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,541
- WE ASKED HER TO EAT
DINNER WITH US.

172
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,958
- WELL, THAT WAS NICE.

173
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,208
AREN'T WE HONORED TO HAVE
SUCH A CONSIDERATE GUEST.

174
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,291
( chuckles ) LUCKY FOR YOU,
I'M NOT COOKING TONIGHT.

175
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,875
- ( all laugh )

176
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,041
- FAMILY.

177
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,583
( gasps )

178
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,416
( screams )

179
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,416
- Meryl: SOLTY, WHAT'S WRONG?

180
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,250
- I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS SO LATE!

181
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,416
PLEASE FORGIVE ME. I GOT TO GO.

182
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,291
- WAIT, SOLTY?
- YES?

183
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:08,708
- UM, MAYBE...
MAYBE TOMORROW?

184
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,291
- ( exclaims happily ) SURE.

185
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,500
SEE YOU THEN.

186
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,333
- ( door opens )

187
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,708
- Solty: IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU.

188
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,541
- WELL, THAT'S A SHAME.

189
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,625
- YEAH. ANOTHER TIME PERHAPS.

190
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,750
- MMM-HMM.

191
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,083
- Yuto: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
LOOK AT WHAT TIME IT IS.

192
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,583
SHE'S BEEN GONE WAY TOO LONG.

193
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,208
- I THINK YUTO'S RIGHT.

194
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,458
SHOULDN'T WE CALL THE POLICE?
TO BE SAFE?

195
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,666
- WHAT'S THE POINT?

196
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,500
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'D
ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING.

197
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,791
- HMM.

198
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,666
- WHAT THE HECK ARE
YOU WAITING FOR?

199
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,458
AREN'T YOU THE LEAST BIT
WORRIED ABOUT SOLTY?

200
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,416
YOU DO REALIZE THERE
ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE

201
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,375
WHO'D LOVE TO GET HOLD
OF HER TECHNOLOGY.

202
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,333
- ( slurping )

203
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,875
- ( sighs )

204
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,041
WHAT'S WITH HIM?

205
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,666
HOW CAN HE BE SO COLD?

206
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,791
ISN'T HE SUPPOSED
TO BE A PARENT?

207
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,708
- HE IS A PARENT.

208
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,416
HE'S JUST NOT VERY
GOOD AT SHOWING

209
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,666
OTHER PEOPLE HIS FEELINGS.

210
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,125
- COME ON!

211
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,333
SHE'S A ROBOT! WHAT THE
HELL AM I WORRIED FOR?

212
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:12,875
( sighs )

213
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,333
DAMMIT!

214
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
- ( door opens )

215
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:29,125
- HELLO. I'M BACK.
TODAY WAS AMAZING.

216
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,458
I MET THIS NICE,
LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS LOST.

217
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,416
HER NAME IS MERYL TYLER
AND WE BECAME FRIENDS.

218
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,250
AND MERYL NEEDED TO FIND THE
TRAIN STATION, SO I HELPED HER.

219
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,291
WE ENDED UP AT HER HOUSE.
IT'S BIG AND BEAUTIFUL.

220
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,958
SHE INVITED ME BACK TOMORROW,
AND I SAID YES.

221
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,291
- ( snoring )

222
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,958
- UH-OH. HE LOOKS ANGRY.
VERY ANGRY.

223
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,500
- I KNOW A SECRET.

224
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,291
IT WORKS GREAT AND CHEERS
MY DADDY UP EVERY TIME HE'S SAD.

225
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,708
MY MOMMY TAUGHT IT TO ME.

226
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:59,333
- NOW'S THE TIME TO TRY IT.
I SURE HOPE THIS WORKS.

227
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,916
- UM, I, UH...
- SPIT IT OUT.

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,916
- WELL, SEE, I...

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,583
- JUST SAY IT!
- I, UH...

230
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,541
- I'M TRYING TO SLEEP HERE.

231
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,500
- DADDY, I LOVE YOU.
- UH...

232
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,000
I LOVE YOU.

233
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,708
- ( footsteps )

234
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:17,791
- ( door closes )

235
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,416
- ( Roy panting )

236
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,625
- ROY, WHAT'S WRONG?

237
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,083
- SOLTY...
- SOLTY CAME HOME?

238
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,333
- SHE'S GONE...
SHE'S CRAZY.

239
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,541
- I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT.
NO ONE LISTENS.

240
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:41,666
- OH, MERYL, YOUR SECRET
DIDN'T WORK ON ROY.

241
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,250
- OH, SHE'S GONE AGAIN?

242
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,875
- YES. DO YOU HAVE ANY
IDEA WHERE SHE IS?

243
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,500
- SOLTY LEFT.

244
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,625
SHE SAID SHE PROMISED A FRIEND
THAT SHE'D GO BACK AND SEE HER.

245
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,000
- WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL ME?

246
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,791
- AND MERYL NEEDED TO
FIND THE TRAIN STATION,

247
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,125
SO I HELPED HER.

248
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,000
WE ENDED UP AT HER HOUSE.
IT'S BIG AND BEAUTIFUL.

249
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,833
SHE INVITED ME BACK TOMORROW.

250
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,125
- YOU OKAY, ROY?

251
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,583
- IT'S... IT'S NOTHING.

252
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,291
- ( chuckles )

253
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,708
SEE, YUTO.
HE KNOWS HOW TO BE A PARENT.

254
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,666
- THEN HE'S SURE GOOD
AT HIDING IT.

255
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,625
- Meryl: REALLY?
SO IT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL?

256
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,250
- NO, I GUESS NOT.

257
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:27,375
SO, ENOUGH ABOUT ALL THAT.
WHAT ARE WE SHOPPING FOR TODAY?

258
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,208
- LET ME CHECK AND SEE.

259
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,791
- ( beeps )

260
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,666
- ( giggles )

261
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,375
WOW. THAT'S A LOT OF FOOD.

262
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,708
- I KNOW.
MAYBE WE BOUGHT TOO MUCH.

263
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,958
- YOU MUST BE TIRED.

264
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,916
WAIT HERE AND I'LL GET
US SOMETHING TO DRINK.

265
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,500
- DO YOU NEED MONEY?

266
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,083
- DON'T WORRY.
I'VE GOT IT COVERED.

267
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,625
SEE. I HAVE ONE, TOO!

268
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,083
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
I WON'T BE LONG.

269
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,791
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

270
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,375
- Celica: TARGET SIGHTED.

271
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,333
GOTCHA. HE'S MINE.

272
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,583
I'VE GOT THE PERFECT SHOT.
JUST SAY THE WORD.

273
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,875
- Integra: NEGATIVE!
DO NOT FIRE.

274
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,625
OUR FIRST PRIORITY
IS TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE.

275
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,166
- HE ESCAPED ONCE.
I CAN TAKE HIM DOWN.

276
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,958
- NO, WE CAN'T RISK
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.

277
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,916
- EXCUSE ME, MISTER,
BUT YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

278
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,833
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

279
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,750
ARE YOU SICK?

280
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:55,458
- MERYL? THAT'S STRANGE.
WHERE WOULD SHE HAVE GONE?

281
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,750
- ( screams )

282
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,416
- ( gasps ) DOWN THERE!

283
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,125
- ( clanking )

284
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,666
- ( Meryl crying )

285
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,666
- THOSE BADGES KNOW
EVERY MOVE I MAKE.

286
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,166
- BUT THANKS TO YOU, SWEETNESS,
EVEN THEY WOULDN'T TOUCH ME NOW.

287
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,416
- SOLTY!
- MERYL!

288
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,000
- ( grunting )

289
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,833
- HOW'D YOU STOP THAT?
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

290
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,291
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WITH MY FRIEND?

291
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,958
- TELL ME YOUR NAME,
LITTLE GIRL.

292
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,208
- I'M SOLTY. WHO ARE YOU?

293
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,833
- ( groaning ) WHAT THE?

294
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,041
- ( screams )

295
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,458
- YOU'RE IN MY WAY!

296
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,083
- DON'T HURT HER!

297
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,250
- ( groaning )

298
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,125
- ( laughing )

299
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,208
- Meryl: SOLTY, WAKE UP. SOLTY!

300
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,166
- Roy: NO, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND, OFFICER.

301
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,791
I NEED TO SEE THAT ID CARD.
YOU FOUND IT HERE?

302
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,916
- CALM DOWN, SIR.
NOW, WHO IS SHE?

303
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,750
- SOLTY REVANT!

304
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,333
- WELL, SIR ALL WE
KNOW IS THAT THE CARD

305
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,041
WAS FOUND NEAR ONE
OF THESE PACKAGES.

306
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,833
I GUESS SHE DROPPED IT.

307
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,250
- WHAT ELSE? DO YOU HAVE ANY
LEADS ON HER LOCATION?

308
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,625
- PATROLS ARE COMBING THE AREA.

309
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,708
NOW, YOU CAN HELP US BY
ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS.

310
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,166
WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP
TO THIS MISSING PERSON?

311
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,875
- ( scoffs ) THIS ISN'T GOOD.
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO GATHER.

312
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,458
- LOCAL LAW
