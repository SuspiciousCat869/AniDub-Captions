1
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,000
- Rose: IN THE CITY,
THE PEOPLE ARE DIVIDED IN TWO

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,500
AS SURELY AS IF THERE IS
A WALL BETWEEN THEM.

3
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:28,000
EXCEPT THE WALL, IN THIS CASE,
IS A SIMPLE PIECE OF PLASTIC,

4
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,083
A CITIZEN I.D. CARD.

5
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,583
REGISTERED CARD-HOLDERS
ARE CALLED COMPENTERS,

6
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,750
UNREGISTERED CITIZENS,
INCOMPENTERS.

7
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,416
REGISTERED CITIZENS ARE
GUARANTEED A LIVING,

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,625
HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION.

9
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,750
AND MANY OTHER CITY SERVICES.

10
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,166
IT'S THEIR RIGHT.

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,166
THE UNREGISTERED CITIZENS
HAVE NO SUCH RIGHTS.

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,958
THEY HAVE NO GUARANTEES.

13
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,458
THIS LITTLE PIECE OF PLASTIC
IS GREATER THAN ANY WALL.

14
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:57,541
ON ONE SIDE ARE THE
PRIVILEGED, THE COMPENTERS.

15
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:01,958
ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE
INCOMPENTERS, THE OPPRESSED.

16
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,208
WELL, I DON'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT SUCH THINGS.

17
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,833
- ( gasps )

18
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,791
- ( alarm sounding )
- ( gasping )

19
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,625
- ( theme song playing )

20
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

21
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,625
- Roy: SO WHO'S THIS?

22
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,625
- Miranda: HE'S THE PERP IN
THE P 10 CRYSTAL ROBBERY

23
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,458
TWO DAYS AGO.

24
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,083
TWO GUARDS WERE SHOT.

25
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,083
- OH, MURDER THEN?

26
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,041
- NO, THE HOSPITAL SAYS THE
GUARDS ARE GOING TO MAKE IT,

27
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,916
BUT IT WAS A PRETTY CLOSE CALL.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,791
- AN UNREGISTERED CITIZEN.

29
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,666
HE'S NOT GONNA BE
AN EASY ONE TO FIND.

30
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,416
- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS
P 10 STUFF HE STOLE,

31
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,291
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?
- OH, IT'S...

32
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,958
- Yuto: A RARE
CRYSTALLINE COMPOUND.

33
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,166
- HUH?

34
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,416
ITS UNIQUENESS LIES IN
ITS GREATER CLARITY

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,666
AND HIGHER REFRACTION INDEX

36
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,250
THAN MOST ORDINARY CRYSTALS.

37
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,416
WHAT'S MORE, IT HAS
OPTO-ELECTRIC PROPERTIES

38
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,291
THAT GIVE IT AN INCREDIBLE
RANGE OF HIGH-TECH APPLICATIONS.

39
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,333
IT'S ONE OF THE HOTTEST
NEW MATERIALS OUT THERE.

40
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,041
A HANDFUL OF THE PURE STUFF
IS NEARLY PRICELESS.

41
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,833
HOWEVER, REFINING PURE
GRADE P 10 CRYSTAL

42
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,750
IS A PRETTY TRICKY PROCESS, SO
IT'S STILL IN SHORT SUPPLY.

43
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,125
- IS THAT SO? 'CAUSE
THE REPORT SAYS

44
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,000
HE GOT AWAY WITH A
PILE OF THE STUFF.

45
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,541
- THEN IT MUST'VE BEEN
A LOWER GRADE OF CRYSTAL.

46
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,791
IT WOULD STILL HAVE A
PRETTY HIGH STREET VALUE,

47
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,583
BUT IMPURE P 10 IS
EXTREMELY UNSTABLE.

48
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:02,250
IT HAS TO BE HANDLED
VERY CAREFULLY OR ELSE KABOOM.

49
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,541
- WELL, ROY,
YOU WANT THE JOB?

50
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,666
- "KABOOM"?

51
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,083
- I GUESS SO.
- ( phone ringing )

52
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,500
- HEY, ROY. PHONE CALL.

53
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,625
YOU CAN TAKE IT IN
THERE IF YOU WANT.

54
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,125
- PUT ME ON IT, MIRANDA.

55
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,958
THIS IS ROY.

56
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,291
- OKAY. I'LL START UP
THE PAPERWORK.

57
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,416
- KABOOM.

58
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,000
- WHAT? YOU'VE GOT TO
BE KIDDING ME.

59
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,666
I'M LEAVING.

60
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,875
- WAIT UP.
- HEY.

61
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,166
- ARE WE ON THE JOB NOW?
HUH, ROY?

62
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,708
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

63
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,541
- SO WHAT WAS THAT MYSTERIOUS
PHONE CALL ALL ABOUT?

64
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,708
I BET YOU ALREADY GOT
A LEAD ON THE PERP

65
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,458
AND WE'RE HOT ON
HIS TRAIL, AM I RIGHT?

66
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,791
- WHAT'S WRONG?

67
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,500
- COME ON, YOU CAN TELL US.

68
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,208
YOU GOTTA KEEP US IN THE LOOP
OR WE'RE NOT GONNA...

69
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,083
- SHUT UP, DAMN IT!

70
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,083
MY DAUGHTER,
SHE'S BEEN FOUND.

71
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,291
- YOUR DAUGHTER?

72
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,708
- ( giggling )

73
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,541
DADDY?

74
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,916
- THEY DON'T LEARN.
- ( scoffs )

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,458
- WHERE'S RITA?

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,291
YOU SON-OF-A...

77
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,458
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
OF SEARCHING...

78
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,833
- ( car doors closing )

79
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,541
- Yuto: IS THIS THE ONE?

80
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,291
- YEAH. I THINK SO.

81
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,875
- THIS IS WONDERFUL. YOU'VE
FOUND HER AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

82
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,458
- UH.

83
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,333
HMM.

84
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,125
- Yuto: HEY, SOLTY, YOU COMING?

85
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,875
- UH, YEAH.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,083
- YES?

87
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,125
- I'M LOOKING FOR
A RITA REVANT.

88
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,041
I WAS TOLD THIS
MIGHT BE HER HOUSE.

89
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,458
- I'M RITA REVANT.
- ( gasps )

90
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,083
- MAY I ASK YOUR NAME, PLEASE?

91
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,833
- I'M... MY NAME IS ROY REVANT.

92
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,541
- HANG ON. IT'LL TAKE ME
A MOMENT TO OPEN THE DOOR.

93
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,791
- ( gasping )

94
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,833
- WHAT DO YOU
THINK, IS IT HER?

95
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,458
- WELL, ROY?

96
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,041
- SHE... SHE'S NOT THE ONE.

97
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,875
- I SEE.

98
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,000
SO YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

99
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,583
- UH, YEAH.

100
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,666
- REVANT ISN'T ACTUALLY MY
LAST NAME. IT'S THE ONE THE

101
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,500
CITY REGISTRATION OFFICE
GAVE ME TWELVE YEARS AGO.

102
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:20,166
I LOST MY EYESIGHT AND THE USE
OF MY LEGS IN THE BLAST FALL.

103
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,333
I WAS FIVE YEARS
OLD AT THE TIME.

104
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,333
I REMEMBERED MY FIRST NAME
WAS RITA. BUT I COULDN'T RECALL

105
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,083
ANYTHING ELSE
ABOUT MY OLD LIFE.

106
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,916
SO I ENDED UP BECOMING
A WARD OF THE CITY.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,583
- SO YOU'RE A NEW RIGHTS CHILD?

108
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,708
- NEW RIGHTS? WHAT'S THAT?

109
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,458
- AFTER THE BLAST FALL,

110
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:40,083
UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN WERE
MADE WARDS OF THE CITY.

111
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,791
A SPECIAL LAW WAS PASSED,

112
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,791
SO THEY COULD REGISTER
AND BECOME FULL CITIZENS.

113
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,041
ANY CHILD WHO QUALIFIED

114
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,625
CAME TO BE KNOWN AS
A NEW RIGHTS CHILD.

115
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,125
- YES, I WAS ONE OF
THOSE CHILDREN.

116
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,041
IF IT WASN'T FOR THE LAW AND
THE SPECIAL ALLOWANCE I GET,

117
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,791
IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE FOR ME
TO LIVE HERE ON MY OWN.

118
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:57,958
- I KNOW.

119
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,833
- I'M... I'M SORRY.

120
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,541
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

121
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,375
- ( car approaching )

122
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,833
- UNCLE IS HERE.
- Yuto: UNCLE? BUT...

123
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,958
- WELL, HE'S... I CALL HIM
UNCLE BECAUSE HE'S SO KIND.

124
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,791
HE SAYS MY FATHER HELPED
HIM ONCE A LONG TIME AGO.

125
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,000
- ( sighs )

126
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,458
- ( door opening )

127
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,625
- HELLO, RITA.

128
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,625
- COME IN. I WANT YOU
TO MEET MY GUESTS.

129
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,958
- GUESTS?

130
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,375
COME ON.

131
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,708
- HUH?

132
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,666
- ( exclaiming )

133
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,083
- WHAT'S THE MATTER...
- RITA!

134
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,750
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, HONEY?

135
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,333
- I'M SORRY.

136
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,750
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE A VERY STRONG GIRL.

137
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,500
- OH, NO.

138
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,916
- IT MUST BE NICE. I WISH
I WAS AS STRONG AS YOU.

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,333
- OH, WELL... OH!

140
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,000
- UH, DO YOU...
- WHAT?

141
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,458
- DO YOU REALLY LIVE HERE
ALL BY YOURSELF?

142
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,000
- YES, I DO.

143
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,958
- BUT ISN'T THAT
KIND OF DIFFICULT?

144
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,625
- I DON'T MIND.
- UH?

145
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,625
- I'VE ALWAYS GOT UNCLE.

146
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,583
I OWE HIM EVERYTHING.

147
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,375
HE'S LOOKED AFTER ME
EVER SINCE THE BLAST FALL.

148
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,291
I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU ALL
THE THINGS HE'S DONE FOR ME.

149
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,833
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO
THANK HIM ENOUGH.

150
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,791
HE'S ALWAYS THERE FOR ME.

151
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,166
HE'S THE ONLY REAL
FAMILY I'VE EVER KNOWN.

152
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,625
- OKAY, WHAT'S
GOING ON? VINCENT.

153
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,333
LISTEN TO ME, THIS MORNING I
GOT A BOUNTY WARRANT

154
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,750
FOR YOUR CAPTURE, RIGHT?

155
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,166
THEN YOU JUST
SHOW UP HERE?

156
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,166
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT GIRL IN THERE?

157
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,166
- RITA IS MY DAUGHTER.

158
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,416
- BULLSHIT!
DON'T YOU GIVE ME THAT.

159
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,208
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE HER FATHER?

160
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,000
THEN WHY DON'T
YOU TELL HER THAT?

161
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,333
- BECAUSE I'M AN
UNREGISTERED CITIZEN.

162
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,125
IF THE CITY FINDS OUT RITA'S
FATHER IS UNREGISTERED,

163
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,750
SHE'LL LOSE HER NEW RIGHTS
STATUS, ALL HER BENEFITS.

164
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,041
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING
AND YOU KNOW IT.

165
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,208
- AND I SUPPOSE THAT JUSTIFIES
SHOOTING TWO PEOPLE?

166
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,125
- I DID IT SO SHE COULD
SEE AND WALK AGAIN.

167
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,500
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
A RESEMBLE EYE COSTS?

168
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,083
A RESEMBLE LEG?

169
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,375
AN AVERAGE GUY LIKE ME COULD
WORK FOR THREE LIFETIMES,

170
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,166
AND STILL NOT HAVE THE
CASH FOR THE OPERATIONS.

171
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,958
- IS THAT WHY YOU
TOOK THE P10?

172
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,291
- RITA'S BEEN SITTING IN TOTAL
DARKNESS FOR TWELVE YEARS.

173
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,458
IF THERE'S A CHANCE FOR HER
TO WALK IN THE LIGHT AGAIN,

174
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,375
I WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

175
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,916
ANYTHING, YOU HEAR? ANYTHING!

176
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,416
- ROY, NO.
- HOLD IT!

177
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,625
- Solty: ROY?

178
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,833
- WHAT?

179
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,375
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
WILL YOU ARREST VINCENT?

180
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,000
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO RITA?

181
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:24,291
- Kelly: FOR GOD SAKE, VINCENT,
JUST CHILL OUT, WILL YOU?

182
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,000
- BUT KELLY, THEY SENT
A HUNTER AFTER ME!

183
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,458
- HEY, RELAX.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

184
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,916
- DON'T WORRY? I GOT
CAUGHT BY A SECURITY CAMERA.

185
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,083
YOU TOLD ME THEY DIDN'T
HAVE ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE.

186
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,250
- THEY DIDN'T WHEN I LOOKED
THE PLACE OVER.

187
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,333
I WAS JUST AS
SURPRISED AS YOU.

188
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,541
VINCENT, I SCREWED UP,
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

189
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,458
- OKAY.

190
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,416
- YOU JUST GOTTA STAY COOL.

191
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,458
I'VE MADE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR RITA'S OPERATION.

192
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,333
YOU ONLY NEED A
LITTLE MORE CASH.

193
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,125
WE'RE GOOD TO GO
ON YOUR NEXT HEIST.

194
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,583
SO IT'S UP TO YOU, MY MAN,
ARE YOU IN OR ARE YOU OUT?

195
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,375
- OKAY, BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE HUNTER?

196
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,625
- JUST LEAVE HIM TO ME.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

197
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,958
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME
KELLY JONES, THE FIXER.

198
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,083
- RITA, IT WON'T BE LONG NOW,

199
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,875
AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
SEE AGAIN, AND WALK.

200
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,000
I'LL DISAPPEAR,

201
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,958
SO YOU CAN START A NEW LIFE.

202
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,208
IT'LL BE BETTER IF I'M GONE.

203
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,375
YOU WOULDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO
KNOW THAT YOUR FATHER'S A CROOK.

204
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,291
YOU'LL BE FINE.

205
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,250
YOU'RE STRONG, LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

206
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,041
ONCE YOUR EYES AND
LEGS ARE REPAIRED,

207
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,291
YOU WON'T NEED ME ANYMORE.

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,416
THIS'LL BE THE
LAST JOB I PULL.

209
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,666
- Solty: MR. VINCENT?
- ( gasping )

210
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,041
- ( chuckles )

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,416
FOR ONCE, CAN'T YOU
LET SOMEONE GO?

212
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,291
- DARN, THAT KID.

213
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,833
- ( knocking on door )

214
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,875
- YEAH?

215
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,500
- I GOT THE DNA ANALYSIS
YOU WANTED.

216
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,958
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT,

217
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,333
VINCENT IS DEFINITELY
RITA'S FATHER.

218
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,958
- ( sighing )
- ( phone ringing )

219
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,833
- YEAH. IT'S ME.

220
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,416
- IT'S MIRANDA. I RAN THE
CHECKS YOU ASKED FOR.

221
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,875
- OKAY, LET'S HEAR IT.

222
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,291
- VINCENT GRECO. I FOUND
ONLY ONE PRIOR ON HIM.

223
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,166
A STRETCH FOR
LARCENY YEARS AGO.

224
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,958
BUT UP UNTIL THIS
P 10 BUSINESS,

225
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,250
IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
KEEPING HIMSELF CLEAN.

226
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,250
IT SAYS HE WAS MARRIED,
WITH ONE CHILD, A DAUGHTER.

227
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,500
HIS WIFE WAS KILLED
IN THE BLAST FALL.

228
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,958
HIS DAUGHTER IS
LISTED AS MISSING.

229
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,875
ACCORDING TO THE
BIRTH CERTIFICATE,

230
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,041
THE DAUGHTER'S NAME WAS...

231
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,875
- RITA.

232
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,958
- THIS IS TURNING
INTO QUITE A MESS.

233
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,125
- SORRY.

234
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,541
- NOT YOUR FAULT.
BUT WATCH YOURSELF.

235
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,666
GRECO'S GOT SOME SHADY
CHARACTERS BACKING HIM UP...

236
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,875
- WHAT? MIRANDA, ARE YOU...

237
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,791
- IS SHE OKAY?
- GET DOWN!

238
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,208
- ( gun firing )

239
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,500
- ( footsteps approaching )

240
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,000
- Vincent: ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS?

241
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,000
- Solty: YES. I'M GONNA
HELP YOU.

242
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,916
BECAUSE RITA IS DEPENDING ON US.

243
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,250
- YEAH, I KNOW.

244
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,791
- Roy: STOP RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

245
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,708
OKAY, GRECO, HANDS ON YOUR HEAD
AND KNEEL DOWN ON THE FLOOR.

246
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,041
- BUT, ROY...

247
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,958
- SOLTY, JUST SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

248
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,291
ARE YOU NUTS? ARE YOU TRYING
TO BE A CRIMINAL, TOO?

249
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,666
VINCENT GRECO, A BOUNTY HAS
BEEN ISSUED FOR YOUR ARREST

250
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,416
FOR THE THEFT OF
THE P 10 CRYSTALS

251
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,375
AND THE ASSAULT OF TWO
SECURITY OFFICERS.

252
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,750
IF YOU RESIST, I...
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

253
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,500
YOU STOPPED US, SO WHY CAN'T
YOU JUST LET HIM GO?

254
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,833
YOU KNOW HE'S ONLY DOING
THIS SO HE CAN HELP RITA.

255
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,166
- YUTO'S BEEN SHOT!
- ( gasps )

256
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,583
- HE'S NOT DEAD,

257
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,708
BUT HE'S IN INTENSIVE CARE
THANKS TO GRECO'S BUDDIES.

258
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:02,125
YOU STILL THINK
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

259
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,250
IF RITA KNEW THAT THE
MONEY FOR HER TREATMENT

260
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,875
CAME FROM ROBBERY
AND ATTEMPTED MURDER,

261
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,791
HOW DO YOU THINK IT
WOULD MAKE HER FEEL?

262
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,250
DO YOU THINK SHE'D WANT THIS?

263
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,166
YOU'VE GOT ALL THE ANSWERS,
YOU RIGHTEOUS PRICK.

264
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,666
BUT YOU WEREN'T SO UPRIGHT

265
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,666
WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

266
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,083
- CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT I HAVE TO DO THIS?

267
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,875
- DON'T BE A SAP, GRECO.

268
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,708
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
THIS IS THE BEST WAY

269
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:22,583
TO HELP YOUR DAUGHTER?

270
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,000
- IT IS. IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

271
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,250
YOU DON'T GET IT.

272
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,166
I'D GIVE MY LIFE FOR HER
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.

273
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,250
- ( gunshot )

274
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,458
- VINCENT, NO!

275
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,458
- ( clapping ) BRAVO. BRAVO.

276
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:42,458
NOW THAT IS TRULY WHAT I CALL
AN AWARD-WINNING PERFORMANCE.

277
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,125
VINCENT, IT'S TIME TO
LOWER THE CURTAIN.

278
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,125
- ( groaning ) KELLY?

279
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,375
- ( laughs )

280
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,375
- NOT A GOOD IDEA.
- ( footsteps pattering )

281
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,583
- GUYS, I'D LIKE TO
INTRODUCE YOU TO

282
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,291
A COUPLE OF MY FRIENDS.

283
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,833
- Vincent: WHY DID YOU
TURN ON ME?

284
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:05,833
- ( scoffs ) TURN ON YOU?
NO, NO, NO.

285
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,458
THIS WAS MY PLAN FROM
THE VERY BEGINNING.

286
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,625
I'M SICK OF LIVING WITH THE

287
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,500
VERMIN IN THE
SHADOWS OF SOCIETY.

288
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,458
I'M GETTING WAY TOO
OLD FOR ALL THE

289
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,916
BLOODSHED AND BULLETS.

290
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,666
SO, NOW I'M GONNA BUY
MYSELF A FULL CITIZENSHIP

291
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,708
AND A COMFORTABLE RETIREMENT,

292
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,958
AND YOU'VE MADE IT
ALL POSSIBLE.

293
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,166
THANKS, OF COURSE,
TO YOUR GENEROUS CONTRIBUTION.

294
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,583
P 10 CRYSTAL.
SURE, IT MAY BE LOW GRADE,

295
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,041
BUT IT'S STILL WORTH PLENTY
TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

296
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,708
AND AS A BONUS,

297
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,125
IT DOES THIS!

298
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,625
- ( explosion )

299
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,166
- GETS ME EVERY TIME.

300
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,291
- BUT RITA... WHAT ABOUT
HER RESEMBLE SURGERY,

301
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,333
YOU PROMISED...

302
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,583
- I LIED. SO SUE ME.
- ( coughing )

303
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,333
STOP IT!

304
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,625
- OOPS. ALMOST FORGOT
ABOUT YOU TWO.

305
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,208
BUT DON'T WORRY,
WE ALL GET TO PLAY A PART.

306
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,458
YOU SEE, THERE'S VINCENT,

307
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,375
DESPERATE FUGITIVE WITH
A PRICE ON HIS HEAD,

308
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,333
HE TRIES TO ROB
A BANK, THEN YOU,

309
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,500
THE SAD, DISGRUNTLED
BOUNTY HUNTER,

310
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,750
YOU TRACK HIM DOWN,
AND AFTER A FIERCE FIGHT

311
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,666
YOU BOTH GET BLOWN TO BITS
IN A P 10 CRYSTAL EXPLOSION.

312
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,583
AND THE STOLEN MONEY IS
BURNED TO ASHES IN THE DISASTER.

313
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,458
WELL, ACTUALLY IT GOES
INTO MY POCKETS,

314
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,750
BUT NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW THAT.

315
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,916
PRETTY CONVINCING
SCENARIO, ISN'T IT?

316
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,250
- Solty: YOU ROTTEN CREEP.

317
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,958
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF VINCENT,
YOU'LL BE SORRY.

318
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,833
I'LL MAKE YOU SORRY.

319
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,166
- ( gasps )

320
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,500
SHOOT HER. SHOOT HER!

321
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,833
- ( guns firing )

322
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,875
- HEY. HEY.

323
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,458
- I DID...

324
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,500
- DON'T TALK.
SAVE YOUR STRENGTH.

325
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,083
- I DID IT FOR RITA, I...

326
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,708
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
JUST KEEP STILL.

327
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,625
- I MANAGED TO GET THIS.

328
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,541
- ( gasps )

329
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:04,625
- USE IT TO FIX RITA'S EYES.
USE IT...

330
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,916
- I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.

331
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,833
- WELL ROY, I GUESS I WASN'T
VERY MUCH OF A FATHER, WAS I?

332
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,583
( gasps )

333
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,375
- NO, VINCENT, YOU CAN'T DIE.

334
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,416
C'MON, NOT NOW. YOU GOT TO LIVE,
YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS YOU.

335
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,083
- ( grunting )

336
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,875
WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

337
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,750
FINISH HER OFF.
SHOOT HER. KILL HER.

338
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,708
- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.

339
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,875
- ( firing )

340
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,250
- THE BULLETS JUST BOUNCE
RIGHT OFF OF HER.

341
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,250
- HOW COULD YOU?

342
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,583
( yelling )

343
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,708
- ( exclaiming in fear )

344
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,750
- SOLTY, YOU OKAY?

345
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,083
- ROY, WHERE'S VINCENT?

346
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,625
- NOW'S OUR CHANCE,
EXTERMINATE THEM.

347
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,125
- DAMN IT.
THERE'S JUST TOO MANY.

348
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,750
- VINCENT. VINCENT.

349
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,375
- SORRY, MAN.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO BORROW THIS.

350
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,500
ASSUMING WE GET
OUT OF HERE ALIVE,

351
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,708
I PROMISE I'LL PAY YOU BACK.

352
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,541
- ( all screaming )

353
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,416
- ( groaning )

354
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,875
- WELL, THAT'S THAT.

355
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,125
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
PLEASE, VINCENT.

356
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,041
YOU CAN'T DIE. YOU CAN'T.

357
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,541
RITA SAID YOU'RE ALWAYS
THERE FOR HER.

358
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,750
RITA SAID YOU WERE HER FAMILY.

359
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,291
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE
HER LIKE THIS.

360
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,000
VINCENT...

361
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,500
PLEASE, YOU CAN'T
DIE LIKE THIS.

362
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,291
- OH. HE SAID THAT?

363
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,041
- UH, YEAH. HE SAID HE HAD
TO GO AWAY FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

364
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,500
- I UNDERSTAND.

365
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,500
- BUT HE LEFT ME WITH THE MONEY
TO PAY FOR YOUR SURGERY.

366
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,583
A COMPLETE RESEMBLE TREATMENT
FOR YOUR EYES AND LEGS.

367
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,500
IF AND WHEN YOU DECIDE
TO HAVE THE SURGERY,

368
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,041
I'LL BE GLAD TO HELP YOU OUT.

369
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,458
CENTRAL'LL PROBABLY SEND SOMEONE
OUT HERE DAY AFTER TOMORROW,

370
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,750
MAYBE EVEN SOONER.

371
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,041
SO, UH...

372
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,500
- TELL ME, PLEASE.
WHERE IS HE? WHERE'S HE NOW?

373
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,291
- I DON'T KNOW. HE DIDN'T
SAY WHERE HE WAS GOING.

374
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,875
- OH, I SEE.

375
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,291
MAY I ASK A FAVOR?

376
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,166
IF YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM, WOULD
YOU TELL HIM I SAID THANK YOU.

377
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,583
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
AND THAT I'LL DO IT.

378
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,291
- YEAH, SURE.

379
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,875
- ONE MORE THING.

380
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,375
PLEASE TELL HIM THAT
I'LL BE WAITING FOR HIM,

381
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,333
NO MATTER HOW LONG HE'S GONE.

382
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,125
TELL MY DAD THAT FOR ME.

383
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,250
- BUT... OF COURSE.
I'LL TELL HIM.

384
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,666
- ( sighs )

385
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,791
- ARE YOU SURE YOU
DON'T WANNA SEE HER?

386
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,250
- NO, I CAN'T.

387
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,666
- WELL ANYWAY,

388
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,666
I USED YOUR BOUNTY TO PAY
YOU BACK FOR THE CRYSTAL.

389
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,208
AND THE BOUNTY ON
KELLY AND HIS GANG

390
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,208
SHOULD LEAVE YOU
WITH SOME CHANGE.

391
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,250
LET'S GO.

392
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,583
- I LOVE YOU, SOLTY.

393
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,625
- UH...

394
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,166
ROSE?

395
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,291
- HEY, WELCOME BACK, GUYS.

396
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,708
I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.

397
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,875
I'M GONNA BE MOVING IN
FOR A WHILE. OKEY-DOKEY?

398
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,333
- UH?

399
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,666
- ( theme song playing )

400
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

401
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,791
- Rose: WHY IS THIS ROOM
SUCH A MESS?

402
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,583
- Solty: UM, ACTUALLY
I JUST CLEANED IT.

403
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,375
NEXT TIME, "A LITTLE
DEMON COMES TO VISIT."

404
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,875
- Rose: I THINK I'M GONNA
TAKE YOUR ROOM.

405
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,250
- Solty: OH!
