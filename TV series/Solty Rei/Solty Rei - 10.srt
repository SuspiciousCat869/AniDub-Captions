1
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,041
- HEY, SOLTY!
- WHAT IS IT, KASHA?

2
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,291
- WELL, I KNOW YOU HEAR
ABOUT THIS EVERYDAY,

3
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:27,375
BUT DO YOU REALLY
UNDERSTAND WHAT RESEMBLE IS?

4
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:30,708
- NO, I DON'T.
- THEN YOU'D BETTER LEARN!

5
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,625
I GUESS I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.
IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY

6
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,875
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO
TEACH YOU ALL ABOUT IT.

7
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:39,750
- OH, I CAN'T WAIT.
- WELL, RESEMBLE IS A TECHNOLOGY

8
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,500
THAT USES MECHANICAL PROSTHETICS
TO REPLACE HUMAN BODY PARTS.

9
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,958
- ME?
- NO, NOT YET.

10
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,250
IT JUST BECAME WIDESPREAD
AFTER THE BLAST FALL.

11
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,291
- REALLY?

12
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,875
- BUT LIKE WITH ANY
NEW TECHNOLOGY,

13
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,208
RESEMBLE CAN BE EXPLOITED,

14
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,833
IN THIS CASE TO GIVE PEOPLE
SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH.

15
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,750
THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT HAS
BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS.

16
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,416
- THAT'S TERRIBLE!

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,583
- BUT CRIMINALS AREN'T
THE ONLY ONES WHO USE RESEMBLE.

18
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,666
THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE
OUT THERE WHO USE IT

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,291
- TO HELP OTHERS IN NEED.
- THAT'S REALLY GOOD!

20
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:06,000
- A PERFECT EXAMPLE IS
THE RESEMBLE RESCUE SQUAD.

21
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,583
THEY CAN EASILY GO PLACES
THAT LARGE EQUIPMENT CAN'T,

22
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,208
AND STILL PERFORM
THE SAME TASKS.

23
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,416
- THAT'S AMAZING!

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,791
- OVERKILL.
- OH, SORRY.

25
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,000
- RESEMBLE CONTINUES TO
FIND NEW AND EXCITING USES.

26
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,708
I'LL CONCLUDE
THIS WEEK'S PRESENTATION.

27
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,208
SEE YOU NEXT TIME!
YOU STEPPED ON MY LINE!

28
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,916
- BYE, EVERYBODY!
- YOU STEPPED ON MY LINE!

29
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,625
- WAS THAT BETTER?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,791
- ( Roy speaking )

31
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,333
- ( rumbling )

32
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,791
- ( Rose quivering )

33
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,416
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY, ROSE?

34
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,291
YOU DON'T LOOK VERY GOOD.

35
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,875
- YEAH, I'M ALL RIGHT.
AT LEAST I THINK.

36
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,500
- OH, IT LOOKS LIKE THE
HOLE WE FELL THROUGH

37
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,041
IS COMPLETELY SEALED UP.

38
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,166
- UH-HUH.

39
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,875
- ( theme song playing )

40
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

41
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,750
- Miranda: ROY!

42
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,375
WHAT IN THE WORLD
HAPPENED HERE?

43
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,083
- WE CAME AS SOON AS WE HEARD.

44
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,250
IS IT TRUE?
ROSE AND SOLTY ARE STUCK?

45
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:50,125
- YEAH. IT HAPPENED JUST AS
WE WERE ABOUT TO CATCH A BOUNTY.

46
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,166
- SO WHY ARE WE STANDING AROUND?
WE'VE GOTTA HELP!

47
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,250
- Rescue leader: IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY.

48
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,083
I'M CAPTAIN BARRY VANDELL AND
WE'RE THE RESEMBLE RESCUE SQUAD.

49
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,750
IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE DOWN THERE,
WE'LL FIND 'EM.

50
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:16,250
JUST LEAVE IT TO US. WE DO
THIS SORT OF THING ALL THE TIME.

51
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,416
WE'LL HAVE THEM OUT
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,458
- YOU PROMISE?
- YES, I PROMISE.

53
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,333
- Roy: KASHA, YOU HEARD THE MAN.

54
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,250
WE SHOULD JUST SIT BACK AND
LET THESE GUYS DO THEIR JOB.

55
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,833
- AREN'T YOU EVEN WORRIED?

56
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,458
- IT'LL TAKE A LOT MORE THAN
A HOLE IN THE GROUND

57
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,000
TO STOP THOSE GIRLS.

58
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,333
- Rose: ( exclaims )
THIS WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED!

59
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,750
( giggles )

60
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:43,875
- UM, CAN I ASK SOMETHING?
- SURE, WHAT'S UP?

61
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,708
- WHY ARE WE TAKING A SHOWER?

62
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,416
- BECAUSE WE WERE
COVERED IN DIRT AND GRIME.

63
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,041
CLEANLINESS SHOULD ALWAYS
BE A TOP PRIORITY.

64
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,250
IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS
A GIRL HAS TO DO.

65
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,625
- OH.

66
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,041
- COME ON. SCRUB UP
BEFORE WE RUN OUT OF HOT WATER.

67
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,750
- UM, ROSE?

68
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,458
I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT'S VERY FLATTERING.

69
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,625
- WHO CARES? IT'S NOT LIKE
ANYBODY CAN SEE ME.

70
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,500
- OKAY THEN, I WON'T LOOK.
- OH, FORGET IT.

71
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,458
IT'S HOPELESS ANYWAY.

72
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,000
I CAN'T PRY THAT THING
OPEN ALL BY MYSELF.

73
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,708
- I WAS WONDERING,

74
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,375
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THIS PLACE IS?

75
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,708
- OF COURSE I DO.
IT'S THE OLD CITY.

76
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,583
- THE OLD CITY?
- YEAH.

77
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,916
I'M NOT SURE
WHEN THIS ONE WAS BUILT,

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,625
BUT IT WAS OBVIOUSLY
A LONG TIME AGO.

79
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,041
I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL
CITIES, JUST LIKE THIS ONE,

80
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,250
HIDDEN UNDERGROUND.
IT'S PLACES LIKE THIS WHERE

81
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,083
A LOT OF UNREGISTERED CITIZENS
MAKE THEIR HOMES,

82
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,666
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE NO ONE'S
LIVED DOWN HERE FOR A LONG TIME.

83
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,083
YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE
EVERYTHING'S SO DILAPIDATED.

84
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,583
( chuckles ) I'M SURPRISED
THAT SHOWER EVEN WORKED.

85
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,083
- OH.

86
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,166
- BUT ALL THAT'S
NOT IMPORTANT NOW.

87
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,041
DO YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU CAN OPEN THIS UP FOR ME?

88
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,291
- I THINK. BUT THEN
WOULDN'T I BE BREAKING A LAW?

89
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,083
- THIS ENTIRE PLACE
IS ABANDONED,

90
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,375
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER.
NOW GET TO WORK.

91
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,875
YOU DON'T WANNA SEE HOW CRABBY
I GET WHEN I'M HUNGRY.

92
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,041
- THEN WE SHOULD HURRY UP

93
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,000
AND FIND A WAY TO
GET OUT OF THIS PLACE.

94
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,041
ROY'S PROBABLY WORRIED ABOUT US.

95
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,541
- OH, YOU THINK SO?
I DOUBT THAT.

96
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:22,458
- HE ONLY WORRIES ABOUT HIMSELF.
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

97
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,583
- I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.
- I KNOW HE IS.

98
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,500
- I KNOW HE'S WORRIED, ROSE!
- OKAY, OKAY.

99
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,541
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.

100
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,833
NOW WOULD YOU MIND
OPENING THAT FOR ME?

101
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,458
WE'RE GONNA FIND A WAY
OUT OF HERE, RIGHT?

102
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,166
BUT THAT COULD TAKE HOURS,
DAYS, OR EVEN WEEKS.

103
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,291
THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD BE
PREPARED AND HAVE SOME FOOD,

104
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,625
JUST IN CASE WE NEED IT.

105
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:50,875
- DON'T YOU TRUST ME?
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.

106
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,916
- AWESOME! WAY TO GO!

107
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,833
- MOM, CAN'T THESE PEOPLE
WORK ANY FASTER?

108
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,000
AT THIS RATE,
IT'S GONNA BE DARK SOON.

109
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,250
- I KNOW, HONEY,
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

110
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,750
THIS TYPE OF WORK TAKES TIME.

111
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:37,583
- I THINK I'VE HAD ALL THE BAD
COFFEE I CAN STAND FOR ONE DAY.

112
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,125
- COME ON, THERE'S
GOT TO BE SOMETHING

113
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,833
WORTH SCAVENGING AROUND HERE.

114
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,166
- ( metallic grazing )

115
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,500
- ROSE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

116
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,125
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

117
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,750
I'M HUNTING FOR TREASURE.

118
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,958
- LET'S GO, ROSE.
THE LONGER WE STAY DOWN HERE,

119
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,708
THE MORE WORRIED
ROY'S GONNA GET.

120
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,208
- HE'S GONNA BE UPSET.
- YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.

121
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,125
BUT NO ONE HAS
LOOTED THIS AREA YET

122
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,041
AND I'M FINDING
ALL SORTS OF GOOD STUFF.

123
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,291
HERE, HOLD THIS.

124
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,041
THIS IS JUST SOMETHING
TO PASS THE TIME UNTIL

125
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,416
WE FIND OUR
WAY OUT, OKAY?

126
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,250
URGH! ROSE...

127
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,583
- AND BESIDES, LOOK.

128
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,458
SOMETIMES YOU FIND
USEFUL STUFF LIKE THIS.

129
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,208
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT IS? A MAP?

130
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,833
- I THINK
IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

131
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,250
WHAT LANGUAGE
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE?

132
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,333
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
A WORD OF IT.

133
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,916
JUST BY LOOKING AT
THE PICTURES, THOUGH,

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,208
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A MAP OF
THE UNDERGROUND CITY WE'RE IN.

135
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,625
- ELECTRICAL ROOM,
THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

136
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:53,875
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS,
INFIRMARY, CAFETERIA.

137
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,708
- WAIT, YOU CAN READ THAT?
- UM, I... YEAH.

138
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,291
- BUT HOW?
- I DON'T KNOW.

139
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,625
- WELL, WHATEVER.
GOOD WORK THOUGH, SOLTY.

140
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,916
NOW, SHOW ME WHERE IT SAYS
THE TREASURE IS LOCATED.

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,458
- WAIT A MINUTE.
- OH, I'M JUST KIDDING.

142
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,416
YOU KNOW,
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

143
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,041
WHY YOU SHOULD BE SO CONCERNED
ABOUT WHAT THAT OLD MAN THINKS.

144
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,833
JUST BECAUSE
HE'S YOUR FOSTER PARENT,

145
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,000
- DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO--
- UH, WHAT DOES FOSTER MEAN?

146
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,708
- IT JUST MEANS HE'S NOT
YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

147
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,291
- BUT ROY IS MY FATHER.

148
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,541
- YEAH, SURE. BUT HE'S...
OH, NEVER MIND. FORGET IT.

149
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,000
WHOA. THAT'S AMAZING.

150
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,125
SO TELL ME,
WHAT IS IT ABOUT ROY

151
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,041
THAT MAKES YOU THINK
SO HIGHLY OF THE GUY?

152
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,458
- THERE'S A BUNCH OF THINGS.
HE'S DONE SO MUCH TO HELP ME.

153
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,958
HE AGREED TO BE MY GUARDIAN

154
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,916
AND HE LETS ME STAY
AT HIS APARTMENT.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,750
HE'S A LOT NICER THAN YOU THINK.

156
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,833
I MEAN, HE HELPED YOU OUT
WHEN YOU NEEDED IT, TOO, RIGHT?

157
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,333
- WELL, YEAH,
I GUESS HE DID. HUH.

158
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,666
- AND YOU TRUST HIM? HONESTLY?
- OF COURSE I TRUST HIM.

159
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,541
- OKAY.

160
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,125
( groans ) OH, MAN,
I'M SO SICK OF THIS.

161
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,916
WHEN ARE WE GONNA
GET OUT OF HERE?

162
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,791
- IT'S OKAY, ROSE. CALM DOWN.

163
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,208
- HAVEN'T YOU REACHED
THE BOTTOM YET?

164
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,125
- WHAT'S TAKING
YOU GUYS SO LONG?

165
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,916
- UH, KASHA.

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,750
YELLING AT THEM
ISN'T GOING TO HELP.

167
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,250
THEY'RE DOING THE BEST
THAT THEY CAN. OKAY?

168
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,333
- BUT...

169
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,458
- Rescue leader: GUYS,
I FOUND ONE.

170
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,958
LET'S GO. LET'S GET HIM UP HERE.

171
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,375
DO YOU KNOW THIS ONE?

172
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,791
- Roy: YEAH. THAT'S THE BOUNTY
WE WERE AFTER.

173
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,625
- Worker: CAPTAIN!

174
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,083
- ( humming )

175
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,791
WHAT?

176
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,708
- ARE YOU HUMMING A SONG?
- OH, THAT? IT'S JUST A HABIT.

177
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,166
IT HELPS ME RELAX
AND CONCENTRATE

178
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,583
WHEN MY MIND IS WANDERING.

179
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,166
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

180
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,916
- OKAY.

181
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,125
( humming )

182
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,708
- ( chuckles )
THAT'S PRETTY BAD, SOLTY.

183
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,791
- OH.

184
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,875
- LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE OUT OF SUPPLIES.

185
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,000
THAT WAS THE LAST
OF THE FOOD AND DRINK.

186
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,916
( sighs ) I'M EXHAUSTED.

187
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,458
HOW MUCH FURTHER
DO YOU THINK WE HAVE TO GO

188
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,958
TILL WE GET OUT OF HERE?

189
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,250
- DON'T WORRY.
I'M SURE WE'RE CLOSE.

190
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,250
- I HOPE SO.
'CAUSE I'M FREAKING TIRED.

191
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,000
- WE CAN'T GIVE UP.
NO MATTER WHAT.

192
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,583
- SO I'VE BEEN THINKING,

193
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,333
IF THAT OLD MAN OF YOURS IS SO
CONCERNED ABOUT OUR WELL-BEING,

194
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,000
THEN SHOULDN'T HE BE
TRYING TO RESCUE US? I MEAN...

195
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,250
- I'M SURE HE'S DOING EVERYTHING
IN HIS POWER TO GET US OUT.

196
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,750
- YOU THINK SO?
- I DO.

197
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,333
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?
- I KNOW SO, REALLY.

198
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,291
- WELL, THEN I HOPE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

199
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,083
BUT, ALL THE SAME,
I'M NOT JUST GONNA SIT HERE

200
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,041
AND PLAY THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS.

201
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,500
AS FUN AS THAT SOUNDS, I
DO HAVE MY PRIDE TO CONSIDER.

202
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,416
SO, LET'S KEEP MOVING, SOLTY.

203
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:11,916
- OKAY.

204
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,833
- HOW MUCH LONGER IS IT
GONNA TAKE YOU PEOPLE?

205
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,416
YOU BETTER NOT HAVE
BEEN LYING TO ME

206
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,250
WHEN YOU PROMISED TO SAVE THEM!

207
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,375
- YOUNG LADY, YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO BE MORE PATIENT.

208
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,416
MY MEN ARE WORKING
AS FAST AS THEY CAN.

209
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,625
- BUT...
- KASHA, CALM DOWN.

210
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,291
- I'M TIRED OF SITTING. IS THERE
ANYTHING I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

211
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,041
- ( exclaims )

212
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,500
- WHAT'S HE...

213
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,250
- HE'S JUST TRYING TO
KEEP HIMSELF BUSY,

214
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,250
SO HE DOESN'T WORRY.
THAT'S HOW HE IS.

215
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,625
- ( alarm beeping )

216
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,791
- QUICKLY! EVERYBODY
GET OUT! NOW!

217
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,041
IS EVERYONE ALL RIGHT?
ARE THERE ANY INJURIES?

218
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,833
- GREG AND TOM WERE
HURT PRETTY BADLY.

219
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,625
- TAKE 'EM TO THE EV
AND CALL MEDICAL.

220
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,250
- ( crying )
- OH, KASHA. IT'S OKAY.

221
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,583
- Roy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE CALLING IT OFF?

222
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,708
THERE ARE TWO LIVES
AT STAKE DOWN THERE!

223
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,500
- THE GROUND'S
BECOME UNSTABLE HERE.

224
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,250
THIS OPERATION WAS ALREADY
DIFFICULT BEFORE THIS HAPPENED.

225
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,125
TO CONTINUE NOW
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.

226
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,958
THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH DEBRIS
FOR MY TEAM TO GET THROUGH.

227
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,875
- Miranda: ROY.

228
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,458
- IF WE KEEP GOING, WE'RE GONNA
RUN INTO SECONDARY CASUALTIES.

229
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,083
IF WE KNEW ANOTHER WAY
TO GET DOWN THERE,

230
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,333
IT WOULD BE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT STORY.

231
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,375
LOOK, I'M SORRY, I REALLY AM.

232
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,750
BUT I NEED TO CONSIDER
THE SAFETY OF MY MEN, TOO.

233
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,291
- I'LL DO IT MYSELF
IF I HAVE TO.

234
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,750
- ROY, DON'T!

235
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,125
- Andy: SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF
WORK FOR SUCH AN OLD MAN.

236
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,500
- EXCUSE ME, WHO ARE YOU?
- I CALLED FOR THEM.

237
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:13,166
THEIR SISTER ROSE IS ONE OF
THE PEOPLE TRAPPED UNDERGROUND.

238
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,375
- HEY, BUDDY, FIRST OFF
I LOVE THE OUTFIT.

239
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,083
NOW DIDN'T I HEAR YOU SAY THAT
IF YOU KNEW ANOTHER WAY INSIDE,

240
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,458
YOU COULD PROBABLY RESCUE THEM?

241
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,916
- YES. WHY?
- WE HAPPEN TO KNOW ONE.

242
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,083
- THE PLACE IS SO OLD,
WE HAD A HELLUVA TIME

243
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,583
GETTING OUR HANDS ON THIS.

244
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,250
- IT'S THE COMPLETE
STRUCTURAL LAYOUT

245
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,458
FOR THE UNDERGROUND
CITY BELOW US.

246
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,416
- Rescue leader: AND YOU'RE
SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT SPOT?

247
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,958
- Larry: POSITIVE.

248
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,458
THERE'S AN AIR CIRCULATION VENT
DIRECTLY BELOW US

249
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,750
THAT WAS PAVED OVER
WHEN THE CITY WAS ABANDONED.

250
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,958
ITS DIAMETER
IS AROUND FOUR METERS.

251
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,791
- WILL THAT BE ENOUGH?
- YES. MORE THAN ENOUGH.

252
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,416
ALL RIGHT, MEN, LET'S BREAK
THROUGH THIS CONCRETE. MOVE!

253
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,833
- YES, CAPTAIN. WE'RE ON IT,
CAPTAIN! YES, SIR.

254
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,041
- SO, YOU STILL UP
FOR HELPING US OUT?

255
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,125
- DAMN RIGHT I AM.

256
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,333
- I'M LISTENING. WHAT'S THIS?

257
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,791
- Andy: THIS IS THE
EXTERNAL CONDUIT

258
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,208
FOR THE COMPUTER SYSTEM
THAT RUNS THE CITY.

259
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,916
I CAN CONTROL THE ENTIRE GRID
FROM UP HERE IF I NEED TO.

260
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,250
SEE, THESE OLD CITIES

261
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,458
WERE BUILT USING COMPUTERS
THAT ARE ARCHAIC TODAY.

262
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,916
THEY ALL USE
PROPRIETARY GEAR

263
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,708
THAT YOU CAN'T
REALLY FIND ANYMORE.

264
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,208
LUCKILY FOR ME, I HAVE
A FRIEND WHO'S A PACK RAT.

265
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,875
- CAN YOU MAKE IT WORK?

266
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,875
- I CAN DO THIS STUFF
IN MY SLEEP.

267
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,250
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- I DON'T KNOW.

268
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,708
THE SYSTEM'S UNSTABLE
AND IT'S BEGINNING TO OVERHEAT.

269
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,666
SO DARN OLD,
THE WIRING'S PROBABLY SHOT.

270
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,333
- CAN YOU WORK AROUND IT?
- I THINK SO.

271
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,041
OKAY I'M INSIDE. HOLD ON.

272
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,000
I'M DOWNLOADING THE SCHEMATICS
TO MY LAPTOP.

273
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,708
- ( beeping )

274
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,625
- HEY, UH,
WHAT'S ALL THAT RED STUFF?

275
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,875
- OH, MY GOD, THIS IS BAD.

276
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,625
LOOKS LIKE
THE WHOLE CITY'S ON FIRE.

277
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,250
- WHAT CAN DO YOU?
CAN YOU, LIKE, TAP INTO A CAMERA

278
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,000
AND FIND OUT
WHERE THEY ARE OR SOMETHING?

279
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,125
- JUST HOLD ON.
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN PULL UP.

280
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,625
DAMMIT! NO GOOD.
CAMERA SYSTEM'S TOTALLY DOWN.

281
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,416
- Rescue leader: GUYS,
CARE TO EXPLAIN THIS?

282
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,333
- Larry: EXCELLENT WORK. YOU'RE
RIGHT WHERE YOU NEED TO BE.

283
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,916
NOW JUST REMOVE
THAT STEEL PLATE

284
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,708
AND YOU'LL FIND THE
VENT UNDERNEATH.

285
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,833
ONCE THAT'S DONE,
YOU CAN GET INSIDE.

286
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,708
- OKAY, TEAM, LET'S GET READY
TO PRY IT OPEN.

287
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,291
- WHAT'S THIS?

288
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,791
I'M HAVING TROUBLE EVEN GETTING
THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM TO ENGAGE.

289
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,041
OH, NO. YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME!

290
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,250
ACCORDING TO THIS, THE FIRE
HAS SPREAD TO THE FUEL DEPOT.

291
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,958
- I THINK IT STOPPED.

292
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,250
- THAT WAS
AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION.

293
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,958
NO TELLING
HOW MUCH DAMAGE IT DID.

294
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,583
I SURE HOPE IT DOESN'T
INTERRUPT MY CONNECTION.

295
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,666
- MOM...

296
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,166
- LIFT!

297
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,625
- GREAT. THAT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE A VENT TO ME.

298
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,958
- Larry: IT'S A
PROTECTIVE SHUTTER.

299
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,416
- YOU THINK YOU CAN OPEN IT?
- GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT.

300
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,125
- ( beeping )
- WHAT!

301
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,083
THIS IS STARTING TO PISS ME OFF.

302
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,875
IF IT'S NOT ONE THING,
IT'S ANOTHER!

303
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,250
- WHAT IS IT?

304
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,375
- THE DAMN FIRE'S BURNED OFF
ALMOST ALL THE OXYGEN.

305
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,208
THEY'RE GONNA SUFFOCATE
DOWN THERE!

306
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,583
- THEN HURRY UP AND OPEN IT!

307
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,083
- I KNOW!
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND!

308
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,333
OH, NO. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM
JUST SHUT ITSELF DOWN.

309
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,041
- IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY
WE CAN OPEN THAT SHUTTER?

310
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,625
- YOU MEAN...

311
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,541
- COME ON!

312
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,833
- HEY, TAKE A BREAK, PAL.

313
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,208
WE'RE GONNA FIND A WAY
TO OPEN THIS THING UP, OKAY.

314
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,000
JAMES, GET THE ELECTRIC SAW
OVER HERE!

315
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,125
- CAPTAIN, WE'LL HAVE MORE LUCK
DOING IT BY HAND.

316
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,625
- I DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT.
JUST GET IT OPEN!

317
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,125
- Roy: DAMMIT.

318
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,958
DAMMIT!

319
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,958
( quivering ) I CAN'T...
I CAN'T LOSE ANOTHER ONE.

320
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,000
NOT AGAIN.

321
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,125
- ROY.

322
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,250
- ( rumbling )

323
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,666
- YOU HEAR THAT?

324
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,958

325
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,583

327
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,958
THANK GOODNESS!
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

328
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,791

329
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,958
- OH, UH, HEY GUYS.

330
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,083

331
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,583
BUT IF YOU'RE EVER LOOKING
FOR A JOB, GIVE US A CALL.

332
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,708
- OH, UH...

333
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:46,958
- ( exhales )

334
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,625
LET'S GO HOME.

335
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,750

336
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,083

337
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:35,791

338
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,625

LOOKING FORWARD TO!

339
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,625
- Rose: OH, YEAH.

340
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,291
IT'S THE OLD MAN'S

341
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,958
