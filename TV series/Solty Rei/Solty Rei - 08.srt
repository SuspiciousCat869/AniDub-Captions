1
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,916
- Rose: A BAND OF THIEVES.

2
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:28,333
INGENIOUS, COURAGEOUS,
COVERT, BOLD...

3
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,166
THE FEARLESS EQUALIZERS
OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE.

4
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,708
KNOWN ONLY AS "TEAM ROSE"!

5
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,375
- Andy: WAIT A MINUTE!
WHAT'S THIS "TEAM ROSE" CRAP?

6
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,666
JUST TO BE CLEAR,

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,958
DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY
HAVE HEARD ON THE STREETS,

8
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,708
WE'RE NOT DOING ALL
THIS FOR THE MONEY.

9
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,125
- Andy: WHAT? YOU LIAR!

10
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,041
- MOST OF WHAT WE
STEAL IS GIVEN TO THE

11
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,666
POOR UNREGISTERED CITIZENS
WHO LACK WELFARE PROTECTION.

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,375
- WELL, YEAH. THAT'S TRUE.

13
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,041
- MODERN DAY ROBIN HOODS,
YOU SAY?

14
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,958
OH, COME ON!
THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE AT ALL!

15
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,500
WE ONLY WANT TO
HELP THE NEEDY,

16
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:56,750
TO BEAR THE FLAG IN A REVOLT
AGAINST A SOCIETY WE DISDAIN.

17
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,958
AND IF WE GARNER A LITTLE
ATTENTION ALONG THE WAY,

18
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,958
IT ONLY MAKES PEOPLE MORE
AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS

19
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,625
THAT WE'RE OUT TO MAKE RIGHT.

20
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:06,208
THAT IS THE HEART AND MODUS
OPERANDI OF "TEAM ROSE"!

21
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,166
- Andy: LOOK! FOR THE LAST TIME,
WE ARE NOT "TEAM ROSE"!

22
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,458
- ACTUALLY, THE NAME
OF OUR LITTLE BAND IS

23
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,208
"THE FRIENDLY
ANDERSON BROTHERS."

24
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,833
- Rose: WHAT?
- Andy: WHA... OH, COME ON!

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,708
- Rose: WE'RE KIND OF
TEMPORARILY CLOSED FOR NOW.

26
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,208
- GOOD MORNING!
THANK YOU FOR TUNING IN.

27
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,875
I'M LYDIA MACKAY.
NOW FOR NEWS.

28
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,291
ROADS FROM
THE DOWNTOWN AREA...

29
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,125
- Rose: IT SAYS HERE THAT
ALL PRODUCTION HAS CEASED

30
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,541
ON THE ENHANCED LINEAR WHEEL.

31
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,416
I DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE COMING.

32
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,916
POST-WAR TIMES ARE
PRETTY DIFFICULT

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,166
FOR THE MANUFACTURING
SECTOR, HUH?

34
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,333
AND ON TOP OF THAT, MY
HOROSCOPE IS TOTALLY BORING.

35
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,041
SOLTY! WHEN'S YOUR BIRTHDAY?

36
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,750
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA, DO YOU?

37
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,708
THAT'S YOUR TOP STORY?

38
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,958
- HEY! WOULD YOU PLEASE
REMIND ME AGAIN

39
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,125
WHY YOU'RE STILL HERE?

40
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,750
- TO RECRUIT SOLTY
AS A THIEF, OF COURSE!

41
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:03,916
I THOUGHT WE
TALKED ABOUT THIS.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,458
- LOOKS TO ME LIKE
YOU'RE SITTING AROUND

43
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,833
MOOCHING A FREE BREAKFAST!

44
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,458
SOLTY'S A SPECIAL GIRL!

45
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,791
SHE'S ALREADY SHOWN
TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL.

46
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,708
AND THAT POTENTIAL COULD BE
USED TO BENEFIT OUR SOCIETY,

47
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,625
BY MAKING HER
A TOP-CLASS THIEF!

48
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,000
- LIKE HELL YOU WILL.

49
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,458
- I'M NOT SURE IF I
WANNA BE A THIEF.

50
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,208
- WELL, YOU GOT PLENTY
OF TIME TO CONSIDER IT.

51
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,416
I'M GONNA BE HERE
FOR A WHILE.

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,000
- WHAT? SAYS WHO?

53
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,916
- IT'S REALLY THE BEST THING
FOR EVERYBODY!

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,916
IT'D BE SUCH A HASSLE TO HAVE
TO MOVE ALL MY STUFF BACK OUT.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,041
- NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME!

56
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,500
- SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?

57
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,416
- SHOULDN'T WE... ALL TRY TO
GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER?

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,708
- ( theme song playing )

59
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

60
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,541
- Andy: WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

61
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,833
- OF COURSE I'M SERIOUS,
MY DEAR BROTHER.

62
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,750
I'M GOING TO MAKE SOLTY A THIEF.

63
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,208
I MEAN JUST THINK ABOUT
ALL THE POSSIBILITIES!

64
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,875
IF SHE JOINS US, OUR WORK
BECOMES A WHOLE LOT EASIER.

65
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,000
- YOU'RE OUTTA YOUR MIND.

66
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,708
- I'LL BET THAT LARRY
AGREES WITH ME.

67
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,250
LARRY DO YOU AGREE WITH ME?

68
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,416
- IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

69
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,541
- Andy: YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!
- Rose: I KNEW YOU'D THINK SO!

70
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,833
- SOLTY REVANT'S
PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES

71
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,416
ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE.

72
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,833
IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE AN ASSET
IF SHE WERE TO BECOME OUR ALLY.

73
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,041
HOWEVER, WE HAVE TO TAKE ROY
INTO CONSIDERATION, AS WELL.

74
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,541
I DON'T THINK HE'LL BE
SO WILLING TO AGREE.

75
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,333
- THEN I'LL JUST
HAVE TO CONVINCE HIM.

76
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,958
- THINK YOU CAN?
- WELL, OF COURSE!

77
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,416
- AND HOW SOON COULD THAT BE?

78
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,375
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN HE
MIGHT DECIDE TO TURN ON US.

79
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,625
WE CAN'T LEAVE YOU THERE
WITH HIM FOR VERY LONG.

80
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,458
- Rose: SO, WHAT?

81
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,791
- YOU GOT THREE DAYS.

82
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,375
THREE DAYS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

83
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,791
- LARRY!

84
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,041
- IF YOU CAN'T DO IT BY THEN,
GIVE UP AND BACK OFF.

85
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,833
THOSE ARE MY CONDITIONS
ON THE MATTER.

86
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,583
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
AND ACCEPT THEM?

87
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,500
- THREE DAYS
IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME.

88
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,833
FOR ROSE, THERE'S NOTHING
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

89
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:37,916
- ( door creaks )

90
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,583
- ( gasps )

91
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,791
( breathing heavily )

92
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,041
WHAT DO YOU WANT!

93
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,375
- YOU WERE TOSSING AND TURNING
IN YOUR SLEEP.

94
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,291
I WAS WORRIED.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

95
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,375
- IT'S NOTHING.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, SOLTY.

96
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,166
SO WHERE'D THE OLD MAN GO?

97
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,666
- HE SAID HE HAD SOME WORK
TO DO AND THEN HE LEFT.

98
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,416
- YEAH? REALLY?
- UH-HUH.

99
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,666
- THEN HOW ABOUT WE...
- I WON'T DO IT!

100
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,333
I'M NOT GONNA BE A THIEF!

101
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,416
- DAMN.

102
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,375
- Miranda: SO I HEAR THAT ROSE
IS TRYING PRETTY HARD

103
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,875
TO RECRUIT SOLTY
INTO A LIFE OF THIEVERY.

104
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,375
- AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ALL THAT?

105
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,708
- SHE TOLD ME. SHE MENTIONED
SOMETHING ABOUT IT

106
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,916
YESTERDAY WHEN WE WERE
AT THE TEA ROOM TOGETHER.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,333
- WHEN DID SHE HAVE TIME TO...

108
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,833
- SO I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU'RE
NOT GOING LET THAT PLAN

109
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:52,666
COME TO FRUITION?

110
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,375
- NO! OF COURSE NOT!

111
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,958
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

112
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,041
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT
ROSE IS AS BAD OF A PERSON

113
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,875
AS YOU MAKE HER OUT TO BE.

114
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,250
I MEAN SHE MAY BE A THIEF
AND ALL, BUT SHE DOES IT

115
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,166
SO SHE CAN HELP
ALL THOSE UNREGISTERED CITIZENS.

116
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,750
- DOESN'T MATTER.
A CRIMINAL IS STILL A CRIMINAL.

117
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,375
- WHY DO KEEP SAYING
SUCH MEAN THINGS ABOUT HER?

118
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,541
EVERYTHING SHE DOES
IS TO HELP PEOPLE!

119
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,250
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
JUST KEEP CALLING HER

120
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,500
A CRIMINAL LIKE THAT!

121
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,750
I THINK IT'D BE GREAT
IF SOLTY BECAME A THIEF!

122
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,958
THAT WAY, SHE COULD
HELP PEOPLE TOO!

123
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,750
I THINK SOLTY FEELS THE SAME,
BUT SHE'S TOO SCARED TO...

124
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,833
- ( gasps )
- Miranda: KASHA?

125
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,708
WHAT IS THIS?

126
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,166
- UM, THAT'S, UH... YOU SEE...

127
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,458
- UH... AND WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT RING?

128
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,958
- I'M SORRY.
GUESS I SCREWED UP.

129
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,083
- ( shushing )

130
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,833
- Rose: COME ON!
THINK ABOUT IT.

131
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,416
A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS
DOESN'T COME ALONG EVERY DAY.

132
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,250
THREE MEALS A DAY,
AN AFTERNOON BREAK,

133
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,291
AND A GUARANTEED MINIMUM WAGE!
PLUS, WITH OUR PROFIT SHARING,

134
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,375
THE MORE YOU WORK,
THE MORE YOU EARN.

135
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,041
TWO BONUSES A YEAR!
HOUSING INCLUDED!

136
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,916
IT'S SUCH AN EXCITING OFFER!
TAKE A LOOK AROUND!

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,958
YOU WON'T FIND
A BETTER OPPORTUNITY.

138
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,166
- THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD RECON--
- ( door slams )

139
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,750
- HEY! WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

140
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,333
WERE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME?

141
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,666
- OH! ROSE!

142
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,500
- UGH. WHAT'S THAT
OLD MAN'S PROBLEM?

143
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,916
- UH, WELL, HE...

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,375
- GUESS I'LL BE ROOMING
IN HERE AGAIN.

145
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,333
WELL, GREAT!

146
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,958
THERE'S ONLY TWO DAYS LEFT.

147
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,458
IF I'D KNOWN IT WAS
GONNA BE THIS HARD,

148
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,208
I WOULD'VE ASKED FOR THREE
MONTHS INSTEAD OF THREE DAYS.

149
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,541
- OKAY, ROSE.
THE BED'S ALL READY FOR YOU.

150
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,125
- SO, SOLTY...

151
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,500
- I CAN'T ROSE.

152
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,833
- AND HERE WE ARE!

153
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,708
THIS IS THE BLAST
FALL MEMORIAL,

154
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,291
BUILT IN COMMEMORATION
OF ALL THOSE THEIR LIVES

155
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,208
N THE GREAT DISASTER
12 YEARS AGO.

156
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,750
EVERYONE HERE IS FAMILIAR WITH

157
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,166
THE EVENTS OF THE
BLAST FALL, RIGHT?

158
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,958
- I GUESS IT WAS A CRAZY
IDEA TO BEGIN WITH.

159
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,166
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO
CONVINCE THE OLD MAN!

160
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,666
WHY IS HE SO PROTECTIVE OF HER?

161
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,375
IT'S NOT LIKE HE CAN
HIDE HER AWAY FOREVER.

162
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,291
AND I'M SURE SOLTY
WOULD BE BETTER OFF

163
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,791
IF SHE WERE A LITTLE
MORE INDEPENDENT.

164
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,708
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

165
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,541
( humming )

166
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,708
- ( wind whooshing )

167
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:49,875
WHOA. I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME I FELT SO RELAXED.

168
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,041
- ( Ashley clears throat )

169
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,083
EXCUSE ME.

170
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,708
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULDN'T
MIND ME JOINING YOU FOR A BIT.

171
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,166
- REALLY?

172
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,333
SO, WHAT IS AN ELITE
FROM THE R.U.C.

173
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,875
DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

174
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,916
- ( laughs ) I TAKE
IT FROM YOUR TONE

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
THAT YOU'RE NOT A BIG FAN
OF THE R.U.C, ARE YOU?

176
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,458
- UH, DUH!

177
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,791
BESIDES, THERE ARE PLENTY
OF OTHER PLACES TO SIT HERE.

178
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,791
- OH, DEAR. WELL, THE PROBLEM IS

179
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,666
THAT THIS IS THE ONLY BENCH
THAT'S COMFORTABLE ENOUGH

180
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,458
FOR ME TO TAKE A NAP ON.

181
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,291
IF I DON'T GET A GOOD
NAP IN, I'M AFRAID

182
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,291
I RUN THE TERRIBLE
RISK OF FALLING ASLEEP

183
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,125
WHILE I'M ON DUTY.

184
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,791
I GOT IN SO MUCH TROUBLE
THE LAST TIME THAT HAPPENED.

185
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,875
IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN,
WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'LL DO.

186
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,875
- ( chuckles ) YOU'RE
AN ODD ONE, HUH?

187
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,708
ALL RIGHT. YOU CAUGHT ME
IN A GOOD MOOD TODAY.

188
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,916
I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION.
HAVE A SEAT.

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,541
- WELL, AS LONG AS
YOU DON'T MIND.

190
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,958
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

191
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,916
- SO WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,250
I MEAN WHAT KIND OF
R.U.C. ELITE WOULD CHOOSE

193
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,666
TO TAKE A NAP
IN SUCH A STRANGE PLACE?

194
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,375
- IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

195
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,625
I HAPPEN TO THINK
IT'S A VERY NICE PLACE,

196
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,000
ESPECIALLY TODAY,
UNDER SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SKY,

197
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,791
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LADY.

198
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,416
UM, LISTEN, FLATTERY WON'T GET
YOU ANYWHERE WITH ME, OKAY?

199
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,458
- THERE'S NO ULTERIOR
MOTIVE HERE.

200
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,166
I JUST CAN'T HELP
BUT FIND YOU TO BE

201
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,500
A VERY BEAUTIFUL
AND ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN.

202
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,791
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU,
WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING AT?

203
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,333
THOSE SHIMMERING EYES,
WHAT ARE THEY SEARCHING FOR?

204
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,541
- LISTEN, BUDDY,

205
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,708
DON'T EVEN THINK THAT
CRAP'S GONNA WORK WITH ME.

206
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,291
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

207
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,500
I'VE GOT MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO.

208
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,416
- WELL, I HOPE TO
SEE YOU AGAIN SOON!

209
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,458
- UGH. WHAT A JERK!

210
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,291
WHO DOES HE
THINK HE IS, ANYWAY?

211
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,041
WHAT IS WITH EVERYBODY TODAY?

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,416
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR YOUR OBJECTIONS.

213
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,791
JUST SIGN THIS CONTRACT!

214
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,333
( gasps )

215
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,416
- AND STAY OUT!

216
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,791
- THAT HAS GOT TO BE
THE MOST THICK-HEADED

217
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,750
--OLD MAN IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!
- HE SAID "NO" AGAIN?

218
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,083
- ( sighs ) TOMORROW'LL BE
MY LAST CHANCE.

219
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,958
ALRIGHT, I THINK I NEED TO
TRY A DIFFERENT APPROACH.

220
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,291
( sighs )

221
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,083
WHAT IS IT, OLD MAN? EXACTLY
WHAT PART OF THE AGREEMENT

222
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,458
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH?

223
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,333
IF YOU TELL ME, THERE
MIGHT BE ROOM TO NEGOTIATE.

224
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,291
- SOLTY WON'T BE A THIEF
AND THAT'S FINAL.

225
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,791
- NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME.

226
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,000
WE MAY BE THIEVES, BUT WHAT
WE DO IS FOR THE GOOD OF...

227
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,416
- A CRIMINAL IS A CRIMINAL!

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,541
- AH. SO, THAT'S HOW IT IS.
- UH, ROSE. MAYBE YOU SHOULD...

229
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,666
THAT'S WHAT YOU
THINK ABOUT ME.

230
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,666
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD A WORD I'VE
SAID TO YOU THIS WHOLE TIME!

231
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,250
I'VE JUST BEEN
WASTING MY BREATH!

232
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,708
- IT'S USELESS.

233
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,166
FINE THEN, IF YOU DON'T
WANNA SEE THINGS MY WAY,

234
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,958
I'LL JUST GET WHAT I WANT
BY FORCE.

235
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,416
- GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT, GIRL.

236
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,083
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD...
- ( gun cocks )

237
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,833
- NO, DON'T! ROSE! PLEASE!

238
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,916
ROSE, NO! DON'T DO THIS!

239
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,500
- YOU IDIOT!
- ( shot fires )

240
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,541
- NO! DAMNIT!

241
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,916
HE'S GETTING AWAY! COME BACK!

242
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:23,916
HE'S STILL ALIVE!

243
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,291
NO, IT'S NOT... NOT POSSIBLE.

244
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,375
HOW COULD HE?
IT CAN'T BE REAL! IT CAN'T!!

245
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,750
- WHAT? ROSE, WHO?

246
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,083
- DAMN HIM! DAMN HIM!

247
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,625
- Miranda: SO, HOW'S ROSE DOING?

248
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,916
- WELL, SHE SEEMS TO HAVE
CALMED DOWN FOR NOW.

249
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,166
IT'S JUST SO HARD TO BELIEVE,

250
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,916
POOR ROSE FALLING APART AND
LOSING CONTROL LIKE SHE DID.

251
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,291
- SO, DID YOU SEE THIS GUY?

252
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,041
THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSON ROSE
WAS CARRYING ON ABOUT?

253
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,458
- NO. I DIDN'T SEE HIM.

254
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,291
- THAT'S SO ODD.

255
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,041
OKAY, LET'S TAKE A LOOK IN
THE CITY'S ANTI-CRIME DATABASE.

256
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,375
- YEAH, RIGHT.

257
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,166
WE WERE ON THE SIDEWALK
NEAR 35 MEMPHIS BOULEVARD,

258
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,250
AROUND 1545.

259
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,500
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

260
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,375
- LOTS OF CAMERAS IN THAT AREA.

261
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,541
MM. THERE'S TONS OF THEM,
A LOT TO GO THROUGH.

262
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,333
IT'S GOING TO TAKE US A WHILE
TO IDENTIFY HIM. IF ONLY THERE

263
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,125
WERE AN EASIER WAY FOR US
TO SINGLE OUT THE SUSPECT.

264
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,375
- THERE IS.

265
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,208
- ROSE! FEELING ANY BETTER?

266
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,500
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

267
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,833
- DON'T TRY TO STOP ME.

268
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,750
THIS IS MY PROBLEM.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

269
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,583
SO JUST STAY OUT OF MY WAY.

270
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,583
- ROSE! HOLD ON!

271
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,166
- Larry: WELL, WELL,
MR. ROY REVANT. I CAN'T BELIEVE

272
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,333
YOU WENT THROUGH ALL THIS
TROUBLE TO HUNT US DOWN.

273
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,208
- YEAH, WELL, IT WASN'T
ALL THAT HARD.

274
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,875
- WHAT? IDIOT!

275
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,541
SHE PRINTED OUT
ALL OUR CONTACT INFORMATION!

276
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,041
- SO TELL ME, WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT FROM US?

277
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,291
- DO YOU RECOGNIZE ANYONE
IN THESE PHOTOS?

278
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,916
- IMPOSSIBLE.
- HE CAN'T BE ALIVE!

279
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,541
- WHO'S STILL ALIVE?

280
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,125
ANSWER ME!

281
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,291
WHOEVER IT IS MADE HER GO OUT
OF HER MIND WHEN SHE SAW HIM!

282
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,708
- Larry: JOHN KIMBERLY.

283
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,041
ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AGO,

284
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,291
HE BRUTALLY MURDERED ROSE'S
BEST FRIEND AND HER PARENTS.

285
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,083
IT ALL HAPPENED
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.

286
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,333
- WHAT?

287
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,375
- John: DO YOU, UH, WANT
SOMETHING FROM ME, YOUNG LADY?

288
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,958
SEEMS THAT YOU'VE BEEN
FOLLOWING ME FOR SOME TIME.

289
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,250
- DOES THE NAME
IRENE HAYES RING A BELL?

290
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,291
- EH, NO. SHOULD IT?

291
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,500
- YES. IT'S THE
NAME OF THE GIRL

292
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,208
YOU MURDERED EIGHT YEARS
AGO, YOU SON OF A BITCH!

293
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,000
- EASY, EASY. YOU
SHOULDN'T GO AROUND

294
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,708
POINTING A DANGEROUS
THING LIKE THAT.

295
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,041
I THINK YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE!

296
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,250
- DON'T GIMME THAT CRAP!
IT'S NO MISTAKE!

297
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,083
I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT FACE.

298
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,000
- MY DEAR GIRL,
I HONESTLY DON'T REMEMBER

299
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,625
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I MEAN HOW COULD I

300
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,083
WHEN I'VE KILLED SO MANY
PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS.

301
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,625
YOU SEE, WHEN I
NEEDED MONEY, I KILLED.

302
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,666
WHEN I NEEDED FOOD, I KILLED.

303
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,791
YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME
TO REMEMBER THEM ALL.

304
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,625
ESPECIALLY JUST
ONE LITTLE GIRL.

305
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,291
- ( shots firing )

306
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,875
- A DEFLECTIVE SHIELD?

307
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,916
- SORRY, BUT IT'S AGAINST
MY PERSONAL POLICY

308
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,833
TO LET ANY WITNESSES LIVE!

309
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,458
- KIMBERLY IS A CUNNING MAN.

310
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,875
HE ONLY MURDERS
UNREGISTERED CITIZENS.

311
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,375
BUT HE, HIMSELF,
IS AN UNREGISTERED CITIZEN.

312
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,875
AND THE POLICE HAVE A TENDENCY
TO OVERLOOK SUCH CASES.

313
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,541
- THAT BASTARD! I HEARD THAT
HE'D FINALLY BEEN KILLED!

314
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,000
- WELL, IF ROSE FINDS HIM,

315
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,416
THE ONLY THING THAT SHE'LL
HAVE ON HER MIND IS REVENGE.

316
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,708
- WE'VE GOTTA HURRY! WE
GOTTA STOP HER BEFORE SHE...

317
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,833
- RIGHT.

318
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,000
- ( phone ringing )

319
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,541
- HELLO?

320
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,875
- Roy: KASHA. IT'S ME.
LEMME TALK TO ROSE.

321
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,000
- ROSE LEFT!
SHE LOOKED CRAZY!

322
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,541
SHE SAID "STAY OUT OF
MY WAY" AND TOOK OFF.

323
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,041
SOLTY JUST RAN OUT
TO TELL YOU GUYS!

324
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,416
- OKAY, JUST CALM DOWN.

325
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,541
- Solty: ROY!

326
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,083
- SOLTY!
- ROY!

327
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,583
- (shots firing )

328
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,291
- A GUN IS USELESS AGAINST ME!
- I HAVE TO... SHOOT THE FLESH.

329
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,583
- ( metallic crashing )

330
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,958
- YOU UNDERESTIMATE ME, GIRL!

331
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,083
- GAME OVER, KIMBERLY.

332
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,083
- YOU SURE?
- ( shots firing )

333
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,458
- ( shot fires )

334
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,250
- OH, MY...
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

335
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,750
GUESS I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

336
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,541
YOU HAD ENOUGH?

337
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,583
GIVE IT UP.
YOU'LL NEVER BEAT ME!

338
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,958
AND REMEMBER...

339
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,083
I DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE
ANY WITNESSES.

340
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,583
SO...

341
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,250
( chuckling )

342
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,041
ROSE! HEY! ROSE!

343
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,875
- SOUNDED LIKE A GUN SHOT.
- OVER THERE!

344
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,000
- YEAH.

345
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,541
- OH, NO!

346
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,500
ROSE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
SAY SOMETHING!

347
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,666
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

348
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,125
JUST STAY OUT OF THIS!

349
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,208
DON'T YOU GET IT?
HE KILLED MY BEST FRIEND.

350
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,291
MY ONLY FRIEND.
IRENE MEANT EVERYTHING TO ME.

351
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,666
CAN'T YOU AT LEAST
TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS.

352
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,166
WE PLAYED TOGETHER
AND TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING!

353
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,958
MY BEST FRIEND.

354
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,416
AND HE JUST SLIT HER THROAT,
RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF ME.

355
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,541
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.
I WAS TOO WEAK TO STOP HIM!

356
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,916
I WAS... I WAS USELESS.

357
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,583
THIS CITY... THE LAWS AREN'T
MEANT TO PROTECT US.

358
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,916
THEY'RE MEANT TO KEEP US
UNDER CONTROL.

359
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,041
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

360
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,375
THAT'S WHY I DO THE THINGS I DO.

361
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,375
FOR THEM! TO PROTECT
ALL THE UNREGISTERED CITIZENS!

362
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,708
SO WHAT IF I DO IT
BY BEING A THIEF!

363
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,125
IT'S BETTER THAN SITTING AROUND
DOING NOTHING.

364
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,208
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO HAVE TO
GO THROUGH WHAT I WENT THOUGH.

365
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,375
NEVER. NEVER AGAIN!

366
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,458
( crying )

367
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,708
- ROSE, I...

368
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,416
UH, ROY...

369
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,416
- THERE'S NO CHOICE.

370
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,583
YOU THINK YOU CAN FIND HIM?

371
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,708
- JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

372
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,208
- ( breathing deeply )

373
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,916
LOOKS LIKE HER FRIENDS
ARE HERE...

374
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,958
- ( explosion booms )

375
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,000
- I DON'T LIKE YOU.

376
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,000
- WHAT THE HELL?
WHAT ARE YOU?

377
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,375
- THAT WON'T WORK ON ME!

378
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,208
( screams )

379
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,291
( grunting )

380
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,500
- ROSE, WAIT!

381
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,291
- FINALLY.

382
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,291
- NO! NO, DON'T!
PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!

383
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,416
HELP ME! SOMEBODY STOP HER!

384
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,166
- JUST SHUT UP!
SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

385
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,583
IRENE BEGGED FOR HER LIFE, TOO,
JUST LIKE THAT.

386
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,625
AND YOU MURDERED HER ANYWAY!

387
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,208
YOU DESERVE TO DIE!

388
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,708
- ROSE! STOP IT!

389
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,541
- NO!
- DON'T DO IT!

390
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,333
- John: SOMEBODY! PLEASE!
- ROSE!

391
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,416
- ( whimpering )

392
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,333
PLEASE! I DON'T WANNA DIE!
HELP ME!

393
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,541
- ROSE.

394
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,500
- ROSE! NO!

395
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,583
- ( sobbing )

396
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,708
( screams )

397
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,416
- Larry: SORRY IF WE
INCONVENIENCED YOU.

398
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,750
- IF YOU'RE REALLY SORRY,

399
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,500
THEN WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
HER HOME WITH YOU?

400
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,041
- AW, COME ON ROY.

401
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,416
I DON'T HAVE THE HEART
TO WAKE HER UP.

402
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,041
BESIDES, THIS COULD
WORK OUT IN YOUR FAVOR.

403
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,000
WITH ALL OF OUR INSIDE
CONNECTIONS

404
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,541
WE MIGHT FIND EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

405
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,708
- AND WHY SHOULD I
TRUST YOU? HMM?

406
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,666
- YOU SAW WHAT WE DID HERE.
YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRUST US.

407
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,166
AND PARTNERING UP
WITH A HUNTER

408
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,166
IS QUITE AN APPEALING
OPPORTUNITY FOR US, AS WELL.

409
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,583
- SUIT YOURSELF, THEN.

410
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,375
LATER.

411
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,416
- ( gun cocks )
- ( gasps )

412
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,791
NO, NO, NO!

413
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,666
- ( gun shot fires )

414
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,833
- ( closing theme playing )

415
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

416
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,500
- Sylvia: HEY!
WHO IS THAT GIRL?

417
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,291
- Celica: I DON'T KNOW.
WHO COULD SHE BE?

418
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,208
- Integra: WHAT'RE YOU TWO
DOING OVER THERE?

419
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,541
- All: NEXT EPISODE,
GIRLS' DAY OFF!

420
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,958
- MY WORK HERE IS DONE.
