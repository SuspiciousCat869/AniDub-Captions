1
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,625
- ( footsteps approaching )

2
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,583
- Will: WHAT IS THAT?

3
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,791
HELLO? HELLO?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

4
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,958
HEY GRAMPS. I FOUND
A GIRL OVER HERE.

5
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,000
I THINK SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

6
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,583
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,666
- ALL RIGHT. THAT SHOULD DO
IT FOR YOUR PAPERWORK.

9
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,083
GOOD LUCK TONIGHT.

10
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,500
- THANKS.

11
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,583
- ( keyboard clacking )

12
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,833
- YUTO.

13
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,208
HAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING
ON SOLTY, YET?

14
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,458
- NO, NOTHING YET.

15
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,916
THE SURVEILLANCE
CAMERAS CAME UP EMPTY.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,375
- OH.

17
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,500
- BUT I'LL EXPAND MY SEARCH
PARAMETERS A LITTLE MORE.

18
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,000
- YES, PLEASE DO.

19
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,333
AND THANKS FOR WORKING ALL
NIGHT. I KNOW IT'S HARD.

20
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,791
- LEAST I CAN DO.

21
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,333
- KASHA, SHOULDN'T YOU BE
LEAVING FOR SCHOOL SOON?

22
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,000
- YEAH. I'D BETTER GET GOING.

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,458
- KASHA, WOULD YOU LIKE IT
IF I WALKED YOU TO SCHOOL

24
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,125
THIS MORNING? I HAVE
TO GET SOMETHING

25
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,583
AT THE STORE, AND
IT'S ON THE WAY,

26
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,000
SO I FIGURED WE
COULD, YOU KNOW...

27
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,500
- I'M NOT A BABY.
I CAN GO MYSELF.

28
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,500
THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD
BE WORRIED ABOUT RIGHT NOW

29
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,208
IS FINDING SOLTY.

30
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,833
- I GUESS SHE'S TAKING THIS
PRETTY HARD, TOO, AND ROY...

31
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,291
- I'M GETTING HUNGRY.

32
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,083
- ( clattering )

33
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,750
- HOW COULD I LET THIS
HAPPEN TO RITA?

34
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,583
( crying ) I'M SO SORRY
I COULDN'T SAVE YOU.

35
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,291
- WHERE AM I?

36
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,833
ROY! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

37
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,833
WAIT, ROY.
WHY WON'T YOU ANSWER ME?

38
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,708
IS IT BECAUSE I'M A MACHINE?

39
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,375
BECAUSE I'M STILL ALIVE
INSTEAD OF ROSE?

40
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,208
WHAT IF I WERE HUMAN?
WHAT THEN?

41
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,041
ROY, PLEASE!

42
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,166
- SO, YOU'RE AWAKE.

43
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,583
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU
WOKE UP AT ALL.

44
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,708
YOU MANAGED TO OVERSTRESS
A NUMBER OF KEY COMPONENTS.

45
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,250
AND YOUR AI CIRCUITS WERE
ALMOST COMPLETELY OVERLOADED.

46
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,208
IT'S A GOOD THING I HAD SOME
SPARE PARTS LYING AROUND.

47
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,208
- HUH?

48
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,916
- SO, LET'S HEAR YOUR STORY.
- HUH?

49
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,291
- WHAT WAS IT THAT BROUGHT
YOU TO US, LITTLE ONE?

50
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,833
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

51
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,916
WHEN DID YOU ARRIVE?
WHAT'S YOUR PURPOSE?

52
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,750
YOU CAN HEAR ME, CAN'T YOU?

53
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,291
HMM, MAYBE HER LANGUAGE
CIRCUITS ARE DAMAGED.

54
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,541
- NO, THEY'RE NOT.

55
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,958
AND PLEASE SIR, DON'T
TALK ABOUT ME LIKE THAT.

56
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,666
- NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.
SO DOES ANYONE KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,583
YOU NEED TO ANSWER ME.

58
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,708
- I DON'T WANT TO ANSWER YOU.

59
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,833
- I NEVER THOUGHT
IT WAS POSSIBLE.

60
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:03,125
I BELIEVE YOU'RE SELF-AWARE.

61
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,375
- LISTEN, SINCE YOU REPAIRED ME

62
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,125
I PROMISE I WON'T MAKE
ANY TROUBLE FOR YOU,

63
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,000
SO WOULD YOU MIND
PUTTING THAT GUN AWAY, PLEASE?

64
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,166
IT'S MAKING ME NERVOUS.

65
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,916
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,833
I WOULDN'T WANT A BULLET
TO RICOCHET OFF ME

67
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,333
AND HIT YOU BY MISTAKE.

68
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,125
- HMM. I GUESS YOU
HAVE A POINT.

69
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,958
- I'M SORRY I CAN'T
ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.

70
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,958
I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP THOUGH.
THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME.

71
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,958
- ( door closes )

72
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,041
- ( sighs )

73
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,375
- HEY THERE.

74
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,250
SO YOU'RE AWAKE, HUH?
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

75
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,958
IT'S REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU
BACK ON YOUR FEET.

76
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,250
FEELIN' ANY BETTER?
YOU GAVE ME A HECK OF A SCARE

77
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,791
OUT THERE WHEN I FOUND YOU.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A GONER.

78
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,333
ANYWAY, MY NAME'S
WILL. NICE TO MEET YOU.

79
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,083
- UH...

80
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,291
IT'S NICE TO
MEET YOU TOO.

81
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,416
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

82
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,416
- UH, IT'S SOLTY.

83
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,583
- SOLTY. COOL.
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

84
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,291
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING
TO DO AROUND THIS PLACE.

85
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,250
WERE YOU ON A HIKE BY YOURSELF?
WOW! THAT'S PRETTY DANGEROUS.

86
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,500
- THIS DESERT WILL
EAT YOU ALIVE, YOU KNOW.

87
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,750
- YOU WERE LUCKY.

88
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,500
JUST SO HAPPENED I WAS
OUT SCAVENGING FOR PARTS

89
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,583
FOR THE PLANE I WAS
BUILDING. WANNA SEE IT?

90
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,541
- UM, I GUESS.

91
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,458
- ( chuckles )

92
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,583
- SO THIS IS WHAT
A PLANE LOOKS LIKE?

93
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,416
- YUP. NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE?

94
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,750
- NO, I HAVEN'T.

95
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,250
- PRETTY COOL, ISN'T IT?

96
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,916
IT'S A MACHINE THAT
CAN FLY LIKE A BIRD.

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,791
- A BIRD?
- LIKE THIS.

98
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,458
( mimics motor sounds )

99
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,833
SHE CAN FLY FAST AND HIGH,
BUT NOT HIGH ENOUGH

100
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,583
TO GET CAUGHT IN THE
ALTITUDE CEILING.

101
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,500
NOT LIKE I'D EVER
WANT TO GO THAT HIGH.

102
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,625
IT WASN'T EASY BUILDING
THIS, YOU KNOW.

103
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,125
PARTS ARE HARD TO COME BY.

104
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,875
YOU CAN'T JUST GO TO A STORE AND
GET WHAT YOU WANT ANYMORE.

105
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,125
I BUILT THIS ENTIRE THING
BY GOING INTO THE CITY

106
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,833
AND SCROUNGING AROUND
FOR WHAT I NEEDED.

107
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

108
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,583
- WELL, EVERY PART OF THIS BIRD,
FROM THE WINGS TO THE PROPELLER,

109
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,541
IS 100% RECYCLED.

110
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,875
I MADE IT ALL FROM TRASH
I FOUND IN THE CITY.

111
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,416
- SO THIS WAS ALL THROWN AWAY?

112
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,250
- YEAH. IT'S FUNNY 'CAUSE
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

113
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,791
I WAS SORT OF THROWN AWAY
MYSELF. AND GRAMPS THREW AWAY

114
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,000
THE LIFE HE HAD, SO IT'S ALMOST
KINDA FITTING, YOU KNOW?

115
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,750
I'M SO SORRY. I DON'T MEAN
TO TALK YOUR EAR OFF.

116
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,250
- THEN...
- YEAH?

117
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,416
- MAYBE SOMEDAY
IF YOU THINK IT WOULD HELP,

118
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,708
YOU CAN USE ME FOR THIS, TOO.

119
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,166
- CAN I REALLY?

120
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,416
- ( engine roaring )
- ( Will laughing excitedly )

121
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,541
WOW!

122
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,083
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

123
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,333
YOU'RE REALLY STRONG.

124
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,250
- THIS ISN'T WHAT I MEANT
WHEN I SAID YOU COULD USE ME.

125
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,250
- ( exclaims )

126
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,625
- WAIT.

127
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,875
- OKAY. NOW I JUST
HAVE TO STABILIZE

128
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,250
THE AIRFRAME AND THEN...

129
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,583
- ( gasps )

130
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:13,958
WILL!

131
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,625
WILL, ARE YOU OKAY?

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,208
OH NO, PLEASE, NOT AGAIN.

133
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,416
( gasps )

134
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,041
- I FOOLED YOU.

135
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,041
( laughs ) NO REALLY,
I'M OKAY. SEE?

136
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,375
I WAS JUST HAVING
A LITTLE FUN WITH YOU.

137
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,541
SO HEY, YOU CAN GO AHEAD
AND LAUGH NOW, RIGHT?

138
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,958
ARE YOU OKAY?

139
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,791
- ( crying )

140
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,541
- I'M SORRY.

141
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,958
I DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU.

142
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,791
C'MON NOW, DON'T CRY.

143
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,583
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

144
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,125
MAN, SHE WAS ALL CRYING
AND EMOTIONAL, AND THEN

145
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,291
THE NEXT THING I KNEW SHE
JUST COLLAPSED TO THE GROUND.

146
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,583
BUT I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO HER. I SWEAR.

147
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,916
- RELAX. NO ONE'S SAYING
YOU DID ANYTHING WRONG.

148
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,958
- GOOD. AS LONG AS
WE'RE CLEAR ON THAT.

149
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,625
SO, WHO IS THIS GIRL ANYWAY?

150
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,291
YOU KNOW SOMETHING
DON'T YOU, GRAMPS?

151
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,166
- RESPIRATION AND
PULSE ARE STABLE

152
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,791
AND WITHIN THE
ACCEPTABLE PARAMETERS.

153
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,666
- BRAINWAVE LEVEL GREEN.

154
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,625
- READINGS COMPLETE FOR
LINES 72 THROUGH 88.

155
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,125
WE'RE READING A
CONTROL CO-EFFICIENT

156
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,833
OF ZERO POINT SIX FIVE.

157
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,250
PROCESSING SPEED STILL
INCREASING STEADILY.

158
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,208
- SHE'S CONNECTING THE
PROCESSING LINES BY HERSELF.

159
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,333
STRESS CO-EFFICIENT
IS NEGLIGIBLE.

160
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,541
IT'S AS IF SHE'S FEELING
NO CONTROL STRESS AT ALL.

161
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,666
SHE'S A FANTASTIC SPECIMEN, SIR.

162
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,375
WHY DID YOU KEEP HER
FROM US FOR SO LONG.

163
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,708
- HELLO? AXELA?

164
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,625
- OH. HI SILVIA.

165
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,125
- WHAT'S UP?

166
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,250
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE ON THE PROGRAM TODAY.

167
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,166
- I WAS, BUT IT GOT CANCELED.

168
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,750
- THAT'S ODD.

169
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,458
- SO I UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTOR
ALREADY HAS YOU INVESTIGATING

170
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,916
THE CLOCK TOWER INCIDENT WITH
INTEGRA AND THE OTHERS?

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,166
- YEAH, WELL, YOU DID SO
MUCH TO PICK UP THE SLACK

172
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,291
FOR ME WHILE I WAS
IN THE HOSPITAL,

173
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,583
I FIGURE I HAVE TO
WORK DOUBLE-TIME

174
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,791
JUST TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

175
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,333
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

176
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,875
- WHAT?

177
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,708
- SILVIA, YOUR MAKEUP.

178
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,791
- UH. OH THAT. IT'S NOTHING.

179
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,875
CELICA MADE ME
PUT IT ON FOR UH...

180
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,708
- ( chuckles ) IT LOOKS GREAT.

181
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,541
- YEAH, RIGHT. LET'S DROP IT.
SO WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

182
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,333
YOU JUST SEEM KINDA
TALKATIVE TODAY.

183
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,916
- REALLY?
IS IT THAT BAD?

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,416
- NO, IT'S JUST UNUSUAL.

185
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,541
- WELL THEN,
I'LL TRY TO BE QUIET.

186
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:47,500
- NO, IT'S A NICE CHANGE
OF PACE. SEE YOU AROUND.

187
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,583
- ( lighter striking )

188
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,375
- Will: ALL RIGHT GUYS,
TIME TO PIG OUT.

189
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,791
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
SOUTHWESTERN THEME FOR A WHILE,

190
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,208
SO I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

191
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,791
- WILL, HOW MANY
TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU

192
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,916
TO STAY OUT OF THE KITCHEN?

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,083
- HOLD ON NOW, GRAMPS,

194
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,041
DON'T JUST JUDGE IT
BY ITS APPEARANCE.

195
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,416
IT'S HOW IT TASTES
THAT COUNTS, RIGHT?

196
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,916
- WHICH IS WHY I STRONGLY
SUGGEST YOU TAKE THIS AWAY

197
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,458
AND BRING OUT THE
USUAL RATION PACKS.

198
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,208
- BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE
HELPFUL TO OUR GUEST,

199
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,250
WHO I'M TRYING TO
HELP FEEL AT HOME.

200
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,083
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY
ABOUT. IT'S DELICIOUS.

201
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,083
( retching )

202
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,375
I TOLD YOU NOT TO
LET ME NEAR THE KITCHEN.

203
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,666
- WHEN YOU GONNA LEARN, WILLIAM?
- WAIT A SECOND.

204
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,958
- HUH?
- HUH?

205
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,500
- MAYBE I COULD COOK.
I'M PRETTY GOOD.

206
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,666
- REALLY?

207
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,916
WOW.

208
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,958
- I DID THE BEST I COULD WITH
WHAT I HAD. I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

209
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,958
- THIS LOOKS AMAZING.

210
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,750
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL?

211
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,583
- ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

212
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,750
- I'M SO HAPPY YOU LIKE IT.
- HMM.

213
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,750
- YOU KNOW SOLTY,
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS

214
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,583
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO LIVE HERE WITH US.

215
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,375
AND IF YOU WANT TO DO ALL THE
COOKING, HEY, THAT'S FINE TOO.

216
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,500
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- THAT'S ENOUGH, WILLIAM.

217
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,166
- WHAT?
- DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

218
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,458
- WHAT'S THAT FOR?
- YOU'VE GOTTA USE YOUR HEAD.

219
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,083
- USE MY HEAD FOR WHAT?
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

220
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,625
FINE. DON'T TELL ME.

221
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,500
PERFECT. NOW IF YOU'LL JUST
BRING THAT PANEL OVER HERE.

222
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,875
- Solty: GOT IT.

223
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,791
- ALL RIGHT.
BRING IT IN NICE AND SLOW.

224
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:05,916
- OKAY.

225
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,500
- ( sighs ) I WAS WORRIED
I'D NEVER GET THIS

226
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,875
PUT BACK TOGETHER.

227
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,750
BUT SHE LOOKS AS GOOD
AS NEW, DOESN'T SHE, SOLTY?

228
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,000
- UH, YES.

229
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,708
- I COULDN'T HAVE DONE
IT WITHOUT YOU. THANKS.

230
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,208
- OH. SURE.

231
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,583
- YOU DON'T SMILE MUCH.

232
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,333
YOU HAVEN'T SMILED ONCE
SINCE YESTERDAY.

233
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,333
IS IT BECAUSE
YOU'RE UNABLE TO?

234
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,125
- NO, I CAN.

235
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,583
- YOU CALL THAT A SMILE?
THAT'S PATHETIC.

236
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,875
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S NONE OF MY
BUSINESS, THEN THAT'S FINE, TOO.

237
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,750
BUT IF YOU WANNA TALK TO SOMEONE
ABOUT IT, WELL, I'M LISTENING.

238
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,416
OKAY. NOW I UNDERSTAND.

239
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,791
SO YOU REALLY HATE
YOUR MECHANICAL BODY THAT MUCH?

240
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,416
- YES I DO.

241
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,750
BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR BODY

242
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,875
YOU WERE ABLE TO SAVE
YOUR FOSTER FATHER, RIGHT?

243
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,875
SO IT'S A GOOD THING FOR HIM
THAT YOU HAD IT.

244
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,291
- WELL...

245
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,916
- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FEEL
ANYTHING! YOU'RE JUST A MACHINE!

246
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,833
- Will: AS FOR ME,

247
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,750
I'D DO ALMOST ANYTHING TO HAVE
A MECHANICAL BODY AT THIS POINT.

248
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,666
- HUH?

249
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,000
- ( chuckles )

250
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,875
PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE, RIGHT?

251
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,583
THEY GET HURT, OR SICK, OR MAYBE
IT'S JUST THEIR TIME TO GO.

252
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,166
IT'S A PART OF LIFE.

253
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,000
BUT WITH A MECHANICAL BODY,
YOU COULD LIVE FOREVER.

254
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,000
- YES, MAYBE SO, BUT ARE YOU
SURE THAT'S A GOOD THING?

255
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,750
- BEATS ME. I SURE WOULD LIKE
TO FIND OUT FOR MYSELF THOUGH.

256
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,083
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS,

257
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,083
PEOPLE ALWAYS TEND TO
WANT WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE.

258
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,875
DOESN'T MATTER THAT
THEY CAN'T HAVE IT,

259
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,375
THEY WANT IT ANYWAY.

260
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,625
SAD THING IS, MOST OF THE TIME,
THE OPPOSITE IS ALSO TRUE.

261
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,083
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
WITH WHAT YOU DO HAVE,

262
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,833
- WELL, THE CURE FOR THAT IS
JUST TO THROW IT ALL AWAY.

263
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,250
- HUH?

264
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,916
- YOUR MECHANICAL BODY,
YOUR FOSTER FATHER, EVERYTHING.

265
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,833
THIS IS A PERFECT PLACE
JUST TO LET IT ALL GO.

266
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,750
I MEAN, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED
TO DO TO FEEL BETTER.

267
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:06,750
- I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT.

268
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,291
- WHETHER IT'S FAMILY,
OR FRIENDS,

269
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,166
LOVE, LIFE, WHATEVER IT IS,

270
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,166
YOU CAN THROW IT ALL AWAY AND
START OVER ANYTIME YOU WANT.

271
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,250
ALL IT TAKES IS THE DECISION
TO DO IT, AND IT'S ALL GONE.

272
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,458
THEN AGAIN,

273
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,125
IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT REGRETS,

274
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,000
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD HOLD ON
TO EVERYTHING A LITTLE LONGER.

275
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,666
I MEAN, YOU'VE MADE
IT THIS FAR, RIGHT?

276
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,083
YOU CAN ALWAYS THROW IT
ALL AWAY LATER IF YOU WANT.

277
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,416
SIMPLE AS THAT.

278
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,666
IF IT WERE UP TO ME,

279
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,750
I'D WANT YOU TO STAY
HERE WITH US FOREVER.

280
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,333
- HUH?

281
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,750
- WHY'S THAT SO SURPRISING?

282
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,875
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS THAT
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU?

283
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,791
- HUH?
- ( chuckles )

284
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,875
- UM, I...

285
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,833
I'M SORRY BUT NO ONE'S EVER
SAID THAT TO ME BEFORE.

286
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,833
REALLY, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO SAY. I, UH...

287
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,083
- GOTCHA.

288
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,916
( laughing ) I WAS ONLY KIDDING.

289
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,708
WOW, YOU REALLY BOUGHT IT.

290
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,916
I'M SORRY. IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A JOKE.

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,708
GUESS I'M 0-FOR-2, HUH?

292
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,666
ANYWAY, LOOKS LIKE ITS
GETTING CLOSE TO SUNSET.

293
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,208
THINK YOU CAN COOK ANOTHER
ONE OF THOSE DELICIOUS DINNERS?

294
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,500
- UM, YEAH. SURE.

295
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,916
- GREAT. I CAN'T WAIT.

296
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,041
- ( vomiting )

297
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,583
( coughing )

298
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,625
DAMN. I DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME LEFT.

299
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,375
- ( beeps )

300
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,250
- ( gasps ) MIRANDA.

301
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,250
- ( footsteps approaching )

302
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,083
- WE'VE GOT SOME INFORMATION
THAT MIGHT HELP US FIND SOLTY.

303
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,541
SOMEONE WHO SAYS
THEY'VE SEEN HER.

304
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,875
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING
TO ME, ROY?

305
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,916
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO ABOUT IT?

306
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,791
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

307
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,666
- NOTHING.
- DAMMIT, ROY!

308
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,416
- SHE'S GONE.
RITA, TAKEN FROM ME AGAIN.

309
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,000
SHE'S ALL I CARED ABOUT.

310
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,000
SO, UNLESS YOU WANT
TO BRING RITA BACK...

311
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,500
( grunting )

312
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,541
- DON'T YOU DARE ACT LIKE YOU'RE
THE ONLY VICTIM HERE, ROY.

313
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,541
YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S LOST SOMEBODY? DO YOU?

314
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:36,083
I LOST MY HUSBAND.
YOU INSENSITIVE PRICK.

315
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,875
BUT I STILL HAD KASHA. I STILL
HAD A REASON TO KEEP ON LIVING.

316
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,125
AND YOU STILL HAD SOLTY,
YOU BASTARD!

317
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,416
- Solty: ROY.

318
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,125
- ( gasps )

319
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
- DO YOU REALLY WANT TO
LIE HERE AND DO NOTHING?

320
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,333
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO LOSE HER, TOO? ANSWER ME!

321
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,375
- Solty: WHAT? ME TOO?
SERIOUSLY?

322
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,375
- Will: YEP! I WOULDN'T KID
ABOUT THAT.

323
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,833
AS SOON AS THE PLANE
LEAVES THE GROUND, HOP IN. OKAY?

324
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,750
- BUT...
- OKAY?

325
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,916
- OKAY.

326
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,166

328
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,500
- LOOKING GOOD. KEEP HER
STEADY. WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

329
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,291
NOW. HOP IN.

330
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,416
HERE WE GO!

331
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,916
HEY SOLTY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ISN'T THE VIEW AMAZING?

332
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,458
- YEAH. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

333
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,375
- WHENEVER I GO
FLYING LIKE THIS,

334
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,833
IT FEELS LIKE I LEAVE
MY TROUBLES ON THE GROUND.

335
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,958
THE WORLD DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
SUCH A BAD PLACE FROM UP HERE.

336
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,750
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

337
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,625
- YOU FINALLY SMILED.

338
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,250
I'M ON TOP OF THE WORLD!

339
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,458
NOW I CAN DIE
A HAPPY MAN.

340
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,625
- DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

341
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,416
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO
BE THINKING ABOUT DEATH.

342
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
YOU HAVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE
AHEAD OF YOU.

343
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,000
- SOLTY.

344
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,333
- PROMISE ME.

345
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,416
- C'MON, I WAS JUST KIDDING
AROUND. CAN'T YOU TAKE A JOKE?

346
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,750
- WILL.

347
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:52,125
- I GOTCHA. NOW, WOULD
YOU MIND LETTING GO OF ME.

348
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,416
GUESS THAT WASN'T FUNNY EITHER.

349
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,208
- WILL, ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID YESTERDAY.

350
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,583
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT A LOT AND WELL...

351
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,916
- RIGHT! ABOUT YESTERDAY,

352
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,666
SORRY ABOUT THAT. I REALLY
WAS JUST KIDDING AROUND.

353
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,000
I GUESS I JUST FELT LIKE
TEASING YOU A LITTLE BIT.

354
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,416
THE TRUTH IS,
I WAS FEELING JEALOUS,

355
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,166
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATED.
I DON' T KNOW.

356
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,583
I JUST WANTED TO LEAVE MY OWN
LITTLE MARK ON THIS WORLD,

WHILE THERE WAS STILL TIME.

358
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,708
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

359
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:26,208
- BUT BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY
THIS. I WAS HALF SERIOUS TOO.

360
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,750
- LISTEN, WILL...

361
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,625
WILL!

362
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,750
WILL, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

363
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,458
WILL, WAKE UP!

364
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,625
WILL!
