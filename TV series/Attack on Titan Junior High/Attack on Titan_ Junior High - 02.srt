We get to watch a DVD today!

[FRANZ]
Fun!

3
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,500
That's kinda weird.

00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,750
Whoever sits at that
desk never shows up.

00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,458
Huh? Oh, Armin.

6
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,125
Poor guy really hates the cold,

7
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,041
so during the Winter
he just stays home.

8
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,375
But it's already Spring.

9
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,458
How warm's it gotta be for
him to come to school?

10
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,708
He needs to start thinking
about his attendance record.

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,041
I wonder if he's okay.

12
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,791
Let's drop by and check
on him after class.

Oh. Right.

18
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,250
Sir, is there a club dedicated
to beating up Titans?

19
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,250
'Cause I would join
that in a heartbeat.

You and the absentee

Uh. Yes, sir!

Good.

I expect you to collect his club
submission form by tomorrow.

If you fail, I'll put him
and the whole lot of you

29
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:12,166
in whatever club I
damn well feel like.

Don't you see?

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,250
That's how I'll hone my
Titan-fighting skills!

00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,625

I just wasn't able
to see it before.

We're caught between
a Siberian cold front

You're a good friend.

We know who's got it.

Question is how do
we track him down?

to swing that bat?

162
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,208
I scoped out the soccer club
and it was a disaster.

163
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,500
They ought to call it pushball

164
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,458
so you know what you'll
be getting' into.

[JEAN]
Hu? Reiner.

169
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,000
The Judo Club's a total joke.

170
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,958
And Ymir says the same
thing about Band.

171
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,625
Titans basically run the show.

So... who's he?

Oh. This is Armin.

178
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,916
Our buddy who's been
absent from school.

179

Uh, is he okay?

182
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,000
That's one heck of
a sneeze attack.

183
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,416
Hey, are you contagious?

184
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Don't worry, he's just
susceptible to colds

185
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,708
when he's not wrapped
up in his futon.

186
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,291
That reminds me.

Have any of you
seen this before?

We're lookin' for
the guy it belongs to.

189
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,291
He ran off with Armin's futon

190
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,958
after takin' out a
Titan in one blow.

191
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,541
Someone took out a Titan?

192
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,083
Yeah, sure. Whatever, man.

193

No. Wait.

194
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,000
I've heard about this.

195
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,583
Word through the grapevine is
there's a secret organization

196
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,125
on campus that rebels
against the Titans.

197
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,833
Their symbol is the
Wings of Freedom.

198
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,041
So you're tellin' me

199
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,708
there is a club where
you beat up Titans!

200
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,791
Wow. He looks happy.

201
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:46,250
Guys. I have feeling that's
where my futon is.

202
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,833
There's more to it
than that. A lot more.

203
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,958
Rumor has it the strongest man
in the world is a member.

204
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,791
The world? That's really strong.

205
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,458
I like me the sound of that.

206
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,958
Ha! My kinda club!

207
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,000
You think if we join they'll
teach how to fight

208
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,291
so we can actually keep our
lunches safe for a change?

209
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,500
Taking down a Titan's gotta
be worth serious points

210
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,958
with the hotties in this school.

211
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,458

I have to sign up!

[REINER]
Easy there, champ.

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,958
Like I said, it's a
secret organization.

214
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,000
It's not like they'll have
a sign over their door.

215

[EREN]
"Attack Junior Scout Regiment."

[CHRISTA] That was easier
than I thought it would be.

217
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,166
[REINER] Yeah, well, I was just
going by what I heard, okay?

218
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,250
[YMIR] Do secret organizations
usually advertise?

219
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,333
It's like a clubhouse

220
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,041
for a bunch of
elementary school brats.

221
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,250
Honestly, I'm starting to
get a little discouraged.

might be in there!

about his club

chance he'll hear us?

Why are you here?

If you're laboring under
the misguided assumption

230
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,166
we're a secret,
below-board organization

231

dedicated to standing up
against the Titan scourge,

No.

There must've been
some kind of mistake.

236
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,166
The very existence of the Scout
Regiment is shrouded in secrecy.

237
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,000
There's no way a bunch of First
Year dolts have heard of us.

00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:51,375
Eren!

319
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:51,875
[ARMIN whimpers]

320
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:52,875
Hey. Moron.

321
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,666
Recyclables go
in a separate bin.

322
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,666
You don't just throw
plastic in the trash.

323
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,041
Hello, Levi!

324
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,000
Excellent form on
the slap, as usual.

325
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:04,250
Then again, you are the
strongest man in the world!

326
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,125
[LEVI]
Can it, Abnormal.

327
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,041
[EREN]
I knew it had to be true.

328
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,083
He is the strongest
man in the world!

329
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,875
Hey, that's my futon he's got!

330
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,583
Why did you... [sneezes]
Why'd you take it?

331
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,833
[sneezing]

332
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,083
[LEVI]
Isn't it obvious?

333
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,250
Huh?

334
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,083
Since when does a
man need excuses

335
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,541
to repair a damaged futon?

336
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,000
--[MIKASA growling]
--[ARMIN sneezes]

337
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,541
[ARMIN]
Ah!

338
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,166
You made him stop sneezing!

339
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,875
He's without it for five minutes
and he catches a cold?

340
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,500
I'd say somebody needs to
get himself in better shape.

341
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,791
Ah. It hasn't been
this warm in years!

342
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,083
Maybe if he wears that thing

343
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,708
he'll actually start
showing up to class.

344
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,958
That's a good idea!

345
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,916
Way to go, Armin, good for you!

346
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,375
Aw, you guys! Thank you!

347
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:46,958
[EREN]
Levi!

348
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,500
[ALL]
Huh?

349
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,916
Please let me join the Attack
Junior High Scout Regiment!

350
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,208
Easy there, Chee-burg.
This place is a sty.

351
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,458
[EREN]
Huh?

352
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,208
[LEVI] Get to cleaning
and I'll consider it.

353
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,625
So, then,

354
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,500
you really think you have
what it takes to be a Scout?

355
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,916
Yes! Please let me sign up, sir!

356
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,916
[LEVI] I need to know
that you fully understand

357
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,541
the risks involved.

358
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,916
If the school finds out,
you'll be expelled.

359
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,875
As in kicked out, for good.

360
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,250
Are you prepared for that?

361
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,916
Yeah! We were born
prepared, sir!

362
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,291
Hell yeah!

363
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,000
We care a lot more about
lunch than our transcripts!

364
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,750
I want my mom's
fried chicken back!

365
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,583
What about you, Chee-burg?

366
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,958
What's in this for you?

367
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,916
It's an easy question, for most.

368
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,625
What is it you want to do?

369
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,375
For me?

370
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,625
I want to join the Scouts,

371
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,958
and slaughter every Titan
that crosses my path!

372
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:41,666
[LEVI] Well played.
Good enough for me.

373
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,458
[ALL scream]

374
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,458
[EREN groaning]
What are you doin'?

375
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,833
Uh?

376
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,166
[EREN]
Whoa!

377
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,000
Good news, First Years.

378
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,750
You're all now officially
members of the Scouts.

379
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,500
This is gonna be epic!

380
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,416
Hooray shadowy organization!

381
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,833
Ha! This is great!

382
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,916
Now the Wings of Freedom
belong to us all!

383
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,625
What about our other clubs?

384
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,375
We ought to be able
to switch, right?

385
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,791
I mean, we've still
got some time.

386
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,416
[EREN] Wait, Wall Cleanup?!
What the hell?!

387
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,750
We turned in our submission
forms on time!

388
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,500
The Scout Regiment
is unauthorized.

389
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,791
Don't tell me you
thought the school

390
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,833
would approve your membership?

391
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,000
--[ALL gasping]

392

[MIKASA sighs]

395
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,208
[ARMIN]
"I will crush you."

396
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,708
Thirsty for revenge,

397
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:11,375
Annie challenges Eren to a
cutthroat game of dodge-ball.

398
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,000
When all is said and done,

399
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,875
the source of her burning hatred
will become all too clear.
