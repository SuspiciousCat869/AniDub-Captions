Hey, Annie!

Uh. Huh?

00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,125
What's your favorite
thing to eat for lunch?

If you don't mind me asking.

I really like cheese--

That chee-burg bastard

No kidding. I mean,

into cheese Hamburg steak?

Right. Keep it together, Jean.

Just, cover up that
Eren's not here.

to explain to me

If I didn't know better,

I'd say it had something
to do with the fact

that Jaeger appears
to be absent.

all in agreement

Right. What are infielders?

underestimate Conny's stupidity.

at least now we know who

to let it get cold?

waste of good ramen!

Of course!

from whatever she
happens to be eating!

to use her hands!

we have one decent player?

tag out somebody like Mi--

You're that weak?!

127
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,791
Yeah. The thing about Mikasa
you have to understand

128
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,916
is that when she's separated
from Eren for too long,

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,625
her stats go down by 30%.

130

The world is a cruel place.

[ARMIN] Hard to believe a girl
just out of elementary school

133

can go that dark.

What it with this team?

An idiot who can't get his
head around the rules.

136

A girl who stuffs her face
in the middle of the game.

And our star player:

intense it's got an aura.

on with this team?!

match is in the bag.

being such a struggle to win.

was in top form.

what else to do.

How 'about when this crap's
over and done with,

162
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,291
you marry me?

[REINER growls]

164
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,416
Gettin' tired of this!

165
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,166
[gasps] Annie! Look out!

166
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,375
[BERTHOLDT]
No! [groans]

167
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,166
[ANNIE]
Huh?

168
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,708
[REINER]
Annie! Heads-up!

169
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,208
What the--?

170
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,666
[STUDENTS scream]

171
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:42,875
Reiner!

172
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:47,375
[REINER yells]
Take this!

175
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,083
[HANNES]
Game over! Class 4, Team B wins!

176
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,583
[ALL scream]

177
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,500
We don't... We don't
stand a chance.

178
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,791
It's as if they're a hive mind.

179
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,541
Well, yeah. It's what
teamplay's all about.

180
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,708
Every member's in tune
with each other.

181
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,208
And they don't eat ramen
in the middle of a match!

182
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,125
[ANNIE]
Where's the chee-burg bastard?

183
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,333
He'd better crawl out from
whatever rock he's under

184
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,125
before our match starts.

185
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,875
Or else I'm telling
Mr. Keith on you.

186
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,333
Heh.

187
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,250
[JEAN]
Uh! Uh... Well, that's it.

188
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,750
There's no way
around it anymore.

189
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,250
We're gonna be
five-star Titan chow.

190
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,666
Ugh! Come on, Eren!

191
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,416
Help us out here!
Wake up already!

192
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,041
[EREN]
Crap!

193
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,250
[HANNES]
Lunchtime! Eat up, kids!

194
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,125
Hey, Annie?

195
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,875
I was wondering if you'd
mind me asking something.

196
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,458
Are you really that
into mozuku seaweed?

197
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,500
[ANNIE gasps]
Why does she want to know?

198
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,708
Is she baiting me into
admitting the truth?

199
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,500
Uh. Yeah.

200
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,375
Love it.

201
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,000
I was hoping you'd say that!

202
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,000
I have some for lunch today,
but I think it's gross.

203
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,041
I was sort of thinking
maybe you'd take it

204
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,791
so it wouldn't go
to waste, you know?

205
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,625
For a second there, I thought...

206
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,750
You know, what? Sure.

207
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,416
[STUDENTS]
Annie.

208
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,125
While you're at it, would
you mind eating my mozuku?

209
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,291
Mine, too, please?

210
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,416
--[THOMAS] And mine!
--[MINA] Same here!

211
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,958
[BERTHOLDT]
I hate the stuff, so...

212
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:23,125
What's wrong with you people?!
Seaweed tastes good!

213
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,875
[JEAN]
We're in big trouble.

214
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,125
S'only a matter of time before
we're eaten. Trust me.

215
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,375
[sighs] Why couldn't I have
done more with my life?

216
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,375
If I'd known it was just gonna
end up like this I would've--

217
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,958
[ARMIN]
I've got a plan!

218
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:37,500
[JEAN]
Uh...

219
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,583
Dead ringer!

220
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,208
It's too perfect!

221
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,083
[JEAN] You're out of your minds!
I don't look anything like Eren!

222
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,083
Uh, actually, your
physiques are similar.

223
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,666
You both have the
face and shifty eyes

224
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,000
of your classic bad guy.

225
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,583
Say that again!

226
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,375
I think the two of you look so
much alike it might even manage

227
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,416
to pull Mikasa out of
her weird little funk!

228
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,416
It won't. I can't
feel his spirit.

229
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,166
[ALL groan]

230
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,416
Huh. Okay.

231
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,375
That doesn't sound like
a crazy person at all.

232
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,625
[ANNIE]
Pardon the intrusion.

[ALL gasp]

234
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,541
[ANNIE] It's almost time for us
to get this match under way.

235
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,166
Chee-burg bastard
better be here.

236
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,000
[SASHA] Don't you worry about
that! Eren's right here.

237
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,750
Wait a second,
something isn't right.

238
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,083
When did you get horse-faced?

239
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,916
[JEAN whimpers]

240
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,791
What's your favorite thing
to eat for lunch?

241
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,208
[JEAN]
Hm? Om-nom?

242
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:17,750
[ARMIN]
Dang it!

243
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,125
Uh! Oh, hell!

244
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,041

Sorry, guys! I overslept!

247
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,750
Cuttin' it kinda close there!

00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,791

Get out of my way!

249
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:28,500

Mikasa!

251
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,208
Now that I'm here,
everything's gonna be--

252
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,125
Tardiness is a very bad habit.

253
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,291
[EREN]
Yes, ma'am.

254
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,500
Glad you decided to
show up, Chee-burg.

255
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,750
Prepare yourself to
be squashed flat!

256
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,083
Bring it on, Annie!

257
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,875
This team's not afraid of you!

258
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,833
Time for the
championship match!

259
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:46,875
Right!

260
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,125
Class 4, Team A will
go head-to-head

261
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,541
with Class 4, Team B!
So, is everybody ready?

262
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,333
And begin!

263
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,708
[REINER]
Got it!

264
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,375
Annie?!

265
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,708
[EREN] Leave it to me,
everybody. This one's mine!

266
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,166
[EREN yells]

267
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,458
Ugh. Seriously?

[gasps]

269
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,083
[HANNES]
Eren is safe!

270
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,333
Wow, she's so agile!

271
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,791
Yeah. Quite the
difference, huh?

272
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,791
Glad Eren showed up.

273
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,250
I'm just gettin' started!

274

[ARMIN yelps]

275

Safe!

This time...! [groans]

277
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,166
[HANNES]
Safe again!

278
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,875
[MIKASA] Whoever comes
at Eren, deals with me.

279
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,375
I don't care what they
try to throw at us.

280
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,916
[HANNES]
Eren's safe.

[HANNES]
Yep. Safe.

284
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,416
[HANNES]
Still safe.

285
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,250
He's getting blasted,
but he can't get out.

286
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,041
Mikasa's catching the rebounds.

287
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,833
Whoa. This is painful.

288
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:41,708
Ow.

They're the only three
left in the game!

293
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,750
I'm about to end
this in one throw!

294
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,250

Let's see what you've got.

Wow. That was some
serious skill.

298
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,541
It's a special technique.

299
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,791
If you want, I'd be
happy to teach you.

300
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,500
[EREN]
No thanks. Dodgeball hurts.

301
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,500
Are you kidding?

302
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,875
Stop trying to be
so damn modest.

Hey, Annie.

00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,333
I wanna learn your technique.

306
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,416
Teach me.

307
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,750
[ANNIE]
I'm not so sure about that.

308
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,958
Whole thing only works
with human beings.

309
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,958
Uh, oh. Epic match alert.

Hell yeah!

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,791
Double or nothin' Mikasa
kicks Annie's butt!

312
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,791
I bet my strawberries!

313
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,291
Cool. I bet herring.

314
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,541
And I'll bet my meatballs.

315
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,750
I'm in.

316
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,625
Let's do it.

[MIKASA]
Eren!

322
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,041
Annie. Why do you
hate me so much?

323
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,166
It's not like I've ever
done anything to you.

324
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,500
Heh. You really wanna know?

325
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,916
[ANNIE sighs]
Pay attention,

326
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,083
'cause I'm only gonna
say this once.

327
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,625
At the entrance ceremony,

328
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,416
you told everyone you loved
Cheese Hamburg Steak.

329
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,125
Without even realizing it, you
basically stole my thunder.

330
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,916
It was my favorite first!

331
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,291
I should've been the
one to blurt it out!

332
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,833
So naturally I hate
your Chee-burg guts!

333
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't understand.

334
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,541
Couldn't you have
just said, "Me, too?"

335
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,458
[gasps]

336
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,625
Uh?

337
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,041
Look, I'm really sorry.

338
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,291
When you get right
down to it, though,

339
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,041
we have something in common.

340
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,416
[ANNIE]
I suppose we do.

341
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,041
That's sweet. Yay, friends!

342
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,166
Huh?

343
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:58,791
[REINER]
Mm-hm.

344
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,041
Huh?!

345
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,750
This is some BS.

346
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,000
[HANNES grunting]
Wait, what's going on?

347
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,750
I get it now! Dodgeball!

348
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,958
I totally just tagged her
out, right? Huh? Huh?

349
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:21,958
[whistle blows]

350
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,291
[HANNES]
Technically, yes.

351
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,833
Game over. Congratulations.

352
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,375
[MIKASA, EREN, ARMIN]
Let's dig in!

353
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,958
All right! My fav!

354
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,500
This isn't happening!

355
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,750
That was my chee-burg
for the day!

356
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,416
[MIKASA]
No three-second rule.

357

[EREN gasps]

358
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,916
[ANNIE]
Mind if I join you guys?

359
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,375
Hey! Sure, no problem!

360
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,500
[ANNIE sighs]
Is that..?

361
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,083
Yeah...

362
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:55,041
It was gonna be the best part of
my whole lunch, except now...

363
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,000
We'll share.

364
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,333
Uh! No way! Really?

365
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,875
Thank you!

366
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,166
Best Chee-burg ever!

367
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,791
That was super nice of you!

368
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,208
Meh. Whatever.

369
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,541
In return, though.

370
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,458
Let's agree to, uh, forget
what I tried to pull--

371
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,750
Eat this.

372
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,416
You're not getting enough
fish in your diet.

373
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,000
[EREN]
Mikasa, stop it!

374
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,041
I'm not your little brother and
I'm not some snot-nosed toddler!

375
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,208
[MIKASA]
Eat it!

376
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,833
I'm not about to let you
get malnourished!

377
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,625
[ANNIE]
Here. Have another one.

378
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,416
[EREN]
No joke?

379
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,625
[MIKASA]
Hey!

380
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,416
Not until you eat some
of your vegetables!

381
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,333
You can't survive on
Cheese Hamburg...

382
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,458
Quite the one-eighty.

383
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,875
I smell a Love Triangle!

384
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,291
[ARMIN]
Wall Cleanup Club.

385
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,583
Eren and the others show
up for their first day

386
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,083
not knowing what to expect.

387
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,875
In truth, nothing could've
prepared them.

388
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,625
At first, they thought their job
would be a normal one.

389
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,875
Then they showed up.
