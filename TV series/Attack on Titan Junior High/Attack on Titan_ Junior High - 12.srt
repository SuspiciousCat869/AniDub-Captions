00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:21,333
[EREN whimpering]
Damn it!

2
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,791
[ARMIN] And just like that,
everything changed.

3
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:29,500
At that terrible moment,
in our hearts, we knew.

4
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,541
Junior High was a pen.

5
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,083
The students, cattle.

6
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,958
[EREN growls]

7
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:40,333
Damn you, Titans!

8
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,791
You okay?

9
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,583
This isn't over.

10
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,250
I'm going to the
Titans' building

11
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,875
to get our cheeseburgers back!

12
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:20,708
[ARMIN gasps]

13
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,875
[MIKASA exhales]

14
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,833
How exactly you s'posed
to pull that off?

15
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:24,875
Me too--!

16
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:25,958
[NILE]
Are you out of your minds?!

17
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,208
Get inside! Immediately!

18
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,625
What?! So the school
just turns a blind eye

19
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,208
and pretends like
nothing's wrong?

20
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,666
Am I correct to assume
you're Eren Jaeger?

21
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,166
According to my records, you
pledged to follow the rules

22
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,666
of this institution,
or don't you recall?

23
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,666
I'm not about to just stand
here and let those monsters--!

24
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,875
[WOERMAN] Quiet! Either
you'll do as you're told,

25
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,166
or we'll kick you out!

26
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,000
Ugh! Go back to class--

27
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,125
[YMIR]
Whoopsie!

28
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,208
What the--?! That's in...

00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:50,916
[groans]

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Guys! Stop it!

31
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,375
What're you doing?

32
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,750
No! Wait! They'll throw
the book at you!

33
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:56,916
[WOERMAN gasping]

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,875
You little delinquents!
As of this moment,

35
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:03,416
you've all jointly committed an
offence punishable by detention!

36
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,958
Make a run for it, Eren.

37
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,291
I owe you one. Thanks!

38
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,000
[ALL gasp]

[EREN panting]

40
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,666
[MIKASA] What've I told you?
Where you go, I go.

41
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,875
[ARMIN]
Same with me!

42
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,166
[JEAN] Joined the party.
Ugh, this is stupid.

43
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,666
More like scary!
I just wanna go home!

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,833
[CONNY] Eh, it's no big deal.
What the hell, right?

45
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:20,916
[EREN]
You guys!

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,875
[MIKASA]
Yeah, yeah. So what's the plan?

47
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,208
I say we head for
the Scouts' clubroom.

48
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,916
The upperclassmen will know
what to do, I'm positive!

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,208
[NILE] Damn it!
You come back this instant!

50
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,791
[KEITH] Grisha. Today
should bring you pride.

51
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,708
Your son is a warrior!

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,583
Bad news! The Titan's raided--!

53
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,333
You don't have to shriek, moron.

54
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,958
We saw the whole thing
for ourselves.

55
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,333
[EREN]
Good!

56
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,875
So the Scout Regiment
plans to retaliate, right?!

57
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,291
For now we're on standby.

58
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,500
[EREN]
What?!

59
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,125
[LEVI] Whatever you
think it is we do here.

60
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,625
A big part of it
involves keeping

61
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,500
our gut reactions in check.

62
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,500
That's what keeps you safe.

63
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,708
Oh, come on!

64
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,083
Our only shot at getting
the chee-burgs back

65
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,291
is if we get off our butts!

66
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,250
[PETRA]
Eren! That's enough!

67
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,833
[EREN] We just sit around and
wait for this to blow over?!

68
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,750
We're gonna let the Titan's
do whatever they want

69
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:07,958
without even putting up a fight?

70
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,083
And if we do?

71
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,375
Now stop whining and
show some respect!

72
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,333
Why are we all ignoring
the obvious?!

73
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,583
Bullies count on us not doing
anything! Unless we--!

74
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:20,750
[ORUO] "Ask not the reason why.
Ask but to do and die!"

75
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,875
You'd understand what those
words mean i f you weren't

76
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,375
such a craven jack-a-napes!

77
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,625
[EREN growls]

78
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,958
I guess if the Scouts
made themselves known,

79
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,583
then they'd be disbanded.
Or even worse.

80
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,833
If we don't keep a low profile,
we might get expelled.

81
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,041
[EREN]
No.

82
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,291
I can do this without them.

83
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:40,166
It's time for me to stand
on my own two feet.

84
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,250
No, stop! Don't do it, Eren!

86
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,750

I wouldn't blame you.

00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,500
Do whatever you think best.

89
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,291
Truth is, I don't know which
is better. Never have.

90
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,083
Should I go with my gut?

91
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,500
Or put myself out there

92
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,666
and give my classmates
the benefit of the doubt?

93
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,833
There's no guarantee
either way. In the end...

94
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,541
...you choose what you choose.

95
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,916
If afterward your regrets
are minimal, great.

Just trust us.

I'd come back to this place.

Wow! You're awesome!
Wait, you...?

You're not gonna tell us to
stand down, or whatever?

Yeah, no,

123
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,416
the Titans helped themselves to
our kamameshi without asking.

It's now or never.

They need to learn not
to mess with humans!

Plus, it's good publicity.

Here's the deal.

Wait for an opening, then
move it. I'll distract them.

You gonna be okay?

133
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,875
Cut me some slack.

134
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,958
It's what I do.
"Janitor" is just a role.

Pay attention, Eren.

At the end of this hallway
is the principal's office.

143
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,833
There's a door in there
you'll need a key to unlock.

00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,625
That's where your

No question.

Okay. Right, let's go!

Somewhere in there
are our chee-burgs!

So, where's the key?

Yeah, or for that matter,
where's the door?

I say we check out the desk.

the Titans and win.

321
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,791
On the surface, this may have
been about cheeseburgers,

322
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,083
but on a deeper level
it's about hope.

323
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:25,041
Gentlemen. I believe we need
to reconsider the rules.

324
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,916
Perhaps even overhaul them.

325
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,666
We want the students
to be safe, of course,

326
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,333
but we also want
them to have fun.

327
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,833
This time, it's
our turn to attack!

328
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,000
[ALL]
Chee-burgs!

329
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,166
Chee-burgs!

330
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,375
Chee-burgs! Chee-burgs!

331
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,708
[EREN]
Yes!
