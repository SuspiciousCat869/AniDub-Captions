1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,458
[HANGE]
Attention!

2
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,791
I'd like to take this moment
to congratulate everyone

3
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:26,125
on their top-notch performances
in the recent Sports Day games.

4
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:29,000
And, thinking back to
what brought us there,

5
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,333
ruminate on the fact that
you kids picked a fight

6
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,125
with your upperclassmen.

7
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,708
All in the past now,

8
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,250
but in the interest of your
team-building skills,

9
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:41,125
we have a li'l event planned.
Something I call....

10
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,791
The Test of Courage!

11
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,833
[ALL]
Huh?!

12
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,625
[EREN]
Look at this place.

13
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,958
It's like after dark it goes
from being a normal school

14
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,625
to the set for a horror
movie or something.

15
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,208
[ARMIN whimpers]
I'm afraid of the dark.

16
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,750
I'm afraid of the dark.

17
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,916
You freak out way too easily.

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,333
[EREN whimpers]

19
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:39,166
What is it you think
you see there?

20
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,250
[ARMIN yelps]

21
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,875
[ERWIN]
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

22
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,541
[ARMIN, EREN, MIKASA gasp]

23
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,166
Hello. I'm Erwin Smith.

24
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,916
The Scout Regiment's
faculty advisor.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,250
[EREN] Uh. I thought this club
was supposed to be a secret.

26
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,250
[HANGE]
Oh yeah! This guy!

27
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,583
Actually, we have this
man's influence to thank

28
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,875
for giving us access to
the building after hours!

29
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,125
By "influence,"

30
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,791
we mean he had to slip
us the key in secret.

31
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,291
Enough with the formalities!

32
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,833
Let's get this party started!

33
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,291
Eren, Jean, Mikasa,
Conny and Armin

34
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,333
will begin at the stairs on
the right side of the school.

35
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,333
Ymir, Christa, Sasha,
Reiner and Bertholdt

36
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,041
will begin at the
stairs on the left!

37
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,125
[LEVI]
Right. The objective is simple.

38
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,625
This is a test of nerve.
You will visit the art,

39
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,583
music and science
rooms, in that order,

40
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,708
leaving your names written
on the chalkboard.

41
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,250
Pretty straightforward, 'less
you got the mind of a child.

42
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,833
Firsts Years are first and we
meet in the gym afterwards.

43
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,916
Anybody need clarification
on the rules?

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,041
Uh?! How come we have to go
before the upperclassmen?

45
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,000
Aw c'mon, man, don't
tell me you're scared?

46
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,083
Hey! Shut your face!

47
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,125
Unlike somebody,
I'm not just doin' this

48
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,041
so no one'll figure out
I'm a 'fraidy cat!

49
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,625
What a coincidence.
Neither am I.

50
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,166
Guess that's something we have
in common, huh? Whaddaya know?

51
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,541
I'm afraid of the dark,
I'm afraid of the dark.

52
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,125
If you're too scared, it's no
big deal for us to go first.

53
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:59,000
It's okay, Christa. Stay
close, I'll keep you safe.

54
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,500
I'm afraid of the dark,
I'm afraid of the dark.

55
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,000
[EREN]
Uh. All right, people!

56
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,041
Let's do this!

57
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,583
Quit waving the flashlight
around. Keep it steady!

58
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,375
[EREN]
It is steady, quit bein' a wuss.

59
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,458
[JEAN]
You're the wuss!

60
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,500
[EREN]
And you're a horse face!

61
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,375
[JEAN]
That's hurtful!

62
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,041
Huh Took 'em long enough, huh?

63
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,375
Don't most people put the fear
of ghosties and ghoulies

64
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,666
behind them once they
reach middle school...?

65
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,083
[ERWIN]
Okay, kids. This is it.

66
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,250
Commence the Attack Junior
High Scout Regiment's

67
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,833
customary initiation.

68
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,916
Let's welcome our new members
with the 57th Test of Courage.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,333
All units, forward!

70
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,083
[ALL]
Shhhhh!

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,791
[EREN]
Huh. Looks empty to me.

72
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,416
Ha! I'm gonna be the
first to write my name!

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,583
[JEAN]
The hell you will!

74
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,833
[groans]

75
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,041
[gasps] When were they here?!

76
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,458
[JEAN] At least my name will
be on here before yours!

77
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,166
[EREN]
I called dibs, you jerk!

78
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,666
Hey, while you're at it,
write my name up there, too.

79
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,500
[GIRL laughs]

80
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,875
[BOYS gasp]

81
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:01,958
[CONNY whimpers]

82
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,708
[ARMIN]
Please. D-Don't tell me. Oh god!

83
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,750
It's the Seven Wonders
of Attack Junior High,

84
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:10,750
Number One: "The
Laughing Mona Lisa!"

85
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,166
[BOYS scream]

86
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,875
[screaming continues]

87
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,875
You know, it's kinda weird.

88
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:23,708
What's up?

89
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,208
Girls, man.

90
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,958
I mean, why they gotta go to
the bathroom in big groups?

91
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,083
Beats me.

92
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,416
[REINER]
Huh?

93
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,041
[BERTHOLDT]
What's wrong? What d'you see?

94
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,083
[REINER]
Hm... Nah. Never mind.

95
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,333
[laughs]

96
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,625
[REINER]
Hm?

97
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,916
[CHRISTA]
Sorry that took so long.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,583
Hey. Doesn't one of
the Seven Wonders

99
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,583
have something to do
with the bathroom?

100
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,166
I remember! Third stall
door from the right.

101
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,333
They say if you knock on
it three times after dark,

102
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,750
Hanako will pop out
and drag you inside.

103
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,875
Um, don't test it, please.

104
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,208
Come on, nothin'll happen.

105
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,708
See? Just a story.

106
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,125
[FRIEDA]
Who is it?

107
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,708
[GIRLS scream]

108
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,125
[GIRLS screaming]

109
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,375
[YMIR]
Ah! Have no fear, my darling!

110
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,541
I'll protect you at any cost!

111
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,333
That's a promise! A vow!

112
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,375
When all this is over,
we'll get married!

113
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,500
Didn't know you felt that way.

114
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:37,416
[YMIR screams] Christa
transformed into Potato Girl!

115
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,916
What have you done with
my precious bride-to-be?!

116
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:46,208
[BOYS panting]

117
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,500
Our t-t-test of courage
isn't going so well.

118
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,250
[EREN] Wait, what is that
supposed to mean?

119
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,875
If you s-s-see all of
the Seven Wuh-wuh...

120
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,541
If, you see all Seven Wonders.

121
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,416
You'll b-b-basically
be c-cursed for life.

122
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,333
It's some seriously bad juju.

123
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,375
Wait, like bad enough to mess up
my popularity with the ladies?

124
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,250
Hold on a sec!

125
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,416
I think that might be the reason

126
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,666
I've been tanking on
all my tests lately!

127
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,833
[JEAN]
Yeah, sure.

128
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,458
Not 'cause you're
an idiot or anything.

129
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,208
[BOYS scream]

130
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,250
What the...?

131
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,666
It's the... the s-s-s-se...

132
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,333
It's the Seven Wonders of Attack
Junior High, Number Two.

133
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,333
Beethoven's 5th Symphony,
played by the ghost

134
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,916
of the composer himself.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,833

[EREN whimpers]

[MIKASA]
Eren! Uh?!

141
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,250
[ALL]
Please... don't go...

142
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,083
[MIKASA]
Eren, wait!

143
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,458
[EREN screams]

144
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,083
[MIKASA]
Eren!

145
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,750
[BERTHOLDT]
Hey, Reiner. Notice anything?

146
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:48,916
Like what?

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,291
[BERTHOLDT]
I dunno, man.

148
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,375
Like maybe how these stairs
seem to keep going up?

149
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,375
[REINER]
It's your imagination.

150
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,166
[EREN panting]

151
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,250
Way to go, Eren. Nice
job there. Gold star.

152
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,583
Just had to split
off from the group.

153
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,416
Uh?! Ah!

154
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,666
Oh, it's only me.

155
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,125
What the hell's a mirror
doing here, of all places?!

156
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,500
What the--?

157
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,083
[EREN] That wasn't real! My
mind's playing tricks on me!

158
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,791
I definitely did not see a
creepy girl with long black hair

159
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,958
floating by in the reflection!
It's all in my head!

160
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:23,916
[GIRL screams]

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,916
[EREN screams]

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,250
Uh? What's going on?!

163
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,333
[EREN groaning]

164
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,083
[footsteps]

165
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,041
[MIKASA]
Eren!

166
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,583
[EREN]
Ah! Oh, Mikasa, it's you.

167
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,791
[MIKASA]
What just happened?

168
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,041
[EREN]
Nothing!

169
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,041
I tripped and fell down
that stairs, that's all!

170
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,291
I, uh, definitely did not see a
creepy girl with long black hair

171
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,750
floating past me in the mirror!

172
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,916
[gasps] This isn't good!
You suh-suh-saw...

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,250
You saw the Seven Wonders
of Attack Junior High,

174
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,791
Number Three.
A cursed infinity mirror

175
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,958
hung in the staircase at
the second floor landing.

176
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,541
If you muh-muh-make
eye c-c-c-contact--

177
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,416
[MIKASA] If you make eye contact
with the ghost who haunts it.

178
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,916
[ARMIN]
Sh-sh-she'll d-d-d-dra...

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,083
[MIKASA]
She'll drag you in.

180
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,000
[CONNY] Anybody else
impressed that Mikasa knows

181
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,250
what Armin's trying to say?

182
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,875
[EREN screams]
I told you nothing happened!

183
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:10,666
I fell down the stairs!

184
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,250
[MIKASA]
Eren! Slow down!

185
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,000
[EREN] ...no creepy girl with
long black hair in the mirror!

186
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,000
And even if there was, I didn't
make eye contact!

187
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,916
[GIRL laughs]

188
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,833
I'm telling you. Something
just isn't right about this.

189
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,041
[REINER]
I don't see it.

190
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,541
[BERTHOLDT]
Seriously?

191
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,625
We've been climbing these
stairs for like thirty minutes.

192
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,416
[REINER]
It's your imagination.

193
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,708
[BERTHOLDT] You keep
saying that. I don't think so.

194
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,000
[REINER]
Trust me.

195
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,541
[YMIR]
Christa!

196
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,458
[SASHA] Stop running!
I don't want to be by myself!

197
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,541
[BERTHOLDT]
You're not tired yet?

198
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,916
[REINER]
Imagination.

199
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,500
[CHRISTA cries] Ymir! Sasha!
Where did you guys go?

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,916
[CHRISTA]
Ymir?

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,666
Whoa! What's wrong with you?!

202
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,125
[EREN] Doesn't look like
Reiner and the others

203
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,916
have been in here yet.

204
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,458
Kind of bizarre.

205
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,291
You'd think we would've
run into them by now.

206
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,041
Muh-maybe they fell
victim. To the...

207
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,458
[MIKASA] Maybe, Reiner
and the gang fell victim

208
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,333
to Wonders Number
Four and Five.

209
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,833
That's The Dancer as well
as a ghastly specter

210
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,000
known as Screaming Skeleton.

211
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,541
Cut it out.

212
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,083
You think I want the back
to be all stretchy?

213
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,541
Stop tuggin' on my shirt!

214
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,125
Hey! You're the one tuggin'
on my shirt, doofus head!

215
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,916
[BOTH gasp]

216
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,416

[ALL scream]

219
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,500
Gah! What in the hell's
wrong with this school?!

220
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,750
What're you talking about?!
I didn't see anything!!

221
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,541
So, uh, exactly how many
Wonders have we seen?

222
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,875
We're totally gonna be
cursed for life, aren't we?

223
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,041
Yeah. Wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh.

224
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,625
We're pretty much
done for, I'm afraid.

225
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,708
There's no hope for us.

226
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,458
[YMIR]
Christa! Christa!

227
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,583
[SASHA]
Will you please slow down?!

228
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,625
[JEAN] Why're Sasha
and Ymir on their own?

229
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,041
[BERTHOLDT]
See what I mean?

230
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,208
These stairs just keep going.

231
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,833
[REINER]
It's your imagination.

232
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,083
[BERTHOLDT]
Correct me if I'm wrong,

233
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,333
but this building only
has three floors, right?

234
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,583
There's no way we haven't gone
up several dozen by now.

235
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:19,750
[BERTHOLDT]
Huh?

236
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,750
[FRIEDA] Ah. So, you got
separated from you friends.

237
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,916
Yeah. I'm scared
and I'm all alone.

238
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,916
Uh? Now, now, you shouldn't
let your nose drip like that.

239
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,416
It's unbecoming of a lady.

240
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,416
You're too cute not to be a
lady. Here, blow into this.

241

[CHRISTA grunts]

Oh! There, you're
all better now.

243
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,250
A word of advice?

244
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,500
You, uh,

245
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,958
shouldn't walk around
by yourself at night.

246
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,125
Heh. Not unless you want to
end up like me, that is.

247
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,208
How come?
What's so bad about you?

248
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,291
You seem nice!

249
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,791
Yeah! As a matter of fact,

250
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,333
when I grow up, I think I
want to be exactly like you!

251
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:59,583
No! Don't say that!
Stay just as you are!

Oh, right!

258
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,708
This is my friend Ymir
I was telling you about.

00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,083
Uh?

Hey!

[CHRISTA]
Uh? Hi, guys!

262
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,125
[EREN] Uh... Where's
Reiner and Bertholdt?

263
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,125
Right. Be careful.

264
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,541
Something seems off.

265
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,958
[BERTHOLDT]
Yeah.

Now, now. Dry those tears, huh?

00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,416
But, I... You were...

269
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,625
C'mon! Let's go!

270
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,875

We finally made it.

I don't see anything!

Not the Mona Lisa,
not Beethoven,

286
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,541
not the Screaming Skeleton.

287
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,083
In fact, nothing out of
the ordinary at all!

288

You can hear them, right?!

What are you talking about?

290
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,833
I don't hear anyone moaning or
chanting "you're all doomed"

00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,375
or you practice black magic.

317
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,083
And whoever you got to
play the Lady in White

318
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,250
was totally on point!

319
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,000
I had a feeling this
was a prank! Ha, ha.

320
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,750
Lady in White? What are
you babbling about?

321
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,541
Sorry, sweetie. Wasn't us.

322
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,958
[EREN]
Uh?

323
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,500
No. You saw The Seven Wonders
of Attack Junior High,

324
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,125
Number Seven.

325
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,875
They say long ago, on a
night light tonight,

326
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,875
a young girl disappeared
during the Test of Courage.

327
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,875
Condemned now to
wander the halls

328
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,416
not even realizing
she's a ghost.

329
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
What is it you think you saw?

330
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,458
Ah! I keep telling you!
I didn't see anything!

331
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,250
[screams]

332
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,541
[EREN] Damn it, Mikasa!
Why'd you do that?!

333
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,625
[MIKASA]
Mosquito.

334
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,791
[EREN]
Overkill!

335
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:08,833
[ARMIN] All he wants is to be
side by side with his love.

336
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,000
Put up to it by Reiner
and the others,

337
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,541
Bertholdt takes his secret
crush to the next level

338
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,875
and asks Annie out to
the Summer Festival.
