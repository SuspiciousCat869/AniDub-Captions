[JEAN]
Hey, Marco.

00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,083
You don't mind if I stop by
your place after school, do ya?

4
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,708
[MARCO]
Sure. That's cool.

00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,458
Hey guys. How you doin'?

[SASHA, CONNY]
Hm?

00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,708
It's not every day we see the
two of you walk home together.

8
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,583
[SASHA] Conny just told me about
this great ramen joint he found!

9
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:38,000
The thought of all that noodle-y
goodness makes we wanna drool!

10
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,541
[CONNY]
You're already drooling.

11
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,291
[SASHA] What's the hold up?
C'mon, let's go!

Yeah!

Oh, Hanna!

Hey guys. What's up?

Why do you two gotta
be all over each other?

17
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,333
It's kinda gross.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

This isn't what it
looks like, I swear!

let's get out of here, Franz.

Huh?

If you insist on worrying,

26
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,333
worry about how
long your hair is.

27
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,416
It's gonna catch up with you
in a bad way on the ODM gear.

Mikasa, stop it!
I'm bein' serious!

I'm not your little brother and
I'm not some snot-nosed toddler!

know who sent this?

There's no signature.

consider the possibly

What about Ymir?

did write this letter.

That wouldn't be so bad.

My darling Christa, I'm sorry.

be different.

Ah! What the hell am
I supposed to do?!

I'd ask what's wrong,
but I don't want to know.

Scared...

Get ahold of yourself, man.

your own stupid fantasy world.

You're breathing's off
and you look terrible.

147
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,333
Possibly symptoms of an
overactive imagination.

148

up the wrong tree?

What if... What if it's Mikasa?

150
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,500
No. Remember what they say

about something that looks
too good to be true.

have a li'l heart-to-heart.

00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,750
That would be between
me and Jean.

161
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,083
[MIKASA]
I'll relay the message to him

162
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,125
after he snaps out
of whatever this is.

163
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,083
[ANNIE] Appreciate it,
but if it's all the same,

164
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,416
I'd rather tell him myself.

165
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,250
[MIKASA] Trust me, it isn't
that big of a deal.

166
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,583
Not really the point.
So, no thank you.

167
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,666
Seems kinda crowded in here.

168
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,333
Makes moving around a bit hard.

169
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,000
We don't want to make
a mess, do we?

170
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,708
Huh. Funny thing about that.

171
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,708
Suddenly, it looks like
there's a lot more room.

172
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,875
Lucky us. What are
the chances, right?

173
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,000
Here we go. Dream match!

174
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,791
Why do girls have
to be so terrifying?

175
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,041
[JEAN]
Oh, wow.

176
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,416
Exactly how many girls
want a piece of this?

177
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,916
Am I a home-wrecker now?

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,541
--[EREN] Um, what's happening?
--[MIKASA] Enough gabbing.

179
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,208
This conversation's
getting on my nerves.

180
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,458
[ANNIE]
Mine too.

181
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,416
Ladies, be civil! No point
fighting over me.

182
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,583
There's enough Jean for every--

183
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,541
[JEAN groaning]

184
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,416

[JEAN grunting]

186
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:07,000
[JEAN] This... this is...
the same kind of envelope...

187
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,583
my love letter came in!

188
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,291
[JEAN groaning]

189
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,666
[ANNIE growls]

190
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,166
[JEAN gasping]

191
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,541
[KEITH]
Question one...

192
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,416
[JEAN] Okay. I'd really like
to know what's going on.

193
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,208
[KEITH] You've just brought
down five of them.

194
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,250
How many Titans
are left? Jaeger?

195
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,125
[EREN] None, sir!
I've driven them all out!

196
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,208
[JEAN]
Could it really be...?

197
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,416
[KEITH]
Go stand in the hallway.

198
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:33,750
[EREN]
I know, right?

199
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,208
Found it at the train station.

200
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,041
[ARMIN] You'd think
whoever misplaced it...

201
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,833
[JEAN] Can Annie really be the
one who wrote me the letter?

202
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,666
If I say something, will
you promise not to get mad?

203
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,833
You, look, you're just not
that popular with the girls.

204
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,708
I think you need to
be more realistic.

205
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:48,791
Shut your face!

206
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,500
[EREN]
Hm?

207
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,583
[MARCO, JEAN]
Uh?

208
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,458
[EREN]
What does she think she's doing?

209
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:54,625
[EREN]
Annie!

210
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,875
[gasps]

211
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,291
Um, that's totally
your shoe locker.

212
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,125
[ARMIN]
She has the crush?

213
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,833
I wouldn't have
put money on that.

214
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,875
Now that I think about it...

215
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,291
Uh. My favorite thing
to eat for lunch?

216
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,958
Bring it on!

217
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,916
Back off! He's mine,
do you hear?

218
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,666
You can't have him!

219
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,208
[JEAN laughing]

220
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,583
Okay.

221
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,333
Clearly he doesn't remember
how it all went down.

222
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,166
[JEAN]
Uh! The letter!

223
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,708
[ANNIE] "Please come to
Attack park after school."

224
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:33,375
[JEAN gasping]

225

[STUDENTS gasp]

226
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:42,875
[JEAN]
This is it! My day has come!

227
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,333
Starting now. I'm a somebody!

228
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,583
Ah, ha!

229
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,833
Woo-hoo! I'm coming Annie!

230
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,833
[EREN]
He seems to be taking it well.

231
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,958
[ARMIN] Yeah. Guess this makes
him kind of a big deal.

232
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:54,708
[ANNIE]
Guys.

233
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,916
[ALL]
Uh?

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,333
[ARMIN] Annie? Shouldn't
you be in the park?

235
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,625
Actually, I was gonna try to
pick your brains this morning.

236
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,541
I need some advice about...

237
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,875
Well, about these
stupid letters.

238
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,291
[ALL]
Huh...?

239
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,625
[ANNIE]
Been here long?

240
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,208
[JEAN]
Uh, hey Annie!

241
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,416
I mean, I sorta figured
it had to be you.

242
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,458
Oh, yeah? Cool.

243
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,791
No offense, but...

244
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,208
You do a pretty good job
hiding your romantic side.

245
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,958
This seems out of character.

246
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,875
Well, everybody's got their
little secrets, right?

247
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,500
[JEAN] What do you say we cut
to the chase? I'm a catch.

248
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,458
Heh. But if you're so into me...

249
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,458
Aw, what the hell. I can see
the two of us goin' out.

250
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,583
Why not?

251
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,666
Yeah. Sure, that'd work for me.

252
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,750
S'pose you're the
lucky one. I mean, well,

253
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,291
I could have my pick,

254
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,125
but since you were the brave
one who stepped up first then--

[JEAN gasps]

256
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,541

I'm not prepared for this!

00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,541
Jerk.

260
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,666
I was trying to be nice, but oh
no, you had to go and be you.

261
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,125
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

262
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,041
Eren and the gang
told me to wait,

263
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,291
said I should come here

264
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,333
and see how you reacted
before I broke the news.

265
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,708
[JEAN]
Bastards!

266
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,708
[ANNIE] I'm not your secret
admirer, my friend is.

267
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,750
But. I saw you.

268
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,500
Hang tight. I'll call
her out for you.

Whoa. What was that all about?

272
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,000
[JEAN gasping]

273
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,041
Huh?

274
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,416
[ALL]
Uh! Titan incoming!

275
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,291
Uh, could someone tell me
what's going on, please?

276
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,916
[ANNIE] This is who
the letters are from.

277
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,708
All I did was write them for her

278
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,041
and slip them in your
locker between classes.

279
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,000
[JEAN]
Wh-What?!

280
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,416
[EREN]
Hold on a second!

281
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,166
Why are you friends with a
Titan in the first place?!

282
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,583
We're in the same cram school.

283
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,208
[ALL]
That's some cram school!

284
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,083
[ARMIN] So you understand
the Titan language?

285
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,666
That's what I study
in cram school.

286

That's some cram school!

287
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,166
Anyway, she's cute,

288
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,333
but she's way too shy
to make the first move.

289
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,208
So... Go out with her.

290
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:17,000

Don't be like that.

294

[ANNIE]
You're a jerk.

295
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,750
The two of you already
have a history,

296
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,958

real. Why did my first ever love

00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,250
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening!

318
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,625
Wait, wait. That's not a Titan.

319
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,791
[ALL]
Uh?

320
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,291
What are you trying
to say there, Jean?

321
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,000
Maybe the shock was enough
to make him lose his marbles--

322
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,500
[JEAN] She's clearly a
regular human being.

323
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,208
See? If she was a Titan,
she'd be taller than me!

324
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,250
Dude, she's a dozen
of you, easy!

325
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,416
[JEAN screams]

326
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,958
[ARMIN whimpers]

327
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:41,041
And we can totally hold
each other's' hands!

328
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,416
Come on, honey!

329
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,250
Jean! Get ahold of yourself!

330
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,375
You can't let this
be how you die!

331
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,791
You've got to face reality for
once in your life! Please!

332
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,250
[gasps] Wait, I've been
living in fantasy world

333
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,041
this whole time, haven't I?

334
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,541
[JEAN] Deep down.
I knew what this was.

335
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,541
Look at her!

336
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:09,125
I can't date that.
It'd never work.

337
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,875
She's taller than I am!

338
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,416
[ALL]
Jean!

339
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,208
[FEMALE TITAN A grunts]

340
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,083
[FEMALE TITAN A cries]

341
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,250
[ANNIE]
She says she's not giving up.

342
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,791
Hey, are you all right?

343
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,125
Wow. No lie,

344
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,208
I'm starting to feel sorta
sorry for the poor guy.

345
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,416
Tell you what, I'm gonna
give him a break,

346
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,333
let him feel popular.

347
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,666
Hi! I'm Daikon!

348
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,375
Y'know, I'm in season!

349
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,250
You should nibble me
while I'm at my peak!

350
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,916
Ew! Why would you do that?

351
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,375
Curry buns are much tastier,
if I say so myself.

352
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,125
Eat up! We were made
for each other!

353
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,541
Wretched bread!

354
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,875
[EREN]
Okay...

355
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,833
[ARMIN] Not sure a making
a radish and a curry bun

356
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,750
fight over him is the answer.

357
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,458
[SASHA]
Am not! Am too!

358
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,291
[SASHA] Grate me!
Grate me! I'm yours!

359
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,958
Eat me! You know
you want to!

360
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,416
Oh, Jean!

361
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,791
[JEAN laughs] Settle down
there, ladies! No fighting.

362
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,916
Ha, ha! I have the
perfect solution!

363
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,833
You can both be my girlfriends!

364
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,500
And, I do believe my
work here is complete.

365
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,333
Let's go home.

366
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,875
All right.

367
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,000
Cram school's just
about to start.

368
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,000
[JEAN]
Jean, my love for...

369
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,583
[CONNY]
Come on, Marco! Let's go!

370
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,916
[MARCO]
You guys go on.

371
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,625
I'm gonna wait for Jean to
come back down to Earth.

372
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,041
[ARMIN] There are rules that
every student has to follow.

373
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,541
When the gap between
upperclassmen and lower

374
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,750
yawns wider than ever before.

375
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,083
Eren and the gang have to battle
it out with their superiors.

376
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,958
Including Levi.
