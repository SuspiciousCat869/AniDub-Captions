00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,541
[ILSE]
My name is Ilse Langnar.

2
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:25,208
Today, after school, I witnessed
the Student Council president

3
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,166
doing something terrible.

4
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,250
First and foremost
a journalist,

5
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,875
I'm racing toward the Newspaper
Club's HQ as I write this!

6
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,166
The wrongdoer must be exposed!

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,333
I will not yield.
I will not yield!

8
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,875
[ILSE gasps]

9
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,708
[ILSE screams]

10
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,208
[HANGE]
Sawney!

11
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,416
What have I told you
about wondering off?

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,833
[LEVI]
Can we go back inside now?

13
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,333
Hey, what'cha got
there, captain?

14
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:02,333
Huh. Looks like Ilse
Langnar's battle record?

15
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,708
[HANGE] Well, it's only courtesy
for Sawney to return it.

16
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,333
[ILSE screams]

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,375
[BOY STUDENT A] The school
newspaper's got balls!

18
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,875
[STUDENT B] They sure put the
student council up a creek!

19
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,041
We have to hold elections for a
new student council president?

20
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,000
[JEAN]
Heh.

21
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,250
[ALL chattering]

22
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,125
[SASHA] I can't believe
you're serious, Jean.

23
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,166
So, you're really gonna to run?

24
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,750
Uh, yeah. Sure! Why not?

25
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,083
What the hell else you think my
achievements have been building

26
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,166
to this whole time?
Am I right, Marco?

27
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,875
Ah, sure'd be nice for all
the hard work to pay off.

28
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,750
Such an honor to serve
your classmates.

29
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,083
[JEAN]
Come on, man! Drop the act.

30
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,166
We're not in elementary
school anymore.

31
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,125
Please. Politics are how
you get the womenfolk

32
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,708
to stand up and take notice.

33
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,875
But that, that's not
what I'm all about.

34
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,375
Once I've become president,

35
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,458
the ladies will fall all over
themselves to get with me!

36
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,708
Plus, I'll be livin' easy
'cause there ain't squat to do!

37
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:21,916
[laughing]

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,583
Wait. We talkin' student
council president?

39
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,333
If I'm elected,
the Titans will pay!

40
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,416
I'd be in a position to drive
every last one of them out!

41
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,333
[REINER]
Sorry, my bad!

42
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,375
What? Say that again freak!

43
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,625
Or don't bother to

44
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,500
'cause it's obvious I'm
the one the people want!

45
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, dream on, pal!

46
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,625
Nobody gives a crap
whether or not you

47
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,833
get to live the easy life!

48
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,500
[REINER]
Sorry! My bad again!

49
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,166
I've had enough of you.

50
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,041
[EREN yells]

51
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:48,666
[JEAN grunts]

52
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,125
[JEAN, EREN groan]

53
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,166
[EREN]
Oh, gimme a break...

54
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,541
[JEAN]
Yeah, that's what I thought!

55
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,083
Let Mikasa save your butt!

56
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,041
She's sure isn't gonna
win you the election!

57
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,375
[MARCO] Wow. Didn't realize he
was this interested in politics.

58
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,500
When I win, I'll
get my own Mikasa!

59
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,125
[MARCO laughs]

60
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,958
[MARLO]
Dammit. This is crazy.

61
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,291
To think the council was betting
on beetle sumo wrestling.

62
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,541
[HITCH]
I guess the corruption

63
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,291
ran deeper than any of
us dared to imagine.

64
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,666
I mean, that is why I joined
in the first place.

65
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,375
I just didn't know scandals
would be so much work.

66
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,458
I joined because I wanted to
reform the system from within.

67
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,250
Oh, you're that guy.
Well good on you, Marlo.

68
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,333
Bravo. Want me to recommend you?

69
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,916
I didn't say that to get
your nomination, Hitch!

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,208
Yo, feel free to chime in.

71
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,666
Ew, gross! She sleeps so weird!

72
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,041
I'm Jean, and I nominate me!

73
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,041
[MARLO, HITCH]
We've got a live one here.

74
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,208
[HITCH] I need your
signature first.

75
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,833
[JEAN]
Oh, I see how it is.

76
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,541
Already want my autograph, huh?

77
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,708
[HITCH]
Huh?

78
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,458
So, when you look at
me you see a winner?

79
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,375
[HITCH groans]

80
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,750
I'll tell you what, sweetheart.

81
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll go one better and give
you my email address--

82
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,708
You have the face of a horse!

83
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,333
[EREN]
Uh. Hey, Marco. Where's Jean?

84
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,500
Oh, uh. He had to stop
by the nurse's office.

85
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,083
I'm on the way to grab
his campaign posters.

86
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,208
Huh? We need campaign posters?

87
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,541
Don't worry! I've got this!
We can make some at my place!

88
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,666
[EREN]
What are we waiting for?!

89
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,166
Thanks, Marco!

90
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,250
[ARMIN]
Why don't we try this layout?

91
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,916
[EREN] That's fantastic!
You're a total pro!

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,416
Ha, ha. It's not that hard,
really. Matter of fact,

93
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,375
heh, if you're game, I can make
some tweaks to your face.

94
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,333
Awesome! Do what you
gotta do, man.

95
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,833
Just make me look cool!

96
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,250
[ARMIN] No problem.
We'll move these here.

97
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,208
[EREN] Perfect! And... maybe
do something about that?

98
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,416
[ARMIN]
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

99
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,291
[EREN] Oh! And make
that part really pop!

100
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,125
I'm talkin' like,
you know, buh-bam!

101
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,208
[ARMIN]
Sure.

102
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,458
[EREN]
Yeah-ah! Now we got a poster!

103
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,791
Okay.

104
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,666
You're, uh, gonna put up
that where people can see?

105
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,583
Well, sure! I wanna
get elected, right?

106
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,875
You think it's awesome?
Be honest.

107
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,291
[ARMIN]
Mikasa. Please.

108
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,791
Tell him how you really feel!

109
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,041
[MIKASA]
Uh. I think it's fine.

110
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,958
[ARMIN screams]

111
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,375
[EREN] I'm gonna tell
everyone you designed it!

112
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,250
Oh, you don't
need to do that.

113
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,500
You don't even need
to put 'em up.

114
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,791
Are you kidding?!
These make me a shoo-in!

115
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,166
[MARCO]
Hey, Eren.

116
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,250
[EREN]
Marco!

117
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,416
Guess you guys got
your signage made.

118
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,708
[BOTH]
Copy cat! Mine go up first!

119
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,083
Whoa!

120
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,666
What the hell?!

121
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,833
[ORUO]
Oh, that's cute.

122
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,833
You're still trying
to distribute media.

123
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:18,833
[EREN]
Of course, but..!

124
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,750
Don't tell me you're running!

125
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,833
[ORUO]
Naturally.

126
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,916
[JEAN]
That looks nothing like you!

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,500
[ORUO] You're wasting time,
boys. Peddle elsewhere.

128
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,708
[JEAN, EREN]
Huh?

129
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,625
This bulletin board
has all it can handle

130
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,333
advertising yours truly.

131
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,375
The others are already
filled up, too, I'm afraid.

132
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:38,291
There's nary a free space
on campus! Sorry!

133
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,458
[EREN growls]
Then what do we do?

134
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,541
[ORUO] Hm. And here I thought
you wanted to be president.

135
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,250
Figure it out.

136
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:44,958
[JEAN, EREN]
Got it!

137
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,166
[ORUO]
Hm?

138
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:46,958
[EREN, JEAN]
We'll just put 'em over yours!

139
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,375
[ORUO]
Over my dead bo--!

140
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,916
[ARMIN] The results of
the opinion poll are in!

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,166
[EREN]
What?! Oh, come on!

142
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,666
Zero percent's quite an
accomplishment in its own way.

143
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,083
[HANGE] First time I've seen
someone poll so badly.

144
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,291
[EREN growls]
Don't even--!

145
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,500
Hange!

146
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,500
Hey. Stop making so damn
much noise out here.

147
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,083
Ugh!

148
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,208
There has to be some way to turn
this thing around in my favor.

149
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:08,958
[HANGE]
Possibly.

150
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,083
[JEAN, EREN]
Huh?

151
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,333
Yeah. The reporter
who broke the story

152
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,958
on the student council
brouhaha is named Ilse.

153
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,458
You should try talking to her.

154
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,958
She keeps a notebook.

155
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,208
Rumor has it
there's some pretty

156
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,416
down-and-dirty stuff in
there about this school.

157
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,791
And it really exists?

158
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,791
Has anybody ever
actually seen it?

159
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,541
You have, right chief?

160
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,666
Yeah. And it covers
everything: The dirt.

161
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,375
The grime.

162
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,333
The nitty-gritty.

163
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,583
I'd kill to have it.

164
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,541
So if I was to get
my hands this thing,

165
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,500
I'd have a pretty baller
political weapon, huh?

166
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:36,750
[LEVI]
You could say that.

167
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,833
[JEAN] Heh. Marco!
To the Newspaper Club!

168
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:40,875
[MARCO]
What? Wait a minute!

169
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,541
I don't think so! Hey!

170
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,041
You're not gonna get
the drop on me!

171
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,875
[REINER] Move it, Bertholdt!
That's notebook's ours!

172
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,000
[BERTHOLDT]
It is?

173
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,083
No running in the
hallway, dumbasses!

174
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,000
[RICO] And if I am elected as
your student council president,

175
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,666
I promise you
right here and now.

176
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,416
The wall will shine
like a new gold coin!

177
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,833
[ILSE]
Rico Brzenska.

178
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,250
Platform: to increase spending
on Wall Cleanup efforts,

179
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,791
to reinstate the draft.

180
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,958
Promote greater awareness
of custodial duties.

181
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:03,833
[JEAN]
There she is!

182
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,208
[ILSE]
Hm? Two more candidates.

183
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,458
Eren Jaeger and Jean Kirschtein!

184
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,791
[JEAN] Hand over your
weapon immediately!

185
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:14,208
Wait, my, my what? Huh?

186
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,791
The magical notebook
belongs to me!

187
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,333
Wha-what in the
world's going on?

188
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,625
[JEAN]
Gimme gimme gimme gimme!

189
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,791
[REINER] I'm gonna be
student council president!

190
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:26,708
[IAN, RICO]
Uh.

191
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,833
[EREN, JEAN]
Hold it!

192
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,083
Argh! What is the issue
with these people?!

193
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,500
[JEAN]
I'll never catch her like this!

194
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,250
The presidency is mine!

195
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,708
[ILSE panting]

196
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,541
[ILSE]
My name is Ilse Langnar.

197
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,208
While on a routine
fact-finding mission,

198
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,541
several candidates
for the office

199
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,333
of student council president
started chasing me.

200
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,750
My future seems dubious.

201
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,083
However, if I can manage to
reach the Newspaper Club's HQ,

202
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,250
there's a chance I'll survive.

203
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,791
In my shoes,

204
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:59,291
a normal person would shrink and
cower in the shadow of fear.

205
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:03,291
But I will not yield!
I will not yield!

206
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,791
Give it here!

207
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,000
[CONNY]
Much obliged, Jean!

208
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,416
Conny?!

209
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,166
[CONNY] Following you was
the best idea I ever had!

210
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,666
[JEAN]
No fair! You can't play dirty!

211
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,791
[CONNY]
Uh?

212
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,083
[ALL scream]

213
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,000
[SASHA]
Yeah!

214
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:15,708
Sasha!

215
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:16,833
Give back my notebook!

216
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,625
Hey! I called dibs, damn it!

217
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,750
[SASHA]
Oh that's cute. Sorry, Jean!

218
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,250
All's fair in love and politics!

219
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,958
I call first come first serve!

220
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,750
Now let's see.

221
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,333
Wait, this is...!

222
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,875
I got it, Bertholdt! Run away!

223
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,583
[BERTHOLDT]
Done!

224
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,708
[JEAN]
Stop!

225
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,125
[ILSE]
Give me back my notebook!

226
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,375
[EREN]
This really sucks!

227
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,291
D'you have a stomachache
or somethin'?

228
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,083
I've just discovered something
that will change my life.

229
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,791
All my wishes are about
to come to fruition!

230
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,416
On Wednesdays the cafeteria
gets massive supply

231
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,708
of yakisoba bread!

232
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,958
Aw yeah!

233
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:48,916
[MARCO, MIKASA grunt]

234
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,208
Where is everybody?

235
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,791
[REINER] Come on, Bertholdt!
Get the lead out!

236
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:52,750
[JEAN]
Stop, you bastards!

237
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,791
[ILSE]
Give me back my notebook!

238
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,166
[MIKASA grunts]

239
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,458
Mikasa!

240
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,458
[BERTHOLDT] Heads up, Reiner!
Mikasa's on our tail!

241
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,041
Eren! Grab it!

242
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,375
[EREN yells]

243
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,000
[RICO]
Move aside!

244
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,166
[EREN groans]

245
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,083
[RICO grunts]

246
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,208
[EREN groans]

247
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,750
Eren!

248
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,833
For your information using the
ODM gear counts as cheating!

249
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,166
This is for the sake of
the Wall Cleanup Club.

250
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,125
Uh!

251
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,125
Just as I thought.
You've all been duped.

252
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,750
There's no secret weapon
for winning this election.

253
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,500
These are just cleaning
instructions.

254
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,875
And very thorough ones,
I might add.

255
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,291
Not exactly what we expected,
but probably something

256
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,458
Levi would kill to get
his hands on, I suppose.

257
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,750
What?! You're kidding me!

258
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,833
[ILSE]
What is wrong with you idiots?!

259
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,208
[MARCO]
We're very sorry.

260
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,333
[ILSE] You all've got
some serious problems!

261
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,916
Don't be too hard on 'em.
Deep down they're nice people,

262
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,166
just sometimes a little on
the impulsive side, y'know?

263
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,916
Actually.

264
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,375
They're kinda painfully honest.

265
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,791
But, that makes for
a good president.

266
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,041
[ILSE]
Huh.

267
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,083
[HITCH]
Competition has been fierce,

268
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,666
given the surprising
number of candidates,

269
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,750
but as we bring this battle
royale to a close,

270
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,041
let's give our presidential
hopefuls a final word!

271
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,958
All right!
Which of these people

272
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,166
will you chose to serve
as Attack Junior High's

273
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,708
Student Council President?

274
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:17,541
First up to make her last speech
is candidate Rico Brzenska!

275
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,708
And, if I'm elected,

276
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,625
not only will this school
be so spotless

277
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,958
you can eat your lunch off
the floor, every student

278
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,916
will be conscripted
into doing their part

279
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,458
to keep it that way. Yes, that
includes working on weekends,

280
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,208
but the extra effort
will be worth it!

281
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,416
[STUDENTS]
Boo!

282
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
[gasps] But, I...!

283
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,875
Well, she gets my vote.

284
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,125
[HITCH]
This is democracy!

285
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,750
Next up to the podium
is Reiner Braun!

286
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,500
Comrades! This is
why you want me!

287
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,083
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

288
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,958
[REINER] If elected, fitness
will be my number one priority!

289
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,333
Attendance at school swim
meets will be mandatory

290
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,791
to increases chances
for physical contact!

291
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:52,875
[GIRL STUDENTS]
Boo!

292
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,458
[BOY STUDENTS]
Yeah!

293
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,000
[REINER]
Hm?

294
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,583
You pig.

295
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,000
[REINER yells]

296
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,625
Candidate Braun is withdrawing
from shock, apparently.

297
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,041
Our next speaker
will be Oruo Bozad!

298
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,958
Give him your attention, please!

299
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,791
[inhales, groans]

300
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,375
Mr. Eren Jaeger will take
the microphone next.

301
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,625
[EREN]
Hmph.

302
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,375
Look, just promise not
to say anything weird.

303
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,458
Meh. Relax.

304
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,458
My reason for wanting to be
your elected leader is simple.

305
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:24,791
When president, hm, every last
Titan in Attack Junior High,

306
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,041
no, the world,
will be destroyed!

307
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,458
[JEAN] Nice. The idiot
just dug his own grave.

308
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,916
[STUDENTS]
Boo!

309
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,500
Eren, why?!

310
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,500
[EREN groaning]

311
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,625
Wha-What did I even say?

312
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,416
[ARMIN]
I need to say something!

313
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,000
Wait, what're you doing?

314
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,750
[ARMIN] I haven't had a chance
to collect my thoughts yet,

315
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,500
but I can do this! I'll just
have to think as I talk!

316
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,458
Listen! Eren's not the
moron he sounds like!

317
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,625
If we take his conviction
and combine it

318
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,791
with our superior
intellect and manpower,

319
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,625
I believe we can reclaim
this campus for humanity!

320
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,333
Does this mean we won't
have to give the Titans

321
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,208
our lunches anymore?
Because I'm all for that.

322
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,791
He doesn't know what
he's talkin' about.

323
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,041
[ARMIN]
With our very survival in mind.

324
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,250
In what time I have left
before they kick me off stage,

325
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,125
I will advocate Eren
Jaeger as president!

326
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,791
[STUDENTS cheer]

327
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,708
[JEAN] This is nuts!
The crowd loves him now?

328
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,375
[cheering continues]

329
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,708
[panting]

330
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,541
[EREN] I should probably
keep my mouth shut, but...

331
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,708
I wasn't finished
with the speech!

332
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,833
[EREN]
You... You're cowards!

333
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,375
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

334
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:39,833
You're all cowards! Just shut
up and put your faith in me!

335
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,083
Hey! What'd you call me?!

336
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,291
[EREN groans, screams]

337
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,708
No!

338
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,416
That's how you figure on
getting yourself elected?

339
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,083
Uh. All right!

340
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,250
Next up is our last speaker,
you'll be glad to know.

341
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,541
Candidate Jean Kirschtein, yay.

342
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,583
[JEAN] They've listened to one
stupid speech after another.

343
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,666
Expectations are at
an all-time low.

344
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,583
This is my chance
to bring it home!

345
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,000
[JEAN]
Fellow students,

346
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,541
I'm gonna be completely
honest here.

347
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,750
I wanna be popular
with the girls.

348
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,583
[BOTH]
Uh...

349
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,083
[STUDENTS]
Boo!

350
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,958
What? What'd I say?

351
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,000
[JEAN]
Why did we do this?

352
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,541
If we'd have known what
we were getting into,

353
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,666
we would've never run.

354
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,291
We've been put
through the ringer,

355
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,291
and all we have to show
for it is regret.

356
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,916
[MARCO] Don't get mad at
what I'm about to say.

357
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,041
[gasps]

358
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,541
Jean's not what you'd
call a standup guy.

359
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,541
But, doesn't that kind of
make him more relatable?

360
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,333
I mean, he's like most of
the folks in this room,

361
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,500
'less I'm wrong.

362
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,375
He's one of us. He gets
our point of view.

363
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:52,333
That's right.
Jean Kirschtein is a realist.

364
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:56,541
Personally, he's where
my recommendation goes.

365
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,416
[clapping]

366
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,333
This man's name is Marco Bodt.

367
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,166
And he happens to be exactly
what I'd call a standup guy!

368
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,583
There was nothing
in this for him.

369
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,666
He was just speaking
out for a friend!

370
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,333
Look at the facts! Think!

371
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,125
Who better to serve
as our president?

372
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,458
I tell you this:

373
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,500
I can't recommend
Mr. Bodt highly enough!

374
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,875
[STUDENTS cheer]

375
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,416
[BOTH] How did this happen?
Outdone by Marco?

376
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,541
That's ridiculous!

377
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,666
This can't be legal!
I've been robbed!

378
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,916
I demand a recount!

379
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,166
[ARMIN]
The school festival.

380
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,666
Amidst a snack alley
bursting with goodies,

381
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,500
Eren devotes himself
to cheeburgs.

382
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,666
Moved by his friend's passion,

383
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,916
Armin prepares to sacrifice
something precious.
