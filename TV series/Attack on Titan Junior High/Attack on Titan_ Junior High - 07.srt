1
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,541
Right! Today's the day!

2
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,750
Yakisoba bread,

3
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,083
you're mine!

4
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,250
Ah!

5
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,666
Uh?! [screams]

6
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,791
Thank you Levi, darling!

7
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,625
I'll pay you back today
before yesterday!

8
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,333
[LEVI]
Like hell, Four Eyes!

9
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,833
Come back, yakisoba!

10
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,833
You and me belong together!

11
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:46,708
[SASHA sniffs] Life is cruel.
Once again, no yakisoba.

12
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,208
It's so unfair!

13
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,708
Yeah, that's a real tragedy.

14
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,916
You do know there's an unspoken
rule banning First Years

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,791
from buying bread in
the cafeteria, right?

16
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,250
The upperclassmen must have a
serious thing for baked goods.

17
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,708
Ugh. Not the point.

18
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,916
They just like to rub our
noses in their superiority.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,375
Whoa! That's not very nice!

20
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,375
[EREN]
On the subject, what's with you

21
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,875
ditching Wall Cleanup
Club lately?

22
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,291
[JEAN whistles]

23
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,041
If I was you, I'd make it
a point to show up today.

24
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,458
Rico's super ticked.

25
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,125
[EREN]
Hey there, Rico!

26
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,791
How's it goin' this afternoon?

27
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:56,250
Not bad. Long time
no see, Jean.

28
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,458
Mind telling me why you've been
skipping out on cleanup duties?

29
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,916
Uh, yeah, well,
I've been crazy busy

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,958
with afterschool dance
class and karate.

31
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,375
I know for a fact none
of that is true.

32
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,708
Bad enough your turned you
back on the sacred trust

33
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,000
that is Wall Cleanup duty,

34
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,666
but to stand there
and lie to me!

35
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,750
Forgiveness is not an option,
and as far as I'm concerned,

36
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,916
you're all responsible
for Jean's misconduct,

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,958
so you're on window detail!

38
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,583
[ALL]
What!

39
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,833
[CONNY sighs]
I'm exhausted.

40
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,750
[SASHA]
I'm on the verge of starvation.

41
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,208
[EREN]
Hey. Sorry we're late. We got--

42
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,625
[ORUO]
Unacceptable!

43
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,500
You must utter an
appropriate greeting!

44
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,083
Oh, uh, good afternoon, then.

45
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,541
I can't hear you!

46
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,291
[ALL]
Uh! Good afternoon!

47
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,750
Why do I get the feeling
you've been slacking off?

48
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,250
You've been remiss in your
commitments, haven't you, runt?

49
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,583
Don't even think
about lying to me!

50
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,208
I wouldn't dream of it!

51
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,958
Explain the state of your dress!

52
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,500
You look like you
just got out of bed!

53
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,875
I expect to see you in
uniform at all times!

54
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,375
And heaven help you if the
collar's left unbuttoned!

55
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,416
First Years are not allowed
to trick out their bags

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,708
with adorable keychains!

57
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,208
I'm sorry! I didn't know!

58
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,791
What's this crap, son?

59
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,291
You tryin' to
impress the ladies?

60
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,708
Colored tee-shirts
are forbidden!

61
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,166
Whoa! Violation!

62
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,875
Skirt hemlines go
below the knee!

63
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,000
And absolutely no cute
needlepoint designs

64
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:08,625
on your socks!

65
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,541
Aw, seriously?

66
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,375
Somebody needs
a haircut, stat!

67
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,625
Turn around, girlie-boy!

68
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,166
First Years get a One Guard!

69
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,875
--[ARMIN] No!
--[CONNY] That's what I use! Ha!

70
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,083
[ELD] Zip up that tracksuit!
All the way!

71
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,458
[PETRA]
First Year females must

72
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,208
tie their hair back
above the ear!

73
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,791
[GUNTHER] Come to school
in designer shoes,

74
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,208
and you'll answer to us!

75
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,541
[ORUO] It's within regulations
for me to backhand you!

76
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,333
Can everybody shut
up for a second?!

Hi guys! What' up?

00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,500
Oh, I mean "good afternoon,"
sorry we're late.

[UPPERCLASSMEN gasping]

82
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,625

Unacceptable!

[EREN sighs]

84
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,875
[JEAN] This sucks. We're stuck
cleaning wherever we go.

85
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,416
[EREN]
I know.

86
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,541
It feels like we'll be doing
this for the rest of our lives.

00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,541
[ARMIN]
Oh, now. It's not that bad.

88
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,750
Junior High's only three
years, after all.

I'll catch you!

You all right, love?

00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,875
Thank you so much, Ymir!

93
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:07,083
When this cleaning is done,
you and me are getting married.

94
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,416
[HANGE]
How's it going in here?

95
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,416
[EREN]
Hange! Levi!

96
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,625
[HANGE]
I don't know why,

97
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,458
but for some reason
this all seems familiar.

98
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,166
Morons. How long have
you been at this?

99
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,375
Uh. I don't know,

100
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,083
maybe something like
ten minutes or so?

101
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,041
You are beyond pathetic.

102
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,375
The three of us could get
it cleaner in two minutes.

103
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,583
How are you gonna be equal
to your Scout duties

104
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,375
when you can't even
dust a store room?

105
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,625
But we've been...

We've been working as
hard as we can, sir!

What are you two, in-laws?

"Man cannot live by bread
alone," said some guy.

110
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,958
And why can't I by me
some yakisoba bread?!

111
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,791
And how come everybody isn't
required to use a One Guard?

112
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,416
Hey, calm down!
We'll get in trouble!

[ALL gasping]

[LEVI] What you need is
to be taught a lesson.

00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,708
And you're in perfect kicking
position, says this guy.

116
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,958
I say we need a friendly
competition!

117
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,333
And that it's important for
all of us to be involved!

118
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,375
So, let's set an example
for the First Years!

How long I've waited to stuff
myself with your deliciousness!

[HANGE] Hello, Sasha! Here's
hopin' we both do okay!

161
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,625
Ho-ho, trust me. I'll do fine!

Come on, Sasha! Woo!

Hold up. What's going on?

00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,250
Is Hange
not even gonna try?

169
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:05,666
[SASHA] What did I just
tell ya? This one's mine!

170

Hey! No way that's regulation!

Why not?

We're basically two halves
of the same person!

Good one, Sawney!

You almost got me there!

[MOBLIT] One of these day's it's
gonna be a lot more than almost!

I'm holding up my end.

stop whining and get up here!

[STUDENTS yelling]

precious ODM gear is meant for!

[CONNY grunts]
There's our opening!

Oh. Hi there.

Nice morning for a game, heh.

[JEAN groaning]

202
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,625
Wow. The Second Years are scary.

203
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,875
And Jean's so
useless it's tragic.

204
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,916
If we put our balls in
the basket right now,

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,208
we'd probably get murdered.

206
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,208
[JEAN groaning]

207
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,791

[REINER moans]

[ARMIN] Our team o-only
has five points.

211
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,291
There so much freakin' better
than us at everything,

212
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,541
what chance do we really have?

213
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,625
Well, suppose we better
just adjust to the idea

214
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,833
of cleaning the Titan building.

215
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,125
Um, maybe if we just
apologized to them?

216
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,166
[MIKASA]
Calm yourself.

217

Mikasa!

219
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,125
[MIKASA]
We haven't got the time for you

220
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,875
to start getting all emotional.

221
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,708
Marco. Correct me
if I'm wrong,

222
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,250
but if we yank the bandanas off
their captains in Shoulder Wars,

223
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,750
we'll get a hundred points.
That about right?

224
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,541
Yeah. I think so.

225
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,833
But even with your help, there's
just way too many of them.

226
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,833
[MIKASA]
I can do it!

227
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,458
[MARCO]
What?

228
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,250
[MIKASA]
I'm strong. Real strong!

229
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,791
I am a warrior!

230
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,750
I can take more punishment
than any of you

231
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,833
and annihilate our
upperclassmen!

232
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,750
Even if I have to do it alone.

233
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,250
As far as I'm concerned,

234
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,791
I am surrounded by a bunch of
unskilled, cowardly worms.

235
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,583
You disappoint me.

236
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,125
You can just sit here and
twiddle your thumbs.

237
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,125
And watch how it's done!

something more motivational.

about you people,

Shoulder Wars!

253
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,041
The object is to
steal the bandanas

from the opposing
teams' captains.

00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,208
No!

320
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,333
Look at us!
We're still standing!

321
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,166
The game isn't decided yet!

322
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,041
Let's go!

323
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,208
[ALL]
Yeah!

324
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,416
[ALL yelling]

325
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,541
[LEVI gasps]

326
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,833
That bandana is mine!

327
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,833
[ALL groaning]

328
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,708
Watch where you're
going, idiots.

329
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,041
Ugh. I just swept over there.

330
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:00,791
[HANGE] Hey!

331
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,125
[LEVI]
Hm?

332
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,416
[HANGE]
If the Third Years win,

333
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,833
I'm totally allowed to
break this open, right?

334
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,500
Please say I am!
Oh, pretty please!

335
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,083
[EREN laughs]

336
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,375
Uh?!

337
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:20,083
[ALL scream]

338
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:31,916
Great. Damn it,
Four Eyes. Ugh.

339
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,500
[EREN sighs]
We're never gonna be done.

340
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,375
[RICO] Excuse me.
There aren't enough brooms.

341
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,541
What d'you mean? Should
be enough for every-- Uh!

342
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,583
What are you guys doing here?

343
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,083
Hey. We're human.

344
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,916
We dealt with our share of
uppity upperclassmen back when.

345
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You're not the only ones
who get sick of lectures.

346
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,041
Wait, so, then you guys
know what it's like?

347
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,291
[RICO]
Oh, yeah.

348
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,541
Even though last year
Levi and the others won

349
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,708
by a huge margin,
they still helped us out.

350
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,416
This will go a lot faster
if we divide and conquer.

351
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,958
[RICO]
Right! Let's get a move on!

352
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,708
I want this finished!

353
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:08,291
[EREN]
Guys!

354
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,875
[ALL]
Mm?

355
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,416
[EREN]
We're sorry!

356
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,791
We should've shown more respect!

357
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,041
Do not misinterpret
our intentions!

358
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,791
We're not here to
soften our image.

359
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,541
We just like to see a
job well done. [groans]

360
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,375
Speaking of Levi and the
others, where are they?

361
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,625
I regret nothing!

362
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,500
[LEVI] Stop running away
from me, Four Eyes!

363
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,500
[ARMIN]
At night,

364
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,250
the screams of Eren and the
others echo through the halls.

365
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,875
The Scouts' traditional
test of courage

366
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,083
is held in spookiest
place on campus,

367
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,208
overseen by a faculty advisor.
