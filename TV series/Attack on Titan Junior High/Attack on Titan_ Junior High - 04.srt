1
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,666
[ARMIN humming]

2
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,333
[ARMIN]
Isn't this exciting?

3
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,875
It's stupid.

4
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,708
If I'd known the Scout Regiment
was strictly off the books,

5
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,958
I would've signed up for
anything 'sides Wall Cleanup.

6
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,541
[ARMIN]
Who'd have thought, right?

7
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,250
You gotta wonder what kind of
activities this club entails.

8
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,625
[ARMIN]
I think it'll be great!

9
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,708
Sucks we have to start
when it's getting' all hot.

10
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,833
[ARMIN]
Summer's just around the corner.

11
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,416
Yeah, about that.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,833
[ARMIN]
Hm?

13
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,666
[EREN] Aren't you, like,
burning up in that thing?

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,666
[ARMIN] Not really.
My hood might look warm,

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,291
but matter of fact,
it's made of mesh!

16
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,000
[ARMIN] Neat, huh? Levi
sewed this for me actually.

17
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,833
[CONNY grunts]

18
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,375
Oh, great. What is it now?

19
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,291
[EREN]
Who cares about Armin's hood?

20
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,666
When we're stuck with
Wall Cleanup Club!

21
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,041
I can't be the only one here

22
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,000
who wants to say forget
this and turn around!

23
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,416
My whole thing is
fighting Titans,

24
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,916
which means I need
to get stronger,

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,291
something I'm not gonna be
able to do playin' janitor!

26
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,500
[SASHA laughs]

27
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,708
If you quit, they'll
just put you in a club

28
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,375
you're bound to hate even more.

29
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,625
We don't even know what the
Wall Cleanup Club's all about.

30
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,416
At least give it a
chance before you bail.

31
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,666
Yeah, and all the cool clubs

32
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,250
are probably at max
capacity by now anyway.

33
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm starting to think
I should've signed up

34
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,333
for the Going Home Club.

35
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,083
Uh, pretty sure that one
only exists in your mind.

36
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,333
What?! Come on,

37
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,166
exactly how many
secret organizations

38
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,333
does this school have?!

39
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,708
[laughs] Well, if
they're secret...

40
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,958
[RICO] Snap to, First Years!
We're not here to gab!

41
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,833
Who the heck is that?

42
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,916
[RICO]
Welcome, new members.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,333
I am the president of
this club, Rico Brzenska.

44
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,041
Brace yourselves, rookies.

45
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,333
You're about to be
put through the mill.

46
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,625
Excuse me. What's all this?

47
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,833
Standard issue custodial
equipment set.

48
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,166
Use it with caution.

49
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,666
Uh! They're just household
cleaning supplies.

50
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,291
Get ahold of yourself! Breathe!

51
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,333
In the glory days when this
club was first founded,

52
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,791
we boasted a hundred members.
Now, I'm the only one left.

53
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,708
This institution needs fresh
blood: in other words, you.

54
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,041
[gasps]

55
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,750
The training will be hard.
That I can guarantee.

56
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,500
[EREN whimpering]

57
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,208
Listen up! As First
Years, you start here!

58
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,041
I want to see these
windows sparkle!

59
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,333
Come on! Seriously?

60
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,041
Doesn't the school have
someone on its payroll

61
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,333
to handle this crap?

62
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,583
[RICO] If you don't like it,
find another club.

63
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,666
But let me warn you.

64
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,166
All of the human
clubs have reached

65
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,208
their membership quotas
for the semester.

66
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,041
The only ones still
accepting applications

67
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,708
are all overrun with Titans.

68
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,916
Uh!

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,708
[RICO] By all means,
don't let me stop you.

70
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,333
[ARMIN]
Seems fairly cut and dry to me.

71
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,541
We'd best pick up our
buckets and get cleaning.

72
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:27,250
[RICO] Start with the new
building. Do not slack off.

73
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,000
If I'd have stuck with
the original plan,

74
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,500
odds are my name
would be synonymous

75
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,125
with Titan Slayer by now.

76
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,000
I'd kill for an afternoon snack.

77
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,625
I bet the Going Home club
has all kinds of snacks.

78
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,625
Stop writing on the windows
and clean 'em already.

79
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,958
You heard what she said.
We can't slack off.

80
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,125
[sighs] See those guys?
I'm so jealous.

81
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,166
[REINER yells]

82
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,625
[BERTHOLDT groans]

83
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,083
What I wouldn't give
to be in their shoes.

84
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,625
[GIRL A giggles]
Seriously,

85
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,708
who joins a club where
they clean windows?

86
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:02,916
[GIRL B]
Maybe they're being punished

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,625
for forgetting their
homework or something.

88
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,000
[GIRL A] You're probably right.
What a bunch of losers!

89
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,000
[JEAN growling]

90
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,375
[ARMIN]
Uh, Jean?

91
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,750
[JEAN] This club is lame!
I'm outta here!

92
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,291
[ARMIN]
Wait! We're on the third floor!

93
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,125
Knock it off, Jean!
We're not even done yet!

94
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,041
Heh. You idiots wanna
shine windows

95
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,500
for the rest of your
lives, be my guest.

96
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:27,250
[RICO] First Year! I clearly
told you not to slack off!

97
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,541
[JEAN groans]

98
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,000
[RICO]
When I give you an order,

99
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,875
I expect you to see it
through to the bitter end,

100
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,208
is that understood?

101
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,000
We clean whatever the cost.

102
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,250
[EREN]
Rico!

103
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,500
[gasps]

104
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,708
What you just did was
unbelievably awesome!

105
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,333
You were totally
flying like a bird!

106
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,333
I'd be interested to know
how you pulled it off.

107
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,041
That is the coolest thing ever!

108
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,583
You mean this old thing?

109
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,208
We call it Omni Directional
Mobility Gear.

110
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,625
The club's most coveted secret.

111
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,416
[RICO]
It's used like this.

112
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,916
All the better to help scour
down those hard-to-reach places.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,791
[ALL]
Whoa!

114
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,208
[EREN]
If I learn to use this,

115
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,416
it can help me bring
down the Titans!

116
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,750
[JEAN]
If I learn to use this,

117
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,958
I'll be the coolest
guy on campus!

118
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,875
[RICO grunts]
Now quit screwin' around,

119
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,125
those windows aren't
going to clean thems--

120
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,125
[BOTH] Please teach us
how to use your gear!

121
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,416
[EREN]
I get to go first!

122
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,125
[JEAN] Whatever, jerkwad!
Stop copying me!

123
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,583
[ARMIN]
Both of you, calm down!

124
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,166
[SASHA] If they're gonna
be morons, I'll go first!

125
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,500
[CONNY] I see what you
did there! No way!

126
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:33,125
Wow. I'm dealing with
a pack of idiots.

127
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,125
[RICO]
I appreciate the enthusiasm,

128
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,541
but until you can learn to
clean a window properly,

129
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,500
ODM gear is out
of bounds. Period.

130
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,208
Now, put aside juvenile things
and make a mental note.

131
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,083
You are to clean as though
your lives depended on it.

132
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:55,125
Show me you understand
by getting back to work!

133
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,875
[ARMIN laughs]
Guess she told us, didn't she?

134
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,375
I suppose we'd better go
back to scrubbing windows.

135
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,500
Don't you get it?

136
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,000
[ALL]
Hm?

137
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,416
If we can show Rico we know
how to take window cleaning

138
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,458
seriously, and she'll teach
us how to use the gear!

139
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,958
Stand back, everybody!

140
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,583
I'm gonna make these windows
shine like they're on fire!

141
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,250
[MIKASA] If that's how you feel
about it, I'm right behind you.

142
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,708
[JEAN]
Hey, hold up!

143
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,500
[SASHA] I want to make 'em
shine like they're on fire!

144
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,500
[CONNY]
Me, too!

145
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,333
[ARMIN]
I'm inspired!

146
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,125
[RICO]
Ugh. Idiotic First Years.

147
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,291
The Wall Cleanup Club is
just a joke to those brats.

148
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,666
Right. Checkup.

149
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,625
I'd better not see so
much as a streak...

150
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,708
Good heavens!

151
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,333
What is this blinding,
angelic light?

152
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,333
[EREN]
Rico!

153
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,500
[RICO gasps]

154
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,625
[JEAN, SASHA, CONNY chuckle]

155
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,250
It's so beautiful.

156
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,041
Well done! Bravo!

157
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,875
Normally only Second
and Third Years

158
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,541
are allowed to use ODM gear,

159
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,208
but in your case I'll
make an exception.

160
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:54,916
So we...?

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,458
Yes!

162
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,750
I'd be honored to teach you all
how to soar through the air!

163
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,666
[ALL]
Yeah!

164
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,208
Okay.

165
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,833
Why am I--? How do
I work this thing?

166
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,083
This can't be happening!

167
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,250
[RICO] What is your major
malfunction, Jaeger?

168
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,791
Now straighten yourself up!

169
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,041
[MIKASA] Just remember the
basics and you should be fine.

170
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,875
[ARMIN]
Loosen up your stance a bit.

171
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,750
If I could do it,
I know that you can!

172
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,458
[EREN]
That's it! I'm going to do it.

173
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:27,250
I have to! I may not be
as talented as the rest,

174
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,458
but nobody,
nobody has more guts!

175
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,916
I'm not giving up.
Not without a fight!

176
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,708
[ARMIN]
Whoa!

177
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,625
[EREN]
I did it. I freakin' did it!

178
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,708
[EREN laughs]

179
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,583
[EREN gasping]

180
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,750
[ARMIN gasps]

181
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,083
[EREN groans]

182
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,666
[MIKASA]
Eren!

183
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,541
[RICO] Never in my life have I
seen a kid with less aptitude.

184
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,125
[ARMIN]
Eren's so athletic, though.

185
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,166
Something must be
throwing him off.

186
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,708
[JEAN]
What's your trick, tough guy?

187
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,875
You've screwed up in
every way imaginable

188
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,166
short of an accidental
equipment-related asphyxiation.

189
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,125
Face it man,
I'm better than you.

190
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,625
I mean, it's no
big deal, really.

191
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,250
Some people are just
born with skill.

192
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,750
[CONNY]
Woo-hoo! First one up the wall!

193
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,125
[SASHA]
I'm right behind you!

194
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,375
[JEAN]
Hey! Quit showing off!

195
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,541
Ah. Look at 'em! Those jerks!

196
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,833
Getting mad about it isn't
going to solve a thing.

197
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,833
There's time to get some
practice in tomorrow morning.

198
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:22,166
Either way, to stay in the club,
he has to master the gear.

199
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,208
Wall Cleanup is only for
students with balance.

200
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,500
Uh! What happens if he sucks?

201
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,000
[RICO]
What do you think happens?

202
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,958
He'll be put in some other club.

203
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,041
Uh? No, please!
Just give me a chance!

204
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,666
I don't make the rules.

205
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,666
The weak simply
have no place here.

206
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,458
Oh, no.

207
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,583
I'm pathetic. How am I
supposed to fight the Titans

208
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,625
if I can't even
stand up straight?

209
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,541
It might be time to
let that dream die.

210
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,708
[EREN gasps]
What do you mean?

211
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,250
I think you should give up
this attempt to be a hero.

212
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,083
What're you saying? After
everything we saw that day,

213
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,041
everything the Titans
took from us?!

214
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:59,833
You're nuts if you think
I'm just gonna walk away!

215
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,208
[MIKASA] Look. It doesn't
matter how determined you are.

216
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,291
Huh?! What are you
talkin' about?!

217
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,000
Because whether
or not you are fit

218
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,500
to be a window cleaner,
isn't up to you.

219
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,625
Setting Jean aside,

220
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,958
even Conny's mastered
the ODM gear.

221
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,166
So clearly it's not a question
of intellect or equilibrium.

222
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,166
Perhaps there's some undetected
flaw in the gear itself?

223
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,708
That's ridiculous!

224
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:23,166
Our predecessors took a 107
years to perfect this equipment!

225
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,958
When the R&amp;D ran out, they
dug into their own pockets.

226
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,458
They went without juice, man!
They went without juice!

227
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,333
[ARMIN] They really
wanted the wall clean.

228
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,541
There is no chance of
this gear being flawed.

229
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,041
Whatsoever. It is
the fruit of genius!

230
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,833
In fact, I'm so confident that
the gear cannot be to blame,

231
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,125
I'm willing to
stand upside down

232
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,791
and eat spaghetti
through my nostrils--

233
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,750
[RICO] Oh. Well, that's
the problem right there.

234
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,666
[MIKASA]
What's the matter?

235
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,083
[RICO screams]

236
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,458
[MIKASA] I'm no expert,
but, I mean, it looks to me

237
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,000
like the gear he has on
is absolutely to blame.

238
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,958
[RICO]
Oh crap! What am I gonna do?

239
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,083
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

240
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,000
[HANNES]
Somebody messin' with you?

241
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,333
[EREN]
Hey Mr. Hannes.

242
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:03,208
Or you just get on
Mikasa's bad side today?

243
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,250
[EREN]
No! What makes you think that?!

244
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,458
Ugh! You smell like booze!

245
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,125
What a minute, what are
you even doing here?!

246
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,875
Huh? What're you
talking about, son?

247
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,000
Who the heck you think

248
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,375
the faculty advisor
is for this club?

249
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,958
[EREN]
What?! You've got to be kidding!

250
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,208
[HANNES]
Shut up.

251
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,291
Take that rig off,
let me have a crack at it.

252
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,375
Uh. I don't--

253
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,666
[EREN]
Do you know what you're doing?

254
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,458
[HANNES]
C'mon. Give me some credit, huh?

255
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,666
They didn't put me in charge

256
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,916
of the Wall Cleanup Club
yesterday, you know.

257
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,416
[RICO]
Excuse me.

258
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,416
[HANNES] There we are. All
right. Now, then. Pay attention

259
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,833
and this old dog might just
teach you some new tricks.

260
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,166
Whoa! Look at Mr. Hannes go!

261
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,541
He's amazing!

262
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,375
So he's not just your average
everyday boozehound!

263
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:44,125
[laughing] What do you think
of me now? Am I cool or what?

264
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,625
[screams]

265
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,916
Don't even act like you
weren't just trying to cheat!

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,875
I found the spot first!
I called dibs!

267
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:50,750
You both heard me!

268
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,375
That's adorable. Sorry, Jean.

269
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,333
All's fair in love and
housekeeping. Calling dibs.

270
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,000
It's first come,
first serve, doofus!

271
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,333
I'm onto you, Potato Girl!

272
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,000
Don't bring your
hunter's logic into this!

273
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:00,625
[SASHA]
Potato?!

274
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,000
[HANNES screaming]

275
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,041
[BOTH scream]

276
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,000
[BOTH groaning]

277
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,000
[EREN]
Mr. Hannes! Are you okay?

278
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,333
[HANNES]
Eren.

279
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,125
There's nothing you could've
done about this rig,

280
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,416
you understand?
You're a kid. You're weak.

281
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,791
[EREN] Actually, I was
practicing earlier.

282
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,416
Don't beat yourself
up. I'm far worse.

283
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,000
When push came to shove I
was just too hammered!

284
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,291
[EREN]
Ugh! You reek!

285
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,875
[RICO yells]

286
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,250
Mr. Hannes, what have you done?
The gear was perfectly fine!

287
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,416
[HANNES]
Huh? Well I'll be damned.

288
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,333
Ah, you're such a mess.
Whatever are we to do with you?

289
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,708
I'll have to mend that
rig myself after class.

290
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,000
That's it for today,
everyone! We're done here!

291
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,541
[MIKASA]
What's got you so worked up?

292
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,708
[RICO]
None of your bees wax!

293
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,875
I said we're done!
Go home, or wherever!

294
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,083
[RICO]
Eren Jaeger. Are you ready?

295
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,208
[EREN]
Yes!

296
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,958
I can do it now! Yeah-ah!

297
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,416
I don't know what's
different from yesterday

298
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,458
but I've totally got this now!

299
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,083
[SASHA]
Congratulations, Eren!

300
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,583
[CONNY]
Way to go, man!

301
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,041
Well, Rico?

302
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,208
This mean I can stay?

303
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,916
I can be in the
Wall Cleanup Club?

304
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,083
Uh. Yes, you passed.
Nice job! Now keep training.

305
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,541
[EREN]
Check it out, Mikasa!

306
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,625
I'm doin' it!
I can fight the Titans!

307
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:19,000
You don't have to worry
about me anymore!

308
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm actually glad things
worked out for him.

309
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,750
His eyes are definitely
saying 'Check me out!'

310
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:24,500
Nuh-uh.

311
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,708
[ALL]
Mm?

312
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,500
What his eyes are
really saying is

313
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,125
he doesn't have to leave me.

314
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,583
At least, not anymore.

315
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,166
[ALL]
Uh...

316
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,125
What the...?

317
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,583
[JEAN] Okay. Do I wanna
know what you're doing?

318
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,458
[SASHA] Gigantic footsteps
headed this way! Super-fast!

319
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,708
[CONNY]
Huh?!

320
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,916
[RICO growls]
Move away from the wall! Now!

321
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,541
[RICO]
The Titans are coming!

322
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,708
[RICO]
Stay where you are.

323
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,375
What are they doing?
What's with the spray paint?

324
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,333
[gasps]

325
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,291
They're tagging the
wall. Those jerks!

326
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,916
That's terrible!

327
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,916
Yes. Now you see what
we're dealing with.

328
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,125
Their graffiti is the reason
this club was founded.

329
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,583
Someone had to clean up
the widespread vandalism.

330
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,166
It's an eyesore.

331
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,625
Several students decided to take
matters into their own hands.

332
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,208
Their names were
Alyosha, Dominic,

333
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:28,750
Fine, Isabel, Ludwig,
Martina, Guido, and Hans.

334
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,791
The founding members of
the Wall Cleanup Club.

335
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,625
[EREN]
Sorry, I have to do this.

336
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,666
Eren, wait!

337
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,083
Don't be a fool, Jaeger!

338
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,583
[grunts] Did someone teach that
boy how to use his ODM rig

339
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,500
while my back was turned?

340
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,000
[RICO growls]

341
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,375
[EREN yells]

342
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,666
I can do this!

343
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,083
As long as I'm
wearing this gear,

344
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,416
the Titan's don't have a prayer!

345
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,291
[MIKASA]
Eren!

346
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,833
Way to go.

347
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,166
Uh, guess it goes to show you
how important practice is.

348
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,250
I've bitten off more
than I can chew.

349
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,916
He'll have to be
trained from scratch.

350
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,416
Yeah!

351
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:30,583
Yeah, you better run! Next time
you won't have it so easy!

352
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,708
[ARMIN]
Test scores.

353
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,416
A hardship that plagues
all students equally,

354
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,166
whatever their status,
whatever their skill.

355
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,958
To escape the despair
of remedial courses,

356
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,833
Sasha asks Armin for help,
with mixed results.
