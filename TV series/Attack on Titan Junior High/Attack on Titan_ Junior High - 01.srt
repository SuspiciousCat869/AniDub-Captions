It's happening again.

325
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:18,333
They take away what
we hold most dear.

326
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,041
I will not be bullied!

327
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,625
[screams] The target's
in front of me!

328
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,875
[MIKASA]
Eren, wait!

329
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,125
[EREN] We've got ourselves
a Colossal Titan!

330
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:25,833
[HANNES]
Huh?

331
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:26,666
[EREN growls]

332
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,458
[EREN]
This is my chance!

333
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,541
Eren!

334
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,541
[EREN]
For us Junior High School kids,

335
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,708
this will be our
greatest leap ever!

336
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,041
[EREN yells]

337
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:46,291
[EREN yelling]

338
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,708
Yes! Go get him, Eren!

339
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,291
[EREN grunts]

340
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,125
[STUDENTS cheer]

341
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,791
Say goodbye!

342
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,958
[EREN]
Uh, oh.

343
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,541
[EREN screams]

344
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,208
[ALL groan]

345
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,583
[EREN]
Ah?! No!

346
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,541
Don't do it, you monster!

347
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:09,250
Not my precious
Cheese Hamburg steak!

348
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,125
[ALL groan]

349
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,250
[SASHA]
Cheese Hamburg steak?

350
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,541
[CHRISTA] He put his life
on the line for <i>that?</i>

351
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,583
[YMIR] Way to have your
priorities straight.

352
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,083
[JEAN]
That Chee-burg bastard.

353
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,208
[sighs] I tried to tell
not to say it out loud.

354
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,041
It's my... favorite.

355
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,333
[grunts] Yeah. Chee-burg
bastard.

356
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,166
[ARMIN]
Armin hates the cold.

357
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,583
In fact, Armin hates
the cold so much

358
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,958
he flat-out refuses
to go to school.

359
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,375
Eren and the others try
to reason with him,

360
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,916
but when they
get to his house,

361
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,875
they come face-to-face with
the strongest man in the world.
