00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,416
[ARMIN]
Summer.

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,666
Temperatures are on the rise.

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,750
More and more people
wear short sleeves.

4
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,791
It's early in the season,

5
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,750
but tensions in the
classroom run high.

6
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:34,125
Soon, the other shoe will drop.

7
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:38,583
Every student's fate hangs
precariously in the balance.

8
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,625
[KEITH]
All right, maggots.

9
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,208
Listen for you name.

10
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:46,958
To the morons out there who
tanked, bear this in mind.

11
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,458
Makeup exams'll be next week.

12
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:53,125
[ARMIN] The dreaded day of
Test Results is upon us.

13
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,291
[KEITH]
Next up, Armin Arlelt!

14
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,125
Yes, sir!

15
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,208
[KEITH]
Perfect score!

16
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,958
[STUDENTS]
Whoa!

17
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:29,875
[ARMIN chuckles nervously]

18
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,958
[KEITH]
Now we have Sasha Braus.

19
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,875
[SASHA]
Uh! Yes, sir.

20
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,208
[KEITH]
The hell are you doin'?

21
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,500
[SASHA]
Huh?

22
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,500
I said: what the hell
are you doin'?

23
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,458
[KEITH]
Congratulations, young lady!

24
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:53,833
You are now officially
on my bad side. Again.

25
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,916
[SASHA sighs]

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,708
Seriously, tell us your secret.

27
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,125
If I bombed as many exams
as that, I'd lose my mind.

28
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,916
There's gotta be some trick
to how you're still sane.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,875
That's harsh, man.

30
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,708
Says the guy who got all zeros.

31
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,500
How are you not totally freaked
out about what's at stake?

32
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,958
If you flunk the make-up tests
you're banned from lunch

33
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,916
for the rest of the semester!

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,333
[SASHA screams]

35
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,000
[SASHA]
Eren! You've gotta help me!

36
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,708
Stay and be my study
buddy, I'm beggin' you!

37
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,958
Love to, but I'm headed to
the Scouts' HQ, so... Bye!

38
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:26,750
Mikasa?

39
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:27,708
[MIKASA]
I'm with him.

40
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,125
[SASHA]
Sure. Go ahead.

41
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,791
You I'm not even
gonna bother to ask

42
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:31,791
'cause I know you'll be a jerk.

43
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,333
Way to make it a lot less fun!

44
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,083
Somebody step up
and be the hero!

45
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,541
If I fail the makeup
tests I'm doomed!

46
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,750
[BERTHOLDT]
Um. Sasha?

47
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,458
I'll be glad to help you--

48
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,583
They're never gonna let me eat
lunch at this school again!

49
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,416
[CONNY]
Okay, okay. Fine.

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,458
What's the trick to getting
the perfect score, you ask?

51
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,708
Well, it's hard to say.
I've got kind of a gift.

52
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,291
It's all about feelin'
it, y'know?

53
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,458
You got straight zeroes
on everything.

54
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,375
Ah-ha! Armin!

55
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,208
Help me! Come on!
You got all perfect scores!

56
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,625
You want me to help you
study? Sure, no problem.

57
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,708
You're a life saver!

58
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,250
Oh, I'm happy to lend a hand.

59
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,916
You can join us, too,
if you like, Conny.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,666
[CONNY]
You mean it?

61
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,208
And all of a sudden,

62
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,083
I'm confident we're being
steered in the right direction!

63
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,791
Yeah! When we put
our heads together,

64
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,916
the sky's the limit!
Hooray teamwork!

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,083
Right! Those tests won't
know what hit 'em!

66
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,625
[ALL]
Yeah!

67
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,000
[CONNY]
Let's do it!

68
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,041
--[SASHA] Study buddies!
--[ARMIN] I believe in you!

69
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,208
All righty, then.
Let's get started.

70
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,291
Wait. Where'd Conny go?

71
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,625
[SASHA] Uh, he was standing
right here, wasn't he?

72
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,958
How'd he even...?

73
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,375
[CONNY humming]

74
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,708
[ARMIN]
Did he honestly forget

75
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,375
what we just talked
about and head home?

76
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,916
[CONNY sighs]
I love this time of year.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,125
[ARMIN]
Okay, then.

78
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,625
Well let's not worry
about him at the moment

79
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,833
and instead dive right
into your weakest subject.

80
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,166
Okay!

81
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,541
That would be math.

82
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,583
Definitely a foreign
language to me.

83
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,708
[ARMIN] Hm. Let's see here.
Take this problem.

84
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,166
I suspect that the letters
tripped you up here.

85
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,125
Try substituting X
and Y in your head

86
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,791
with an apple and an orange
and see if that doesn't help.

87
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,791
Solving for letter
values is way easier

88
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,375
if think of the equation
in terms of food.

89
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,958
So let X be apples
and Y be oranges.

90
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,458
[SASHA]
Heh...

91
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,791
You see what I just did there?

92
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,541
Now the problem's
more relatable.

93
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,166
[laughing]

94
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,166
Wow! This is working
like a charm!

95
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,541
So basically we've been sitting
through algebra all this time

96
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,583
just to figure out the
market value of produce.

97
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,833
Oh, man.

98
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,291
If I'd have known it was
all about consumerism,

99
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,458
I'd have grown my own.

100
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,416
Whoa! Okay!

101
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,791
Getting' a little too off track!

102
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,458
It's was just an example!

103
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,166
Tell you what:
let's dial it back.

104
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,500
X and Y can be whatever
you want them to be!

105
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,958
Whatever I want them
to be? Like what?

106
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,708
Uh well, for example...

107
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,166
X can be steak. Y can be curry.

108
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,041
Why not go five-star dinning?

109
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,208
Hold up!

110
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,500
So X is boiled eel
and Y is pickled plum?

111
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,791
Sure thing!

112
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,500
Or X can be tempura
and Y can be watermelon?!

113
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,875
Of course!

114
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,000
Why did I never realize
something as boring as math

115
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,875
could be the stuff
dreams are made of?

116
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,750
You see?
Algebra can be magical!

117
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,458
[ARMIN]
Just not in the way you think.

118
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,041
Thank you, Armin!

119
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,166
With this method I can solve any
problem the test throws at me!

120
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,500
Yeah! That's the spirit!

121
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,208
You've just got to
believe in yourself!

122
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,541
Oh, and in real life,

123
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,500
avoid all the food combinations
we just imagined.

124
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,583
[SASHA]
Uh.

125
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,083
[EREN]
Ah, ha, ha, ha!

126
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,208
Scout Regiment, here I
come, to do Scout stuff!

127
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,750
Will you stop running
like that, please?

128
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,625
Afternoon, everybody!

129
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,000
[PETRA] Oh, hey First Years.
How's it goin'?

130
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,791
[ORUO]
Ugh! Damn it all! Why?

131
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,291
What am I supposed to do?

132
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,791
How was I supposed to
know it'd come to this?

133
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,166
Stop it. We talked about
this. You're whining.

134
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,666
Is something going on, or--?

135
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,708
Don't!

136
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,833
Oh, my. I didn't
want to mention it,

137
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,541
but since you asked,
I have to expound.

138
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,333
[PETRA growls]

139
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,666
If you must know,

140
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,625
I did poorly on the tests
recently administered...

141
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,708
[PETRA]
No one cares.

142
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,916
...which I'm honor-bound
to tell you

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,791
is the source of
my current distress.

144
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,458
Do not be deceived, greenhorn!

145
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,666
What?

146
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,666
My failure gives you
no right to disrespect--

147
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,291
[ORUO groaning]

148
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,125
Hey. Are you okay?

149
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,875
Apologies for making a scene.

150
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,250
The pecking order is important,

151
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,083
the rookie has to
know his place.

152
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,083
You just confused him.

153
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,250
[ORUO]
Hmph! Indeed so.

154
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,833
Our exchange went
exactly as planned.

155
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,291
Ugh. What happened to you, Oruo?

156
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,125
You never used to
talk like this.

157
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,041
Look, it's none of my business,

158
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,083
but if you're trying to
be like Captain Levi,

159
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,125
it's kind of embarrassing.

160
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,666
You're not him.
Never will be. 'Kay?

161
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,458
So 'less you wanna
come off like a poser,

162
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,916
I'm gonna need you
to use your head.

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,250
Ha, ha.

164
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,416
If you intend to hound
me like girlfriend, Petra.

165
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,458
There's rather more of me you
need to be acquainted with

166
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,875
before laying claim
to the privilege.

167
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,625
[PETRA] Next time you bite your
tongue, I hope you bleed out.

168
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,958
[JEAN]
What's the big deal?

169
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,708
So your test scores aren't
the greatest. Who cares?

170
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,750
[ORUO]
Oh, please!

171
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,166
For your information, plebian,

172
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,125
test scores are not
the issue here.

173
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,916
I'm ashamed for letting
my guard down

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,791
and performing less than
admirably on something

175
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,208
at which I'm known to excel.

176
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,166
Ha! Not that I expect you
to understand, of course!

177
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,750
And why, you ask, don't I
expect you to understand?

178
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,125
Because when push
comes to shove,

179
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,416
you're as far from
my level as can be!

180
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,458
I don't even study.
Did you know that?

181
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,625
I ace my exams
purely on instinct!

182
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,625
[JEAN]
This guy!

183
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,041
Hey!

184
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,750
What did I just tell you about
trying to imitate Levi?

185
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,958
Stop. You're only making
a fool of yourself.

186
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,166
Oh, and by the way,
we know you study a lot more

187
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,416
than you'd like us
to think you do

188
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,208
'cause I talked to your
mom the other day.

189
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,291
She says the night before
a test, you're frantic.

190
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,166
Sweetheart?
I made you a snack.

191
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,375
It's late.

192
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,000
[ELD] She's brags about
you all the time,

193
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,625
says you're the most
conscientious student

194
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,041
in the whole world.

195
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,541
'Course I guess you could
be deceiving your own mom.

196
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,875
Ugh! Unbelievable!

197
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,250
You realize that's just
like spying on me!

198
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,833
Are you all so desperate?

199
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,416
Why do you even care about
my test scores to begin with?

200
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,583
Fine! I suppose you'll
stop at nothing!

201
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,458
Like I said, no one cares.

202
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,208
Humph. How can I possibly
fight such persistence?

203
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,708
So be it, then. I'll let
you see how I did.

204
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,083
But only on condition that I get
to see your test scores as well!

205
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,958
[ALL]
Huh?

206
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,458
Wow, guess we're
really gonna do this.

207
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,291
Whatever. All right.

208
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,291
[ALL]
One, two.

209
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,000
What?!

210
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,125
Wait a second.
That doesn't look bad.

211
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,333
[ORUO]
Are you kidding?

212
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,000
I missed a perfect score
by six whole points!

213
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:04,833
[PETRA, EREN]
Huh?

214
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,208
You First Years have no idea

215
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,750
how good you have
it come test day.

216
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,375
I'd offer to let you tutor me,

217
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,333
but you seem woefully
under-qualified.

218
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,833
I'll just ask a teacher.

219
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:17,416
You set us up so you could
rub it in our faces!

220
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,708
[HANGE laughs]
Levi!

221
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,875
[HANGE]
Tada!

222
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,833
What do you say whoever
did better on their test

223
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,583
treats the other to some
yakisoba bread, huh?

224
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,416
Shut up.

225
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,041
[HANGE]
Huh?

226
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,791
Ah, ha! I'm just kidding!
Yeah! Only havin' a laugh!

227
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,333
But actually, there is something
we need to talk about.

228
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,916
I happened to be starving
at the moment,

229
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,083
and wouldn't you know it,

230
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,375
not even enough in
my wallet for crumbs!

231
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,416
Come again? The ol'
conscience weighing on you

232
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,916
for not treating your
pal Hange to a meal

233
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,125
you know she needs and would
be eternally grateful for?!

234
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,000
You've got enough
for Sacchan Squid.

235
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,500
[HANGE]
Huh?!

236
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,208
News flash: Sacchan Squid
is not, nor has it ever been,

237
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,291
yakisoba bread, and you're
a monster for implying

238
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,458
they're in any way similar!

239
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,333
Stop trying to
sidestep the issue!

240
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,750
[LEVI] So you make a bet
with me knowing your score.

241
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,500
Then you go and jump
all over my case

242
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,416
for making an
alternative suggestion?

243
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,041
I'll chalk this one down
to stupidity and move on.

244
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,500
I'm sorry. I'll admit
my bold-faced attempt

245
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,875
to finagle you into buying me
a piece of yakisoba bread

246
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,541
was somewhat questionable,
if not downright dishonest.

247
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,666
However!

248
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,708
Huh?

249
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:21,583
However. Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

250
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,666
[LEVI]
Starve for all I care.

251
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,208
[HANGE]
Have it your way!

252
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,916
I'll just exploit the Levi name
to leech our underclassmen!

253
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,541
FYI: You're a stupid jerk
and you have stupid hair!

254
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,625
[LEVI] You really need to
work on your comebacks.

255
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,958
[sighs]

256
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,750
[JEAN, EREN panting]

257
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,833
[LEVI]
What are you people doing?

258
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,541
We had to... she was
out of control!

259
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,208
Crazy girl just shows up out of
nowhere and went on a rampage!

260
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,416
Please, sir! You've gotta
get her out of here!

261
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
[LEVI]
Yeah, no.

262
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,208
[EREN]
But Hange was hardcore flailing!

263
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,291
You should've seen it!
She took out Oruo!

264
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,250
[LEVI]
Good for her.

265
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,541
See?

266
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,416
You were an absolute fool
to underestimate me.

267
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,333
Let it be known that
Hange plays for keepsies.

268
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,458
Let there be no doubt you're a
few sandwiches shy of a picnic.

269
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,708
[HANGE sighs]

270
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,083
[EREN] Uh... Not that
it's any of my business,

271
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,041
but how'd you let yourself
get so short on cash?

272
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,916
Gah! Idiot! Shut up!

273
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,791
[HANGE]
Ah. I knew it.

274
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,916
You possess a singularly
curious mind, don't you?

275
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,750
[EREN]
Well. I, uh...

276
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,375
[HANGE]
You ask questions! Oh, ho! Yes!

277
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,750
All the sordid details
fascinate you, huh?

278
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,583
[EREN]
Hange.

279
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:34,041
What, uh, what'd you bring us
to the science lab for exactly?

280
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,083
Well, we of the Biology Club
use this room from time to time,

281
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:41,750
with the faculty's blessing, of
course. Welcome to what we do!

282
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,875
'Kay. Seems a little bit...

283
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,500
I dunno, dark?

284
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,000
Now allow me to
introduce to you!

285
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,500
[EREN]
Ti... Titans?

286
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,791
Aren't they just adorable?

287
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,916
I've had these li'l darlings
for a while now.

288
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,041
I still need to come up with
suitable pet names for them,

289
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,291
though. Something cute,

290
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,833
along the lines of "dung
beetle" or "sea urchin."

291
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,458
We gotta do this again?

292
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,208
Her naming scheme is so freaky.

293
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,833
Ah! You're "Sawney."

294
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,791
And we'll call you "Beane."

295
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,666
Let's be chums, huh?

296
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,416
[MOBLIT]
Hange, please! You're too close!

297
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,458
[HANGE]
Hm?

298
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,000
Whoa-ho! That was a close one!

299
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,333
That's what I just told you!

300
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,333
You can't treat Titan's
like hamsters!

301
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,833
[HANGE]
Of course you can!

302
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,833
We've been fumbling in
the dark for too long,

303
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,916
the framework through which
we understand these creatures

304
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,333
is built on little more
than fear and contempt!

305
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,375
I concede that my approach may
be a complete waste of time.

306
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,666
However. Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

307
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:38,833
[moaning]

308
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,208
[HANGE]
Mm? Go on. Talk to me.

309
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,250
Oh!

310
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,875
Hange! Will you
please stand clear?!

311
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,791
[laughs] You were just a hair's
breadth from getting me there,

312
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,041
weren't you, darling? [laughs]

313
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,583
Argh! You're gonna get
your head chomped off!

314
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,458
[HANGE laughing]

315
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,250
[LEVI]
I see how it is.

316
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,125
This pretty much explains
why you're broke.

317
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,375
[EREN]
When did you come in?

318
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,583
Exactly right!

319
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,333
The cost of feeding
them is enough to keep

320
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,041
our club's finances in the
red! I try to scrape together

321
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,875
what I can, but my allowance
is a joke, so, you know...

322
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,583
[stomach growls]

323
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,708
Guess it can't be helped.

324
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,875
Levi.

325
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,916
I am not treating you. I except
to be paid back in full.

326
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,041
Levi!

327
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:21,500
[LEVI]
Here.

328
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,208
Uh?

329
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,416
[HANGE]
What's this?

330
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,000
Food for your hamsters.

331
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,125
Not for her?!

332
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,708
Go buy some Sacchan
Squid for yourself

333
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,333
and leave me alone.

334
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:34,583
[HANGE] Gee, thanks.
You are one stubborn bastard.

335
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,625
[ARMIN]
I'm so proud of you, Sasha!

336
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,625
You got most of
the answers dead-on!

337
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,875
Well, I did have a
pretty awesome tutor.

338
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,500
Hey. No, at the end of the day,

339
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,416
you accomplished
this all by yourself.

340
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,875
[SASHA] If I'm honest, I always
thought Armin was a total wuss.

341
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,250
But he's also a sweetheart.
And so intelligent!

342
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,458
In fact, he's all
kinds of wonderful!

343
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:03,041
[SASHA] Thank you. I'm really
grateful for the help.

344
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,541
[ARMIN]
Oh, it's my pleasure.

345
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,875
Good luck on the makeup
tests! See you tomorrow!

346
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,041
[SASHA]
You're amazing.

347
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,583
You didn't have to help me out,

348
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,375
but you stepped up.
Now it's my turn!

349
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,458
Ha! Yeah!

350
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,208
Uh?

351
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,041
[ARMIN screams]
The street is pitch black!

352
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,666
[SASHA]
What's gotten into you?!

353
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,750
Scared of the dark!
Scared of the dark!

354
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,541
[ARMIN whimpers]

355
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,916
[SASHA laughs]

356
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,833
[SASHA] To be fair,
he's still a bit of a wuss.

357
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,583
[KEITH]
All right, livestock!

358
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,458
The remedial tests
are in front of you!

359
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,083
Try not to screw it up!

360
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,166
And begin!

361
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,875
[SASHA]
It's got an X and a Y!

362
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,625
And I know exactly what to do!

363
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,375
Ha ha! You don't scare
me, algebra! Huh.

364
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,083
So, what should I substitute?

365
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,083
Well, steak and curry
sound marvelous,

366
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,333
but Hamburg steak and
melon are also good.

367
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,208
Or I could go with cake,
sushi, gyoza, pizza,

368
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,916
bean-paste bun and ramen.

369
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,041
Ah... What's on the menu today?

370
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,333
[ARMIN]
In the end,

371
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,916
Sasha got the same grades
on the makeup tests

372
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,541
as she did the
first time around.

373
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,833
Now she's in remedial classes.

374
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,083
[CONNY humming]

375
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,458
[HANGE laughing]
Yahoo!

376
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,375
[MOBLIT]
This is dangerous!

377
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,791
[ARMIN] Conny was automatically
put in remedial classes

378
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,958
because he forgot about
the makeup tests.

379
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,041
[CONNY]
Ah! Favorite time of the year.

380
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,375
[ARMIN]
Popularity.

381
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,875
Jean dreams of it,

382
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,958
lives for the day when
girls fall at his feet.

383
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,875
A certain something
found in his locker

384
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,416
might just bring that
day a little closer.
