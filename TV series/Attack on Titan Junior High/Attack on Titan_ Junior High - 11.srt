1
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,333
All right, guys.

2
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,458
We need to decide what we're
gonna do for the big festival.

3
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,375
Every class has to
arrange two things:

4
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,333
a snack stand and
something else.

5
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,083
I vote maid café!

6
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,083
[YMIR]
Huh?!

7
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,083
[CHRISTA]
Sorry, Brass Band Club's

8
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,541
already doing one of those.

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,750
Screw that! We should
totally put on a play!

10
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,000
I know the perfect actor
to play Prince Charming!

11
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,500
[ARMIN]
Hang on.

12
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,083
We don't have enough students
to run two things, right?

13
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,291
I suppose that means some of us
will have to pull double duty.

14
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,458
[MARCO]
Pretty much.

15
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,000
Correct me if I'm wrong,

16
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,875
but isn't the highlight the big
B-grade gourmet competition

17
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,333
all the snack stands
have to compete in?

18
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,583
Oo, oo! I know!

19
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,833
Our stand can do perfectly
steamed potatoes!

20
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,250
--I'm thinkin' fried chicken.
--[thud]

21
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,291
[CONY, SASHA]
Uh?

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,333
[MIKASA]
Eren?

23
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:00,208
We're gonna sell cheeseburgers!

24
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,291
[EREN laughs]
This is it, guys!

25
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,416
Our once-in-a-lifetime
chance to show the world

26
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,125
how awesome cheeseburgers
really are!

27
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,375
Don't let it go to waste!

28
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,250
We're closin' in on
being ready, yeah?

29
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,041
Almost! Hold your horses,

30
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,541
it takes a gal time to
get properly prepared!

31
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:59,208
[ARMIN] Hey. Uh, is it
necessary to go... this far?

32
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,458
Of course it is!

33
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,750
We're not gonna move
a lot of product

34
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,541
with an unsightly staff, are we?

35
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,083
Exactly!

36
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,291
And, if I may point out, last
year's winner is next door.

37
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,625
[HANNA]
They sure are!

38
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,208
[MINA] When they take
the lid off that rice pot,

39
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,458
magic happens.

40
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,333
[FRANZ] I heard so many
customers were lined up

41
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,875
they practically had a
full-scale riot on their hands.

42
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,083
Something I want you
to be aware of, Jaeger.

43
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,750
Our stand's going to win
this competition, bar none.

44
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,541
We are undisputed.

45
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,666
You just keep that
lodged in your mind.

46
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,375
Yeah?! You don't scare me!

47
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,791
Ha! Bring it!

48
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,250
Our cheeseburgers aren't gonna
go down without a fight!

49
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,083
Okay, people! Let's show
'em all how it's done!

50
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,625
[FRANZ, HANNA, MINA]
Yeah!

51
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,500
[HANNA]
Okay, now we do your makeup.

52
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,958
Try to hold still.

53
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,500
[ARMIN]
To be perfectly honest,

54
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,791
there's very little reason to
suppose this plan will work.

55
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,125
I may be naïve,

56
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,291
but there's one thing
I know beyond all doubt.

57
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,750
Sometimes, to win,

58
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,958
we have to accept the burden
of doing the unspeakable.

59
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,333
The pressure to outperform
the reigning champions

60
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,625
is tremendous.

61
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,125
To beat them,

62
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:02,000
I must be a man who can give
up even his school uniform!

63
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,291
Welcome, everybody!

64
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,750
Who wants to satisfy
their hunger

65
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,958
with a tasty cheeseburger?

66
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,125
[CROWD]
Yeah!

67
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,458
[FRANZ]
Ah...

68
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,333
[HANNA grunts]

69
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,166
[JEAN]
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

70
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,208
Who's the most popular
student of all?

71
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,708
Uh, I mean... person?

72
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,166
I must tell you, all right:

73
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,958
'tis without a doubt Snow White.

74
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,500
[JEAN] What? But I, Jean,

75
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,791
uh, I mean your Queen
should be the most popular!

76
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,125
You there! Huntsman!

77
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,500
Take this Snow White into
the woods and, well...

78
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,166
Surely you don't need me to
spell it out for you, right?

79
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,500
My Queen.

80
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,708
I shall treat the maiden
to a banquet of wild boar!

81
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,958
[JEAN]
Stop improvising!

82
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,500
Sorry to keep you waiting!

83
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,875
Allow me to put a magic
spell on your omelet rice

84
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,625
to make it even tastier.

85
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,333
Abracadabra! Become delicious!

86
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,625
Kindly eat every last bite.

87
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,416
[REINER]
I'm gonna marry her.

88
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,125
[REINER screams]

89
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,625
[BERTHOLDT]
Oh, is that not cool, man?

90
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,250
You can trade with
me if you want.

91
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,250
No, she asked me to finish it,
so that's what I'll do.

92
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,750
Another omelet rice, please!

93
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,791
[CHRISTA]
Okey-dokey!

94
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,291
Another tasty magic
spell coming up!

95
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,833
Abracadabra! Become delicious!

96
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:19,958
[REINER]
Marry her.

97
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,625
[CHRISTA]
Kindly eat every last bite.

98
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,125
[REINER]
Hey! Don't you touch it!

99
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,250
[YMIR]
Uh?

100
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,291
Reiner, no!

101
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,291
I'll be fine.

102
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,958
I've survived worse
than this. Way worse.

103
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,125
I will eat Christa's
omelet rice!

104
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,625
We will. Together.

105
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,791
[YMIR growls]
Oh yeah? What if I--!

106

[CHRISTA]
Stop! You're being mean!

107
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,541
Talk to me. Are you okay?

108
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,791
Damn right I am.

109
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,333
If I save only one omelet rice,
it's a good day.

110
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,833
[I'm not sure what that's
supposed to mean,

111
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,500
but it sounds cool!

112
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:58,666
[REINER yells]

113
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,208
What's happening?

114
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,083
No! So that red stuff
was Tabasco?

115
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,416
[CHRISTA]
Huh?

116
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,791
Look, honey, to tell
you the truth,

117
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,291
I'm not all that into it
either, it's just, y'know.

118
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,750
So, you get it. Good.

119
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,000
[HITCH]
Come on!

120
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,708
You promised we'd go
to this thing together!

121
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,125
You love this crap.
Don't try to hide it.

122
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,791
I'm on to you girlfriend.

Ow, that hurt!

So, Hitch.

00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,541
Exactly how long have
you been a cat lover?

140
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,291
I'm not a cat lover!
I'm practicing dominance!

141

You've gotta show the little
fleabags who's boss!

Here, kitty!

Kneel down before me

tuna you have in stock,

one in this relationship is.

to frighten you.

to switch places,

amazing cheeburgs really are,

every last one!

161
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,791
I go where Eren goes.
If he stays, so do I.

162
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,833
I've got his back whether
he likes it or not.

163
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,541
So just deal with it.

164
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,250
Wow! The way you
dedicate yourself

165
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,375
to cheeseburgers is
utterly inspiring!

166
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,666
I can't do that much, but I'd
sacrifice my time to the cause!

167
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,791
[ARMIN laughs]
I'm staying, too!

168
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,750
[CONNY] There's someone
sleeping on the ground!

169
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,875
[MARCO] Her cheeks are like
roses, her skin white as snow!

170
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,583
I think she may even
be a princess!

171
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,625
[CONNY] Kinda unfair all
you gotta do is lay there,

172
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,875
just sayin'.

173
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,958
It's not my fault Armin
decided not to show up.

174
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,458
Apparently the chee-burg
stand is doing really well.

175
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,708
Oh, and no offense,

176
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,833
but you're a complete
disaster in that outfit.

177
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,833
Hey, hey! Shut your face
and say your lines!

178
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,166
Okay.

179
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,708
Naturally I'd like to start with
the standard battery of test

180
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,500
we conduct on all such captures.

181
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,125
Goochi-goochi-goo!
Tickle monster alert!

182
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,083
[MOBLIT] Hange, please!
Don't get so close!

183
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,458
Aw, c'mon Sawney.

184
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:38,166
Doesn't it tickle even a
little bit? You can tell me!

185
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,291
Well, go on. Speak.

186
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,291
[HANGE yelps, laughs]

187
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,916
For the love of god:
stand clear!

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,083
[laughs] You were
a hair's breadth

189
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,041
from getting me there, darling!

190
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,583
Do you want to get your
head chomped off?!

191
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,833
Well hello there.

192
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,500
All right, ten cheeseburgers
coming up!

193
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,083
[HANNA] I need 20 more
with ketchup, stat!

194
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,291
Chop-chop!

195
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,583
I've got 30 hold the pickle,
fast as you can!

196
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,125
I'm not sure even Mikasa
can handle this many!

197
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,041
[RICO]
Order up! Thirty kamameshi!

198
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,166
[EREN, MIKASA gasp]

199
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,875
[RICO]
Thank you! Come again!

200
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,291
Ian, 50 more orders
of kamameshi, please.

201
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,875
Make the rice extra crunchy.

202
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,083
Comin' right up!

203
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,250
[EREN growls]
Ugh! Way things are goin'...

204
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:17,916
[MIKASA]
Don't worry.

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,958
[gasps]

206
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,541
Mikasa?

207
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,166
[ALL]
Whoa.

208
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
She's got this! Right!

209
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,666
Keep those orders
comin' everybody!

210
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,708
[MINA, SASHA]
Yes, sir!

211
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,625
[REINER]
What's up? How we doin'?

212
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,375
Oh, hey!

213
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,625
Don't get too comfy,

214
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,083
but word on the street
is you're neck-and-neck

215
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,375
with last year's champions.

216
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,166
The whole school smells
like cheeseburgers.

217
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,583
Everybody's got
'em on the brain.

218
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,166
Oh, that's just silly:

219
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,000
what does me having Franz on
the brain have to do with it?

220
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,250
[FRANZ]
Come on!

221
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,166
So what if I happen to
think about Hanna 24/7?

222
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,083
[EREN growls]

223
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,666
[CONNY]
Yeah, only problem is

224
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,791
since Armin no-showed Jean's the
one stuck playin' Snow White.

225
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,000
[ARMIN]
What?

226
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,833
[MARCO] Hello, dearie.
Would you like an apple?

227
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,666
[JEAN] My! What a scrumptious
looking piece of fruit!

228
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,416
Why are you and me
the only ones here?

229
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,166
The rotation system we all
agreed on went a little haywire,

230
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:02,875
so....

231
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,500
Be my guest, young lady.

232
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,333
[JEAN]
Thank you, kindly crone.

233
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,125
Stay here. I'll go
round up some help.

234
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,541
Do what you gotta do
to keep the play going.

235
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,291
Sure, fine. Just come back.

236
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,500
[groaning]

237
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,833
[cackles] At last,
Snow White is no more!

238
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:24,583
Yes! Now the most popular
person in all the land is I!

239
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,208
[MARCO]
Sorry, Jean! Keep it together!

240
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,833
[HANGE laughing]

241
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,750
Hange, is it necessary
for you to laugh?

242
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,958
Just how do you expect
me to keep from it?!

243
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,208
Ah, ha. Look at him!

244
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,791
Poor thing's absolutely
beside himself!

245
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,541
Aw, stay strong Beane!
That's my boy!

246
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,291
Oh. Look at his face, Moblit!

247
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,291
He's on the verge of
losing it! This is it!

248
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,500
Hurry up and sketch
his expression!

249
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,291
Dang it! It's going
back to normal!

250
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,625
[MOBLIT] Hange! Have you
no compassion at all?

251
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,541
[MARCO gasps]
This crowd is insane!

252
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,041
End o' the line right here!
Get your chee-burg!

253
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:04,875
[MARCO]
Conny!

254
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,125
Oh! Hi, Marco! Good timing!

255
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,833
The play's gonna tank!
You guys were supposed--

256
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,541
Here, hold this sign
for a few minutes.

257
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,333
I gotta go pee. 'Kay now, bye!

258
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,791
Hold up! Conny!

259
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,416
Hey there, Marco. Say, is
this you kids' snack stand?

260
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,541
Um, yes it is.

261
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,208
The fact we've had to
wait in line this long

262
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,291
means it's super awesome.

263
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,291
Trust me.

264
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,458
You can't tell if
the food's good

265
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,375
just by the size of
the line. Trust me.

266
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,500
People are sayin' they've got

267
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,333
a really cute server
girl on staff.

268
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,166
[ARMIN]
Thanks for waiting!

269
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,458
[ALL gasp]

270
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,958
[PETRA]
A-Armin?

271
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,708
[ARMIN] Here are the four
cheeseburgers you ordered!

272
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,750
Hope you enjoy them!

273
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:35,958
What the--?

274
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,250
Why in the world are
you dressed like that?

275
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,250
[ARMIN laughs]

276
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,708
Please tell me the
cute server girl

277
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,333
you were just talkin'
about isn't him.

278
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,541
Insolent brat!

279
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,291
How dare you make my
delicate taste buds wait

280
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,708
an inordinate amount of time
to satisfy their cra--!

281
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,583
Stop yammering
and eat already.

282
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,833
Th-This is!

283
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,625
A perfect marriage of
melty cheese and fresh,

284
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,875
high-quality, juice-filled beef.

285
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,500
The meat must've been
tenderized with a knife

286
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,500
and aged to a rich
flavor-- [groans]

287
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,583
[PETRA]
That's what you get

288
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,500
for flapping your jowls
while eating.

289
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,541
[laughs]

290
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,875
[IAN]
Rico. It's just about done.

291
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:04,916
[RICO]
Excellent!

292
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,916
[ARMIN]
Their method is incredible.

293
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,875
The rice starts on low,
ends on high.

294
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,208
And the lid stays
on till it's done.

295
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,541
Judging from the heat,

296
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,333
they'll be finished
any minute now.

297
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,083
[ARMIN]
Eren! We need to have a sale!

298
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,291
Huh? What kind of sale
are we talkin' about?

299
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,166
We're almost giving
'em away as it is!

300
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,750
[The price point stays
the same. Heh, but...

301
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,916
Now, we'll pack on
double the cheese.

302
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,833
You mean double cheeseburgers?!

303
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,166
[SASHA]
'Scuse me.

304
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,625
I feel like I'm gonna come
down with a stomach ache

305
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,166
right around that time,
so uh, can I man the line?

306
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:34,791
[MIKASA]
Like hell.

307
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,166
Come on!

308
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,500
What's the big deal?

309
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,250
Look at the crowd. I mean,
clearly we're winning.

310
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,500
For now. But any second,
the tide can turn.

311
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,083
When they remove that lid,
all bets are off.

312
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,416
[SASHA]
He's got a point, you know.

313
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,041
There's nothing like the
smell of slow-cooked rice.

314
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,250
It won't have anything

315
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,166
on the smell of our
freshly-made chee-burgs!

316
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,125
Okay! Double the cheese!

317
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,416
[ALL]
Yeah!

318
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,791
[JEAN] Oh, Princess!
How beautiful you are!

319
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,250
Your raven-black hair,
your rosy-red lips.

320
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,541
You look for all the world
as though only asleep.

321
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,666
[JEAN grunts]

322
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,416
[JEAN]
Dammit! If don't kiss this thing

323
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,250
I can't call myself a prince!

324
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:16,416
Oh fair one! Let me awaken you
with the kiss of true love.

325
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,375
[STUDENTS]
Whoa!

326
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,583
Hey! I'm acting!

327
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,583
[JEAN groans]

328
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,000
What's that?

329
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,583
It's from next door.

330
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,041
[ARMIN]
Oh no! Can it already be done?

331
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,625
[EREN growls] Damn you, Home of
the Shared Pot, Kamameshi Stand!

332
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,416
[CONNY] Check it out!
They're poppin' the lid!

333
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,750
Engage!

334
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,208
Attention, everyone!

335
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:45,500
For a special limited time
only we're offering...

336
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,416
Double cheeseburgers
with double the cheese

337
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,333
for the price of a single!

338
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,875
[CROWD cheering]

339
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,416
I've never seen so many
customers in my life!

340
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,916
[MIKASA] Sasha, did you just
slip something into your pocket?

341
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,208
I don't even like chee-burgs.
What are you talking about?

342
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,041
[REINER]
Here they come!

343
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,875
[BOY STUDENT A]
Three double cheeseburgers here!

344
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:04,958
[BOY STUDENT B]
I'll take ten!

345
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:05,916
[ORUO]
I'll take 17!

346
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
[MOBLIT]
Two for me, please!

347
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,458
[SASHA]
Let me have at least one!

348
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,166
[MIKASA]
No.

349
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,583
Not bad, for a rookie.

350
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,541
Ian, I say it's about
time we open the lid.

351
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,875
Uh?

352
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,000
What is that?

353
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:16,541
[CONNY]
Uh...

354
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,041
[ARMIN whimpers]

355
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,166
The hell's that noise?

356
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,250
Look sharp, Nile.

357
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,333
Deploy the entire
staff immediately.

358
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,166
We have to assume that a Titan
is about to rear its head.

359
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,208
[NILE]
Huh?!

360
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,208
Titans incoming! Evacuate!

361
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,791
[CROWD screams]

362
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,541
[EREN growls]

363
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,000
[MIKASA gasps]
Eren!

364
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,083
You bastards!
I will destroy you all!

365
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,208
[JEAN] Run, Chee-burg!
Are you out of your mind?!

366
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,416
[EREN yells]

367
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,291
Oh, no! It looks like they're
after the snack stands!

368
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,083
This is bad!

369
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,291
[BOY STUDENT C]
That's our sausage stand!

370
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,833
[GIRL STUDENT A]
Our octopus dumpling stand!

371
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,375
Put those down!

372
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,708
Uh. You really shouldn't
do this alone!

373
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,916
[EREN] You're not gonna
touch another snack stand!

374
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,375
I won't let you ruin
this festival!

375
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,500
Uh!

376
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:07,541
[ARMIN, SASHA gasp]

377
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,083
Eren!

378
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,000
[EREN groaning]

379
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,791
[MIKASA]
Eren!

380
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:21,333
[EREN]
No. Give them back!

381
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:27,333
They took my...
They took our chee-burgs!

382
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:31,458
Damn you, Titans!

383
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,458
[ARMIN] And just like that.
Everything changed.

384
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:11,625
At that terrible moment,
in our hearts, we knew.

385
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,625
Junior High was a pen.

386
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,291
The students, cattle.
