1
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:20,875
[BERTHOLDT]
All done!

2
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,375
Whoa. Wow, Bertholdt!
That's pretty neat!

3
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,500
It's amazing.

4
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:29,166
It's not that big of a deal.
Just the one thing I'm good at.

5
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,625
[REINER]
Bertholdt.

6
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,541
Bertholdt!

7
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,375
How does he sleep like that?

8
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,916
Hey, good for him.

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,375
I don't get why's he gotta be
all artsy about it, though.

10
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,083
[CONNY] I think it means the
sun'll come out tomorrow?

11
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,500
Bertholdt! Wake the hell up!

12
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,875
Uh. Sorry.

13
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,916
Okay, that stung a little bit.
Mornin', Reiner. How's it goin'?

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,875
[REINER] Fine. Listen,
I've got a favor to ask.

15
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:29,750
Oh, yeah?

16
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,958
It's... It's important.

17
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:32,708
[BERTHOLDT]
Mm?

18
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,250
Look, I need your help.

19
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,833
I was thinking about asking
Christa to the Summer Festival.

20
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,250
[BERTHOLDT]
Uh?!

21
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,000
[yawns] That's nice. Good luck.

22
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,416
[REINER] You're coming along
for the ride! I need a wingman!

23
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,708
What d'you mean?

24
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,416
I'd just be third wheel,
it'll cramp your style.

25
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,791
Look, in an ideal world
of course I'd want the girl

26
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,916
all to myself. Thing is...

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,291
Go on.

28
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,208
I'm... too... embarrassed.

29
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,666
Oh.

30
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,916
I bare my soul to you and
that's all you have to say?

31
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,250
[REINER]
Smirk.

32
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,416
Yeah. Just to be clear, I need
this to be a double date.

33
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,416
Wait. I gotta ask someone out?

34
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,291
Who?

35
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,416
Annie seems like a good choice.

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,250
Don't be ridiculous! Why
would I go out with Annie?

37
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,416
Talk about outta left field!

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,458
It's not like I harbor
secret feelings...

39
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,583
[REINER]
The guy's an open book.

40
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,083
You know what'd be great?

41
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,541
You and me stopping at the crepe
place over by your house!

42
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,750
Sure. You'll get fat.

43
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,250
Oh, god! Do I look like
I'm gaining weight?!

44
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,625
[REINER]
Got a minute, Christa?

45
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,416
I was wondering if
you'd like to go

46
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,333
to the Summer Festival with
me on Saturday, or whatever.

47
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,625
I mean. If you want.

48
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,541
I'd love to!

49
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,458
[REINER]
Seriously?!

50
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,875
[YMIR]
What the hell?!

51
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,833
The festival was supposed
to be a you-and-me thing!

52
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,625
Don't be silly! It's more
fun if we all go together!

53
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,791
[YMIR growls]

54
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,375
Who else d'you think
we should ask along?

55
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,333
[YMIR] Hey! Don't just
stand there like an idiot!

56
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,083
Say something

57
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,208
[REINER]
Mm?

58
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,125
I vote we make it
a big group! Party!

59
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,916
Hm... Oh, yeah! And I'll bet
they have a crepe stall!

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,875
I am totally going
to stuff my face!

61
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:52,791
[REINER, YMIR]
Smirk.

62
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,166
Here's the deal, Berthie.

63
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,625
I'm pretty much gonna shadow
Christa the entire time

64
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,791
so she doesn't get mauled
by a gorilla or something.

65
00:03:58,875 --> 00:03:59,916
A gorilla?

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,250
I'm not up for grabs
in this scenario.

67
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,708
Best bet is to ask Annie.

68
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,583
Don't be ridiculous!
Why would I do that?

69
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,875
Talk about outta left field!

70
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,750
[YMIR, REINER]
Worst poker face ever.

71
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,416
Hey, Annie. Got a minute?

72
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,583
Bertholdt has a question
he'd like to ask you.

73
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,583
[BERTHOLDT gasps]
Reiner! Ugh! Seriously?

74
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,916
Now?! Right now?!

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,333
Yes! Do not wuss out!

76
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,291
This is your chance!

77
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,833
[ANNIE]
What's up?

78
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,208
[BERTHOLDT]
U-Um, uh.

79
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,083
[ANNIE]
Hm?

80
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,250
[BERTHOLDT]
Uh, uh... D'you.

81
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:27,833
maybe...

82
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,375
wanna... Uh!

83
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,250
come with all of us to the
Summer Festival this Saturday?!

84
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,791
The Summer Festival?

85
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,291
Nah, no thanks.
Not really my scene.

86
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,333
[EREN]
Oooo! I wanna go!

87
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,916
Sounds like it'd be a blast!

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,583
Wherever Eren goes, I go.

89
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,541
Ooo. Festival! I'm in!

90
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,500
Yakisoba, cotton
candy, shaved ice,

91
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,041
grilled squid,
octopus dumplings!

92
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,458
Cool! Think they'll
have fried chicken?

93
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,666
Heh. Stick with me and
I'll teach you yokels

94
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,833
how to enjoy the Summer
Festival like a boss.

95
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,958
All right! This will
be so much fun!

96
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,708
See? D'aw! You're gonna love it!

97
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,291
[ANNIE]
What? I wasn't planning...

98
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:03,041
[REINER, YMIR, BERTHOLDT]
Wow. That escalated quickly.

99
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,375
Yeah, yeah, I know.
We've got some stragglers now.

100
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,333
But look on the bright side:
you did technically ask her out.

101
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,333
I guess. Sort of.

102
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,916
C'mon, get off it.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,458
Look, what's done is done, okay?

104
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,541
It's time for you to man up.

105
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,875
The festival's a
golden opportunity.

106
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,750
Tell her the truth,
she's not gonna bite.

107
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,916
Uh. Uh... Truth about what?

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,875
[REINER] Nice try. We all see
the way you look at her.

109
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,125
[BERTHOLDT gasps]

110
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,125
Really hope you weren't
trying to be sneaky,

111
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,291
'cause it's painfully obvious.

112
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,375
[BERTHOLDT]
Huh?

113
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,625
[YMIR]
We should call you Stare-tholdt.

114
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,708
[BERTHOLDT screams]

115
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,416
Don't come apart on me, dude.

116
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,000
Accept and move on.

117
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,458
This is your chance to tell her
how you really feel. Take it.

118
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,916
Don't be an idiot.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,500
How's he supposed
to spill the beans

120
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:46,833
with the jackass brigade in tow?

121
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,250
If he doesn't come
clean now, he never will.

122
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,000
And it's not like we have the
option of uninviting everyone.

123
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,083
[YMIR] Duh, I know. Guess
your boy's up a creek.

124
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,291
Sorry.

125
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,625
[REINER]
Nah. No worries.

126
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,833
I've got a plan.

127
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,875
[YMIR]
Uh, oh. Is it stupid?

128
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,000
[BERTHOLDT]
How did this happen?

129
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:07,333
All I want is to be with Annie.

130
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,666
[REINER] Look at me.

131
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,625
Stick to the plan and we'll
lock this down, got it?

132
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,041
[BERTHOLDT]
Yeah, sure.

133
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,708
Moving into phase one.

134
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,750
First, tell her
she looks adorable!

135
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,916
[REINER (BERTHOLDT)]
Wow, Annie.

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,375
Love the candy coating.
You look adorable.

137
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,791
[REINER (ANNIE)]
Oh, Bertholdt. Kiss!

138
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,583
[REINER] The key is to
focus on something specific.

139
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,541
Right.

140
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,583
[CHRISTA]
Thanks for waiting!

141
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,541
[BERTHOLDT]
Hm?

142
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,791
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,583
Took me longer than I
thought to get dressed.

144
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,958
[REINER]
She's... so cute!

145
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,375
Totally all right!
We haven't been here long!

146
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,000
Hey! Like the look! It's
absolutely adorable--

147
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,041
Yeah, that yukata is
absolutely adorable on you.

148
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,041
Hey, wanna get married
after the festival's over?

149
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,000
Heh. You're sweet.

150
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,500
[REINER growls]

151
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,416
Oh, Annie looks pretty swank,
too, wouldn't say, Bertie?

152
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,541
Oh, uh, oh, I-uh!

153
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,208
[YMIR]
We're waiting!

154
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,750
Oh, uh! You, you look, uh...

155
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:10,291
I'll give you a little hint:
it has to do with her yukata.

156
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,500
You. Uh, I mean. Annie.

157
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,000
[YMIR, REINER]
Now! Say it!

158
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,666
I'm really liking that knot
you have on your geta strap.

159
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,833
[REINER, YMIR]
Ow. Damn it!

160
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,083
That's too specific.

161
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,458
[EREN]
Hey, guys!

162
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,500
Was this where we were
supposed to meet up?

163
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,875
[SASHA gasps] Oh, wow! You're
rockin' that yukata, Annie!

164
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,208
It was a present from my dad.

165
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,708
Oh, Hey, guys. What'cha
got goin' on down there?

166
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,166
[YMIR, REINER growl]

167
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,750
Whaddya think we
oughta do first?

168
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,166
Meh. I dunno.

169
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,125
Just be sure to not blow through
this month's allowance,

170
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,500
your mom asked me to remind you.

171
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,750
I'm craving octopus dumplings!

172
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,541
[SASHA] I love a yukata
on you, too, Christa!

173
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,916
[CHRISTA]
How come you're not wearing one?

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,041
[SASHA]
I went jinbei.

175
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,291
A yukata's too tight
around the tummy.

176
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,500
[REINER]
Fine! On to phase two!

177
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,208
Show her your manly side...

178
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,750
at the shooting gallery!

179
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,500
I'm tellin' you, there's
nothing more macho

180
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,750
at a festival than a
sharpshooter stall.

181
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,250
This booth looks kinda
cool, wanna give it a try?

182
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,375
Sure. I'm game.

183
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,833
Uh? Hey kiddos!
The name's Ness.

184
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,541
I'm the proprietor
of this stall.

185
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,708
This here's my pet
hamster, Charrette.

186
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,000
She has sort of a thing
for chewing on folks' hair,

187
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,333
so be careful 'less you
figure on goin' bald--

188
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,875
[groaning]

189
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,375
You do know what they
say about a man

190
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,750
who can deadeye his target.

191
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,791
He can put an arrow straight
through the heart

192
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,666
of his ladylove.

193
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,000
[REINER (BERTHOLDT)]
Here you go, Annie.

194
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,083
I won it. Just for you.

195
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,791
[REINER (ANNIE)]
Oh, Bertholdt! Kiss!

196
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,875
[BERTHOLDT]
Whoa.

197
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,625
[CONNY]
Check out that aim!

198
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,750
Mikasa just bagged the
biggest prize in the booth

199
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,000
on her first shot!

200
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,333
[SASHA gasps]

201
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,625
[EREN growling]

202
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,833
[MIKASA]
Eren. This is for you.

203
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,583
Uh. Sorry, what's goin' on?

204
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,416
You, looked hungry.
Pork Fillet Cutlet-hungry.

205
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,666
[EREN]
What kind of look is that?!

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,875
No way! Another
on the first try!

207
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,500
Hey. so, uh...

208
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,500
if no one's gonna
eat that, maybe...

209
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,500
[BOTH]
Mister, one more time, please.

210
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,333
[NESS] Could you not run me
out of business, please?

211
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,958
[REINER, BERTHOLDT] Well, this
clearly wasn't the way to go.

212
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,958
Don't worry, my plan
still has a trump card

213
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,708
that'll completely
turn this around!

214
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,041
Trust me, it's foolproof!

215
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,333
Anyone else hot?

216
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,166
I could go for some
shaved ice right now.

217
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,625
Yeah, good idea.

218
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:30,750
Want some, Annie?

219
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,000
Guess that sounds okay--

220
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,416
Sounds brilliant!

221
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,458
Tell you what: let me buy some
for everybody, my treat!

222
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,291
I'll help carry!

223
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,416
[REINER]
No, wait! Guys!

224
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,083
Ugh. Fine!

225
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,083
It shouldn't affect the outcome.

226
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,958
Moving to Phase Three.

227
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,333
Operation "Look out, your
yukata'll get stained!"

228
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,916
First, Ymir will hand
Annie her shaved ice.

229
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,416
[REINER (YMIR)]
Uh-oh!

230
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,291
[REINER] Just when it's
about to plop smack-dab

231
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:58,250
on her nice outfit, sploosh!

232
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,666
[REINER (BERTHOLDT)]
You okay? Sorry 'bout that.

233
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,916
[REINER (ANNIE)]
It's all right.

234
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,958
I'd prefer a chocolate-coated
banana anyway.

235
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,000
Ahh. Love-love-love!

236
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,083
[REINER] What'd I tell ya?
It's your ace in the hole!

237
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,333
Uh... just...

238
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,416
Huh. Sure is taking them
a long time to get back.

239
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,166
[REINER]
I think we left the wrong people

240
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,166
in charge of reconnaissance.

241
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,625
I wouldn't be surprised
if they got lost.

242
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,666
[MAN A]
My pleasure, miss!

243
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,541
[BERTHOLDT]
Annie?

244
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,625
Damn! Phase Three's
a bust at this rate!

245
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,208
So? Just tweak your
stupid plan already.

246
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,416
[BERTHOLDT] Or, we could
just forget about it.

247
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,708
Oh. Great. And now
he's backing out.

248
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,583
What?! Dude! We're
trying to help!

249
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,208
Look, I know you mean well.

250
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,750
But seriously, putting Annie
in this position isn't cool.

251
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,041
[CONNY]
We made it back!

252
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,708
Huh. See?

253
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,958
That's what we get for taking
one of your shortcuts.

254
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,208
Where were you?

255
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,333
Don't worry about it,
enjoy your shaved ice!

256
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,458
[JEAN] It's basically
flavored water now!

257
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,000
[SASHA] If you don't want it,
I'll take it!

258
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:57,708
[JEAN]
Hands off!

259
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,250
[YMIR]
Smirk.

260
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,291
[JEAN grunting]

261
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,250
[YMIR]
Uh, oh!

262
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,958
Annie! Look out!

263
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,166
[ALL gasping]

264
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,416
[CHRISTA, ANNIE whimper]

265
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,458
[gasps]

266
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,208
[ANNIE]
Bertholdt.

267
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,791
You okay? Nothing
on your clothes?

268
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,541
[ANNIE]
N-No, I'm fine.

269
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,875
Good.

270
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,791
Nice save! Good thing
Bertholdt was around, huh?

271
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,166
Yeah! I'll say!

272
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,500
Those were some
catlike reflexes!

273
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,625
Are you okay?
You got drenched.

274
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,083
[BERTHOLDT] No worries,
I'll just go wash up.

275
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,083
Excuse me. I'm gonna
need a minute.

276
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,583
Uh, sure thing.

277
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,958
[BERTHOLDT sighs]
Look at me.

278
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,958
All this BS. 'Cause I don't
know how to talk to her.

279
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,666
[BOSS A]
Come one, come all!

280
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,958
Step right up and enjoy
some first-rate die-cutting!

281
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,000
You find him?

282
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,500
[JEAN]
He wasn't by the restrooms.

283
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,916
[SASHA] Where did he go? I
thought that he was coming back.

284
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,041
Crap. He totally freaked out.
We got too carried away.

285
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,791
He's gotta be somewhere.
I say we scatter.

286
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,041
[YMIR grunts]

287
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,958
[BERTHOLDT]
Uh? All done.

288
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,833
[BOSS A] Nice job.
Can that be it for now?

289
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,666
C'mon, kid. I'm a workin' man.

290
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,375
You keep this pace up, you're
gonna drive me outta business.

291
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,458
How 'bout some bonus prizes?

292
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,041
Both of 'em?

293
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,791
[BOSS A] Yeah, why not? One for
you, one for your girlfriend.

294
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:39,458
[BERTHOLDT] Oh! My what?
She's not my girlfriend!

295
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,541
[ANNIE] This is where
we all agreed to meet

296
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:46,416
once somebody found you.
The others oughta be here soon.

297
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,250
[BERTHOLDT] Sorry. You
must've looked everywhere.

298
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,458
[ANNIE]
Not really.

299
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,791
I knew you were a big
fan of die-cutting.

300
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,333
[BERTHOLDT gasps]
You remembered that, huh?

301
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,625
[ANNIE]
Of course I did.

302
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,375
So I had fairly good idea
where you might be.

303
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,208
[BERTHOLDT]
Makes sense.

304
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,708
I can't remember the last time

305
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,166
I'd been to a summer
festival, though.

306
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,708
Sorry. I shouldn't
have asked you.

307
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:09,958
I know it's not your scene,

308
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,500
but I hope you're
having a little fun.

309
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,958
It's not terrible.
I just hate crowds.

310
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,958
[gasps] I'm sorry!

311
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,458
[ANNIE]
Don't be.

312
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,250
Honestly, getting me out here
was probably a good thing.

313
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,833
[BERTHOLDT]
Huh?

314
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,583
[ANNIE] Because it's with you,
I mean. Don't take that weird.

315
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:30,125
I just don't do well around,
you know, people. And you.

316
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,708
You're someone I can
be myself with.

317
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,250
Mainly... because I don't
have to make small talk.

318
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,125
Does that put me in the Friend
Zone or somewhere even worse?

319
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,166
[ANNIE] Really, I think
of you like... like air.

320
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,750
[BERTHOLDT]
That's way worse!

321
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,833
[ANNIE laughs]

322
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:45,375
[BERTHOLDT gasps]

323
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,916
[ANNIE laughing]

324
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,291
[gasps] Hey, guys! Over here!

325
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,083
[YMIR]
Shh! Shut. up.

326
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,583
[ANNIE laughing]
Sorry, that was mean.

327
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,125
--[BERTHOLDT] Annie, would--
--[ANNIE] I shouldn't--

328
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,791
[gasps]

329
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:08,708
Annie. How do I say
this? Would you...?

330
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,791
[inaudible]

331
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,458
Sure.

332
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,083
[gasps]

333
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:27,708
Yes!

334
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,916
[ALL groaning]

335
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,958
[CHRISTA]
Uh...

336
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,333
What're you doing?

337
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,791
[REINER laughs] You did it,
man! I'm proud of ya!

338
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,458
[YMIR] I knew you'd work
around to it eventually.

339
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,791
It was only a matter of time.

340
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,750
Aw, thanks. It's no big deal.

341
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,416
Hey! Why don't we all
do some die-cutting!

342
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,000
[BOTH]
Huh?

343
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,375
[YMIR, REINER sigh]

344
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:54,083
Fantastic. All that trouble and
she said yes to die-cutting.

345
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,791
The perfect moment was
staring him in the face.

346
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,458
[EREN yells]
It keeps breaking!

347
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,750
You're good at this, Bertholdt.
Wow, look at that!

348
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,750
Thanks. It takes patience,
the secret's not to rush things.

349
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,083
See, if you're in a hurry,

350
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,000
you always press too hard
and wind up damaging it,

351
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,833
especially if you're
not super careful...

352
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,583
[REINER]
It's a start.

353
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,541
[BERTHOLDT gasps]

354
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,833
[CONNY]
Whoa! Awesome!

355
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,458
They're beautiful!

356
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,458
Wow! Incredible!

357
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,166
Beautiful.

358
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,583
[BERTHOLDT]
Huh?

359
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,458
[BERTHOLDT]
They certainly are.

360
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,166
[ARMIN]
Student council elections.

361
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,375
The goal is to be president.

362
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,125
Many are the ambitious
souls who run.

363
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,500
Legend tells of a
mysterious notebook

364
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,750
whose content heavily influences
the electoral outcome.
