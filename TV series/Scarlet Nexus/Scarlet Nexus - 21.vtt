[KASANE]
Nine, ten, eleven people.

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:15.056 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I haven't cooked
for that many in a long time.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.726 position:50% align:center
Do you cook very much, Kasane?

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] No, almost never,
I hear Yuito does sometimes.

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:25.066 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] The bowls are in
here if I remember correctly.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.068 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
How did you know?

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
It's a Sumeragi family shelter.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
They're always the same.

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:36.703 position:50% align:center
Huh... Here, I'll give
you a hand with that.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.664 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh. Thanks, that would be great.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA chuckles]

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.254 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
What?

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:49.090 position:50% align:center
It's just nice to spend
some time together.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.426 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA, KASANE giggle]

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.890 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:01.978 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:31.860 position:50% align:center
[KASANE grunts]

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:35.989 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA giggles]

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.450 position:50% align:center
Oh! Good morning, Yuito.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.285 position:50% align:center
Uh! Morning, Mom.

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:41.953 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Are you feeling okay?

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:44.372 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm good.

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,
how are you feeling?

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center
You must be tired.

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:51.046 position:50% align:center
They say time travel's
hard on your brain.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.923 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I'm alright,
but thanks for asking.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.092 position:50% align:center
Kasane caught me up on
everything that I missed,

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.677 position:50% align:center
by the way.

00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:00.388 position:50% align:center
There's also the data
that I received via BABE,

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:03.099 position:50% align:center
so I should have all
the information I need.

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:07.354 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
I told her about Karen, too.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.064 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.402 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Psionics really come
in handy at times like this,

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:15.695 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.739 position:50% align:center
[KASANE sighs]

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
You're good at that, Yuito.

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:22.535 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Yeah, I like cooking.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
I can do this, too.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.379 position:50% align:center
Wow! That's incredible!

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
I'll go take care
of the laundry.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
Uh...! Are you sure?

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] It's fine.
Be right back, Mother.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.806 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
'Kay.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.557 position:50% align:center
[YUITO sighs]

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.351 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA chuckles]

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] You can sit down and
take it easy if you want.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Thank you, dear,
but I'm alright.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.444 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
You remind me of your dad.

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.947 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Aw, you don't mean that.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50% align:center
Kaito looks way more like him.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
I don't resemble
Dad much at all.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
I don't mean your looks.
It's your personality.

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:11.209 position:50% align:center
How is Kaito?
Do you two get along?

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:15.505 position:50% align:center
He's okay.  But I wouldn't
say that we "get along."

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:19.592 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh. Listen, Yuito.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.970 position:50% align:center
I know things are complicated,

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:25.015 position:50% align:center
but your father was a
very kind and gentle man.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center
He saved me from being
murdered by Togetsu.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
And Kaito swore that
he'd change this nation.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
Ever since he was young,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.067 position:50% align:center
your brother set his
sights on politics.

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
I know, it's just...

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.030 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Not to worry.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
You're both our sons,

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
regardless of whatever may
have come between you.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
[YUITO sighs]

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA chuckles]

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
[HANABI gasps]
Good morning!

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.961 position:50% align:center
Thank you for breakfast.

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO sighs]

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:59.382 position:50% align:center
I'm confused. I thought
that you would've been

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
pulled back into
your time by now.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
My power's a bit weak, but I
can control the Red Strings.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50% align:center
We still have to hurry up,
though, don't we?

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
Yes. If we don't correct the
dimension entanglements

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
within the Kunad Gate,

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.151 position:50% align:center
then the world will
eventually go dark.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:20.236 position:50% align:center
We need to correct what?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
The errors that occur when
time has been altered.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
The Kunad Gate is a
transient dimensional hole

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
that can appear
during time travel.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
But because of the
resonance between Yuito

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
and Kasane's power, it's been
generated in a warped state.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
The Yuito in the future
told me that, too.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] We time-traveled
through a distorted portal,

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.889 position:50% align:center
which caused some
dimension entanglements.

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
But if we can untangle
all of them,

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:53.269 position:50% align:center
then we'll be able to
close the Kunad Gate.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.522 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
How do we do that?

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
Yuito, Kasane,

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:01.903 position:50% align:center
the only solution is for you
to enter the Gate together.

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] There's a conceptual
space inside it that exists only

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:10.370 position:50% align:center
for those who can wield the
power of the Red Strings.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] What? You mean the place
with all that weird imagery?

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
That's right. Where I'm from,

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
we called it the
Chronos Terminal.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
The Chronos Terminal...

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.717 position:50% align:center
It sounds kind of
like a station,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.678 position:50% align:center
except it's used
for time travel.

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
I suppose only Yuito and
Kasane can perceive it.

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
That's why when we
went to the future,

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.812 position:50% align:center
we never even noticed
it was there.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] For a Red Strings user,
simply coming into contact

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
with the terminal will
trigger an entanglement.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
No time travel is necessary.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.698 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, the only way to
determine exactly where the

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
errors have occurred is to go
and locate them yourself.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
In other words, these two really
are the only hope we've got.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:58.043 position:50% align:center
Does this mean that they have
to use the Red Strings, again?

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:01.046 position:50% align:center
Please be extra careful, okay?

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.676 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm ready.

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Mother, let's go.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Something wrong?

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
You grew up to be such
a wonderful person.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
I'm very proud of you.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:36.331 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I realize I can't take
any credit for that, of course.

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:39.042 position:50% align:center
Not after I abandoned you.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.211 position:50% align:center
I hope you know I'm sorry.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.631 position:50% align:center
No need to apologize.

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:48.051 position:50% align:center
It almost cost you
your life. It's fine.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:51.429 position:50% align:center
And I don't remember much
from Togetsu anyway.

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:52.889 position:50% align:center
Besides...

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.354 position:50% align:center
When I came to Suoh, I got
an amazing big sister.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.272 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
I see. She must be
responsible, then.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.195 position:50% align:center
I owe her thanks.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:08.613 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:16.788 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Despite all that,
she still calls me Mother.

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.832 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Shall we?

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.250 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Sure.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.048 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Dimensional entanglements

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
are represented by
tangled-looking Red Strings.

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, you'll know
how to set them right.

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:34.931 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO]
Mm.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
Come back if it's
too dangerous, okay?

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.979 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Sure thing. Please look
out for Mom while we're gone.

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
We will, just leave it to us.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.358 position:50% align:center
You have our word!

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
Thanks, guys.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.278 position:50% align:center
We're grateful.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
Now, are you kids ready to go?

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
Kasane, you good?

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:57.912 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.165 position:50% align:center
Concentrate as hard as you can.

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:02.709 position:50% align:center
Try to imagine the
Chronos Terminal.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
The Chronos Terminal.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.799 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Let's untangle the Red Strings.

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:22.687 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
It looks like we made it.

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:23.855 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Yeah.

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yuito, Kasane, this way!

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.108 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.860 position:50% align:center
Mother.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.737 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO]
Huh?

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.238 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Do you see them?

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:35.617 position:50% align:center
The dimensional entanglements
are just ahead of you now.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.118 position:50% align:center
We'll take care of them.

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
Everything'll be okay soon.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Good, be careful.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center
There they are.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
So, we need to put each point
in time where it belongs.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
Let's start here.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
Back at the old OSF Hospital.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.314 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Mm.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.539 position:50% align:center
We're inside the
dimensional entanglement.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
If we use the Red Strings...

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that should fix it.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50% align:center

[KASANE, YUITO gasp]

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
We keep mixing each other up.
We have to work together.

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center
Now, come on. Focus.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.030 position:50% align:center
Uh, right!

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
Help me out here!

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.494 position:50% align:center
I got it!

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
Not bad!

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
Now that one.

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:20.513 position:50% align:center
You know, I think Naomi
was right about you.

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
You really are kind,
a great sister.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.894 position:50% align:center
Huh? What are you
trying to say?

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps] Well, you were
born before I was, remember?

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
But we're the same age.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Kyoka said you
were in cold sleep, though.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:39.282 position:50% align:center
Either way, I appreciate you.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
You know. You saved me that day.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
I never got to say
"thank you" for that.

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.879 position:50% align:center
Okay, but why now?

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Well, ever since that happened,

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
I've been able to
harness my power.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
So, I always felt like
you must've shared

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:02.555 position:50% align:center
some of yours with me.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
Psionic abilities can't
be shared, though.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:09.020 position:50% align:center
I know that... but...

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center
...because you and
I crossed paths,

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:15.652 position:50% align:center
I'm still alive today.

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
and I achieved my goal
of enlisting in the OSF.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
Really. I'm so thankful.

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
You changed my life.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.081 position:50% align:center
Well then, you're welcome.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:29.874 position:50% align:center
Are you happy now?

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.377 position:50% align:center
Alright, that should do it.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.107 position:50% align:center
When's this?

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
It's 50 years in the future.

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.069 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] From the time
I met you in Suoh City.

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:12.667 position:50% align:center
You're kidding.
Is this really Suoh?

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:18.006 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's go. I know
right where it is.

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:20.800 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Hey! Wait!

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Yuito.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
Have you ever thought
about whether or not

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.518 position:50% align:center
you would change history?

00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
You mean by traveling
to the past like you?

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't that create a whole
new dimensional entanglement?

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.903 position:50% align:center
I mean once the
Kunad Gate is gone.

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
What if you could move freely
back and forth through time?

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I have thought about it.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:50.455 position:50% align:center
I still regret I didn't do
things differently that day.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.041 position:50% align:center
[NAGI]
Can you tell me?

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:58.213 position:50% align:center
If I'm gonna die
here regardless, at least,

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50% align:center
I'd like to know what I
could've done differently.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I had no idea what I
was supposed to say to Nagi.

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
Well tell me doesn't that make
you want to change the past?

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
No, it doesn't.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:16.356 position:50% align:center
Even if you alter the past,

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:19.067 position:50% align:center
you still don't know what
the future might hold.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
I mean... if Nagi hadn't
become my friend,

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:24.155 position:50% align:center
he wouldn't have gotten
wrapped up in this.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
And if I had never met Nagi,
then I wouldn't have

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.830 position:50% align:center
pushed myself so hard
to keep up with him.

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
So it just doesn't seem right
to change what happened,

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:35.959 position:50% align:center
not things like that.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
Nagi had his own goals
for the future, you know?

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:43.049 position:50% align:center
You can't fix it if it
makes entanglements.

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:45.885 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You shouldn't
alter someone's life

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:48.346 position:50% align:center
so it plays out
the way you want.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
That would be messed up.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:55.186 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] I'm sorry. I know
that's a bizarre question.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised, though.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
Seems you and I feel
the same way about it.

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:03.111 position:50% align:center
If someone had asked
me that years ago,

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
I probably would have
answered differently.

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.074 position:50% align:center
Maybe my view of the
world changed a little

00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
after I met you guys.

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
I get it, I feel the same.

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:15.790 position:50% align:center
It turns out you and I are
more alike than I thought.

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:20.003 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty bold
assumption for you to make.

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
I knew this was it.

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.521 position:50% align:center
We should start from the right.

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Okay.

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center

can do the left side.

little bit longer, Kasane!

piece over here.

I'll be okay.
There's only one more to go.

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You're right.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:59.019 position:50% align:center

the first time I came here!

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
It's like Mother said.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:06.109 position:50% align:center
Psionics users like
us can trigger a

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center

visiting the Chronos Terminal.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
[HANABI] She left a message
for the two of you.

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO gasp]

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yuito, Kasane, please forgive me

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
for leaving you
behind once again.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:40.615 position:50% align:center
I know I should've told
you about my plans myself,

00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
but I didn't think I could
do it without breaking down.

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I'm going to
return to my own time.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center
Well, when you hear this,
I'll have already gone back.

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:54.963 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking
about it ever since

00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
I received that data from BABE.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
I have a destiny to fulfill
and I need to play the part

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
that was assigned to me.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:09.686 position:50% align:center
If I'm going to receive the
information sent from Togetsu,

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
then I have to give their
soldiers the chance to recover

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
my brain and
connect it to BABE.

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
[YUITO whimpers]

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I'm sure this must
be hard for the two of you,

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:23.783 position:50% align:center
but I hope you know how
happy you've made me.

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
I had the opportunity to see my
beloved children become strong 

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
and courageous adults.

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
They'll get my brain, but not
that glimpse of the future.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Whatever happens,

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:42.177 position:50% align:center
I know you two will
be alright somehow.

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I thank you
for coming into my life,

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:52.312 position:50% align:center
for surviving this long
and for bringing me joy.

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:54.064 position:50% align:center
[KASANE sobs]

00:21:56.316 --> 00:22:02.322 position:50% align:center
Kaito, Yuito, Kasane, Joe.

00:22:13.124 --> 00:22:16.336 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] If I could have one
wish, it's that the happiness

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:20.548 position:50% align:center
you gave me, will be returned
to you countless times over.

00:22:20.632 --> 00:22:25.345 position:50% align:center
Yuito, Kasane, I love you.

00:22:27.764 --> 00:22:32.769 position:50% align:center
