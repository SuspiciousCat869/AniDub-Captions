We still have to hurry up,
though, don't we?

Yes. If we don't correct the
dimension entanglements

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
within the Kunad Gate,

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.151 position:50% align:center
then the world will
eventually go dark.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:20.236 position:50% align:center
We need to correct what?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
The errors that occur when
time has been altered.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
The Kunad Gate is a
transient dimensional hole

that can appear

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
But because of the
resonance between Yuito

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center

generated in a warped state.

The Yuito in the future
told me that, too.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] We time-traveled
through a distorted portal,

dimension entanglements.

But if we can untangle
all of them,

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:53.269 position:50% align:center

close the Kunad Gate.

Yuito, Kasane,

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:01.903 position:50% align:center
the only solution is for you
to enter the Gate together.

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] There's a conceptual
space inside it that exists only

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:10.370 position:50% align:center

power of the Red Strings.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] What? You mean the place
with all that weird imagery?

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
That's right. Where I'm from,

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
we called it the
Chronos Terminal.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
The Chronos Terminal...

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.717 position:50% align:center
It sounds kind of
like a station,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.678 position:50% align:center
except it's used
for time travel.

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
I suppose only Yuito and
Kasane can perceive it.

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
That's why when we
went to the future,

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.812 position:50% align:center
we never even noticed
it was there.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] For a Red Strings user,
simply coming into contact

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
with the terminal will
trigger an entanglement.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
No time travel is necessary.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.698 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, the only way to
determine exactly where the

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
errors have occurred is to go
and locate them yourself.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
In other words, these two really
are the only hope we've got.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:58.043 position:50% align:center
Does this mean that they have
to use the Red Strings, again?

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:01.046 position:50% align:center
Please be extra careful, okay?

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50% align:center

in time where it belongs.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
Let's start here.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
Back at the old OSF Hospital.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.314 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Mm.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.539 position:50% align:center
We're inside the
dimensional entanglement.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
If we use the Red Strings...

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that should fix it.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.897 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO gasp]

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
We keep mixing each other up.
We have to work together.

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center
Now, come on. Focus.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.030 position:50% align:center
Uh, right!

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
Help me out here!

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.494 position:50% align:center
I got it!

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
Not bad!

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
Now that one.

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:20.513 position:50% align:center
You know, I think Naomi
was right about you.

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
You really are kind,
a great sister.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.894 position:50% align:center
Huh? What are you
trying to say?

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps] Well, you were
born before I was, remember?

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
But we're the same age.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Kyoka said you
were in cold sleep, though.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:39.282 position:50% align:center
Either way, I appreciate you.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
You know. You saved me that day.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
I never got to say
"thank you" for that.

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.879 position:50% align:center
Okay, but why now?

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Well, ever since that happened,

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
I've been able to
harness my power.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
So, I always felt like
you must've shared

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:02.555 position:50% align:center
some of yours with me.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
Psionic abilities can't
be shared, though.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:09.020 position:50% align:center
I know that... but...

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center
...because you and
I crossed paths,

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:15.652 position:50% align:center
I'm still alive today.

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
and I achieved my goal
of enlisting in the OSF.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
Really. I'm so thankful.

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
You changed my life.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.081 position:50% align:center
Well then, you're welcome.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:29.874 position:50% align:center
Are you happy now?

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.377 position:50% align:center
Alright, that should do it.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.107 position:50% align:center
When's this?

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
It's 50 years in the future.

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.069 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] From the time
I met you in Suoh City.

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:12.667 position:50% align:center
You're kidding.
Is this really Suoh?

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:18.006 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's go. I know
right where it is.

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:20.800 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Hey! Wait!

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Yuito.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
Have you ever thought
about whether or not

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.518 position:50% align:center
you would change history?

00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
You mean by traveling
to the past like you?

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't that create a whole
new dimensional entanglement?

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.903 position:50% align:center
I mean once the
Kunad Gate is gone.

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
What if you could move freely
back and forth through time?

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I have thought about it.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:50.455 position:50% align:center
I still regret I didn't do
things differently that day.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.041 position:50% align:center
[NAGI]
Can you tell me?

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:58.213 position:50% align:center
If I'm gonna die
here regardless, at least,

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50% align:center
I'd like to know what I
could've done differently.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I had no idea what I
was supposed to say to Nagi.

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
Well tell me doesn't that make
you want to change the past?

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
No, it doesn't.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:16.356 position:50% align:center
Even if you alter the past,

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:19.067 position:50% align:center
you still don't know what
the future might hold.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
I mean... if Nagi hadn't
become my friend,

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:24.155 position:50% align:center
he wouldn't have gotten
wrapped up in this.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
And if I had never met Nagi,
then I wouldn't have

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.830 position:50% align:center
pushed myself so hard
to keep up with him.

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
So it just doesn't seem right
to change what happened,

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:35.959 position:50% align:center
not things like that.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
Nagi had his own goals
for the future, you know?

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:43.049 position:50% align:center
You can't fix it if it
makes entanglements.

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:45.885 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You shouldn't
alter someone's life

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:48.346 position:50% align:center
so it plays out
the way you want.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
That would be messed up.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:55.186 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] I'm sorry. I know
that's a bizarre question.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised, though.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
Seems you and I feel
the same way about it.

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:03.111 position:50% align:center
If someone had asked
me that years ago,

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
I probably would have
answered differently.

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.074 position:50% align:center
Maybe my view of the
world changed a little

00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
after I met you guys.

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
I get it, I feel the same.

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:15.790 position:50% align:center
It turns out you and I are
more alike than I thought.

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:20.003 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty bold
assumption for you to make.

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
I knew this was it.

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.521 position:50% align:center
We should start from the right.

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Okay.

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center

Sorry, it's nothing.

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center

can do the left side.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center

little bit longer, Kasane!

piece over here.

I'll be okay.
There's only one more to go.

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You're right.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:59.019 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait a sec...

00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, that's what I saw
the first time I came here!

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
It's like Mother said.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:06.109 position:50% align:center
Psionics users like
us can trigger a

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center

visiting the Chronos Terminal.

No!

Yuito, Kasane, please forgive me

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
for leaving you
behind once again.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:40.615 position:50% align:center
I know I should've told
you about my plans myself,

00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
but I didn't think I could
do it without breaking down.

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I'm going to
return to my own time.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center
Well, when you hear this,
I'll have already gone back.

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:54.963 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking
about it ever since

00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
I received that data from BABE.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
I have a destiny to fulfill
and I need to play the part

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
that was assigned to me.

If I'm going to receive the
information sent from Togetsu,

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
then I have to give their
soldiers the chance to recover

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
my brain and
connect it to BABE.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I'm sure this must
be hard for the two of you,

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:23.783 position:50% align:center
but I hope you know how
happy you've made me.

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
I had the opportunity to see my
beloved children become strong 

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
and courageous adults.

that glimpse of the future.

Whatever happens,

I know you two will
be alright somehow.
