For some reason, the Others

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center

they fear the same thing

The Kunad Gate.

[FUBUKI] Your brother Kaito
drafted a strategy by which

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
the Extinction Belt would be
consumed inside the Kunad Gate.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but it wouldn't work.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
Even using Kasane's
and my gravikinesis,

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:51.805 position:50% align:center
we'd need more power...

and that was using all the
brains in New Himuka.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.313 position:50% align:center
That's why this time,

we'll access Arahabaki

but the supercomputer

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
If we use SAS, we should be
able to boost our psionic power.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center

Even if there's just the
smallest chance, we have to try.

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.476 position:50% align:center
It's settled, then.

If we used Arahabaki,

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.010 position:50% align:center
then our power would
be off the charts,

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center

strength alone be enough

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.893 position:50% align:center

I did lend you my

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center

we must do what's
best for our planet,

to protect the operation team!
