Haruka. Can you help?

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:40.937 position:50% align:center
Uh... Ah! I can keep tabs
on Seiran and look out

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:42.605 position:50% align:center
for suspicious activity.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
If anything does happen,
I'll contact you immediately!

[KASANE]
Thank you. I owe you one.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center

[KAREN]
You're finally awake.

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center
All thanks to you.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:33.717 position:50% align:center
Somehow, you always know
when I need rescuing.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
The simple fact is I
can't afford to lose you.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:42.142 position:50% align:center
I see. Is it because of
my engagement to Alice?

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.311 position:50% align:center
Don't be ridiculous.

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:48.565 position:50% align:center
You're still a regiment
commander of the Suoh OSF,

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.943 position:50% align:center
which means you're
more useful alive.

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Do you remember?

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
The day Alice first
joined the force?

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
It was sunny, just like today.

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
She couldn't stop smiling.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
She was so happy she
finally caught up with us.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:22.640 position:50% align:center
Truth be told,
I was worried for her.

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:26.394 position:50% align:center
I thought... she was too kind.

00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:29.022 position:50% align:center
She just didn't have it
in her to be a soldier.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
That's right. Plus, she did
have two left feet.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:37.322 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI chuckles] Alice would
get so annoyed with you,

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:40.617 position:50% align:center
especially when you
would say that.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.329 position:50% align:center
But... she never meant it.

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I never imagined
that I'd lose Alice like that.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:50.418 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
Mm?

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
Do you ever wonder,
"what if"?

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
Like, what if she hadn't gone
on the mission that day?

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
Things would be
so different now.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.528 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] Thinking about things
like that, it's pointless.

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:36.047 position:50% align:center

What'll happen to me?

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
I'm scared.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center
I can't take it.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
I'm so scared.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:46.349 position:50% align:center
Somebody, help me, please!

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] Please, don't.
I'll be... your friend.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
Don't cry, okay? It's all right.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA]
Haruka.

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.455 position:50% align:center
We've veered pretty far off
from our normal patrol route.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:10.790 position:50% align:center
How're things on your side?

00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:13.251 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] As far as I can tell,
no one's noticed yet.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:16.129 position:50% align:center
I'll keep watching and let you
know if something changes.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.465 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA]
Thank you. You're a big help.

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:28.308 position:50% align:center
Looks like we'll have to
walk the rest of the way.

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.310 position:50% align:center
It's... so cold.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:33.813 position:50% align:center
I expected it to be cold,
but this is something else.

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:36.191 position:50% align:center
I know, right?
It's freezing out here.

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
And some areas snow year-round,
so they're always like this.

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.029 position:50% align:center
It totally sucks, doesn't it?

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:43.573 position:50% align:center
It's so cold.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] If we don't keep moving,
it'll feel even colder.

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:48.495 position:50% align:center
We can't afford to wait around.

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
Yeah. She makes a good point.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.793 position:50% align:center
This weather is terrible!

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
And all of us could get stranded
if we got hit by a blizzard.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO sighs] It's still
not too late to head back!

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center
Why don't we go home and get
a nice steamy hot pot going?

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:06.680 position:50% align:center
It's... so cold.

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:08.181 position:50% align:center
Kagero, shut it!

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
I'm just stating the obvious.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you rather be
in a warm bed right now?

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
Let's be honest
with ourselves, Shiden.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.147 position:50% align:center
This straight up sucks!

--[ARASHI whimpers] It's so-
--[SHIDEN] We get it Arashi!

Hey, you three. Come on,
stop messing around!

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center
Wait! Don't lump me in
with those morons!

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
Hm?

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
I can't believe flowers can even
grow in this kind of place.

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.174 position:50% align:center
Weird right?

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO]
If only Tsugumi were here.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
I bet she'd love them.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
Make sure you keep an eye out.

There are more
than flowers here.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] It's not unusual
for the snowfields

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:55.311 position:50% align:center
to be teeming with Others.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.439 position:50% align:center
But no one can figure out
where exactly all of them

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.024 position:50% align:center
are coming from.

00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
It's called the mystery of
the never-melting snowfields.

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:05.613 position:50% align:center
I totally get it. How can
anyone solve a mystery

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:07.615 position:50% align:center
when their brain
is frozen solid?

Yeah, it's not much farther.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:17.792 position:50% align:center
I should've asked earlier.

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:20.503 position:50% align:center
But what's it actually
like inside the city?

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:23.131 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Well, strictly
speaking, it's not a city.

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
It's really just a giant temple
for the Togetsu faith.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:30.305 position:50% align:center

place was stifling.

That's not very nice,
having different

beliefs doesn't make
them "weird".

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:40.148 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't judge other people
based on their religion.

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
I'd say it depends on
what the belief is.

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
Exactly.

I know that you have
some reservations about

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
going back to Togetsu, Kagero.

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:51.034 position:50% align:center

be a little understanding?

However, the fact remains,
Sister Kasane.

You were born in Togetsu.

I was?

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center

And you were no ordinary child.

From birth you were blessed
with immense psionic power.

I was born in New Himuka,

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center
both of my parents
were killed by Others.

They are Togetsu's secrets and
are not for outsiders to hear.

Forgive us, Sister.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.509 position:50% align:center
But would you come inside
so we can speak privately?

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:42.349 position:50% align:center
No, I won't. Whatever you
have to say to me,

00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:44.768 position:50% align:center
I'll just end up
relaying to my platoon.

time by telling me
