Then he asked me to kill
you before it was too late.

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.960 position:50% align:center
There's no way! How?

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
I see. My psionic power really
did have an effect on the gate.

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
So, you knew about it?

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:16.096 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But I didn't
want to believe it.

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
What if every time you had one
of those horrible headaches,

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
it was somehow related to
the gate? Could that be it?

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
I don't know.
But my future self--

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.442 position:50% align:center
I'm still...

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:33.238 position:50% align:center
Even in the future,

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.949 position:50% align:center
I'm powerless to do
anything on my own.

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:37.158 position:50% align:center
What a loser.

00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:40.453 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Yuito. Don't give up hope.

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
Hey. There's something
I wanted to ask you.

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
Kyoka is one of the Design
Children from Togetsu, right?

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.423 position:50% align:center
I wonder.
What about you, Kasane?

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
Huh? Where'd this come from?

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:54.843 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO gasps]

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
It's because... back in Togetsu,

00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center
we saw someone who
looked just like Kasane.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:06.104 position:50% align:center
Which means...
you really are one.

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:08.982 position:50% align:center
You're right.
That might be the case.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
You sound like you're
not so sure of that.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
Some of my memories came
back to me in Togetsu.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.867 position:50% align:center
Things like my
childhood and my mother.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
In those memories
someone said that I was

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.330 position:50% align:center
one of the Design Children.

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:29.085 position:50% align:center
Even now, none of it
seems real to me,

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:33.131 position:50% align:center
so I want to find out
the truth about my past.

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:34.924 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I shouldn't
have brought it up.

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
You're a kind soul, Hanabi.

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
It's okay, I forgive you.

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
[HANABI sighs]

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Let's move on.

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
Did you manage to
uncover anything?

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.147 position:50% align:center
You might not believe
the things we found out.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Apparently, humans
first came from the moon.

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:53.902 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO, KASANE gasp]

00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
That's impossible.
What're you saying?

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
How about you Kasane?
Have you ever heard about it?

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:00.950 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Mm.

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:02.911 position:50% align:center
And you're absolutely certain
that's what you heard?

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
Mm-- Yes.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
It was in Togetsu's records.

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:09.626 position:50% align:center
Three thousand years ago,
Humankind had to escape

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
from Earth, and so they
went to the moon.

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
A thousand years later,
a group of them came back

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
and founded New Himuka,
or so they claim.

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I don't even know
what to believe anymore.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:23.431 position:50% align:center
Have you heard of
this before, Kyoka?

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:25.684 position:50% align:center
I don't think they would
have just made it all up.

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:28.436 position:50% align:center
He's right. You're one
of the Design Children.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
And earlier you said that
you had Pope's memories.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
I didn't retain all
of her memories,

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
so I can't say for sure if
the story is true or not.

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
But I do know

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:42.200 position:50% align:center
that it matches the history
that Togetsu taught me.

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Just cause
Togetsu says it's true...

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:46.162 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec.

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.957 position:50% align:center
Togetsu's often wrong,
but not on this.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
That entire story is true.

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:53.545 position:50% align:center
They did go to the moon,
and after Earth had

00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
finally recovered, they came
back and founded New Himuka.

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:59.968 position:50% align:center
How are you sure, Kagero?

00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:03.805 position:50% align:center
Oh, my sweet Tsugumi.
Don't look at me like that.

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:06.725 position:50% align:center
You know I can't resist
when you make that face.

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:09.436 position:50% align:center
Kagero, there's something
that I've always wanted

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:10.979 position:50% align:center
to ask you about.

00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:12.689 position:50% align:center
Well, can't say I blame you.

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:13.732 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:15.233 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.610 position:50% align:center
The memory is pretty hazy.

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:21.656 position:50% align:center
But I remember seeing Kagero,
or rather, Pope does.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.783 position:50% align:center
How's he in Pope's memories?

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:26.536 position:50% align:center
Those are over 2,000 years old.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:29.914 position:50% align:center
Kagero. Who, or what are you?

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:32.083 position:50% align:center
While you're at it,
what is this place?

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
'Cause it's not
just some "hideout."

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
Heh. You always were smart.

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:39.674 position:50% align:center
The truth is, we're all inside
what's known as an Ark.

00:21:39.758 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
Basically, it's a spaceship.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.303 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
Wait wha--?

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:45.180 position:50% align:center
A spaceship?

00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
It's the same one I
rode to get to Earth.

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:50.352 position:50% align:center
Two thousand years ago, I was
part of the immigrant group

00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:52.562 position:50% align:center
that came here from the moon.

00:22:07.702 --> 00:22:11.664 position:50% align:center
[KAITO] The Sumeragi family's
dearest wish will be fulfilled.

00:22:11.748 --> 00:22:13.875 position:50% align:center
And Yuito's the key.

00:22:22.634 --> 00:22:27.514 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] This time, I won't fail.
I will save you.
