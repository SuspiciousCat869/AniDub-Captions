it warps the space around it,

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
swallowing up more and more of
this world the longer it exists.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
There's no way to stop it?

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.932 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] The gate was
sustained by my power alone,

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
so it would have vanished
if I'd been killed.

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.562 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.606 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I learned long ago that
that was the only solution.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.780 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] But, in the end,
I chose not to die.

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I was persuaded
by those around me

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.661 position:50% align:center
that there must
be some other way.

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:04.748 position:50% align:center
I searched desperately
for a means to survive.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
But now the gate has
expanded so much

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
that even my death
won't eliminate it.

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:14.215 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I failed to
make the right choice.

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Kasane, I need
you to kill me.

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
For the good of our world.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.318 position:50% align:center
There is no other option.

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
You're insane.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
Go back to your time, when the
Kunad Gate first spawned.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
Slay the false hero.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
You must kill Yuito Sumeragi.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
I can't do that!

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
Besides, I don't even know
how to go back there.

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:54.756 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
I'll tell you the way.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.132 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] The Red Strings
are triggered by

00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center
overwhelming emotions.

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
More specifically,
by traumatic events

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
that leave scars on the mind.

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
Suoh conducted cruel
government-ordered research

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:13.692 position:50% align:center
that involved turning
humans into Others.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
That day, Suoh forces attempted
to fire a metamorphosis round

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
at a Seiran soldier.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:20.782 position:50% align:center
Look out!

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
That research was conducted
at my father's directive.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
And then, as I was
their so-called "hero,"

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
I took the helm,
despite knowing the truth.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]
You took over? Really?

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.552 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] So many were turned
into Others because of me.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
Just like poor Naomi was.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.100 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] And it was all done in
the name of studying psionics

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.519 position:50% align:center
and saving my
own pitiful life!

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
Yuito! How could you?

00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:00.530 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS growl]

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, my friend.

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:04.909 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:06.244 position:50% align:center
Yuito!

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:08.288 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS growl]

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
Now, take my life!

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
Do it for the sake
of this world!

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
For the sake of the future!

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.302 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center

[KASANE gasps]

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.662 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Am I back in the present?

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Kasane! Come in!

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.291 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Haruka?

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] Don't worry,
Arashi and the others are safe.

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
They told me what happened
to all of you just now.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
Suoh's in total chaos
because of the revolt!

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.467 position:50% align:center
If you can hear me,
let's meet up!

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
Go to the-- Ah!

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:07.430 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Haruka? What's wrong?

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
There's a revolt?

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
And that's where they all are?

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] It's supposed
to vanish if I'm killed.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
So many were turned into
Others because of me.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.609 position:50% align:center
Just like poor Naomi was.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]
Yuito.

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] I couldn't return from
the future where I saw Yuito,

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
until the Red Strings
brought me back.

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
Which means this
version of the present

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center
should have a different future.

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
But the Kunad Gate
is still here.

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
If we don't do something,
the world will end!

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.219 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.763 position:50% align:center
The people of New Himuka
have been blind.

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:51.933 position:50% align:center
But today, you can't deny
the truth that's right here

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
in front of you!

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
My eyes have been opened and I
reject this surveillance state,

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
as should you.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.526 position:50% align:center
My comrades and I...

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:04.070 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Why is Karen doing this?

00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:07.449 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] ...with Seiran, a group
that shares our worldview.

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
[exhales]
Too close for comfort!

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.498 position:50% align:center
Some of them have quite
a keen sense of smell.

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
I'd better watch it.

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:21.588 position:50% align:center
Kagero...

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center

Don't waste your strength!

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
I'll call for some help!

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center

Then... can I ask you this?

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.021 position:50% align:center
Did the New Himukan government
turn Naomi Randall

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
into an Other?

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:32.367 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] So what Yuito
said 50 years from now...

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
I chose not to die.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
Now, take my life!

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
Do it for the sake

he was going to be.

And under the circumstances,
I can see why I'm a suspect.

So, when you attacked Yuito,
you'd have killed him.
