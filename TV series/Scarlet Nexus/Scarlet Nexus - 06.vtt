Kasane, check that out.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.139 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.895 position:50% align:center
Isn't that the Kunad Highway?

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:03.730 position:50% align:center
What happened to it?

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:08.318 position:50% align:center
Everyone's as
surprised as you are.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center
We woke up and it
was just like that.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.615 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:16.618 position:50% align:center
This just keeps on
getting crazier!

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
I remember everything
until the earthquake.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.123 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] Would that be
enough to cause all this?

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:23.583 position:50% align:center
The heck if I know.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.585 position:50% align:center
But it looks like there's
some kind of gravity anomaly

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.629 position:50% align:center
around that ginormous thing.

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:29.798 position:50% align:center
I'm unable to reach
Haruka at all,

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:32.759 position:50% align:center
and we've lost track
of Luka and Yuito too.

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:33.760 position:50% align:center
They're missing?

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:34.928 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA]
Mm-hm.

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:37.263 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Not good.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.891 position:50% align:center
Damn it! We need
some answers now!

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:41.726 position:50% align:center
Chill out, Shiden.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.603 position:50% align:center
If Karen really has gone rogue,

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:46.272 position:50% align:center
then things must be
bad in Suoh, too.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:49.401 position:50% align:center
Yes, we should get back there.

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:50.694 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Mm!

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:55.073 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
What in the world is this?

â™ª

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
We are back in Suoh, right?

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center
Doesn't look like it.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.717 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] It's a shell
of what it used to be.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.220 position:50% align:center
Arahabaki's not
functioning either.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] So that's why I can't
get through to Haruka.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center
I hope she's okay.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:55.568 position:50% align:center

Was that some kind of dream?

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Wait, what's that?

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Huh?

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:06.579 position:50% align:center
Kinda looks... like our
research facility.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
By "our" you mean your family's?

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] Yeah, except I don't
think Spring Pharmaceuticals

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.338 position:50% align:center
ever had a location in Suoh.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:18.383 position:50% align:center
Then maybe we're not
even in Suoh after all.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.176 position:50% align:center
Something's off.

Is it some kind of drug?

They've got Seiran's

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
This thing. I've seen it.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center

[ARASHI, KYOKA gasp]

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.098 position:50% align:center
What did he do to me?

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.642 position:50% align:center
One of the Major General's
special abilities,

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
an SS Class Skill,
called Brain Eater.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
He can copy any psionic
power and make it his own.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN] But why would
he copy Kasane's power?

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
He's used psychokinesis for
as long as I can remember!

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Couldn't catch him.

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'm confused.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
We thought this was Suoh,
in solar calendar year 2020,

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.466 position:50% align:center
but it looks like it isn't.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Well, it is Suoh,
but this is the year 2070.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.221 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
It's 2070? But how?

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.643 position:50% align:center
Did we travel into the future?

00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:17.437 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.939 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Their time ran out.

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:22.609 position:50% align:center
They say, that in order
to endure in a world

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50% align:center
that stretches across
time and space,

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:29.199 position:50% align:center
one must possess the
ability of time travel.

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.786 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
What are you saying?

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.705 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] All those who were
merely swept up in its power

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:40.085 position:50% align:center
will be pulled back into
their own time before long.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
But I stayed.

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] You've been
mistaken from the start.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
Your skill for manipulating
dimensions appeared

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:51.429 position:50% align:center
as psychokinesis, but it
is in fact gravikinesis.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:56.935 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Kasane, you are
able to time travel.

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50% align:center
You have the power
of the Red Strings.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:06.403 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
That wasn't a dream.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
Red Strings.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.616 position:50% align:center
They represent the power
to move through time?

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Arahabaki informed me
that you would be coming here

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50% align:center
from the past.

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.967 position:50% align:center
Then again, it's been
wrong half of the time.

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
So what happened?

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Following Karen
and Seiran's revolt,

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.433 position:50% align:center
the New Himukan government

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:40.145 position:50% align:center
desperately tried to
salvage its credibility.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.230 position:50% align:center
As a ploy to
distract the people,

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:45.817 position:50% align:center
they fashioned me into
the image of a brave hero

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center
that saved the nation
from certain destruction.

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
My father was assassinated,

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:54.492 position:50% align:center
and the authorities hunted
you as the accused killer.

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:56.619 position:50% align:center
Everyone thought
that I murdered him?

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Yes.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center
Yuito, you know I would
never hurt your father.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] After that, the violence
between Suoh and Seiran

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
only became worse.

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
I spent countless
days battling Others

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
and psionic soldiers
deployed by Seiran.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
And during that time,
something else began to grow.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:25.231 position:50% align:center
It was the quasi-black hole
that you and I created.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
Something that would become
known as the Kunad Gate.

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
We created it?

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.572 position:50% align:center
Our psionic power
is gravikinesis,

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center
and we both use a similar form.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:39.913 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Like you, I am
capable of time travel.

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
I possess Red Strings, as well.

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.503 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Our powers
resonated with each other,

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.005 position:50% align:center
which spawned the Kunad Gate.

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:57.764 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] However, my power
was not great enough

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
to travel across space and time.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:02.936 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]
Now what?

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] The Kunad Gate
has grown so massive

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:07.315 position:50% align:center
that it threatens to
devour the world.

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
No!

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:17.283 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] You see, the gate
appeared during our time

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:21.830 position:50% align:center
travel event and should have
disappeared shortly afterward.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
But it resonated with my power,

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center
causing it to
stabilize and persist.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:30.588 position:50% align:center
And each time I use psionics,
it warps the space around it,

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
swallowing up more and more of
this world the longer it exists.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
There's no way to stop it?

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.932 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] The gate was
sustained by my power alone,

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
so it would have vanished
if I'd been killed.

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.562 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.606 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I learned long ago that
that was the only solution.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.780 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] But, in the end,
I chose not to die.

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I was persuaded
by those around me

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.661 position:50% align:center
that there must
be some other way.

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:04.748 position:50% align:center
I searched desperately
for a means to survive.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
But now the gate has
expanded so much

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
that even my death
won't eliminate it.

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:14.215 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I failed to
make the right choice.

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Kasane, I need
you to kill me.

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
For the good of our world.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.318 position:50% align:center
There is no other option.

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
You're insane.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
Go back to your time, when the
Kunad Gate first spawned.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
Slay the false hero.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
You must kill Yuito Sumeragi.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
I can't do that!

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
Besides, I don't even know
how to go back there.

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:54.756 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
I'll tell you the way.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.132 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] The Red Strings
are triggered by

00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center
overwhelming emotions.

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
More specifically,
by traumatic events

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
that leave scars on the mind.

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
Suoh conducted cruel
government-ordered research

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:13.692 position:50% align:center
that involved turning
humans into Others.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
That day, Suoh forces attempted
to fire a metamorphosis round

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
at a Seiran soldier.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:20.782 position:50% align:center
Look out!

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
That research was conducted
at my father's directive.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
And then, as I was
their so-called "hero,"

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
I took the helm,
despite knowing the truth.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]
You took over? Really?

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.552 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] So many were turned
into Others because of me.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
Just like poor Naomi was.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.100 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] And it was all done in
the name of studying psionics

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.519 position:50% align:center
and saving my
own pitiful life!

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
Yuito! How could you?

00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:00.530 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS growl]

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, my friend.

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:04.909 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:06.244 position:50% align:center
Yuito!

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:08.288 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS growl]

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
Now, take my life!

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
Do it for the sake
of this world!

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
For the sake of the future!

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.302 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center

[KASANE gasps]

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.662 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Am I back in the present?

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Kasane! Come in!

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.291 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Haruka?

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] Don't worry,
Arashi and the others are safe.

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
They told me what happened
to all of you just now.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
Suoh's in total chaos
because of the revolt!

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.467 position:50% align:center
If you can hear me,
let's meet up!

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
Go to the-- Ah!

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:07.430 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Haruka? What's wrong?

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
There's a revolt?

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
And that's where they all are?

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] It's supposed
to vanish if I'm killed.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
So many were turned into
Others because of me.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.609 position:50% align:center
Just like poor Naomi was.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]
Yuito.

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] I couldn't return from
the future where I saw Yuito,

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
until the Red Strings
brought me back.

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
Which means this
version of the present

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center
should have a different future.

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
But the Kunad Gate
is still here.

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
If we don't do something,
the world will end!

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.219 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.763 position:50% align:center
The people of New Himuka
have been blind.

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:51.933 position:50% align:center
But today, you can't deny
the truth that's right here

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
in front of you!

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
My eyes have been opened and I
reject this surveillance state,

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
as should you.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.526 position:50% align:center
My comrades and I...

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:04.070 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Why is Karen doing this?

00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:07.449 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] ...with Seiran, a group
that shares our worldview.

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
[exhales]
Too close for comfort!

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.498 position:50% align:center
Some of them have quite
a keen sense of smell.

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
I'd better watch it.

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:21.588 position:50% align:center
Kagero...

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center

Don't waste your strength!

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
I'll call for some help!

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center

Then... can I ask you this?

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.021 position:50% align:center
Did the New Himukan government
turn Naomi Randall

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
into an Other?

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:32.367 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] So what Yuito
said 50 years from now...

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
I chose not to die.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
Now, take my life!

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
Do it for the sake

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
were sent back here?

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Hm... Red Strings.

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
And the Kunad Gate?

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:21.119 position:50% align:center
Turning people to Others?

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.287 position:50% align:center
So Naomi?

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.497 position:50% align:center
The world ends
unless Yuito dies?

00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:28.043 position:50% align:center
Do you seriously expect us to
buy into that load of crap?

00:19:28.126 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
Chairman Sumeragi
was killed tonight,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
exactly like Yuito said
he was going to be.

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
And under the circumstances,
I can see why I'm a suspect.

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
So, when you attacked Yuito,
you'd have killed him.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
[KASANE grunts]

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.479 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
This is insane!

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:50.565 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA gasps]

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
Karen!

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:58.281 position:50% align:center
I've been looking
for you, Kasane.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
[OSF SOLDIER A]
Excuse me sir!

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
It seems Arahabaki
is back online.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
[OSF SOLDIER B] Yes, and the
rebel forces have finally

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
left their stations.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
[KAITO]
I see. And Kasane Randall?

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
[OSF SOLDIER A]
We still haven't found her.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
Keep searching then.

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
[OSF SOLDIERS]
Right!

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:22.514 position:50% align:center
[KAITO]
Mm...

[HANABI sighs]

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.700 position:50% align:center
Kasane? What did you do?

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
Your knife, why is
there blood on it?

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA] Personality
rehabilitation is somewhat

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:51.209 position:50% align:center
of an open secret among
members of the OSF.

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:55.338 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Turns out it was true.

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:59.509 position:50% align:center
Everyone in this land
is livestock, meant to be used

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:03.513 position:50% align:center
and exploited exclusively for
the good of New Himuka!

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:06.683 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] And my dad and brother
knew about it the whole time.

00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
[JOE] Watch your back.
This nation wants you.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:16.401 position:50% align:center
--[YUITO grunts]
--[HANABI] Yuito?

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:19.237 position:50% align:center
It's nothing. I'm fine.

[HANABI]
Where's Kasane?

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.287 position:50% align:center
She got away.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.831 position:50% align:center
The good news is
Tsugumi confirmed

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:32.459 position:50% align:center
she rendezvoused
with Kyoka Platoon.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.423 position:50% align:center
Karen, wait!

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:44.971 position:50% align:center
And Kagero, he was with them.

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:46.389 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
Seriously?

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:48.558 position:50% align:center
Yes, and it's not
just him, either.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:51.478 position:50% align:center
Karen's convinced nearly
half the OSF now.

00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:55.607 position:50% align:center
Apparently, Seiran's going to
declare independence soon.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.192 position:50% align:center
[WATARU]
Everyone!

00:21:57.275 --> 00:21:58.234 position:50% align:center
Wataru!

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:00.362 position:50% align:center
Looks like Psynet is back up.

00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:02.489 position:50% align:center
Wataru. Haruka is--

00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:05.033 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know,
no need to tell me.

00:22:05.116 --> 00:22:07.118 position:50% align:center
She's out in the field, right?

00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:09.079 position:50% align:center
She won't ditch her friends.

00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:11.831 position:50% align:center
Not Kasane,
or anyone else, either.

00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:13.375 position:50% align:center
That's just how she is.

[YUITO]
Kaito.

00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:20.924 position:50% align:center
Come to HQ.

00:22:21.007 --> 00:22:24.886 position:50% align:center
It's time... that you
became a hero.
