This one's mine!

[SHIDEN shouts]

[GEMMA grunting]

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:33.324 position:50% align:center
Well, now.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.410 position:50% align:center
I'd say it's about to time to
head back home for a nice nap.

[RECRUITS gasp]

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN] I thought I
told you to stay back!

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.385 position:50% align:center
The only thing you had to do
was keep the Others at bay.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.137 position:50% align:center
[MALE RECRUIT A]
You did, sir.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.390 position:50% align:center
Our apologies, Commander Shiden.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:59.267 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.603 position:50% align:center
You're doing well,
Commander Shiden.

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:03.188 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Yeah, Commander Shiden.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.148 position:50% align:center
Remember to take a break
every once in a while.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.775 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
Oh, hush.

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:09.402 position:50% align:center
I always knew I'd make
commander someday,

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.029 position:50% align:center
but I didn't expect this.

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:12.572 position:50% align:center
What exactly were you expecting?

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.075 position:50% align:center
A commander's job is to
manage their platoon.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:17.452 position:50% align:center
That includes training
new recruits.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:18.828 position:50% align:center
As I remember,

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.247 position:50% align:center
Kasane was originally supposed
to be the commander.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:23.541 position:50% align:center
Wanna see if she's willing
to take her job back?

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.001 position:50% align:center
Of course not!

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.671 position:50% align:center
And plus, she's busy with
her new assignment, anyway.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.047 position:50% align:center
I'm fine.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.049 position:50% align:center
Hey, what did I miss?

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:32.509 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA]
What are you doing here?

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:35.011 position:50% align:center
I thought you were still
out on assignment.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.389 position:50% align:center
I dropped by to
give an update.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:39.683 position:50% align:center
But then I heard my name called.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.351 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.520 position:50% align:center
We were just talking about
what a great job I'm doing

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:44.813 position:50% align:center
as commander.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.106 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Mm?

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.317 position:50% align:center
You got somewhere to be?

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:53.029 position:50% align:center
Yuito's coming back, too.
We're gonna catch up a bit.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.710 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Thanks.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.591 position:50% align:center
Kasane, been a while.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:16.553 position:50% align:center
It has. You look well.

â™ª

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] They wanted me
to keep using this thing,

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
even though I don't need it.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] You should listen
to what your doctor says.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50% align:center
You ended up
volunteering after all.

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
How've you been?

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
Arashi?

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
She said she couldn't
nap with all the noise.

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
Yuito. You here to
get discharged?

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.002 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I wanted to say
hi to everyone first.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.545 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Training is exhausting.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.338 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] There's so many
new faces around here.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.215 position:50% align:center
Careful now, don't let
Commander Shiden hear you...

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:20.343 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA] The OSF's had a
flood of new recruits.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
The Extinction Belt is gone,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50% align:center
but that hasn't lessened
the threat the Others pose.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:27.767 position:50% align:center
Shiden, I heard
you got promoted.

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.227 position:50% align:center
How's that going?

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN] Great, obviously.
I'll keep working my way up.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.482 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna stop
till I'm the OSF chief.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
Are you serious? The chief?

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:40.280 position:50% align:center
There's still a lot of tension
between Suoh and Seiran.

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
We have a long way to go

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
to ensure the peace
between us lasts.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
Those in charge who
can't see that,

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
should step down and let
those who can, lead.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.584 position:50% align:center
I'll keep serving until my
discharge order comes through.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:55.462 position:50% align:center
But for now, I'll do whatever
I can to make sure the OSF

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:56.880 position:50% align:center
stays on the right path.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.507 position:50% align:center
There's nothing to worry
about with you two here.

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
Come by and visit, would ya?

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
And next time, we can
throw another <i>gyoza</i> party.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
You can have your party,

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.600 position:50% align:center
but can you try not to
go overboard again?

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:13.396 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA] A toast to the
destruction of the Kunad Gate!

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
I know it was a celebration,

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50% align:center
but you ordered
way too much <i>gyoza</i> .

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center

three whole plates.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:24.741 position:50% align:center
I can't in good conscience
let food go to waste.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
Have you seen Hanabi?

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
No, not yet.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
Alice's platoon is supposed
to go out on patrol.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
You can catch her
before they leave.

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
Is that so? Thank you.

[YUITO] How are things
with your family, Hanabi?

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
Well...

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
[MALE ANNOUNCER A]
Following allegations of

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
inhumane experiments
conducted at the OSF Hospital,

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
the hospital's
director general...

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center
[HANABI] Turns out my uncle
kept everyone in the dark.

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
My parents had no idea what
he had been doing there.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
In fact, they were more
concerned about my safety.

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
Even though things
don't look good

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
for the Ichijo family right now,

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.874 position:50% align:center
I think it's good
the truth came out.

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.877 position:50% align:center
I hope Commander Alice
isn't taking it too hard.

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine
she's too happy.

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.882 position:50% align:center
The former director general
is her brother, after all.

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.300 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
What about you, Yuito?

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:26.511 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center
The Chief was found
guilty and then deposed.

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] After my brother's
actions came to light,

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:36.187 position:50% align:center
it makes sense he'd be
removed from office.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.733 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] And while the
Extinction Belt may be gone,

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:42.485 position:50% align:center
the Sumeragi family
still has many critics.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50% align:center
But we can't allow ourselves
to wallow in the past.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
I agree.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:50.410 position:50% align:center
I was scouted before I
officially joined the OSF.

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.078 position:50% align:center
But after fighting
with you all,

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
I realized that I want to make
New Himuka a better place.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
And I'll keep
working to do that.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.254 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI] Now that the
Extinction Belt's gone,

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:02.714 position:50% align:center
things've been improving.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.633 position:50% align:center
Somehow, even the
sunlight's warmer.

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:08.303 position:50% align:center
The flowers and trees are happy.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
I'm going to do what I can
to protect this peace

for all living beings.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] So, this is
where you've been.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50% align:center
I hope you're
feeling better, Yuito.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center
You've been discharged?
We're going to miss you.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center

[YUITO, KASANE gasp]

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.410 position:50% align:center
Well, we've been engaged
for so many years already.

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I mean, it's nothing
to get so worked up about.

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
How could I not be excited?

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.292 position:50% align:center
You're getting married,
commander!

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
I'll make a bridal
bouquet for you!

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.922 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] We appreciate
your enthusiasm but...

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:46.007 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Yeah. Under the
current circumstances,

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
I don't think we'll be able
to have a ceremony.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:50.804 position:50% align:center
In that case, just have
a small one at HQ!

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
We'll think about it.

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
We have to go now.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.392 position:50% align:center
We'll talk to you
guys later, okay?

00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] Geez, there you go
making a big fuss again.

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, Arashi.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.192 position:50% align:center
Congrats on getting discharged.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
And you two,
stop nagging at them.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.197 position:50% align:center
You know they've always
taken things slowly.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
Well, the major general
needs a push now and then.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
Aren't you worried about him?

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.495 position:50% align:center
As if, I don't have
the time or energy

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
to waste on such
trivial matters.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
Wow, regiment commander.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
Congrats.

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:27.674 position:50% align:center
You're actually
leaving the OSF, huh?

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.593 position:50% align:center
Well, what are you
gonna do from now on?

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.221 position:50% align:center
I'm thinking about
going to college.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.598 position:50% align:center
There's still so much
I wanna learn.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
I see, that's good.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:40.770 position:50% align:center
There're a lot of things I
want to accomplish, too.

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.565 position:50% align:center
I'll keep serving to
the best of my ability,

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
but I also want to work
towards changing the nation.

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Change it? What do you mean?

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
Being born without psionics
shouldn't be a disability.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.243 position:50% align:center
Under the system as it is,

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
almost no thought
is given to duds.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50% align:center
It's as if they
don't even exist.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
A person without psionic power,

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50% align:center
simply can't function
in our society.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.380 position:50% align:center
I was a dud as a child

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
and was the subject of
experiments to develop psionics.

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.928 position:50% align:center
It was brutal and painful
having to endure them alone,

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
day after day.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.682 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:18.808 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
You okay?

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm fine.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
It's strange,
but I had the feeling

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
that there was
someone else with me.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO gasp]

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
And because he was there,

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
I was able to hold on even
during my darkest hours.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
But for some reason, I just
can't remember his name.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.205 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's give
it our best shots.

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:41.706 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
Kasane, I don't know what kind
of mission the higher ups

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
are planning for you,
but don't overdo it, okay?

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.632 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Right. Don't you worry.

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:05.647 position:50% align:center
It's so bizarre.
They really forgot Karen.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
Like he never existed.

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
That day, history was rewritten.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
See that? We're fine!

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
What? Is that you?

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA]
What's going on?

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.343 position:50% align:center
How come we're the only people
who still remember Karen?

00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
[LUKA] The only reason I can
think of is because of our link

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
to Yuito and Kasane via SAS.

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
It made us into pseudo
Red Strings users.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
And so, we were able to observe
what was going on in our world.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
Yuito, have you had any
migraines since then?

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.027 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
There's no need to worry.
All my headaches have gone away,

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
and my psionics
are normal again.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.410 position:50% align:center
Could it be linked to the
Kunad Gate vanishing?

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.537 position:50% align:center
Whatever the reason, I'm glad!

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.997 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.999 position:50% align:center
[HANABI grunting]

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Just like that, keep it up!

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
Hanabi, you don't
need to hold back!

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
Yes, ma'am!

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
I'm still not used to it.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
Seeing Alice like
nothing happened.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
She's been here since
before we enlisted.

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
I mean, we are in
different platoons, but...

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.685 position:50% align:center
...it's not like she...

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.316 position:50% align:center
Uh, wait...
So, what were we saying?

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
You did great.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.031 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] You said there had to
be a cause-and-effect link,

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
connecting Karen's time travel
and the fact that Alice is alive

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.744 position:50% align:center
in the present day, right?

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:44.871 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Have you been able
to find out anything else?

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.539 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
The theory that I'm going with,

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:49.292 position:50% align:center
is that it's essentially like a
ginormous butterfly effect.

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
But I can't prove it either way.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.004 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] It's like he pulled
off some sort of miracle 

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
and swapped his
existence for hers.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:00.345 position:50% align:center
Uh... Hold on a sec.
Who pulled off a miracle?

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
Karen did!

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:02.555 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Karen?

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.015 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO gasp]

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] Hm. Oh, right.
"Miracle" isn't wrong, per se,

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
but I can't say I'm
a fan of that kind of

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
illogical sentiment.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
I've been noticing it, too.

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
Almost everyone's
forgotten about Karen.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they have.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.618 position:50% align:center
Who knows if
we'll forget, too.

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]
Hey, you don't look so good.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
Yuito...! Yuito!

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Now it's just us,
we're the only ones

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
who even know that Karen
existed in the first place.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
I guess... this is
the world he wanted.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
Nothing's really
different from before,

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
except that Alice is
alive and Karen is gone.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
Even if it worked out,

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
I still believe that
Karen was wrong.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
No one should be able to
alter the course of history.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.277 position:50% align:center
It's too dangerous.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
This reality may be different,

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:05.910 position:50% align:center
but it's our world,
we have to carry on.

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Karen may have rewritten
history to his liking,

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
but still, it'll be up
to us to forge the future.

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:18.214 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center
It's our future. Not his.

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:28.600 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Here you go.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
Thanks a bunch.

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Hey, Fubuki?

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
Is someone else
going to join us?

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Kasane, you're still
planning on staying enlisted

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
with the OSF, right?

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Yeah, at least
until my next post is ready.

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:02.467 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Well, if it isn't the
hero who saved the country.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.887 position:50% align:center
Or are you a rebel?
I just can't keep track anymore.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.639 position:50% align:center
Kagero! Kyoka!

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.225 position:50% align:center
You're looking well. I'm glad.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:12.936 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I heard that you
two are going be a part

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
of the Lunar Surface
Survey project.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] Yes. At the request
of the New Himukan government.

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:19.693 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] We'll help with
cleaning up the mess

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:21.903 position:50% align:center
in Togetsu, too.

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
After BABE was terminated,

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:26.950 position:50% align:center
a bunch of systems went down,
including the cold sleep system.

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.993 position:50% align:center
So all the sleeping immigrants
from the moon woke up

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
in their capsules.

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
Though, with BABE offline,

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.749 position:50% align:center
the Togetsu faithful aren't
really much of a threat.

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
I heard that in exchange
for your service,

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:39.379 position:50% align:center
New Himuka offered
to purge your records.

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
Nothing ever gets done
without some give and take.

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Not only that,
but it shows how much

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.386 position:50% align:center
the government values
any secrets you know.

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:47.637 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50% align:center
And if what I know could
be useful to New Himuka,

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
I'm more than happy
to give it to them.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
Yuito, I've been meaning
to speak with you.

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:57.731 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:14:57.814 --> 00:14:59.524 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] It has to do
with your father.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
While the Chairman did commit
crimes against humanity,

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
it's clear that he only did
so to protect New Himuka

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
from Togetsu.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.617 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure that fact is
put in the official record.

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:11.619 position:50% align:center
Amazing. Thank you.

00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
I was wondering, Kagero,

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
what'll you do after
the project is over?

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO]
What do you mean?

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:21.379 position:50% align:center
Would you go back to the moon?
If you had the chance?

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
I lost the desire to go
back a long time ago.

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:27.260 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] I figured you'd want
to see it again at least once.

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
While I'd love to find out
what became of my family,

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:32.515 position:50% align:center
and what the Moon
is like after so long,

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
I'm okay with never knowing.

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
And plus, the decision
of whether or not I can go

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.647 position:50% align:center
isn't up to me anyway.

00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
With all the help you're giving
them, I'm sure they'd let you.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] To top it off, you were
the commander in chief

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
of the immigrants' military.
Right, General Shin Daniel?

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO gasps] I asked you
not to call me that!

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:53.036 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you
were so important!

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] We'll be counting
on you, General.

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:58.625 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO sighs]
Why even keep a record of that?

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
Those old timers are just
as annoying as ever.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:02.212 position:50% align:center
What was that, General?

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO]
Just forget it!

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
Hanabi, what's wrong?

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.967 position:50% align:center
Yuito and his
psionic powers. He...

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.344 position:50% align:center
His psionics will
never be the same.

00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
I wonder, what if we had
stopped him that day?

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center
You know he wouldn't
have listened to us.

00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:58.601 position:50% align:center
And without Yuito,
we would've...

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN] Don't you think
I already know that?

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:03.481 position:50% align:center
Besides, Kasane's just as bad.

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
She's going to get
herself killed!

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.237 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I heard you were
gonna go to the moon.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.321 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Yeah, it is.

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.368 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
You're worried. Me too.

00:17:15.452 --> 00:17:18.371 position:50% align:center
Why would she go in the
first place? I don't get it.

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:19.789 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure,

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:22.250 position:50% align:center
But the immigrant group's
data is still in Togetsu.

00:17:22.334 --> 00:17:24.753 position:50% align:center
If she used them, maybe.

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
We don't even know what the
situation is on the Moon.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.215 position:50% align:center
Worst case scenario,

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:31.885 position:50% align:center
it's been completely
overrun by Others.

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:35.305 position:50% align:center
Even so, Kasane's still going.

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
And by herself, too.

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:41.353 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] So, why did you
volunteer for the Recon Team?

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:43.897 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] We don't know what
the situation is on the moon.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center
I'll be collecting
data firsthand.

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Why don't you just send
an unmanned observation drone?

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:50.653 position:50% align:center
There's no need
to risk your life.

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:54.366 position:50% align:center
We can't. What if there are
Others attacking people?

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:57.035 position:50% align:center
Only a person with
psionics could help.

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center
That's why I have to go.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
But why you?

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:00.413 position:50% align:center
Don't you see?

00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:01.998 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:04.542 position:50% align:center
I can't live with
any more regrets.

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:06.461 position:50% align:center
If there's even a small
chance to save someone,

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
I won't give up. So...

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Kasane.

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:12.759 position:50% align:center
Everything is my fault.

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:16.429 position:50% align:center
I was fully aware of what
might happen to you.

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
But I still had you
fight alongside me.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:23.603 position:50% align:center
I made you bear the burden
all alone... that's why...

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:30.068 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I also have regrets,
ones I'll never live down.

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:31.820 position:50% align:center
It's not just you!

00:18:31.903 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
Nagi and I promised
each other...

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
...that we'd be
amazing OSF members.

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:41.705 position:50% align:center
But... look at me now.

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
Yuito. I'm sorry, I didn't...

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
I won't live
with regrets, either.

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
So I've decided... my goal...
is to get into politics.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
I want to help make the
world a better place.

00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
Where the government
doesn't lie to its people.

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
I'll advocate for people
without psionics,

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
and push for Others research.

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] I don't understand,
why research the Others?

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
I still believe there's a
way to turn metamorphosized

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
Others back to normal.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
Yuito...

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:18.742 position:50% align:center
I'll become a politician
and fix the world.

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
The way I see it, the OSF is
being dragged down by old rules.

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
People should be allowed to step
down if it's what they want.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
If you could choose,

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
you'd probably stay put,
wouldn't you Shiden?

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
Of course I would.

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:33.131 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] That's right, you wanna
become the OSF chief first.

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:34.674 position:50% align:center
That's irrelevant!

00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:37.052 position:50% align:center
I don't know what title
I'll end up having,

00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:38.386 position:50% align:center
but I'll keep serving.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.015 position:50% align:center
I agree. Who knows how long
my body will hold out,

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.768 position:50% align:center
but till it breaks down,
I'll keep on fighting.

00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
I thought so.

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:48.063 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling that
Kasane would agree.

00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:49.814 position:50% align:center
That's why she took
on that mission.

00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:54.277 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Yuito has
big plans, too.

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
He's certainly not
the type to just

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
quietly fade away
into obscurity.

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:58.865 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
If you ask me,

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:00.784 position:50% align:center
I'd say he's gonna try
his hand at politics.

00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:02.494 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
We'll have to extra work hard

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center
if we want to keep up
with Yuito and Kasane.

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:08.041 position:50% align:center
I just can't picture that
naÃ¯ve kid as a politician.

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
Why don't you just give him
some pointers, General?

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
Good idea!

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:14.923 position:50% align:center
You could totally
be Yuito's mentor!

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:16.925 position:50% align:center
What do you say, General?

00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
Sounds great, General.

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:23.181 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Could you please
stop calling me that?

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
Alright. It's about time
for me to get going now.

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center
That's just like you.

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
Politics, huh? You'll do great.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
Honestly? I wasn't
sure at first.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:40.949 position:50% align:center
But you inspired me,
and for that, thank you.

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
You don't need to thank me.

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
You see, I was
worried at first, too.

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:48.623 position:50% align:center
But even if we're alone,

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
both of us are doing
the best we can.

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
And that's what matters, right?

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.424 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
My goal is to change the world,

00:20:57.507 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
and I know it sounds like some
impossible, far off, pipe dream.

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] We've already
saved the world once,

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center
who's to say we can't change it?

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:08.601 position:50% align:center
I'm off to college
and you, the moon.

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:11.021 position:50% align:center
Even though we'll
be a world apart.

00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:13.732 position:50% align:center
We'll both be working to
create a better future.

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
You better take care of
things while I'm gone.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:18.445 position:50% align:center
Right, course I will!

00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:21.489 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'll live
in the here and now.

00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:26.327 position:50% align:center
Others sighted in District E-24!

00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
Haruka!

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Alice Platoon, move out ASAP!

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.960 position:50% align:center
[WATARU] Shiden Platoon!
Get ready to deploy!

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's go!

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:37.464 position:50% align:center
I'll come with you!

00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:38.882 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
You're going, too?

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't I? I'm still
a member of the OSF!

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:46.389 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] There are times
when we feel alone,

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:47.932 position:50% align:center
it's a part of life.

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:53.480 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
But, despite how it feels,

00:21:53.563 --> 00:21:55.398 position:50% align:center
we're all still connected.

00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:56.775 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
No matter what,

00:21:56.858 --> 00:21:58.985 position:50% align:center
there's always
someone there for us.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.716 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Our connections
span over any distance.

00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:31.601 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] That's why, even if
we can't see each other...

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.438 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO]
...they bind us together.

00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:47.659 position:50% align:center
