00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.565 position:50% align:center
I'll keep serving to
the best of my ability,

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
but I also want to work
towards changing the nation.

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Change it? What do you mean?

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
Being born without psionics
shouldn't be a disability.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.243 position:50% align:center
Under the system as it is,

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
almost no thought
is given to duds.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50% align:center
It's as if they
don't even exist.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
A person without psionic power,

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50% align:center
simply can't function
in our society.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.380 position:50% align:center
I was a dud as a child

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
and was the subject of
experiments to develop psionics.

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.928 position:50% align:center
It was brutal and painful
having to endure them alone,

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
day after day.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.682 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:18.808 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
You okay?

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm fine.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
It's strange,
but I had the feeling

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
that there was
someone else with me.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO gasp]

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
And because he was there,

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
I was able to hold on even
during my darkest hours.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
But for some reason, I just
can't remember his name.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.205 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's give
it our best shots.

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:41.706 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
Kasane, I don't know what kind
of mission the higher ups

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
are planning for you,
but don't overdo it, okay?

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.632 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Right. Don't you worry.

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:05.647 position:50% align:center
It's so bizarre.
They really forgot Karen.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
Like he never existed.

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
That day, history was rewritten.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
See that? We're fine!

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
What? Is that you?

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA]
What's going on?

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.343 position:50% align:center
How come we're the only people
who still remember Karen?

00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
[LUKA] The only reason I can
think of is because of our link

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
to Yuito and Kasane via SAS.

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
It made us into pseudo
Red Strings users.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
And so, we were able to observe
what was going on in our world.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
Yuito, have you had any
migraines since then?

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.027 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
There's no need to worry.
All my headaches have gone away,

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
and my psionics
are normal again.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.410 position:50% align:center
Could it be linked to the
Kunad Gate vanishing?

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.537 position:50% align:center
Whatever the reason, I'm glad!

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.997 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.999 position:50% align:center
[HANABI grunting]

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Just like that, keep it up!

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
Hanabi, you don't
need to hold back!

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
Yes, ma'am!

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
I'm still not used to it.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
Seeing Alice like
nothing happened.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
She's been here since
before we enlisted.

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
I mean, we are in
different platoons, but...

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.685 position:50% align:center
...it's not like she...

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.316 position:50% align:center
Uh, wait...
So, what were we saying?

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
You did great.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.031 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] You said there had to
be a cause-and-effect link,

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
connecting Karen's time travel
and the fact that Alice is alive

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.744 position:50% align:center
in the present day, right?

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:44.871 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Have you been able
to find out anything else?

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.539 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
The theory that I'm going with,

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:49.292 position:50% align:center
is that it's essentially like a
ginormous butterfly effect.

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
But I can't prove it either way.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.004 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] It's like he pulled
off some sort of miracle 

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
and swapped his
existence for hers.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:00.345 position:50% align:center
Uh... Hold on a sec.
Who pulled off a miracle?

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
Karen did!

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:02.555 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Karen?

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.015 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO gasp]

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] Hm. Oh, right.
"Miracle" isn't wrong, per se,

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
but I can't say I'm
a fan of that kind of

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
illogical sentiment.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
I've been noticing it, too.

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
Almost everyone's
forgotten about Karen.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they have.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.618 position:50% align:center
Who knows if
we'll forget, too.

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]
Hey, you don't look so good.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
Yuito...! Yuito!

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Now it's just us,
we're the only ones

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
who even know that Karen
existed in the first place.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
I guess... this is
the world he wanted.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
Nothing's really
different from before,

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
except that Alice is
alive and Karen is gone.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
Even if it worked out,

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
I still believe that
Karen was wrong.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
No one should be able to
alter the course of history.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.277 position:50% align:center
It's too dangerous.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
This reality may be different,

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:05.910 position:50% align:center
but it's our world,
we have to carry on.

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Karen may have rewritten
history to his liking,

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
but still, it'll be up
to us to forge the future.

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:18.214 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center
It's our future. Not his.

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:28.600 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Here you go.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
Thanks a bunch.

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Hey, Fubuki?

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
Is someone else
going to join us?

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Kasane, you're still
planning on staying enlisted

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
with the OSF, right?

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Yeah, at least
until my next post is ready.

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:02.467 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Well, if it isn't the
hero who saved the country.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.887 position:50% align:center
Or are you a rebel?
I just can't keep track anymore.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.639 position:50% align:center
Kagero! Kyoka!

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.225 position:50% align:center
You're looking well. I'm glad.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:12.936 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I heard that you
two are going be a part

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
of the Lunar Surface
Survey project.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] Yes. At the request
of the New Himukan government.

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:19.693 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] We'll help with
cleaning up the mess

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:21.903 position:50% align:center
in Togetsu, too.

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
After BABE was terminated,

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:26.950 position:50% align:center
a bunch of systems went down,
including the cold sleep system.

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.993 position:50% align:center
So all the sleeping immigrants
from the moon woke up

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
in their capsules.

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
Though, with BABE offline,

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.749 position:50% align:center
the Togetsu faithful aren't
really much of a threat.

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
I heard that in exchange
for your service,

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:39.379 position:50% align:center
New Himuka offered
to purge your records.

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
Nothing ever gets done
without some give and take.

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Not only that,
but it shows how much

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.386 position:50% align:center
the government values
any secrets you know.

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:47.637 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50% align:center
And if what I know could
be useful to New Himuka,

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
I'm more than happy
to give it to them.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
Yuito, I've been meaning
to speak with you.

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:57.731 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:14:57.814 --> 00:14:59.524 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] It has to do
with your father.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
While the Chairman did commit
crimes against humanity,

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
it's clear that he only did
so to protect New Himuka

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
from Togetsu.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.617 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure that fact is
put in the official record.

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:11.619 position:50% align:center
Amazing. Thank you.

00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
I was wondering, Kagero,

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
what'll you do after
the project is over?

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO]
What do you mean?

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:21.379 position:50% align:center
Would you go back to the moon?
If you had the chance?

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
I lost the desire to go
back a long time ago.

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:27.260 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] I figured you'd want
to see it again at least once.

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
While I'd love to find out
what became of my family,

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:32.515 position:50% align:center
and what the Moon
is like after so long,

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
I'm okay with never knowing.

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
And plus, the decision
of whether or not I can go

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.647 position:50% align:center
isn't up to me anyway.

00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
With all the help you're giving
them, I'm sure they'd let you.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] To top it off, you were
the commander in chief

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
of the immigrants' military.
Right, General Shin Daniel?

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO gasps] I asked you
not to call me that!

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:53.036 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you
were so important!

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] We'll be counting
on you, General.

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:58.625 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO sighs]
Why even keep a record of that?

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
Those old timers are just
as annoying as ever.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:02.212 position:50% align:center
What was that, General?

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO]
Just forget it!
