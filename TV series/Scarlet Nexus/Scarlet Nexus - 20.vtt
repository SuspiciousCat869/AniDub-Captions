I have something important

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.015 position:50% align:center
that I need to tell you.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.808 position:50% align:center
--[KASANE] Mother!
--[YUITO] It's mom!

â™ª

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.578 position:50% align:center
Kasane, what did you say?

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:04.499 position:50% align:center
"Mother" and I think
you called her "Mom".

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:06.209 position:50% align:center

I've missed you two so much.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.004 position:50% align:center
Don't let it fool you.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:12.799 position:50% align:center
It's nothing but a vision
created by BABE.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.427 position:50% align:center
[VISION]
Wakana was a precious being.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.638 position:50% align:center
She had access to the incredible
power of the Red Strings

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:21.349 position:50% align:center
and was treasured among
the Design Children.

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50% align:center
She was one of the
Design Children?

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.812 position:50% align:center
She represented the opportunity

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.189 position:50% align:center
to make our greatest
wish come true.

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:31.651 position:50% align:center
And for both of you,
of course,

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:34.738 position:50% align:center
she filled a role that
was irreplaceable.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.491 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right, she was
in charge of raising Kasane.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:41.327 position:50% align:center
But then something happened
that made her defect.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.539 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I can only hope your future

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:46.750 position:50% align:center
will be bright, sweetheart.

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:51.671 position:50% align:center
[HANABI] So, Wakana fled
Togetsu and ended up in Suoh,

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.382 position:50% align:center
which is where she met
Chairman Sumeragi?

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.051 position:50% align:center
[LUKA]
That's what it sounds like.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.094 position:50% align:center
He must've known
she was from Togetsu

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50% align:center
and didn't want to be a part
of what they were doing.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.975 position:50% align:center
He probably took her under
his wing and protected her.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
This is too much.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.854 position:50% align:center
It's hard to wrap my
head around it.

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center
I needed to reach out
to the two of you.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:13.485 position:50% align:center
That's why I decided
to assume this form.

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
Yuito, Kasane, surely you
know the Kunad Gate

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
is threatening to grow such that
it swallows up all of existence.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50% align:center
Unless I have your help,

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.624 position:50% align:center
everything will
soon be destroyed.

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.878 position:50% align:center
[VISION]
Yuito, I know I hurt you deeply

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
when I abandoned you as a child.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center
But allow me to
ease your pain now.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
And Kasane, do you
remember that puppy?

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
Imagine that same brutality
on a grand scale.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:48.603 position:50% align:center
All of humanity will die
unless we stop this.

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:52.732 position:50% align:center
Now, children, I trust that
you'll listen to my humble plea.

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.499 position:50% align:center
Using my mom for
your twisted plan?

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.292 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you people?

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
Erase countless lives

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.880 position:50% align:center
and undo the history of all
those moon immigrants?

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:17.966 position:50% align:center
My mother wouldn't want that!

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
Ignorant fools.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:23.596 position:50% align:center
Wakana's brain was restored
and integrated within me.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.933 position:50% align:center
So, it isn't just her
appearance I'm using.

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
What did you say?

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding?

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
They've built a human
brain inside of BABE?

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
My mom, she wasn't
attacked by an Other?

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50% align:center
Instead, BABE murdered her?

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.573 position:50% align:center
Togetsu, they did this?

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:44.451 position:50% align:center
It was all in the interest
of saving the world.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.286 position:50% align:center
You can skip the BS.

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center
Togetsu's only ever cared about
things that benefitted them!

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] I know you think
taking the form of our mother

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
will discourage us
from moving forward,

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:55.837 position:50% align:center
but it won't stop us!

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.673 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I won't let you
use my mom as a puppet!

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:01.509 position:50% align:center

Did it just give up and
erase its own data?

Mm. Listen, Kagero, Kyoka,

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.394 position:50% align:center

Unfortunately, the power

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.351 position:50% align:center
We should go talk to
her for ourselves.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.644 position:50% align:center
[LUKA]
Mm.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
I thought it was smaller.

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
It was before, but it's
growing quickly.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:17.742 position:50% align:center
You plan to use the Red Strings
to go back to the past?

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:22.497 position:50% align:center
I realize it's a dangerous move,
but there's no choice.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.833 position:50% align:center
I know, but won't
it place a heavy load

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:27.752 position:50% align:center
on Yuito's brain again?

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:31.256 position:50% align:center
If we do nothing,
the gate will keep growing,

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.466 position:50% align:center
which means the
world will end.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
[HANABI sighs]

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:37.345 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
It's worth a try, right?

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
I have to do everything
in my power.

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:41.391 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Mm.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
We'll be here doing
whatever we can to help.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
Coming back here, it brings
up a lot of memories.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
We have to succeed.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] I think we might
actually have a chance.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50% align:center
You do? You're pretty confident,
I wish that I felt the same way.

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:05.373 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, we're here via SAS.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center
Perfect. Thanks, Gemma.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:10.837 position:50% align:center
By the way, you need a certain
day and place in mind.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center
Have you thought of one?

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:18.261 position:50% align:center
October 4th, 2009.
Lokusho. The OSF hospital.

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:19.179 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
We'll see her there, I know it.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:25.518 position:50% align:center
Wasn't that the day when the
Others attacked Lokusho City?

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Mm. That's the day she died.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
Imagine it vividly
or try your best.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:39.324 position:50% align:center
'Kay, but I have to warn you,
I don't remember that much.

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]
Don't be afraid.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
We're not fighting alone.
Everyone's here.

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
Look who decided to
act all mature now.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA]
You try it sometime.

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
Hm?

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Listen. I'll go
to the past by myself.

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:01.137 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
You and I are the two
Red Strings users.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
All the others would
get sent right back.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
It's a burden on your brain.
You're better off staying here.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:16.444 position:50% align:center
No! I'm helping you.
I can't let you go alone.

00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
She's right.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.615 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't risk seeing
your childhood self.

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
If two instances of
the same person meet,

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.370 position:50% align:center
we don't know what could happen.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
Maybe there'd be no
problem at all,

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
but I'd much prefer
we play it safe.

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:32.293 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Yeah, but having
her go by herself...

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:35.422 position:50% align:center
Yuito. I just told you,
we're not alone.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:40.385 position:50% align:center
Besides, you possess the
same psionic power as I do.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:44.139 position:50% align:center
You can serve as a waypoint
for me to come home this time.

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:46.558 position:50% align:center
At least, I hope.

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:52.063 position:50% align:center
I'll be your lighthouse...
Alright, just be smart, okay?

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:55.025 position:50% align:center
Yes, I promise.

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Let's do it.

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO]
Hey, what's the matter? Yuito!

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.950 position:50% align:center
Yuito, are you alright?

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:48.995 position:50% align:center
Yuito... Yuito... Yuito...!

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:59.881 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yuito... Yuito... Yuito...?

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:01.174 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yuito!

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
You did such a great job, dear!

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.013 position:50% align:center
You're so strong!

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Huh?

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.561 position:50% align:center
Do you remember what's
happening today?

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Mm! I'm having a big party!

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:19.275 position:50% align:center
That's right! And there's
a special dinner, too!

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
Not just that, but I have a
really neat present to give you.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:25.073 position:50% align:center
Huh? What is it?

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA laughs] You'll have
to wait until tonight.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
Aw, why?

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.662 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Too excited?

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Mm!

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Well, then how about
we play together for a while?

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.127 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Mm!

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
So, the boy.
What are your thoughts?

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.800 position:50% align:center
Well, he hasn't displayed
any signs of change.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
That said, our dud treatment can
produce drastically different

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
results between patients.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
I see. So, it's true.

00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:57.605 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Where are you?

00:14:57.689 --> 00:14:59.983 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
You'll never guess!

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:02.318 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Don't go too far, okay?

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:05.530 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
'Kay! Come find me!

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Well now, I wonder
where my sneaky little Yuito

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
could have run off to.
Maybe he's this way?

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:13.997 position:50% align:center
[YUITO giggles]

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
Ah! Where is he?

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA gasps]

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
Um. My name is...

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
I knew this
would happen, Kasane.

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:37.854 position:50% align:center
Out of the blue, one day,
I had a vision.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:41.941 position:50% align:center
After I met you as a child,
I saw you here.

00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:43.276 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Perhaps that
proves that BABE's efforts

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
were successful.

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
The Red Strings' potential
has finally been realized.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:53.536 position:50% align:center
Mother... I don't understand.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
BABE's main CPU.

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
It's linked up to the brains
of Red Strings users

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.042 position:50% align:center
who have passed away.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.713 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] None of them had
power as immense as yours.

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:06.424 position:50% align:center
But BABE used the combined
strength of their brains

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:08.968 position:50% align:center
to generate quasi-Red Strings.

00:16:09.052 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
That way, all of the data could
be transmitted backward

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:16.518 position:50% align:center
through time into the hands
of the Red Strings user.

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:19.312 position:50% align:center
Through time? Hold on.

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:21.189 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
We were connected via my brain,

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
which lies within BABE.

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:25.652 position:50% align:center
And BABE's data was sent
to me from a different point

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
in the future.

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:28.905 position:50% align:center
Is that possible?

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
Yes. In fact, it's how
I was able to see

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:34.494 position:50% align:center
that you were alive and well.

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:38.039 position:50% align:center
You've grown up
so strong. I'm proud.

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] But this is no
time for us to reminisce.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
You have to hurry.

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:45.213 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Huh?

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:47.257 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Thank you, Mother.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
Now, I need you to
tell me whatever you can

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
about the Kunad Gate.

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:55.015 position:50% align:center
What can stop it?
Does Yuito really have to die?

00:16:56.766 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
Yes... he does.
As long as Yuito lives,

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:03.440 position:50% align:center
the Gate will continue
to consume the world.

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:04.566 position:50% align:center
Oh, no...

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:06.943 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:10.155 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] That's why I've
made my own preparations.

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
We must act, and right now,

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:14.784 position:50% align:center
while the Red Strings
are manifest.

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
You'll have to take me
with you to your own time.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:20.331 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Alright.
That's all I need to do?

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:23.418 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yes, but before we depart.

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
A present for my son.

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.632 position:50% align:center
It's finally completed.

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:32.886 position:50% align:center
This will protect him from
suffering any memory loss.

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:36.181 position:50% align:center
Typically, they're reserved for
certain patients and quite hard

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
to obtain, but I made
sure to get one.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.519 position:50% align:center
Yuito's ear cuff...

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] As long as I replace
the one he's wearing with this,

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:47.609 position:50% align:center
I'm confident he'll make it
through everything alright.

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
And then, we can be on our way.

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
