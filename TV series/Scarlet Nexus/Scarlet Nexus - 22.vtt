it's that the happiness
you gave me,

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:20.270 position:50% align:center
will be returned to you
countless times over.

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:25.108 position:50% align:center
Yuito, Kasane, I love you.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.822 position:50% align:center
Mother.

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:34.743 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait a second.

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
She went back to her own time.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
So, why is the
Kunad Gate still there?

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
No way!

Mm?

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.053 position:50% align:center
They're gone.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:04.934 position:50% align:center
They sent out the Search Team.
Just as expected.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.644 position:50% align:center
It's a good thing we moved.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.146 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised it
took them so long

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center
to try to capture us, honestly.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.150 position:50% align:center
That's because of yours truly.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:15.320 position:50% align:center
I did some tinkering with their
database when I hacked in,

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
set your status to "caught".

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center
And because of the
discrepancy in their systems,

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.743 position:50% align:center
I bet they made a list of
our last known locations

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:22.952 position:50% align:center
and are checking them.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.913 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA]
Hm?

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center
Yuito, are you feeling better?

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.417 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm okay now.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.296 position:50% align:center
So, is it safe to say that
all of the entanglements

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
have finally been unraveled?

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center
Well, all the ones that
we know of, at least.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50% align:center
from 11 and 50 years ago,
also in Yakumo Sumeragi's time, 

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:44.516 position:50% align:center
back 2,000 years.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
Yakumo? What's he got
to do with any of this?

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.062 position:50% align:center
Why would there
be an entanglement?

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess,

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:53.191 position:50% align:center
it would be because we witnessed
him being assassinated.

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
Which created an entanglement
we have to unravel.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make sense.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.156 position:50% align:center
Yakumo Sumeragi
wasn't assassinated.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.201 position:50% align:center
He's right. I've never heard
anything like that before.

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.537 position:50% align:center
[HANABI] They would've taught
us that in History class.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
We were just as
confused as you are.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
But we both saw it.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
Yakumo Sumeragi was
murdered by Karen Travers.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:16.673 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
I mean, using Arahabaki
and the Red Strings.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.053 position:50% align:center
It could be possible.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
Hold on, you're saying that
you traveled to Yakumo's time?

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
And how can you even be
sure that it was Yakumo

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50% align:center
and Karen the two of you saw?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
I have no doubts.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.150 position:50% align:center
He had on the same mask.
The one from the stories.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.694 position:50% align:center
The Same mask?

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
So that's it! That's the key.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:43.074 position:50% align:center
Yakumo's mask!
It would explain everything!

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
Kagero.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.161 position:50% align:center
You know we can't
read your mind.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
Tell us what you've figured out.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sorry.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.666 position:50% align:center
So, I'm sure you all know
the reason why Yakumo

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
started wearing
that mask, don't you?

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
Because he was injured
in an accident.

00:04:57.213 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Correct. But after
he started wearing his mask,

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
he stopped going out in public.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:03.803 position:50% align:center
And according to the rumors,

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
it was like he had become
a totally different person.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
He became a different person?

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.518 position:50% align:center
Are you saying?

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Karen came from the future,

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center
assassinated the real Yakumo
Sumeragi and then wore his mask

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
so that he could take his place?

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
If Karen replaced Yakumo,

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.448 position:50% align:center
does that mean he's
actually Yuito's ancestor?

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO]
No, that's not possible.

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
At the time of his injury,

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.871 position:50% align:center
Yakumo had already
fathered a child.

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
But, what did Karen have
to gain from killing him?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
I mean, does it matter
what his reason was?

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50% align:center
Our top priority right now
is closing the Kunad Gate.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
If Karen did travel
to Yakumo's time,

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:42.967 position:50% align:center
then there should
be an entanglement

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
at the point where he arrived.

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
One different from yours.

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50% align:center
[HANABI] Great, you just
have to unravel it!

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50% align:center
Thing is, we looked around,

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.977 position:50% align:center
but we couldn't find
any signs of it.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
So, what are we
supposed to do now?

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50% align:center
This might be out of our hands.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center
Only Wakana could fix
her entanglement.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50% align:center
I see. So it'll be
up to my brother,

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50% align:center
he'll have to take
care of his own?

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
Pretty much. We have a plan now.

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:10.829 position:50% align:center
We'll have to take Karen
to the Chronos Terminal,

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:14.165 position:50% align:center
then get him to do his
part to fix things.

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
Do you really think he'll
just play along nicely?

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:21.172 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] Wataru. Can you pinpoint
Karen's current location?

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
I've been trying,
but I've had no luck so far.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.305 position:50% align:center
I might have an idea,
where we can find him.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.224 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm?

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
Well, I hope.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:35.520 position:50% align:center
Yakumo Sumeragi lives!

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:36.438 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
What?

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center
[KAITO] He sleeps in Suoh,
deep underground.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
Even now, he's waiting for the
day of his vengeance to arrive.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.366 position:50% align:center
He's sleeping deep
underneath Suoh?

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.744 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess where
they're hiding him,

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
I'd check out the
Sumeragi tomb for sure.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
Although, it is a tourist spot.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
It's your family's tomb,
after all.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
Not sure, I've never
been inside.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:08.053 position:50% align:center
But... it's likely that
my brother knows.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center
Do you think the chief knows
the truth about Yakumo?

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.308 position:50% align:center
That he might actually be Karen?

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:16.728 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I don't know.
He kept so many secrets.

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:19.147 position:50% align:center
It's a real shame.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.067 position:50% align:center
Chief Kaito was ousted,
and placed under house arrest.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Huh?

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Sounds like the
responsibility for the public

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.908 position:50% align:center
backlash over the cover-up fell
on the chief's shoulders, huh?

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] In other words,
they used him as a scapegoat.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.746 position:50% align:center
I can't get through.

Are you sure?

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
The Kunad Gate still

We'll be able to give it our

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
full attention after
we deal with Suoh.

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50% align:center
Now isn't the time to be
arguing amongst ourselves.

Huh?

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
[KAITO] Sumeragis can't
just depend on others.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:41.146 position:50% align:center
Our family has to stay strong.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
It's our duty.

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:46.026 position:50% align:center
We must always be ready and
able to fend for ourselves.

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:50.280 position:50% align:center
For New Himuka,
for the sake of our nation.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:53.033 position:50% align:center
Find your strength, Yuito!

[YUITO gasps]
A message from Kaito.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.599 position:50% align:center
He wants to meet me, alone.

It's too dangerous!

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
Sounds like some kind of trap.

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
Be careful, after all he did
have a real plan to use you.

Because of your psionic power,

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
your brain has access to a
special form of gravikinesis

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
How did you manage to do that?

[KASANE]
He approached them with an offer

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:42.951 position:50% align:center
to jointly deal with
the Kunad Gate.

00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:45.286 position:50% align:center
After it began spinning
out of control.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA] Not only that, but Yuito
has been cleared of all charges.

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
And Wataru is back in HQ.

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:53.545 position:50% align:center
Seems that the order to
eliminate us is on hold.

00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
On hold for now, at least.

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
I'll take it.

00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
Although, we can't
afford to get complacent.

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
Right. The whole situation
is on shaky ground.

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Everyone, stay on alert!

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
[alarms buzzing]

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:36.838 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
[WATARU] Others are
spawning all over Suoh!

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.010 position:50% align:center
There's a horde of them.

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
On top of that,
the earthquake just now?

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
It's caused major damage
to the defense system!

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
The Anti-Other flak cannon

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:51.269 position:50% align:center
is operating at 70% efficiency!

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:52.854 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:05.742 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS growling]

00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:08.745 position:50% align:center
We have to get back to Suoh now!

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:11.289 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Let's move out.

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:13.708 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Yuito?

00:22:13.792 --> 00:22:14.709 position:50% align:center
[KAITO, FUBUKI gasp]

00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:19.798 position:50% align:center
