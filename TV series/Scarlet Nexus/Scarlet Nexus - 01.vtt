[NAGI] It says here Kasane's
birth parents were killed

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.228 position:50% align:center
by Others when
she was a child.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:06.940 position:50% align:center
After that, the Randall family
adopted her as their own.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
She and Naomi are the same age.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
Kasane was scouted by
OSF when she was 12

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.322 position:50% align:center
and went into their
training program.

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.408 position:50% align:center
Naomi is ranked fifth.

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
Wow, that means they're
both total elites!

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:22.205 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute,
the Randall family.

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
Kasane Randall.

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I think she was at
my dad's inaugural party.

[NAGI sighs]
So that's all you got, huh?

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:35.677 position:50% align:center
You're no help to me
at all, you know that?

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.555 position:50% align:center
Oh, and Yuito? We need to
get one thing straight.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Hm?

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
Kasane's all yours, buddy.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she kinda
freaks me out.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
I'll stick with Naomi.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50% align:center
--[door opens]
--[NAOMI] I'm relieved.

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.739 position:50% align:center
Well, this morning, you said
you had that dream

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
with the Red Strings again.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] You must never
allow the Red Strings

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.496 position:50% align:center
to escape your grasp.

[NAOMI]
What do you think it means?

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:10.128 position:50% align:center
I wonder if it might
have something to do

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
with your psionic abilities.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
Forget that. I'm much
more worried about you.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
I hope we're assigned
to the same platoon.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
I need to protect you,
since you're so clumsy.

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
Kasane! That's not
a nice thing to say!

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:27.312 position:50% align:center
There's not much info to go on.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll never
know who rescued you.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
Sucks. And my brother didn't
know anything, either.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
[HANABI] Yuito! We're in
the same platoon!

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.323 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's good to
see ya, Hanabi!

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:40.325 position:50% align:center
Oh-ho! Who is this?

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
Hanabi Ichijo.
My childhood friend.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:44.829 position:50% align:center
That's Nagi.

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
Hey there.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.582 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet ya!

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
I don't think I saw you
during training earlier.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's because I
ended up in Scouted Class.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
Oh, that makes sense.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center
[NAGI]
Hm?

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
[SETO]
Welcome to Seto Platoon, troops.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
I am Seto Narukami.
I'll be your commander.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.017 position:50% align:center
so listen.

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:07.769 position:50% align:center
As you know, we'll be
fighting with the help

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
of the Struggle Arms
System, or SAS.

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
This advanced technology allows
you to share your psionics

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:14.984 position:50% align:center
with each other in battle.

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
Now, to start off.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we should get to
know each other a bit.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
By the way, my psionic
power is electrokinesis.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
Hanabi Ichijo. Pyrokinesis!

My name's Nagi Karman.
My ability is aerokinesis.

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
Joining OSF was always my dream!

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.674 position:50% align:center
I'm Yuito Sumeragi.
I do psychokinesis.

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
When I was a kid, somebody from
OSF saved my life.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
So I'll work hard to
pay back that debt.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
[SETO] Hm. Now I'd like
to hear a few words

It's, um... Er...

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:01.406 position:50% align:center
Well, it's... It's clairvoyance.

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:04.743 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's kinda hard to
demonstrate that one, huh?

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
Oh, look! There's a
celebrity in our midst!

still so much we didn't know.

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
We'd thought of the Others

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.661 position:50% align:center
as some disaster that
had come out of nowhere.

...behind the obvious threat
they posed to our daily lives,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
was the mother
of all conspiracies.

must be destroyed...

...is this insane country!

the confusion around me...

myself the least.

butt on your first day!

True, but after you
read my report,

00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:31.703 position:50% align:center
you'll be feeling it too.

00:23:33.246 --> 00:23:35.457 position:50% align:center

severely punished.
