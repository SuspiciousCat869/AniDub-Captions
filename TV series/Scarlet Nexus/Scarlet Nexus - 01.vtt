[NAGI] It says here Kasane's
birth parents were killed

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.228 position:50% align:center
by Others when
she was a child.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:06.940 position:50% align:center
After that, the Randall family
adopted her as their own.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
She and Naomi are the same age.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
Kasane was scouted by
OSF when she was 12

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.322 position:50% align:center
and went into their
training program.

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.408 position:50% align:center
Naomi is ranked fifth.

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
Wow, that means they're
both total elites!

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:22.205 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute,
the Randall family.

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
Kasane Randall.

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I think she was at
my dad's inaugural party.

[NAGI sighs]
So that's all you got, huh?

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:35.677 position:50% align:center
You're no help to me
at all, you know that?

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.555 position:50% align:center
Oh, and Yuito? We need to
get one thing straight.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Hm?

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
Kasane's all yours, buddy.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she kinda
freaks me out.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
I'll stick with Naomi.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50% align:center
--[door opens]
--[NAOMI] I'm relieved.

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.739 position:50% align:center
Well, this morning, you said
you had that dream

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
with the Red Strings again.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] You must never
allow the Red Strings

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.496 position:50% align:center
to escape your grasp.

[NAOMI]
What do you think it means?

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:10.128 position:50% align:center
I wonder if it might
have something to do

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
with your psionic abilities.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
Forget that. I'm much
more worried about you.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
I hope we're assigned
to the same platoon.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
I need to protect you,
since you're so clumsy.

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
Kasane! That's not
a nice thing to say!

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:27.312 position:50% align:center
There's not much info to go on.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll never
know who rescued you.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
Sucks. And my brother didn't
know anything, either.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
[HANABI] Yuito! We're in
the same platoon!

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.323 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's good to
see ya, Hanabi!

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:40.325 position:50% align:center
Oh-ho! Who is this?

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
Hanabi Ichijo.
My childhood friend.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:44.829 position:50% align:center
That's Nagi.

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
Hey there.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.582 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet ya!

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
I don't think I saw you
during training earlier.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's because I
ended up in Scouted Class.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
Oh, that makes sense.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center
[NAGI]
Hm?

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
[SETO]
Welcome to Seto Platoon, troops.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
I am Seto Narukami.
I'll be your commander.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.017 position:50% align:center
so listen.

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:07.769 position:50% align:center
As you know, we'll be
fighting with the help

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
of the Struggle Arms
System, or SAS.

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
This advanced technology allows
you to share your psionics

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:14.984 position:50% align:center
with each other in battle.

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
Now, to start off.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we should get to
know each other a bit.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
By the way, my psionic
power is electrokinesis.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
Hanabi Ichijo. Pyrokinesis!

My name's Nagi Karman.
My ability is aerokinesis.

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
Joining OSF was always my dream!

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.674 position:50% align:center
I'm Yuito Sumeragi.
I do psychokinesis.

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
When I was a kid, somebody from
OSF saved my life.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
So I'll work hard to
pay back that debt.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
[SETO] Hm. Now I'd like
to hear a few words

It's, um... Er...

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:01.406 position:50% align:center
Well, it's... It's clairvoyance.

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:04.743 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's kinda hard to
demonstrate that one, huh?

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
Oh, look! There's a
celebrity in our midst!
