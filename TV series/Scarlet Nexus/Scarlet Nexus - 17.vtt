00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
I can't reach him
through brain talk.

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
I'm worried.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
[HANABI, LUKA gasp]

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.874 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid that Yuito's memory
could be fading away

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
by the second.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
[LUKA]
That's awful!

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
[HANABI] Does that mean his
past is gonna be erased?

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
Worse, possibly. He may
even lose his identity.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:40.218 position:50% align:center
But I don't wanna
think about that.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA]
Memories define a person.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
Once those are gone,
Yuito will be gone, as well.

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
What can we do?

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.477 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] There has to be
some kind of solution here!

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:52.605 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
Come on guys, let's think!

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:55.734 position:50% align:center
What if we all copied our
memories over to Yuito?

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:57.610 position:50% align:center
Are you seriously suggesting--?

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
We could try it.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
We'll reload his connection
with our own memories.

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
Reload it? What's that mean?

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
We would digitize our memory
data and then send it to him

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:10.540 position:50% align:center
using SAS.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
No way, that's insane!

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.711 position:50% align:center
We're talking about memories,
not photo albums!

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
Are you sure about this?

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
Well, it is risky.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:21.885 position:50% align:center
We have no choice.
We need to anchor his existence.

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
Do you think it'll work?

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.096 position:50% align:center
From the research I've read,

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
science deemed it
theoretically impossible.

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
Quick. Fill me in anyway.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.395 position:50% align:center
I'll cobble together
the program we need.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
Wait a second. You mean
we're doing it right now?

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.075 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Huh?

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.019 position:50% align:center
That's just...

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:15.271 position:50% align:center
I'm a super-genius, remember?

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] There might still
be problems with it--

00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
We'll deal with whatever
comes our way!

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
If it's to save Yuito,
we have to!

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:26.533 position:50% align:center
The stakes are
pretty high, aren't they?

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
That's alright. I enjoy a
good challenge now and then.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
Hanabi, you should keep
talking to Yuito.

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
External stimuli might help
delay his memory loss

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.210 position:50% align:center
a bit while we work.

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
Yuito? Hey! Can you hear me?

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center
Bingo! The program's
all coded now!

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
Already?

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:47.262 position:50% align:center
May I take a look?

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
Sure. Tell me what you think.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50% align:center
It's a partial fix.

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.811 position:50% align:center
But after we stream it,
there are other steps.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
Recheck, rebuild,
and then the embedding.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.275 position:50% align:center
We can't afford to
make any mistakes.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.778 position:50% align:center
Nice catch, I didn't
think about it that way.

00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:07.323 position:50% align:center
Well, the biggest issue is
Yuito's brain structure.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
We have to select the
right memory areas.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Hm...

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.663 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, I have the
perfect solution.

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
Yuito's brain scan data.

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:19.252 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling it would
come in handy sometime.

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:21.379 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
Why do you have that on you?

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:22.964 position:50% align:center
Back in Togetsu,

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:26.259 position:50% align:center
you guys kept accessing those
data terminals, remember?

00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center
Well, funny story, they were
stealing your information

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:29.679 position:50% align:center
the entire time!

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:31.348 position:50% align:center
Not to worry, though.

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
I deleted all of it as soon as
I caught onto their game.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center
That said, I did keep a
backup for my own records.

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:40.482 position:50% align:center
Nice going.

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:43.276 position:50% align:center
This way, we can pinpoint
the areas we need.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
At those coordinates,

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:54.704 position:50% align:center
I'm detecting some abnormal
readings, which means.

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
We're about to find just
what we're looking for,

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:59.376 position:50% align:center
