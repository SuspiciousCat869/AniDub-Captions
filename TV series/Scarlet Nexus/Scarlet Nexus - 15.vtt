Hang on! Please! Hey!

[NAGI grunts]
Yuito... I'm sorry.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:53.153 position:50% align:center
I don't know what the
hell is wrong with me.

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:55.822 position:50% align:center
A voice keeps telling
me to kill you,

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
but I don't want
to fight with you.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
I hate this but I'm so afraid I
don't know what to do anymore.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:08.418 position:50% align:center
It's fine. Trust me.
I understand.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.171 position:50% align:center
You don't need to
feel bad about it.

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:15.550 position:50% align:center
Yuito... You really are special.

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
I don't get... why all of
this had to happen to us.

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
We both achieved our
dream of joining the OSF

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.812 position:50% align:center
and then we were put
into Seto Platoon.

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
I thought we'd get to be
goofballs together forever.

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:35.653 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, Commander Seto.

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
I never said sorry, but I guess
it's... too late for that now.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
[YUITO sighs]

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
I always figured that if
I got killed, it would be

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
fighting a bunch of Others,
like, in some big battle.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:55.674 position:50% align:center
That way I could've
been a hero, like you.

00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:59.386 position:50% align:center
I wish I understood where I had
gone wrong along the way.

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me?

[YUITO whimpers]

If I'm gonna die
here regardless,

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:09.187 position:50% align:center
at least I'd like to know what
I could've done differently.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
No... please.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.075 position:50% align:center
No!

[YUITO whimpers]

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] You didn't do
anything wrong at all.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.719 position:50% align:center
Any time I was nervous,

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
you said we should focus
on getting into the OSF.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.182 position:50% align:center
Then we'd know what to do.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
I always wanted to save
as many people as I could,

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.605 position:50% align:center
but I couldn't even save you.

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
I promise.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:01.364 position:50% align:center
I'll get revenge on the
people who did this to you.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.325 position:50% align:center
He's dead?

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:06.786 position:50% align:center
No way.

[KASANE gasps]

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center
We don't have time for tears.
Are we all set, Wataru?

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
[WATARU]
Yeah. It's ready when you are.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.172 position:50% align:center
Okay, then let's get started.

[KYOKA]
Arashi?

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.260 position:50% align:center
What are you about to do?

00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:24.512 position:50% align:center
Just be quiet and let me work.

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
This isn't going to be easy.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.976 position:50% align:center
But if it's for Nagi,
I have to get it perfect!

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center
No one's tried to stop us.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.
They've dispatched everyone.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:46.409 position:50% align:center
The only person left
inside is Chief Sumeragi.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:51.790 position:50% align:center
Kaito.

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:53.541 position:50% align:center
So, you've arrived.

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:55.460 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] We came here to
speak with Suoh's officials

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
about a serious issue.

00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:01.424 position:50% align:center
But first, I want to
ask you something.

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:06.304 position:50% align:center
Tell me, did Nagi attack
me on your orders?

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.390 position:50% align:center
[KAITO] He was worthless, after
all.

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:09.724 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
We did everything we could
to make him stronger,

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
but the potential just
wasn't there to begin with.

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
How dare you talk like that?

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Why? Why did you do it, brother?

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center
Because of your psionic power.

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:28.493 position:50% align:center
Your brain has access to a
special form of gravikinesis

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.620 position:50% align:center
and Suoh must obtain it.

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:36.209 position:50% align:center
So they know what Yuito
can do. I understand now.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.253 position:50% align:center
I thought unleashing
your friend against you

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:42.340 position:50% align:center
would be enough to make you back
down, but clearly, I was wrong.

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
If you had simply listened to
government orders, Yuito,

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:48.596 position:50% align:center
we never would have been
forced to resort to this!

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.764 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
When you were first
branded as a rebel,

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.811 position:50% align:center
you should've immediately
come to me for counsel.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:57.063 position:50% align:center
The punishment would
have been lighter.

00:14:57.147 --> 00:14:59.399 position:50% align:center
You've always been this way!

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center
You make choices on your own,
never asking for advice!

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
You have no idea what it
means to be a Sumeragi,

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:09.784 position:50% align:center
and that was exactly why
Father never told you!

[YUITO]
Told me what?

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
That our family's duty is
to fulfill Yakumo Sumeragi's

[ALL gasp]

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
Okay then, and what
did he wish for?

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
I've said too much.
That isn't for you to know.

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
Let me guess. It's got something
to do with the moon, right?

[gasps]

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
We heard about him.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
That he came here with the
first group of immigrants.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
I see. You pried into things
that you shouldn't have

while in Togetsu.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
Guess so. And now
we have to talk.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
Togetsu's planning
to destroy us--

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
I don't care to listen
to their ravings.

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:49.699 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you've allowed
yourself to be brainwashed.

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:53.244 position:50% align:center
If anybody's been brainwashed,
then it's you!

00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
We double-checked
the entire story!

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:57.707 position:50% align:center
I promise you,
the whole thing's true!

00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:59.125 position:50% align:center
[KAITO]
Enough!

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:02.837 position:50% align:center
You know nothing of
Yakumo Sumeragi's dream.

00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:06.841 position:50% align:center
Then enlighten us! Tell us what
this lofty dream entailed.

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
I assume you discovered it
was the people of the Moon

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
who put the Extinction
Belt in place.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:15.767 position:50% align:center
Knowing that,

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.896 position:50% align:center
surely it's easy to understand
the extent of their selfishness.

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
After the hardships that
led to founding New Himuka,

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:25.777 position:50% align:center
Yakumo Sumeragi made
a vow and he didn't care

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.029 position:50% align:center
if he lived to see it completed.

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:30.532 position:50% align:center
One day, we would remove
the Extinction Belt

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
and attack the moon.

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:33.368 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:36.454 position:50% align:center
We're doing Yakumo
Sumeragi's will.

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:40.125 position:50% align:center
To exact his great vengeance
upon the residents of the moon.

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
His vengeance?
That's what he wanted the most?

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.547 position:50% align:center
[KAITO]
That's right.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.258 position:50% align:center
It is the will of our Founding
Father and the destiny

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:50.010 position:50% align:center
of the Sumeragi family.

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's the reason
New Himuka exists.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:56.474 position:50% align:center
We plan to use your
psionic power to move

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:57.726 position:50% align:center
the Extinction Belt.

00:16:57.809 --> 00:17:00.687 position:50% align:center
The time has come to
open the way to the moon

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.897 position:50% align:center
and claim revenge for good!

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:05.150 position:50% align:center
But I can't move that
thing on my own!

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:06.943 position:50% align:center
I'm not strong enough!

Even with mere civilian brains,

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.997 position:50% align:center
psionics can be vastly expanded
when tens of thousands

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.999 position:50% align:center
are working in tandem.

And once all of them are
connected to such a strong

our nation's military might

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:29.924 position:50% align:center
will be increased exponentially!

You can't!
They're only civilians!

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
They won't survive it!

00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
That is none of my concern.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:40.393 position:50% align:center
All I need is to access their
brains for one single maneuver.

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center
But they're not tools,
and neither am I!

get revenge for something

Yuito, look, you're a
Sumeragi, too.

This is something
that you must accept.

To hell with that.
A 2,000 year tradition?

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.479 position:50% align:center
Just because of my last name?

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.231 position:50% align:center
I'm nothing like you!

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:29.067 position:50% align:center
I wanna look for my
own truth, for me,

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
and live my life based
on my own decisions!

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.905 position:50% align:center
Then you're no
longer a Sumeragi!

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:35.407 position:50% align:center
I don't care.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.868 position:50% align:center
With or without
my name, I'm still me.

Yuito, damn you.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:46.626 position:50% align:center
In that case, I'll have
to force you to comply.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
I was hoping that we could
talk it out, but you refused.

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:53.883 position:50% align:center
That said, I won't
be your prisoner.

00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
Don't you care what Father
would think about all this?

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:02.851 position:50% align:center
I do feel bad.

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:06.980 position:50% align:center
But, he'd understand,
at least I hope so.

[GEMMA] Thanks for saving us,
but that was reckless.

[LUKA]
Sorry.

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
Yuito...

Guys. I've got an
update for you.

Can you come meet me over here?

[LUKA]
This is unbelievable.

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
It's true! When you had
that chat with the chief,

00:19:57.572 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
I was able to capture all the
audio and video for you.

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50% align:center
And I hacked into the
control system, by the way.

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
Arashi!

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you got in?

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:10.126 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] Yeah, but I really
had to stick my neck out.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:13.171 position:50% align:center
And believe me, I won't get
another chance like that one.

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:14.881 position:50% align:center
I got us the data, though.

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:17.133 position:50% align:center
It'll be useful for
my brother's plan.

[gasps]

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
I'll use Arahabaki to
transmit those images

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:22.764 position:50% align:center
all over the nation.

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
A way to enter Arahabaki.

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:27.894 position:50% align:center
It's a device that outputs
a one-time access code.

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:30.355 position:50% align:center
We haven't heard a thing
from the Major General.

[ARASHI] He won't kick
the bucket that easy.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
That's such a big decision.

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center
Yuito. You're the commander,
so I'll respect what you choose.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:45.954 position:50% align:center
And I'm ready to face
the consequences.

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center
That's what being
a team is about.

I know this will be difficult,
but Gemma's right.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
We're all prepared
to stand by you.

[TSUGUMI, HANABI]
Mm!

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:57.882 position:50% align:center
Thanks, everyone.

00:20:57.966 --> 00:21:00.301 position:50% align:center
It's hard to tell
what's right here.

Should I destroy what my family
worked so hard to protect?

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:07.267 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm really conflicted,

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
but what I do know is that
I have to take action.

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:11.771 position:50% align:center
Now that I've learned the truth,

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:14.566 position:50% align:center
I can't just sit and
do nothing, right?

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:16.317 position:50% align:center
So, here's the plan.

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
We'll head for Arahabaki and
reveal all that the government's

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:22.949 position:50% align:center
been hiding!
The people should know!

00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:24.909 position:50% align:center
We'll leave Suoh
to Yuito's group.

leadership to listen to us?

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.336 position:50% align:center
I think we should try
talking to Karen first.

Think that'll work?

At this point,

I wonder if he'll bother
giving us the time of day.

we have to give it a try.

I don't know.
