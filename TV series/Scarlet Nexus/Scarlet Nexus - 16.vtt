I hope we're assigned
to the same platoon.

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:19.394 position:50% align:center
I need to protect you
since you're so clumsy.

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:21.646 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI]
You're a kind person, Kasane.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.190 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Then I'll have to
do some investigating,

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
find out if he's a good match.

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:30.238 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI] And you've
always been so strong.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI]
Take a look, Kasane.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI]
When we wear these,

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:37.579 position:50% align:center
everybody'll know
that we're sisters!

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.543 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI] But, you've always
had a bit of a weak side.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.797 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI]
Kasane...

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.467 position:50% align:center
Kasane...

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.844 position:50% align:center
Kasane.

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center

She sounds wonderful.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:55.555 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI gasps]

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:01.978 position:50% align:center
[ALICE] I can tell your sister
is deeply important to you.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.398 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI]
Yes.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.401 position:50% align:center
Do you have somebody like that?

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:09.861 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
I have two.

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
But I wouldn't say they were
as gentle as your Kasane.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.327 position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps one of them was.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.372 position:50% align:center
However, the other one.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.207 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI]
Was the other one not nice?

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.708 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Not really.

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:27.170 position:50% align:center
Once, he said,
"people like you are..."

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:33.551 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI]
It's okay, you can tell me.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:37.222 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
Actually, I can't remember.

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:39.057 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI chuckles]

It's time to settle down.

â™ª

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.379 position:50% align:center
Are you sure that's right?

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:33.922 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Without a doubt.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
The only thing I'm not certain
of is why they're moving the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.803 position:50% align:center
human-derived Others
all of a sudden.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
I guess if Fubuki ordered it,
he must have a good reason.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
I'd agree if I thought
it was his idea. But...

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
Naomi.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:09.499 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]
Is it behind this door?

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
[YUITO grunts]

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.423 position:50% align:center
Wataru?

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:19.217 position:50% align:center
Looks like our communications
are blocked while we're in here.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50% align:center
That figures.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:33.023 position:50% align:center
It's okay. The coast is clear.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Mm.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
[HANABI] So, are we
inside Arahabaki now?

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.882 position:50% align:center
I came on a field trip
when I was a little girl,

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.051 position:50% align:center
but this seems really different.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
Arahabaki has several levels

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
and it was built deep
underneath Suoh.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
The top level's
open to the public,

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.394 position:50% align:center
so that's probably the
part you visited before.

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
He's right. This is the level
that controls everything.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
Normally, it'd be
impossible to get in.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.402 position:50% align:center

You okay?

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Not to worry.

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA] Sorry, Luka.
We've had to rely so heavily

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
on your ability to
make our way here.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
We've had soldiers tailing us
at every step of the way.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.213 position:50% align:center
What else could we do?

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:41.925 position:50% align:center
What about you, though?
How are you feeling now?

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.344 position:50% align:center
Me? Oh...

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50% align:center
Well my head feels
a lot better--

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.181 position:50% align:center
[LUKA] No. I mean
about the Chief.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI, HANABI sigh]

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center
I'd never done that.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
Just spoke my mind
to him before.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
I always held back.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:05.240 position:50% align:center
He used to say he'd follow in
Dad's footsteps no matter what.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:10.412 position:50% align:center
He and I are nothing alike.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:15.083 position:50% align:center
Still, he did always do things
according to what he believed.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] But that doesn't mean
I can forgive him for this.

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.466 position:50% align:center
[LUKA]
Brothers or not.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
Or, because he's your brother,

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
it's sometimes hard
to see eye to eye.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
Look at me and Karen.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
We almost never
understand each other.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
Ha. Yeah, that's a good point.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.732 position:50% align:center
Guess he'd be a
tough nut to crack.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.984 position:50% align:center
[LUKA chuckles]
Definitely.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center

Hm. Tsugumi, do you see anything

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:49.451 position:50% align:center
that looks like it might
be an access point?

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.077 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI grunts]

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
Arahabaki is huge,
so it's hard to say.

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
But there's one area with
fairly concentrated circuitry.

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center

Okay, let's check it out.

Yes, sir.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
[OSF SOLDIER A]
Let Chief Sumeragi know

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center

There's no need to be afraid.

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:23.777 position:50% align:center
Not anymore.

Wait, are you? You're right.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
[OSF SOLDIER C gasps]
Who's there?

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:41.544 position:50% align:center
[OSF SOLDIER A] Kasane Randall!
Why are you here?

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.672 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI]
Kasane!

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Why do you need to move
all the human-derived Others?

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.010 position:50% align:center
[OSF SOLDIER B] We're simply
carrying out orders.

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:51.429 position:50% align:center
The Other Weapons
needed to be extracted

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center
for their final adjustments.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:59.229 position:50% align:center
Perhaps the nation wants them
to fight some upcoming battle?

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
So they're planning to use
my sister as a weapon?

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
Well, they can't.
I won't let it happen!

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:09.114 position:50% align:center
Our orders come from
Major General Fubuki Spring.

We're with the Others
research facility.

If that's the case,
then where is he right now?

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
[OSF SOLDIER A] The Major
General is a very busy man.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.042 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] I find it hard
to believe that Fubuki

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:23.545 position:50% align:center

with Chief Sumeragi,

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.439 position:50% align:center
that's where their
orders came from.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.898 position:50% align:center
So that's what's up.

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
Well, this new info sort of
turns the entire narrative

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:49.320 position:50% align:center

something like this.

With such powerful weapons,

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center
we'll be able to deal a
