I've been so worried.

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:25.730 position:50% align:center
Just hearing you say
that puts me at ease.

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
Why would you ever be
worried about me?

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:31.194 position:50% align:center
I was the one who
always worried!

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
I felt like I had
to keep you safe!

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:37.325 position:50% align:center
I need to protect you,
since you're so clumsy.

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
Kasane! That's not
a nice thing to say!

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
I know. I was wrong.

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:48.962 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Oh, Sis. Please forgive me.

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:54.426 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA]
Kasane, don't torture yourself.

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:56.469 position:50% align:center
That's not what
your sister wants.

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
She's right. It's obvious
you were worried about her,

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:02.267 position:50% align:center
but the one good thing to come
out of this is that both of you

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
are still alive.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
And now we finally
know where she is.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.190 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI]
I'm sorry, Commander Kyoka.

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
Just look at me.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
I can't believe what a
terrible thing I've become.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.364 position:50% align:center
It's all right. Really!

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center
How is your life here?

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:19.451 position:50% align:center
Are you healthy?

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
They're not treating
you badly, are they?

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI]
No, I'm fine.

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:29.753 position:50% align:center
The people have been very kind,
even to an Other like myself.

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:32.464 position:50% align:center
You sound... hurt.

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI] Kind of, you see,
without the ampules,

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
the pain is unbearable.

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.473 position:50% align:center
I'm not even able
to communicate.

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:45.060 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI]
Listen, Kasane.

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
You need to leave this
place and never come back.

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.816 position:50% align:center
I want you to forget about me.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
Please, it's the only way!

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
No! I can't! I'll never do that!

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
Not after all I did
just to get to you!

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI] The drug from
the ampule's worn off.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, Kasane,
but you have to leave.

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:09.501 position:50% align:center
Get out of here, now.

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
Hurry...! Hurry!

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
Kasane! Let's go!

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:16.883 position:50% align:center
This is the best thing
we can do for her now!

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:18.343 position:50% align:center
Sis, no!

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:23.431 position:50% align:center
[NAOMI roars]

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
I thought that
this might happen.

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:33.274 position:50% align:center
[KAREN grunts]

--[NAOMI roars]
--[KASANE gasps]

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:49.708 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO]
Well, Major General.

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
You've got us right where
you want us now, don't you?

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
Have we been dancing to
your tune from the start?

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
The ampules allow
Naomi to retain

00:20:57.632 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
some semblance of herself.

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:02.887 position:50% align:center
Problem is, they're nothing
more than a stop-gap.

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:06.725 position:50% align:center
Is there any way to bring
her back to her human form?

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:08.685 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
There may be, Kasane,

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:11.521 position:50% align:center
but we'll need your
psionic power.

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
My power?

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
You'll have to stand by while
preparations are made.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
Until then, I'll try
to keep her alive.

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:21.990 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but we can't trust you.

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:25.660 position:50% align:center
Not when so many secrets
are being kept from us.

00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
What can I answer?

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:29.330 position:50% align:center
Just one question.

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
These ampules you're
giving Naomi...

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.836 position:50% align:center
I want you to tell
me what's in them.

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:38.506 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
I'm relieved. You came
back in one piece.

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
We have you to thank for that.

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
I'm assuming you put in a good
word for us with the Chief?

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:55.273 position:50% align:center
Something like that.

00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:57.942 position:50% align:center
Still, though,
that was strike one.

00:21:58.026 --> 00:22:00.862 position:50% align:center
He won't be so easygoing
the next time around,

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:02.822 position:50% align:center
so please watch yourselves.

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:04.491 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:06.868 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE A]
Sir, you have a parcel.

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:09.204 position:50% align:center
It came from the OSF Hospital.

00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:11.956 position:50% align:center
What?

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.294 position:50% align:center
You left in a rush, which means
you never got your medication.

00:22:16.378 --> 00:22:17.962 position:50% align:center
Maybe they sent you some?

00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:19.255 position:50% align:center
Maybe...

00:22:20.924 --> 00:22:22.425 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding?
