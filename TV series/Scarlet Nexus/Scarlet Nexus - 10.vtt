That's right.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:01.514 position:50% align:center
We knew that the facility
would be misused,

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:04.601 position:50% align:center
but we didn't have a choice
and we pushed for Seiran

What's our next step?

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Nagi witnessed
Naomi's metamorphosis,

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.591 position:50% align:center
and it's very likely that
memory was extracted

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.510 position:50% align:center
so it could be studied.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
During his rehabilitation
they stole memories?

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:46.559 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Mm. If you can get
me that memory data,

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.396 position:50% align:center
I'll use Arahabaki to
transmit those images

Alright, then.

Tell me. Where is
Nagi's memory data?

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
They're extracting memories
that can cause brain damage.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
Are we sure the
data is in there?

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
Nagi underwent personality
rehabilitation here.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
It has to be inside.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:18.800 position:50% align:center
Maybe... he's there, too.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center

It's a possibility.

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:24.889 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Mm... You don't
have to do this, Hanabi.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
I know that.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
But, if my dad and

[HARUKA] Arashi. The Major
General wants to see you.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
He also called for the
rest of Kasane's platoon.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:14.856 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] I received a report
from the research facility.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center

in alignment with my own.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
Of course, sir, you want to help
the people who were transformed.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.914 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, Seiran wants
to use Others as weapons

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
by any means possible.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.418 position:50% align:center
That's right. You need
to be more careful.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50% align:center
One wrong move could
spell disaster.

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.715 position:50% align:center
Seiran hardliners would
jump at the chance

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.467 position:50% align:center
to try to keep us in check.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
Will that facility help Naomi?
Can it turn her back?

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center

she's refusing to take the drug.

that facility is Naomi's best
chance to be saved, so...

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:03.321 position:50% align:center
She doesn't get a say.

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:06.366 position:50% align:center
And she'll be forced to take
that drug against her will.

Wouldn't put it past him.

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center

all you wanted to tell us?

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:15.041 position:50% align:center
No, one more thing.

Okay. Now that's
all settled, what next?

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] I suspect that you've
seen a larger gate than this.

consume the world.

That's what Karen said.

Somehow, he knew that I
had traveled to the future.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:46.224 position:50% align:center
And now they've supposedly
proven that there's a link

between Yuito and
the Kunad Gate.

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:52.480 position:50% align:center
It just seems so
coincidental, and yet...

to one answer.

Killing Yuito will
save the world.

help but wonder.

What? That doesn't matter!
Where are my friends?

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:15.558 position:50% align:center
This is caused by a large
apparent decrease

00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
in the binding rate of
his psionic hormones.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:21.022 position:50% align:center
According to our records,
at a younger age,

00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
the subject suddenly manifested
psionic power, after undergoing

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
a procedure that differed from
the usual dud modification.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
Wha--I was a dud?

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.701 position:50% align:center
[SCIENTIST A] It seems he
doesn't remember being a dud,

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
the memory loss may be
greater than first thought.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
I believe symptoms
are worsening.

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
Damage is accumulating in his
brain with each psionics use.

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.670 position:50% align:center
Which increases the
frequency and severity

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
in the lapses of memory.

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
what you're saying.

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.259 position:50% align:center
I can't have been a dud.

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.469 position:50% align:center
[SCIENTIST A] We've discovered
there's only a zero-point-five

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:54.389 position:50% align:center
percent success rate in our
dosing tests on children

born without psionic abilities.

And from that group
of test subjects,

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
only a small number of them
manifested psionic power

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
into an acquired ability.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
Out of those that gained
abilities, only zero-point-two

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:08.236 position:50% align:center
percent have been identified
as possessing powers

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
that exceed the average level.

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.165 position:50% align:center
[LUKA]
What a relief.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry...
and thank you. Really.

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
Seems like you're
always saving me.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
Let's go. The OSF already
knows we're here,

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
they'll lockdown
the entire facility.

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
We can't afford
to waste any time.

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
I'll show you the way out.

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
The Major General has
already briefed me.

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI gasps] Be careful!
The Others are gathering.

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
All of you need to leave now.
I can keep them occupied.

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:33.446 position:50% align:center
But, sir!

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.657 position:50% align:center
You'll need to
take this first.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
What is it?

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
A way to enter Arahabaki.

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
It's a device that outputs
a one-time access code.

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.457 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS growling]

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Now, get out while you can.

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:49.254 position:50% align:center
Don't forget, I'm a Septentrion.

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:51.589 position:50% align:center
It'll take more than
this to kill me.

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center
But Major General.

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
We have to go. Come on.

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] 

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:01.474 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI grunts]

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:04.019 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS growl]

00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
[YUITO, LUKA, TSUGUMI gasp]

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.527 position:50% align:center
Brother!

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:18.366 position:50% align:center
Yuito. So, you've finally
revealed your true colors.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.242 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:22.120 position:50% align:center
[LUKA gasps]
Don't tell me.

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
Yuito Sumeragi, once the
nation's savior,

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
is now wanted for
committing treason.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.753 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Sumeragi
and his platoon

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
broke into a top-secret
research facility.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:35.884 position:50% align:center
While inside, they attempted
to steal classified informa--

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
You'd be hunted down if you
tried to set foot back in Suoh.

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:45.101 position:50% align:center
How about it, Yuito?
You could join us in Seiran.

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:48.563 position:50% align:center
Instead of traitors, you would
be welcomed as comrades.

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:51.399 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps] You use human
brains to conduct your

00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:54.027 position:50% align:center
research on Others, and you
really expect me join you?

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.237 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] New Himuka is
experimenting on turning

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:57.781 position:50% align:center
humans into Others.

00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:00.909 position:50% align:center
All for the sake of developing
powerful psionics.

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:04.454 position:50% align:center
And Suoh plays a vital role
in New Himuka's atrocities.

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:07.749 position:50% align:center
Both sides have done wrong.
You've both gone mad!

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.292 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
Then what will you do?

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:12.879 position:50% align:center
Will you run to Togetsu and
their religious delusions?

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.048 position:50% align:center
The theocratic autonomous zone.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
They would gladly welcome
someone with your skills.

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:20.011 position:50% align:center
It's your only other option.

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:21.554 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:25.225 position:50% align:center
He's right. New Himuka wouldn't
dare make a move against it.

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
Togetsu is an independent city.

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
Hold on just a second.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:30.939 position:50% align:center
You came here to tell us that?

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
Please. I have other business.

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center
But if you're going to Togetsu,
you should take this.

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]
But that thing is...

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.243 position:50% align:center
I know you have objections
to how it's made.

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
Still though,
it's something you need.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
Otherwise you won't survive.

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
Without it, you'll keep
losing your memories.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.252 position:50% align:center
And over time, you'll eventually
find yourself unable

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:54.421 position:50% align:center
to use psionics.

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, this will
only delay the inevitable.

00:20:57.841 --> 00:20:59.175 position:50% align:center
But if you want
to keep fighting,

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:00.844 position:50% align:center
you don't have a choice.

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
Hmph.

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
Karen!

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.522 position:50% align:center
[WATARU] Keep moving!
We can't afford to stay here!

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center

[grunts, gasps]

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:37.756 position:50% align:center
It's you.

00:21:46.598 --> 00:21:49.934 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing they'll make
their move anytime now.

00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:03.907 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] You're not holding
things in again, are you?

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:07.911 position:50% align:center
I thought I told you earlier
to let us share your burdens.

00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:10.038 position:50% align:center
Kyoka.

00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:13.124 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] Is it about Yuito?
Or maybe Naomi?

00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:14.918 position:50% align:center
Knowing you, it's both.

00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:16.795 position:50% align:center
What do you think about leaving?

00:22:16.878 --> 00:22:19.130 position:50% align:center
We could get far
away from Seiran.

00:22:20.382 --> 00:22:23.885 position:50% align:center
What if... all of us
went to Togetsu?

00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:26.346 position:50% align:center
