Okay. Now that's
all settled, what next?

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] I suspect that you've
seen a larger gate than this.

consume the world.

That's what Karen said.

Somehow, he knew that I
had traveled to the future.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:46.224 position:50% align:center
And now they've supposedly
proven that there's a link

between Yuito and
the Kunad Gate.

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:52.480 position:50% align:center
It just seems so
coincidental, and yet...

to one answer.

save the world.

help but wonder.

What? That doesn't matter!
Where are my friends?

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:15.558 position:50% align:center
This is caused by a large
apparent decrease

00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
in the binding rate of
his psionic hormones.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:21.022 position:50% align:center
According to our records,
at a younger age,

00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
the subject suddenly manifested
psionic power, after undergoing

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
a procedure that differed from
the usual dud modification.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
Wha--I was a dud?

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.701 position:50% align:center
[SCIENTIST A] It seems he
doesn't remember being a dud,

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
the memory loss may be
greater than first thought.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
I believe symptoms
are worsening.

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
Damage is accumulating in his
brain with each psionics use.

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.670 position:50% align:center
Which increases the
frequency and severity

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
in the lapses of memory.

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
what you're saying.

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.259 position:50% align:center
I can't have been a dud.

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.469 position:50% align:center
[SCIENTIST A] We've discovered
there's only a zero-point-five

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:54.389 position:50% align:center
percent success rate in our
dosing tests on children

born without psionic abilities.

And from that group
of test subjects,

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
only a small number of them
manifested psionic power

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
into an acquired ability.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
Out of those that gained
abilities, only zero-point-two

percent have been identified
as possessing powers

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
that exceed the average level.
