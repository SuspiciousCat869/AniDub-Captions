[KAGERO]
Hm? Hey, Tsugumi.

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.289 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] I was wondering
if you were going too.

00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:42.665 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
Yeah.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
There are so many people
I care deeply about here.

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:48.588 position:50% align:center
I just couldn't bear
it if I lost them.

Don't you feel that way?

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:56.012 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Of course, I do, but
any chance you'll reconsider?

00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.808 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
Huh?

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
'Cause if we do end up going
toe-to-toe with Karen,

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:06.064 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure that I'll
be able to protect you.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center
And I want you to
live a long life.

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
You need to understand
I don't want to live my life

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center

goes for the future, too.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.828 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I guess you bring
up a good point there.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50% align:center

right to force that upon you.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
It's okay.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm sure we'll
survive another day

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center

wisecracks of yours.

You've cut me to

[ARASHI]
Hm? What do you mean?

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
Still the same childish habits.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
Like lounging around eating
snacks in my room, for instance.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.709 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] Oh, don't mind me,
I'm good over here.

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
I should go to bed.
Early day tomorrow.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.590 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Boo! Fine, you do you.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
Listen, it's time for
you to go, okay?

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] Alright, alright.
You're such a drag.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
I don't remember
raising you like that,

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.686 position:50% align:center
little brother of mine.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.439 position:50% align:center
Strange, I don't remember
you raising me at all.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center

right into that one.

Sis, tomorrow.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
There's nothing to worry about.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.118 position:50% align:center
Those Others won't even
know what hit them.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.995 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.748 position:50% align:center
But you should be careful
who you're friendly with.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
Just my advice.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center

Kasane.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.173 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I came to
check up on you.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
You're not ready yet, after all.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
No, I'm fine.

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center
Yeah? But what about
your psionics?

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
Listen!

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.182 position:50% align:center
Look, they're gone.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:50.020 position:50% align:center
Nagi, Naomi, the commander.

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
It's so hard for me to
accept it, but it's true.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center
And no matter how
much time passes,

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'll
ever get over it.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.654 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
The sorrow when lives are lost.

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
That's what this nation
was built upon.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
Using psionics to
travel back in time, 

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:11.750 position:50% align:center
people trying to
become more powerful.

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
What was it all for?

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:17.172 position:50% align:center
So many lives have
just been thrown away.

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
Look, this has to end now.

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
We can't let the lust for
power control our world.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
That's over.

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
Our psionics were supposed
to be there to help us.

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:34.230 position:50% align:center
But instead, we became
too dependent on them.

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:36.983 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
That's what I mean.

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
I want us to live in a world
where we don't have to depend

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
on psionic power, at all.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
And that can't happen if
the Kunad Gate still exists.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.371 position:50% align:center
You inspire me.

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
To think, when we first met,

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.541 position:50% align:center
I assumed you were
completely useless.

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.961 position:50% align:center
[YUITO laughs] Yeah, you made
that pretty clear.

00:13:57.045 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
That said, you're a
different person now.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:04.844 position:50% align:center

it takes to change the world.
