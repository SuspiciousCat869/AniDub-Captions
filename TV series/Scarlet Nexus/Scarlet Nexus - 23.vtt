Pick up the pace!

Wait, what the hell is that?

[MALE VOICE A]
What's the holdup?

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center
I need that data!

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
They're spawning everywhere now!

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.932 position:50% align:center
And there's no sign
of it letting up!

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:01.770 position:50% align:center
The Belt is so low!
I've never sen anything like it!

[WATARU]
What's your ETA look like?

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.282 position:50% align:center
Thirty minutes.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.825 position:50% align:center
[WATARU]
Roger.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.035 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA]
How's it looking?

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:18.536 position:50% align:center
[WATARU]
Not good, I'm afraid.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.456 position:50% align:center
We're still dealing with intense
shaking every few minutes,

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.751 position:50% align:center
which causes the defense
system to glitch out on us.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:26.169 position:50% align:center
Not only that,

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.255 position:50% align:center
but the Extinction Belt is
hovering dangerously low.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.675 position:50% align:center
That sounds like a
gravitational anomaly.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.470 position:50% align:center
It's probably because
of the Kunad Gate.

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:39.391 position:50% align:center
And if the Belt keeps
on descending, then...

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:41.059 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
How's Yuito?

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:43.103 position:50% align:center
He's still unconscious
at the moment

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:46.481 position:50% align:center
and he looks like
he's suffering.

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:48.316 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] I'll try to
get him a hospital bed.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.695 position:50% align:center
But, I have to admit,
considering the circumstances,

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.364 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure how much
they can help him.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.574 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
Right. Thank you.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.097 position:50% align:center
Hanabi. You heard what
they told us, right?

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.557 position:50% align:center
We can't teleport him
in his current condition.

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
It's far too dangerous.

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:49.437 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know. Luka, Sorry.

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:50.647 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.148 position:50% align:center
Is he gonna be okay?

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.567 position:50% align:center
Yuito hasn't even opened
his eyes this entire time.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.612 position:50% align:center
Of course, he will! I...

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:00.740 position:50% align:center
[KAITO]
He's not done yet.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.200 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
You should've heard the
stubborn tone he was taking

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
when we last spoke.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:08.081 position:50% align:center
He's determined to prove
to me that his way is right,

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:09.457 position:50% align:center
no matter what.

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50% align:center
Trust me, he won't give up.

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:14.087 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI chuckles]
Stubborn, you say?

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.840 position:50% align:center
Guess that runs
in the family, huh?

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
This is a crisis,

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:21.928 position:50% align:center
so your authority has been
temporarily reinstated.

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
That means you'll be able to
assume command of the OSF

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
as soon as we make it to Suoh.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
[KAITO] Hm. So before
they throw me out,

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
they're hoping to get
their money's worth.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
That's politics, I suppose.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
[MALE OSF SOLDIER B]
Our system's down!

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
We can't access our defenses!

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
But this is Arahabaki!
Should be rock-solid!

[MALE NDF SOLDIER E]
The blast doors

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
at some of the
shelters won't shut.

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.746 position:50% align:center
Our forces are keeping
the Others at bay,

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.498 position:50% align:center
but they can only
hold out for so long!

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
[MALE NDF SOLDIER C] We're
seriously undermanned here!

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center

We're in no shape to defend!

[MALE ACTING CHIEF A]
Chief Sumeragi!

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:07.766 position:50% align:center
Take the soldiers off of those
inoperable flak cannons.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.435 position:50% align:center
Have them move to
shelter defense.

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50% align:center
And send the splinter forces
back to HQ immediately.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
We need to re-form our lines,

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
Seiran and Togetsu
are also strained.

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
We can't call backup.
It's all on us.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center

is in our hands!

Are you all right?

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
We cleared out the area

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50% align:center
surrounding the eastern
district's shelter.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.151 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA]
Just in time again.

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:03.905 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Good. Head to another

Where am I?

The Suoh hospital?

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.757 position:50% align:center
I guess... I blacked out.

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
Is everyone okay?

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Yuito! You're finally up!

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.932 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
I'm so glad!

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
Thanks, guys. So, um.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
I remember that Suoh was under
an Other alert, and then...

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:40.650 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA] Yeah, their numbers have
been brought down significantly

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50% align:center
and the spawn rate's much
more stable than it was.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:45.989 position:50% align:center
But it's still not safe for
civilians to come out

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
of the shelters.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:48.950 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA] Unfortunately, the
defense system hasn't recovered

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:54.122 position:50% align:center
yet and we don't know whether
there's another attack 

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.582 position:50% align:center
around the corner.

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.500 position:50% align:center
We're standing by
at headquarters.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
For right now, we're all just
doing our best to regroup.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:04.090 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Then I'll head over
to Sumeragi Tomb soon.

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
[HANABI sighs]

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] Be honest,
you sure you're up to it?

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:12.557 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you don't
need to fret over me.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.809 position:50% align:center
That long power
nap really helped.

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
We should go find Yakumo,
well Karen, I should say,

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.149 position:50% align:center
and set things straight.

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
If we don't fix that last
entanglement, it's all over.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA]
Understood.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.657 position:50% align:center
But you haven't been
conscious for very long.

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50% align:center
Let's give you a little
while to recover.

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.746 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll rest.

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
Sumeragi Tomb, huh?

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:41.002 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
I'm scared. You really
think Yuito's okay?

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
Well, he sure seems
to think he is,

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
so there's not a
whole lot we can do.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.640 position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
We might as well concentrate
on ourselves at this point.

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
[HANABI gasps]

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50% align:center
If Karen is waiting at
the Sumeragi Tomb, 

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:03.066 position:50% align:center
we can try to get him to see
where we're coming from.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.860 position:50% align:center
But, if he won't listen, then...

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:08.279 position:50% align:center
We may have no other
choice but to fight.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:14.703 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] Yes. We must
be ready for anything.

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50% align:center
[ALL sigh]

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:19.541 position:50% align:center
I realize that the world
we live in can be ugly

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.835 position:50% align:center
and unfair sometimes.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
But still, despite
what's gone wrong,

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.798 position:50% align:center
there are plenty of
good things in it, too.

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:28.216 position:50% align:center
We can't lose those.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.010 position:50% align:center
That's why I'll never
give up on this world,

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center
no matter what may happen.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.349 position:50% align:center
[HANABI, LUKA,
KYOKA, GEMMA laugh]

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.309 position:50% align:center
Hey now, what's so funny?

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:39.853 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.187 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
I've been looking
into this gyoza joint.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
I think I might go
and check it out.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.568 position:50% align:center
Gyoza?

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
But... it's kind of geared
toward a younger crowd.

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
I might feel kinda out of place.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
Sounds fun.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
Technically, I'm not quite
as young as I look,

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.662 position:50% align:center
but I'd love to go
try it out with you!

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.122 position:50% align:center
Count me in, too, then.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:02.208 position:50% align:center
Ooh, gyoza! I would love to go!

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:04.336 position:50% align:center
Am I the only one being
serious right now?

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with you?

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center

[KAGERO]
Hm? Hey, Tsugumi.

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.289 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] I was wondering
if you were going too.

00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:42.665 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
Yeah.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
There are so many people
I care deeply about here.

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:48.588 position:50% align:center
I just couldn't bear
it if I lost them.

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:56.012 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Of course, I do, but
any chance you'll reconsider?

00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.808 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
Huh?

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
'Cause if we do end up going
toe-to-toe with Karen,

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:06.064 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure that I'll
be able to protect you.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center
And I want you to
live a long life.

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
You need to understand
I don't want to live my life

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center

goes for the future, too.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.828 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I guess you bring
up a good point there.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50% align:center

right to force that upon you.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
It's okay.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm sure we'll
survive another day

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center

[ARASHI]
Hm? What do you mean?

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
Still the same childish habits.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center

snacks in my room, for instance.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.709 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] Oh, don't mind me,
I'm good over here.

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
I should go to bed.
Early day tomorrow.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.590 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
Boo! Fine, you do you.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
Listen, it's time for
you to go, okay?

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] Alright, alright.
You're such a drag.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
I don't remember
raising you like that,

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.686 position:50% align:center
little brother of mine.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.439 position:50% align:center
Strange, I don't remember
you raising me at all.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center

right into that one.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
There's nothing to worry about.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.118 position:50% align:center
Those Others won't even
know what hit them.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.995 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.748 position:50% align:center
But you should be careful
who you're friendly with.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
Just my advice.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center

Kasane.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.173 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I came to
check up on you.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
You're not ready yet, after all.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
No, I'm fine.

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center
Yeah? But what about
your psionics?

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
Listen!

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.182 position:50% align:center
Look, they're gone.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:50.020 position:50% align:center
Nagi, Naomi, the commander.

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
It's so hard for me to
accept it, but it's true.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center
And no matter how
much time passes,

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'll
ever get over it.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.654 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
The sorrow when lives are lost.

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
That's what this nation
was built upon.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
Using psionics to
travel back in time, 

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:11.750 position:50% align:center
people trying to
become more powerful.

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
What was it all for?

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:17.172 position:50% align:center
So many lives have
just been thrown away.

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
Look, this has to end now.

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
We can't let the lust for
power control our world.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
That's over.

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
Our psionics were supposed
to be there to help us.

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:34.230 position:50% align:center
But instead, we became
too dependent on them.

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:36.983 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
That's what I mean.

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
I want us to live in a world
where we don't have to depend

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
on psionic power, at all.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
And that can't happen if
the Kunad Gate still exists.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.371 position:50% align:center
You inspire me.

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
To think, when we first met,

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.541 position:50% align:center
I assumed you were
completely useless.

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.961 position:50% align:center
[YUITO laughs] Yeah, you made
that pretty clear.

00:13:57.045 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
That said, you're a
different person now.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:04.844 position:50% align:center

it takes to change the world.
