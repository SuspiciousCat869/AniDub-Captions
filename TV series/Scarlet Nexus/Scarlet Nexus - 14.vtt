Yakumo was extremely positive,

especially given
everything we faced.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
He was the person who
spearheaded the Ark landings

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:00.795 position:50% align:center
on earth and began
the efforts to improve

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
the planet's environment.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.758 position:50% align:center

paved the way for even more

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center

[KASANE]
What happened?

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
[LUKA] The computer in Togetsu
told us that the Extinction Belt

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:18.146 position:50% align:center
appeared after the
group landed on earth.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.773 position:50% align:center
Maybe that was part of it.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.649 position:50% align:center
So, the settlement
project stopped

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
when the Extinction
Belt first appeared?

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.738 position:50% align:center
I heard it was because
the situation on the Moon

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.198 position:50% align:center
had changed.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:31.451 position:50% align:center

dark too then, eh, Kyoka?

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.624 position:50% align:center
Well, this may take a while to
explain, but this is the story

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
of what happened
2,000 years ago.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
After we made our
landing on earth,

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.799 position:50% align:center
we continued our
correspondence with the Moon.

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center

had gone terribly wrong there.

Yes, the Others.

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:04.984 position:50% align:center
You see, a strange comet had
passed by the Moon one day.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
and it gave off some
unknown substance.

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
Not much was clear
about its makeup.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
All we could tell was that any
lifeforms that came into contact

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
with it were somehow
transformed into Others.

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
The Moon's government gave it
the name "Other Particles".

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.086 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, the earth
redevelopment effort

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:26.715 position:50% align:center
entered the gravity

Did they--?

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.016 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO]
Yup, you guessed it.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.476 position:50% align:center
They launched a project to
divert all of those nasty

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50% align:center

toward Earth instead.

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center

Belt was formed.

Wait a second,
what about the Others?

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
The Moon's government
created the Belt,

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
but did they make the
Others fall from it too?

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center
There's a space station situated
outside the Extinction Belt.

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50% align:center
It releases the genetic
information of living organisms.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.674 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] When it
encounters Other Particles,

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
it spawns Others,

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
which, of course,
rain down upon the Earth.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
They'd really go that far?

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
Based on our records,

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
we know that the Moon was badly
overpopulated a long time ago.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.900 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it was a means
of population control.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but still!

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] That probably means
that the people on the Moon

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
were struggling
to survive, as well.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
To make a long story short,
I simply had to stay

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
on good ol' planet Earth and I
couldn't tell you what happened

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
on the Moon after that.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
I don't even know whether
there are any humans

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
living there these days.

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
Even if they did survive,

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:48.505 position:50% align:center
I'm sure a lot of them
have turned into Others.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
We made it.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.012 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN] Can you even
forgive the Moon people

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
for betraying you?

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:01.309 position:50% align:center
Heh. I can understand why
you're asking me that question,

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:04.312 position:50% align:center
but we're talking about
literal ancient history.

Which is where our armored
vehicle is waiting.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:31.548 position:50% align:center
Kagero. You said this path would
be a dangerous way to go, right?

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50% align:center
I did, so I'm sort of hoping
our luck doesn't run out.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center

We should fall back for now.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Agreed!

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] That Other's made its
home in this area for years.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
We've faced it in
battle many times,

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:09.813 position:50% align:center
but sadly we've never
been able to defeat it.

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
That explains why the place
has always been off-limits.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:15.652 position:50% align:center
Lucky for us, it never ventures
too far from its comfort zone,

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.779 position:50% align:center
so we're safe here.

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
Do you think there's any way
for us to get around it, then?

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Unfortunately,
it's sitting on the only route

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.577 position:50% align:center
to the base of the mountain.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.830 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we could try
to run past it.

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:28.915 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA]
It moves incredibly fast.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
Besides, its icicle attack
covers such a wide area.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
We could try using
Luka's ability.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:38.008 position:50% align:center
Well, we don't know
where it'll surface next.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
That makes teleporting
too dangerous.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Right. This cavern
is practically a maze,

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.099 position:50% align:center
so we'd be taking a huge gamble.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center

[KAGERO]
Yeah?

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.581 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] If that story about you
coming from the moon is true,

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
why did you choose to help us?

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] It's not as
cut-and-dried as all that,

00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
I have my own motivations.

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
The Moon abandoned us on earth,

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center
so we established
our own nation,

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:07.138 position:50% align:center
which you know as New Himuka.

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:10.475 position:50% align:center
Yakumo Sumeragi was the founder.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
But you already
know these things.

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Yeah.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.397 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] There were
some who never gave up

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50% align:center
on returning to the Moon.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.361 position:50% align:center
The truth is, I was one of them.

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:24.614 position:50% align:center
And so we founded Togetsu.

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:28.159 position:50% align:center
We entered cold sleep together,
and took turns waking

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:30.870 position:50% align:center
so we could assess the
situation here on earth

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
and try contacting the Moon.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:34.666 position:50% align:center
After several rounds of this,

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.961 position:50% align:center
I awakened to find that
Togetsu had changed.

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
And with the Extinction Belt,

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
we could no longer
return to the Moon.

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:45.885 position:50% align:center
Not only that, we couldn't
tell how our home had fared

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
against attacks from the Others.

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:50.974 position:50% align:center
So we devised a plan.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:54.936 position:50% align:center
To save our motherland, the Moon
and to escape from earth,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.313 position:50% align:center
we would make it so the
Ark immigrant project

00:14:57.397 --> 00:15:00.316 position:50% align:center

which is why they
created the Red Strings.

--[KAGERO gasps]
--Tsugumi, fall back!

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
No, it's now or never!

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:07.837 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI gasps]

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA]
She did it!

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we've both gone on
living for far too long.

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:25.730 position:50% align:center
I only hope you rest
in peace down there.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.363 position:50% align:center
Everyone! You safe?

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:36.241 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
That's a relief.

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
No enemies found nearby.

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
Well, keep us updated, Wataru.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
[WATARU]
Sure, leave it to me.

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
You, too, Haruka.

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.334 position:50% align:center
You got it!

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
Kagero. You never finished
your story before.

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
So tell me, what did you mean
when you said "motivations"?

00:18:57.846 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO sighs]

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I was
a spy for Togetsu.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
I would feed them intel
while I was in Suoh.

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
So why would
their spy help us?

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:12.152 position:50% align:center
At first, I acted as a
double-agent to sabotage

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:16.364 position:50% align:center
Togetsu's plan, but I couldn't
let them catch on to me,

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:19.242 position:50% align:center
so I'd go along with their
orders the best I could.

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:20.535 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] I'd say this might
be a good time to fall back.

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center
[KASANE grunts]

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
That's a convenient story.

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:32.589 position:50% align:center
Don't like it? We can part
ways here if you prefer.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
But still, I won't let this
world's history be lost.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
I left a precious family
back on the Moon.

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] I refuse to let them
wipe my child from existence!

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.940 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
He's being serious, guys.

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
Trust me. He's never
like this, not at all.

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
So, please, listen to him.

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.534 position:50% align:center
Tsugumi...

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
She knows you much better
than anybody else,

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
so I'll take her word.

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
Same here. I believe you, too.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.544 position:50% align:center
However, if you
betray us, you're dead.

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.715 position:50% align:center
Ha. How bout that?

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
And here I thought you newer
kids would be pushovers.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.387 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA, KASANE, YUITO chuckle]

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
So... does anyone know what
our next move should be?

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
We have to thwart
Togetsu's plan. But how?

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:32.065 position:50% align:center
It won't be an easy task.
Where do we even begin?

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
We could appeal to Suoh
and Seiran's leaders.

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
I don't know,
we're rebels, remember?

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:40.240 position:50% align:center
That's true, but once they're
brought up to speed,

00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:42.367 position:50% align:center
maybe both sides will
realize that this is no time

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.077 position:50% align:center
to be fighting with each other.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
Let's hope so.
Makes a lot of sense.

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
Suoh and Seiran's governments
should know all about

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:51.126 position:50% align:center
the ARK mission,

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:54.087 position:50% align:center
so it's clearly in their best
interests to cooperate with us.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50% align:center
Either way, we have
to do something.

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:59.843 position:50% align:center
None of us wants to be
erased from existence.

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:02.887 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO exhales]
Agreed.

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:05.807 position:50% align:center
I suppose we'll split up
and do what we can, then.

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.354 position:50% align:center
Kasane?

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:14.482 position:50% align:center
Be right there, one second.

00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:15.984 position:50% align:center
Yuito.

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:20.238 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for trying to kill
you, but like I said before.

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
Despite what you believe,

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:25.744 position:50% align:center
I swear, I wasn't the one who
murdered Chairman Sumeragi.

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I know.

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:29.039 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:31.750 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] When I fought with
you again, I remembered.

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:33.710 position:50% align:center
You're a terrible liar, which
means you couldn't have

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
killed my father.

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:37.630 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Uh! Hey, are you
making fun of me?

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
[YUITO laughs]

00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:44.179 position:50% align:center
Look, I can talk
to Suoh's leaders.

00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:47.766 position:50% align:center
But first, I need to
meet with my brother.

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
And I'll go to Seiran.

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:53.021 position:50% align:center
So we're finally after
the same goal.

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:56.024 position:50% align:center
Yes... Good luck.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.417 position:50% align:center
[NAGI]
Yuito...

00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:18.588 position:50% align:center
[NAGI]
Yuito...

00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:21.633 position:50% align:center
Yuito...

00:22:21.716 --> 00:22:24.386 position:50% align:center
Yuito...

00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:26.346 position:50% align:center
Yuito!
