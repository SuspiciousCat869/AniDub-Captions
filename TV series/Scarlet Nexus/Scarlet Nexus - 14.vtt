Just for their own survival?

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:52.532 position:50% align:center
Wait a second,
what about the Others?

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
The Moon's government
created the Belt,

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
but did they make the
Others fall from it too?

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center
There's a space station situated
outside the Extinction Belt.

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50% align:center
It releases the genetic
information of living organisms.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.674 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] When it
encounters Other Particles,

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
it spawns Others,

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
which, of course,
rain down upon the Earth.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
They'd really go that far?

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
Based on our records,

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
we know that the Moon was badly
overpopulated a long time ago.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.900 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it was a means
of population control.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but still!

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] That probably means
that the people on the Moon

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
were struggling
to survive, as well.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
To make a long story short,
I simply had to stay

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
on good ol' planet Earth and I
couldn't tell you what happened

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
on the Moon after that.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
I don't even know whether
there are any humans

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
living there these days.

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
Even if they did survive,

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:48.505 position:50% align:center
I'm sure a lot of them
have turned into Others.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
We made it.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.012 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN] Can you even
forgive the Moon people

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
for betraying you?

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:01.309 position:50% align:center
Heh. I can understand why
you're asking me that question,

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:04.312 position:50% align:center
but we're talking about
literal ancient history.

Which is where our armored
vehicle is waiting.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:31.548 position:50% align:center
Kagero. You said this path would
be a dangerous way to go, right?

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50% align:center
I did, so I'm sort of hoping
our luck doesn't run out.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center

We should fall back for now.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Agreed!

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] That Other's made its
home in this area for years.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
We've faced it in
battle many times,

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:09.813 position:50% align:center
but sadly we've never
been able to defeat it.

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
That explains why the place
has always been off-limits.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:15.652 position:50% align:center
Lucky for us, it never ventures
too far from its comfort zone,

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.779 position:50% align:center
so we're safe here.

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
Do you think there's any way
for us to get around it, then?

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Unfortunately,
it's sitting on the only route

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.577 position:50% align:center
to the base of the mountain.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.830 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we could try
to run past it.

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:28.915 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA]
It moves incredibly fast.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
Besides, its icicle attack
covers such a wide area.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
We could try using
Luka's ability.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:38.008 position:50% align:center
Well, we don't know
where it'll surface next.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
That makes teleporting
too dangerous.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Right. This cavern
is practically a maze,

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.099 position:50% align:center
so we'd be taking a huge gamble.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center

[KAGERO]
Yeah?

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.581 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] If that story about you
coming from the moon is true,

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
why did you choose to help us?

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] It's not as
cut-and-dried as all that,

00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
I have my own motivations.

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
The Moon abandoned us on earth,

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center
so we established
our own nation,

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:07.138 position:50% align:center
which you know as New Himuka.

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:10.475 position:50% align:center
Yakumo Sumeragi was the founder.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
But you already
know these things.

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Yeah.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.397 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] There were
some who never gave up

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50% align:center
on returning to the Moon.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.361 position:50% align:center
The truth is, I was one of them.

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:24.614 position:50% align:center
And so we founded Togetsu.

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:28.159 position:50% align:center
We entered cold sleep together,
and took turns waking

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:30.870 position:50% align:center
so we could assess the
situation here on earth

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
and try contacting the Moon.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:34.666 position:50% align:center
After several rounds of this,

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.961 position:50% align:center
I awakened to find that
Togetsu had changed.

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
And with the Extinction Belt,

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
we could no longer
return to the Moon.

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:45.885 position:50% align:center
Not only that, we couldn't
tell how our home had fared

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
against attacks from the Others.

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:50.974 position:50% align:center
So we devised a plan.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:54.936 position:50% align:center
To save our motherland, the Moon
and to escape from earth,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.313 position:50% align:center
we would make it so the
Ark immigrant project

00:14:57.397 --> 00:15:00.316 position:50% align:center

which is why they
created the Red Strings.
