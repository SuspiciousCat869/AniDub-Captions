[VISION ] Furthermore,
the accelerated expansion

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
of the Kunad Gate has been
linked to the psionic abilities

--of Yuito Sumeragi.
--What?!

At this point in time,

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:35.033 position:50% align:center
earth's destruction is
no longer avoidable.

Take heart, for the Moon is

Forget that! Why did you
bring up my psionic power?

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
Is there really a connection
between me and the Kunad Gate?

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
[VISION] The Kunad Gate
should be of no concern.

Its purpose is to
remake the universe...

...in order to usher in the

Yuito. That was a lot,
but don't be too upset.

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
The gate is growing.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
And seems to be pulling
in everything around it.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
You think when it
gets big enough...

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
...it'll really
swallow up the earth?

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous to take
that story at face value.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It could be
some sort of trap.

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
We can not let them deceive us.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.526 position:50% align:center
Right. Good point.

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
Well, then what's next?

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:55.905 position:50% align:center
That BABE system.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.866 position:50% align:center
It's probably
worth investigating.

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:00.201 position:50% align:center
If we want to ask
about the Others,

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:03.288 position:50% align:center
the Vision said we would need
to access it, didn't she?

[HANABI, TSUGUMI]
Mm.

So, it's knowledge of BABE

What is BABE, exactly?

It is the supercomputer

I'll be right back.

Isn't that sweet?

[KASANE] A puppy? It does
seem familiar, but why?

Yes, of course.

They killed that

She was so warm, so kind, always
