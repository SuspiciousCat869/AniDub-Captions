At long last, we have secured

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:22.105 position:50% align:center

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:36.244 position:50% align:center
[LUKA] They seem to be welcoming
us peacefully, at least.

Though I'm not sure why.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
For some reason,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.334 position:50% align:center
they know who Yuito
and the rest of us are.

[TSUGUMI] I haven't identified
anything suspicious here yet.

However, there are several
areas I can't see into.

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:53.595 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Tsugumi, let me know
the second you spot anything

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:55.138 position:50% align:center
out of place.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.432 position:50% align:center

Right. I'll do that.

You, too, Wataru.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.519 position:50% align:center
[WATARU] Major General Fubuki

What is it that
you wish to know?

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50% align:center
Kyoka?

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
That thing looks just like her!
How can this be possible?

Subject, Kyoka.
Searching for results.

One found. Please stand by
while data is retrieved.

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
Kyoka Eden, one of
the Design Children

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
manufactured by Togetsu.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:07.038 position:50% align:center
Wait, "Design"? She was created?

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
The Design Children.
I've heard about them.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
They were a product of
genetic recombination.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
Like people that
were built to order.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.799 position:50% align:center
Their creators could customize
their appearance and powers.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:19.134 position:50% align:center
Like dolls.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
I dug some stuff up.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
It's basically what
Luka just said.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50% align:center
But it was all theoretical
and they deemed it

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:27.017 position:50% align:center
unfeasible in the end.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.019 position:50% align:center
Kyoka was one of them, huh?

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
As for her design, she was
based on a cell sample

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
taken from renowned neuroscience
researcher Doctor Hitoyo Pope.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
Scholar, proud matriarch
of the Togetsu faith,

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
and a psionics expert.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
They look the same!

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
Okay, so this doctor
you're talking about.

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
Did she make Kyoka?

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
[VISION]
No.

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center
The original Doctor Pope
passed away 2,000 years ago.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.917 position:50% align:center
She's no longer living.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA]
Two thousand years ago?

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
That was around the same time

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:57.714 position:50% align:center
New Himuka was founded.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.549 position:50% align:center
[LUKA] Do you think we
could use this system

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
to gather information about
what New Himuka was like then?

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.763 position:50% align:center
Well, it's definitely
worth a try.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:07.223 position:50% align:center
Maybe we'll find something that
the government wanted to keep

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center
covered up.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Hm... What can you
tell us about New Himuka

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:13.897 position:50% align:center
when it was founded?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.940 position:50% align:center
History of New
Himuka's founding.

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
Please stand by
for data retrieval.

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
New Himuka was established
by the People of the Ark

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.240 position:50% align:center
2,020 years in the past.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.994 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA] And who are
the People of the Ark?

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center
[VISION] They are the
group of immigrants who

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
arrived from the Moon.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
Wha--? From the moon?

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center
Yes. During the primeval times,

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.963 position:50% align:center
humanity was able to
flourish upon the earth.

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:43.551 position:50% align:center
But then, 3,000 years ago,
a sudden change occurred.

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:47.138 position:50% align:center
A shift in earth's orbit caused
an environmental cataclysm

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center
and the planet's population
drastically declined.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
To preserve the species,

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
the entire human race emigrated
to the Moon and established

00:05:55.897 --> 00:06:00.735 position:50% align:center
a city and the effort to repair
the earth's environment began.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.030 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
What is she talking about?

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
[VISION] The thousand-year
project vastly improved

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
the environment, so much so
that the Moon's government

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
was able to safely dispatch
a group of settlers

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
to repopulate the earth.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:18.336 position:50% align:center
They were known as the
People of the Ark.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA]
That doesn't make any sense.

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
You're telling us humankind left
earth for the moon and then they

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
came back here? Really?

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
No one told us that.

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
Immigrants came
down from the moon?

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:34.561 position:50% align:center
Okay, so that was only a
small portion of their numbers?

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center
Yes, precisely.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.983 position:50% align:center
Which means... there are still
people on the moon, right?

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.568 position:50% align:center
[VISION]
It is impossible to answer that

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.028 position:50% align:center
with any degree of certainty.

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
But, why?

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
[VISION] At the moment, all
communication with the Moon's

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.409 position:50% align:center
government is being blocked.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:53.121 position:50% align:center
Blocked? Oh, right,
by the Extinction Belt.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:56.875 position:50% align:center
[VISION] Yes. Due to the
Extinction Belt's effects,

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center
sadly, we are completely
unable to assess

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
the situation on the Moon.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
[HANABI] Makes sense.
Still, though...

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.217 position:50% align:center
If the Extinction Belt
was there, then how was

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
that immigrant group able to
reach the earth's surface?

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
[VISION]
At the time,

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:13.183 position:50% align:center
the Extinction Belt had
not yet come to exist.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center
You're saying it hasn't
always been there?

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:18.104 position:50% align:center
It appeared sometime after
they came from the moon?

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.148 position:50% align:center
[VISION]
Yes. That is correct.

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
Our history says it was caused
by the Spring of Extinction.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.029 position:50% align:center
That was how it got its name.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
And around that same time
is when our nation was born.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center
Right, so then did the
Others come with it?

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.954 position:50% align:center
[VISION ]
No.

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
The arrival of the Others was
abrupt, but it occurred sometime

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
after the Extinction
Belt first appeared.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.254 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Huh? Not at the same time?

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
But they're supposed to be
spawned by the Extinction Belt!

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
What are you thinking?

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.722 position:50% align:center
It's a lot to take in.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:56.518 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.853 position:50% align:center
So, what exactly are the Others?

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50% align:center
I am unable to answer.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center
That information is
not available to me.

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.902 position:50% align:center
Access to BABE is necessary.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.363 position:50% align:center
What's BABE?

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center
It's probably another system
that's more powerful

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
than this one.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
[ALL grunt]

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
We got info we couldn't find in
Suoh or Seiran, but still...

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.461 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I gave up on
trying to understand it

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
about halfway through.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:28.758 position:50% align:center
It sounds ridiculous.
Almost like a fairy tale.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
I bet they've passed it
down for generations.

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:35.223 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's a scripture, then.
Like, part of their faith.

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
If New Himuka was created
by the People of the Ark...

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:42.063 position:50% align:center
Then our founder,
Yakumo Sumeragi,

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center
came here from the moon!

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Hm...

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:48.153 position:50% align:center
So, assuming what this
"Vision" says is true.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:51.573 position:50% align:center
I take it that anyone
who was born on earth,

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
is a descendant of the people
who immigrated from the moon.

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
[WATARU]
That can't be right!

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:08:57.412 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
Huh? Let's try asking
it something else.

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.042 position:50% align:center
What's the Kunad Gate?

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
Talk about that.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
Retrieving data
on the Kunad Gate.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
The Kunad Gate is a large
quasi-black hole that has

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
appeared in the sky
above the Kunad Highway.

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center

the accelerated expansion

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
of the Kunad Gate has been

--What?!

At this point in time,

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:35.033 position:50% align:center
earth's destruction is
no longer avoidable.

Forget that! Why did you
bring up my psionic power?

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
Is there really a connection
between me and the Kunad Gate?

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
[VISION] The Kunad Gate

...in order to usher in the

Yuito. That was a lot,
but don't be too upset.

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
The gate is growing.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
And seems to be pulling
in everything around it.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
You think when it
gets big enough...

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
...it'll really
swallow up the earth?

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous to take
that story at face value.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It could be
some sort of trap.

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
We can not let them deceive us.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.526 position:50% align:center
Right. Good point.

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
Well, then what's next?

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:55.905 position:50% align:center
That BABE system.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.866 position:50% align:center
It's probably
worth investigating.

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:00.201 position:50% align:center
If we want to ask
about the Others,

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:03.288 position:50% align:center
the Vision said we would need
to access it, didn't she?

Mm.

So, it's knowledge of BABE

What is BABE, exactly?

It is the supercomputer

Isn't that sweet?

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.049 position:50% align:center
How can I trust you?

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.593 position:50% align:center
You think I might be
in cahoots with Kyoka?

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
But why help you if I were?

00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
I thought you were supposed
to be one of the smart ones!

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
Anyway, you see? I knew that
you would regret coming here.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
[KASANE grunts]

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:08.106 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] But I'll rub
your face in it later.

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:11.609 position:50% align:center
For now, let's run. This place
is worse than I remember.

00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:15.697 position:50% align:center
Oh, and newsflash. Yuito and
his platoon are here, too.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.992 position:50% align:center
Yuito? That's terrible!

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:21.119 position:50% align:center
Togetsu is after my Red Strings.

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:24.080 position:50% align:center
And Yuito likely has
the same power.

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
I hear you.

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:29.002 position:50% align:center
We'll just have to go rescue the
whole crowd then, won't we?

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
Let's get to it.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.755 position:50% align:center
[KASANE sighs]

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE BELIEVERS gasp]

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE BELIEVER C]
Sister Kasane is gone.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA]
Huh? But how is that possible?

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
When I think about it,

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
a touching reunion doesn't
really sound all that fun.

00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:51.441 position:50% align:center
Okie dokie, I'll see
you when I see you!

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:53.818 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
Hey, wait!

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:55.278 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA]
Kagero...

00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:05.830 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO, KASANE]
Hm?

00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] Kasane! Kagero!
I'm so glad you're both okay!

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:12.003 position:50% align:center
Haruka, where's the platoon?

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] I don't know.
I'm not getting through to them.

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:18.093 position:50% align:center
Got any idea where
they're being held?

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:19.719 position:50% align:center
Not in the slightest.

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Huh! But I do know
where Yuito's group is headed!

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.485 position:50% align:center
[MALE BELIEVER A]
We are here, Brother Yuito.

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:39.364 position:50% align:center
BABE is available to answer
any inquiry you may have.

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.285 position:50% align:center
[MALE BELIEVER A] You desire to
discover whether everything

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:47.872 position:50% align:center
you've heard thus far is the
truth, isn't that correct?

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
Speak with BABE, and your doubts
shall be reborn as convictions.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
We welcome your questions.

00:20:56.381 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
The Moon is watching over you,
Brothers and Sisters.

[YUITO grunts]

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:25.660 position:50% align:center
Despite what they say,
this doesn't feel right.

00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:28.872 position:50% align:center
I agree. This system's on
the same level as Arahabaki

00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
is for us, and they're
letting outsiders use it?

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and now that you
mention it, why does a small

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:38.798 position:50% align:center
religious order like them even
need a computer that powerful?

00:21:38.882 --> 00:21:43.136 position:50% align:center
Wataru? You there?
Can you hear me?

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:46.306 position:50% align:center
Great. They're blocking
the Psynet signal.

00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50% align:center
Let's hurry and get the intel.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
Then we'll get out of
here as fast as we can.

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:53.188 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Right.

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:54.814 position:50% align:center
[HANABI gasps]

00:21:58.777 --> 00:22:00.153 position:50% align:center
[YUITO sighs, gasps]

00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:02.572 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
What's wrong?

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:05.283 position:50% align:center
Why isn't the Vision
showing up now?

00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:08.036 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:10.080 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
What the--?

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:13.375 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]
I know this feeling.

00:22:13.458 --> 00:22:15.835 position:50% align:center
It's like being
connected to SAS!

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:17.921 position:50% align:center
--[YUITO gasps]
--[HANABI] Yuito?

00:22:20.674 --> 00:22:22.509 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Whoa.

00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:24.469 position:50% align:center
What's happening?

00:22:24.552 --> 00:22:26.012 position:50% align:center
I can't move!
