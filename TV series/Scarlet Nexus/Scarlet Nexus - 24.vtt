Yakumo... Sumeragi?

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.844 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.220 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Karen.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.182 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
So, you're the same person?

00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
I just don't believe it.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:04.981 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] What is this?
Something's not right.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:10.070 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.329 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
No. It wasn't like this before.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.373 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO gasp]

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:47.125 position:50% align:center
Karen.

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
You've really been down
here for 2,000 years.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:52.922 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:57.177 position:50% align:center
Karen. There's something that
we need you to do for us.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.764 position:50% align:center
Help us destroy the Kunad Gate,
or the world will end!

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.936 position:50% align:center
When you traveled through time,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50% align:center
by using Arahabaki
and the Red Strings,

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:12.025 position:50% align:center
you decided to interfere
with events that happened

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:16.780 position:50% align:center
2,000 years ago that
created an entanglement.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
Unless we rectify it,
the Gate will remain.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:25.413 position:50% align:center
She's right. If we don't do
something, humanity will perish!

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
So please, we need your help!

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.417 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
It won't solve anything.

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:32.128 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]
But the person who creates

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
a dimensional entanglement is
the one who has to unravel it.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.677 position:50% align:center
We know because we've
done it ourselves!

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
I realize that.

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.846 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Are you kidding me?

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.807 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA]
Then why won't you help?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.642 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Because it won't do any good.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center
That's the truth of it.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.062 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO gasp]

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.816 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.235 position:50% align:center
Wait. This doesn't add up.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
You moved through time in
the hope of saving Alice.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
But why go back 2,000 years?

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:06.037 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] I didn't understand,
not at first.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
[LUKA]
At first?

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] As you are aware,
Yakumo Sumeragi was born

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
a Red Strings-user, and I
believe that I must have been

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
drawn to that power somehow.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.677 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] So, you casually
jumped two millennia?

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.097 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] I was searching,
hoping there was a way

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
to change the future so that
we'd meet in our own time.

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
And you thought that the
solution was to become

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:34.274 position:50% align:center
Yakumo Sumeragi?

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] I was certain that the
office of the nation's founder

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
would prove itself
useful to my cause.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.323 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Useful? What did you plan to do?

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Many ages after that,

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center
I discovered the only way that
I could hope to save Alice.

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.876 position:50% align:center
What did you do? Tell us.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
It was simple.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
I connected myself to Arahabaki.

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] I thought that
if my brain was synced up

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
with the heart of
all other systems,

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
I could change history
and rescue Alice.

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:15.815 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
This is crazy.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:21.988 position:50% align:center
A bio-computer that uses your
brain in tandem with Arahabaki?

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA] So, all those
intrusions into our brains,

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
they were because of you?

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
This doesn't add up.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
After everything you did,
why didn't she come back?

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] I don't know.
I tried so many times.

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
How many?

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.509 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] I've sent
countless copies of myself

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:47.138 position:50% align:center
throughout time, in hopes
of taking Yakumo's place.

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
And what does that mean?

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Dimensional entanglements occur

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
in each instance.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
But if I try to unravel them,
then I can't rescue her.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.402 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
Yes, that's exactly right.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.530 position:50% align:center
I create new dimensional
entanglements.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:05.573 position:50% align:center
Brother!

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
They're both Karen?

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.327 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
It's you. I don't understand.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.041 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:18.878 position:50% align:center
I'll be asking the questions!
Now explain this;

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:22.257 position:50% align:center
You told me to become
Yakumo and link to Arahabaki.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
That nothing else would be
enough to save Alice's life!

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:28.888 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] It's true,
that's the only way.

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center
You must travel through time.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
The proof is stored
on Arahabaki.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
It kept records of
every single attempt,

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
from the very beginning.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] Then why can't
I go back 2,000 years?

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
What do you mean?

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.446 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] Why have I failed
to travel through time?

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.448 position:50% align:center
Answer me!

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.284 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Did I not help you?

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
It was you.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Huh?

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
Tell me everything you know,

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.585 position:50% align:center
or I'll destroy you
here and now!

00:06:58.668 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO gasp]

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center

Finally, my brain's
connected to Arahabaki,

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
it's such a powerful sensation!

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:50.095 position:50% align:center
All of the data it holds
now belongs to me!

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:50.929 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
No way!

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.263 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
For real?

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50% align:center

everything inside Arahabaki?

How dare you!

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] Try as you might,
that will never change.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:44.524 position:50% align:center
You will always be an
infinitesimal fraction

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
of what I am.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.861 position:50% align:center
You might as well give up now.

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
Huh?

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
How many attempts?

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.791 position:50% align:center
How many times have
I transferred the data

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
to my countless copies?

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
And yet, the future
remains unaffected.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
Alice can't be saved.

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
I have observed
every single try,

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:19.976 position:50% align:center
and I am the only one who
could've changed things.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.605 position:50% align:center
You have struggled endlessly,
and predictably,

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
you have nothing to show for it.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:31.154 position:50% align:center
Lest you forget, you are but one
individual among the infinite.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
That's enough! It's a lie!

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
Shut your mouth!

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
I won't be stopped!

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.206 position:50% align:center
I'll try every way possible,

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
and I don't care how

[LUKA, ARASHI grunt]

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:56.596 position:50% align:center
You never got to
absorb Yuito's skill.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.764 position:50% align:center
That must've been the reason

00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
you weren't able to
travel through time!

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
I think I understand now.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.478 position:50% align:center
You can't sustain
the Red Strings,

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:05.563 position:50% align:center
so you keep on copying it!

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
You're not strong enough!

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center
Don't waste your time resisting.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.987 position:50% align:center
I won't rest until I harness
the power of the Red Strings!

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:17.117 position:50% align:center
Karen! If you time-travel now,
then the world will end!

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.910 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
Why should that matter?

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center

Our society... The moon...

There are lots of problems.

But if the world ends,
then nothing will get solved!

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
Our only choice is to
forge a new future!

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] A world with such a
hideous past isn't worth saving.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:47.814 position:50% align:center
