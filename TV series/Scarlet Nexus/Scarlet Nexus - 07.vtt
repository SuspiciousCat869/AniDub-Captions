00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:11.136 position:50% align:center
There's personality
rehabilitation, too.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:16.099 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] The government is hiding
secrets I know nothing about.

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:22.731 position:50% align:center
Watch your back.
This nation... wants you.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] What's going on here?
Did father know about this?

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.989 position:50% align:center
Did my brother?

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center
Regardless, I'll get
to the bottom of it!

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.954 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Taking down Arahabaki
was a declaration of war.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.249 position:50% align:center
One led by Karen and the
Seiran Regional Force.

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:43.835 position:50% align:center
I see. They're regrouping.

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center
Sir. What about the Chairman?

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.089 position:50% align:center
Was it them?

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
That's right. Karen and
Seiran are to blame.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:52.969 position:50% align:center
What are we going
to do now, sir?

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.597 position:50% align:center
Nearly half of our
troops have defected.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center
Indeed, and therefore,
we'll have to reorganize.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.437 position:50% align:center
You'll join a newly formed unit.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.731 position:50% align:center
The oh-one Platoon.

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:07.859 position:50% align:center
Furthermore, the commander
will be Yuito.

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:10.236 position:50% align:center
Huh? Sir, are you sure?

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.032 position:50% align:center
As I had said, we will need
you to become a hero.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:17.118 position:50% align:center
You'll be the protector
of New Himuka.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:23.500 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.508 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]
Huh?

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.635 position:50% align:center
[HANABI]
Yuito? What's wrong?

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.054 position:50% align:center
Why'd you suddenly stop?

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:01.681 position:50% align:center
U-Uh...

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:02.891 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
Weren't we all just
having a meeting at HQ?

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.728 position:50% align:center
Meeting?

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:09.856 position:50% align:center
What the hell are
you talking about?

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.151 position:50% align:center
Sorry for the delay.
I ordered a media blackout.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.362 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, the Crows
would be everywhere.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50% align:center
Huh? Lieutenant Colonel?

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:19.199 position:50% align:center
I already told you
there's no need

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.576 position:50% align:center
to stand on ceremony around me.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.746 position:50% align:center
Come on. You're the platoon
commander after all.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50% align:center
I'm the commander?
You're joking, right?

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.793 position:50% align:center
You're messing with me.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:30.919 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50% align:center
He's acting... strange.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:35.465 position:50% align:center
Wataru, are there
any abnormalities

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.425 position:50% align:center
in Yuito's brain data?

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center
Nothing. All normal here.

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center
Yuito, we've been assigned to
the OSF's oh-one Platoon

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.767 position:50% align:center
and you're our commander.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
Well? Does anything I've
said jog your memory?

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.232 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I remember being
summoned by my brother,

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
but after that...

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:56.736 position:50% align:center
...it's all blank.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.612 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:59.739 position:50% align:center
I can't remember a single thing.

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
Did I ask Kaito
about those secrets?

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.703 position:50% align:center
Do you seriously not remember?

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Huh? I don't.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
That can't be a good sign.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
You should get checked.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
Visit the OSF Hospital
as soon as you can.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
[WATARU] I'll bring it up to the
top brass if it gets worse.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
Oh! My uncle works there!

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
He's the director general
of the OSF Hospital!

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
I could introduce you two!

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
I bet he can pull some strings
and let you skip the line!

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
You can leave the
patrolling to us.

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
Mm.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
You're still our commander,

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
so I can't force you
to do anything.

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
Better safe than
sorry, right, Yuito?

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.362 position:50% align:center
[YUITO sighs]

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
Attention.

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
The Seiran OSF assignments
have been restructured.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
The oh-one Platoon.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
Kyoka Eden.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.086 position:50% align:center
Arashi Spring.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.921 position:50% align:center
Kagero Donne.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.381 position:50% align:center
Shiden Ritter.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center
And Haruka Frazer.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
Lead by... Kasane Randall.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
New Himuka,

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50% align:center
their sins far exceed
just a surveillance state.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.980 position:50% align:center
They use humans for
forbidden research.

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
Research on turning
people into Others.

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
Their final goal was
finding a way to forge

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
exceptional psionics users,
and in doing so,

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
they conducted experiments
metamorphosing life forms.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.536 position:50% align:center
I will crush their
regime and put an end

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
to their hellish research.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
You should join us in Seiran.

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
[KASANE grunts] Did New Himuka
turn Naomi into an Other?

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.630 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
They did.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.965 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything you ask of me

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center
as long as you
promise to help her.

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
We'll do whatever we can.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
Okay. Then I'll come along
with you to Seiran.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
I never thought that
you of all people,

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
would end up siding with Seiran.

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
Well believe it or not,
I was born in New Himuka.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
Trust me, the way the
government operates

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
has never sat right with me.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
They're just so erratic.

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
You're another surprise, Kyoka.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me. Did you only
come here cause of Karen?

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
Oh my. Is there something
wrong with me

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.797 position:50% align:center
wanting to follow
the Major General?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you for real?!

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Just kidding.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:29.347 position:50% align:center
I can't ignore the questionable
things the government is doing,

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.683 position:50% align:center
even if it would
make my life easier.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
But still, I can't believe
they're researching

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.688 position:50% align:center
how to turn humans into Others.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
Unforgivable.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
Seems like we're all
on the same page.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
Everyone who's in
Seiran right now

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.487 position:50% align:center
distrusts the New
Himukan Government.

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
But I'm sure some
people are here

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.324 position:50% align:center
because of the Major
General's magnetism.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
Hm. Hold on, where's Kasane?

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.414 position:50% align:center
Who knows? She left as soon
as the meeting ended

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
and I haven't seen her since.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI sighs]

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.258 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever it takes
to find you again.

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.149 position:50% align:center
The hero who assassinated
Chairman Sumeragi,

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50% align:center
finally here in Seiran.

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
The higher-ups were delighted
to hear of your decision.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
It wasn't me.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:30.658 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] Don't be in such a
rush to throw it all away.

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:33.203 position:50% align:center
You can use it to
your advantage.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:36.414 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling that it's
Seiran that wants to use me.

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter.
Where is Naomi?

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:43.880 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] I'd like you to tell
me what you think about this.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:46.925 position:50% align:center
A micro local gravitational
anomaly that appeared above

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
the Kunad Highway.

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
And it's getting larger?

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:56.685 position:50% align:center
Yes. As it consumes its
surroundings it's growing.

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.186 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
The Kunad Gate,

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50% align:center
or so it's called by the
New Himukan government.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:02.190 position:50% align:center
[KASANE grunts]

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] And during that time,
something else began to grow.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
It was the quasi-black hole
that you and I created,

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
something that would become
known as the Kunad Gate.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] I suspect that you've
seen a larger gate than this.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center
One big enough to
consume the world.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.917 position:50% align:center
--[KASANE gasps]
--[KAREN] As I thought.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
Tell me. You went to
the future, didn't you?

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
[KASANE grunts]
What do you mean?

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.426 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] Don't waste time
playing coy with me.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center
I just want to know what you
saw while you were there.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] So he knows that
I traveled through time.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
There's no point in hiding it.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
As the world was coming
to an end, you and I met.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
Did this future me
say anything to you?

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
Somebody's on my side.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.323 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:53.825 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Were you
talking about having help

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
to save people who were
turned into Others?

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.789 position:50% align:center
Well? I know you're
hiding something.

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center
If you can cure those people
and change them back to normal,

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.128 position:50% align:center
you can save
Naomi, too, right?

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
You've got a lot of questions.

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center
The only thing I can tell
you is that we have

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
a research facility here in
Seiran to study the Others.

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:13.928 position:50% align:center
And Naomi is there, isn't she?

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:15.889 position:50% align:center
[KAREN]
Yes, for her protection.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center

Yuito! How'd it go?

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
Apparently it's just exhaustion,

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:54.988 position:50% align:center
and because of that my body is
over-secreting psionic hormones,

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.198 position:50% align:center
which in turn causes
temporary confusion

00:10:57.282 --> 00:11:00.702 position:50% align:center
and affects the memory

[TSUGUMI gasps]

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:24.627 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI] I can see the van,
but no sign of Nagi.

00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:26.463 position:50% align:center
Can you take a look inside?

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:32.510 position:50% align:center
There are a bunch of
areas I can't see into.

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:35.680 position:50% align:center
To think this place really
is still being used.

00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:36.556 position:50% align:center
Uh, what?

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center
[LUKA] I'd heard rumors about
a facility in the old hospital

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
that's still operational.
Looks like it's true.

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
[LUKA] It's possible that
all of this destruction

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.235 position:50% align:center
was caused by the
New Himukan government.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:51.446 position:50% align:center
Wataru. Can you
pull up any info?

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
What are we dealing with?

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.950 position:50% align:center
I can't access any of
the old hospital's data.

00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
I won't be of much
use here, so be careful.

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Got it.

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
Okay, everyone, we're going in.

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.597 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
That thing creeps me out.

00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:20.433 position:50% align:center
It just keeps absorbing
everything around it.

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:22.143 position:50% align:center
Do you ever wonder what
happens to all the things

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
that get pulled in?

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:25.480 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shiden,
stick a finger in it.

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:27.440 position:50% align:center
I bet it feels
super weird inside.

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.984 position:50% align:center
Why don't you do us all a favor
and shove your head in there?

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:30.985 position:50% align:center
Ha!

00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
That's enough, guys.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.531 position:50% align:center
Don't even joke about
approaching that thing.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
Curiosity killed
the cat, you know.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] I can feel it.
It's resonating.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:42.247 position:50% align:center
I've felt this before.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.291 position:50% align:center
It's the same sensation as when
the power of the Red Strings

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
is at work.

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
That means...

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Our psionic
power is gravikinesis,

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
and we both use a similar form.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.511 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] Our powers
resonated with each other,

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
which spawned the Kunad Gate.

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.016 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Everything he said is happening.

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
I have to change the future.

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.145 position:50% align:center
What's got you looking so glum?

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
I bet I know what it is!

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
It's because that's the thing
that destroys the world

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
in the future, right?

00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
It must've been weird
meeting the future Yuito.

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:15.697 position:50% align:center
It's like he was a
totally different person.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
A grief-stricken old man who
had given up. Waiting to die.

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center
So you're trying to kill Yuito?

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:23.955 position:50% align:center
Before he turns
into that person?

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
At least he won't
have to suffer.

And now that person...

[MALE SCIENTIST B] What's this?
Someone's broken in! Impossible!

something wrong?

[YUITO]
Huh?

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:17.384 position:50% align:center
Does it remind you of when
you were hospitalized?

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
Uh? Not really.

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
I was too young back then.

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
So, to tell you the truth,
I can hardly remember it.

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
I was too focused on watching
for threats in front.

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.
