And honestly,

Yuito! How'd it go?

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
Apparently it's just exhaustion,

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:54.988 position:50% align:center
and because of that my body is
over-secreting psionic hormones,

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.198 position:50% align:center
which in turn causes
temporary confusion

00:10:57.282 --> 00:11:00.702 position:50% align:center
and affects the memory

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:04.789 position:50% align:center
Nothing serious. I'll be
okay if I take my meds.
