[KASANE]
An ampule?

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:34.069 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I found them
in the old subway.

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:35.987 position:50% align:center
Is it some kind of drug?

00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:38.281 position:50% align:center
They've got Seiran's
mark on them.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:42.577 position:50% align:center
Hey. I've seen these.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
Y'mean at your house?

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Why would they have been there?

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
Either way, it might be a clue.

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.801 position:50% align:center
Don't mention this
to anyone, okay?

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'm...

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:06.059 position:50% align:center
About the Other.

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.937 position:50% align:center
I knew that it was Naomi,
but I just--

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.315 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] Save your breath!
I'm going to bring her back.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
Just see that you
don't get in my way.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
This may not mean much, but if
there's any way I can help out,

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
then I'd really like to.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
Not sure you can.
But, thanks, I guess.

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Have you heard from Nagi?

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] No, not since he
was put in the hospital.

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
We were both in the
volunteer faction.

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:47.100 position:50% align:center
We hung out in the academy, too.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:50.854 position:50% align:center
As a Sumeragi, I'm seen as
special everywhere I go,

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.565 position:50% align:center
and that can make things
weird for me sometimes.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.404 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] But being around
Nagi felt totally normal,

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
even natural.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe not normal.

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:08.163 position:50% align:center
I mean, hey, we were
instant best friends.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:12.250 position:50% align:center
But, without that guy,
I wouldn't be here.

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center
Let's be friends, Kasane.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
[SETO]
Kasane.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, YUITO gasp]

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Captain Seto.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.974 position:50% align:center
So are you feeling better now?

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:29.017 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
You sure? Don't push it.

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:34.356 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine.
Please don't worry.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.900 position:50% align:center
You're not the only one
I'm worried about.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:38.109 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
Whenever soldiers get
in over their heads,

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.615 position:50% align:center
it tends to put their
comrades in danger, as well.

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
It's not just you.
Your whole platoon is at stake.

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:53.041 position:50% align:center
Always remember that.

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:54.542 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:57.003 position:50% align:center
That'll be all. Take care.

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
--[KASANE chuckles]
--[YUITO] Huh?

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
Are you sure nobody's
gonna see us?

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:17.148 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] Relax. It's a blind
spot in the surveillance.

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.819 position:50% align:center
[MAN B] Our preparations
are almost complete.

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
And the OSF. Is it?

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
Its demise is in motion.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] At last, this country
will fall by our own hands.

What the--?

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.421 position:50% align:center
That's impossible!

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:55.186 position:50% align:center
The MOA is forecasting an Others
event of record proportions.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] It will occur within
a 10-kilometer radius,

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
mainly Kunad Highway.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:05.864 position:50% align:center
The entire OSF will be
dispatched to respond.

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.618 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] Area civilians have
been told to evacuate.

Quickly!

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center

Keep it moving!

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:16.541 position:50% align:center
[MALE CITIZEN A]
Can't be that bad.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:17.751 position:50% align:center

It happened in Kunad, not here.

You need to leave!

Right. Be careful.

own special force today.

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
From what I'm hearing, there's
a ton of Others this time.

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:38.313 position:50% align:center
I'm glad it's him and not me.

Kasane, you okay?

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.452 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I heard what
the Commander said.

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:54.245 position:50% align:center
I'll stay calm.

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center

Yep!

yourselves sick or anything!

Glad to have you.

Let's do this!

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center
Nagi.

[gasps]

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:50.844 position:50% align:center
Welcome back.
That's enough chatter, though.

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center
Let's move out.

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:53.221 position:50% align:center

Right!

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:57.183 position:50% align:center
Listen. Are you sure that
you're well enough?

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:59.519 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I got wounded,
but I'm all good now.

Y'see?

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
No, not that.
The, uh... Naomi thing.

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
[NAGI] Oh. I was shocked when I
heard she was killed in action,

[YUITO gasps]

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
but I can't be stuck in
my head about it forever.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?
No, she's still alive.

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
[NAGI]
Huh?

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] I mean,
she turned into an Other,

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:22.751 position:50% align:center
so I guess it depends on
whether you call that "alive".

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
Yuito. What's this all about?

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?
She's an Other?

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.215 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center

then it's not funny.

What if Kasane hears
you say that?

00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:37.015 position:50% align:center
But...

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:41.269 position:50% align:center

keep looking ahead, okay?

shouldn't we be getting close
to the forecast location?

He's right.

00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center
We've only seen a few
Others here and there.

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:19.849 position:50% align:center
Yeah, the place is supposed
to be overrun with them.

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:22.268 position:50% align:center
If it stays like this,
we can go home early.
