them before it was too late.

Indeed. It can't have been

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.952 position:50% align:center
So, when we were at that
secret research facility,

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.662 position:50% align:center
Alice was there too, right?

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.039 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI]
Yes.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
In fact, the reason we built
it in the first place

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.418 position:50% align:center
was to help her by trying
to reverse the change.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:28.672 position:50% align:center
I knew it. So that Other
we saw really was Alice.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.215 position:50% align:center
That was her?

00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:32.676 position:50% align:center
So that means...

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.553 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI] That's right.
Alice, in Other form,

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:38.682 position:50% align:center
was part of that big group
of human-derived Others.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.016 position:50% align:center
She protected us.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.935 position:50% align:center
Aunt Alice was there?

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:43.895 position:50% align:center
But, she...

00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:45.313 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI]
If I had to guess,

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:49.150 position:50% align:center
I'd say Karen is probably
trying to save Alice.

I'll hit reset as many
times as it takes.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:59.369 position:50% align:center
So you're saying that Karen
traveled back in time

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:02.330 position:50% align:center
to try to stop Alice from
turning into an Other?

00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:05.208 position:50% align:center
But why would he attack Yuito?

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.502 position:50% align:center
He probably needed
Yuito's power.

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:10.463 position:50% align:center
He must not be able to control
the Red Strings without it.

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.841 position:50% align:center
It sounds like he's
done this before.

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:14.926 position:50% align:center
If this wasn't his
first attempt,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.262 position:50% align:center

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.932 position:50% align:center
Watch out, I'm gonna work even

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
Make sure you don't
do anything stupid.

Oh, I know.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't dare dream
of causing problems,

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.944 position:50% align:center
unlike someone I know who
keeps disobeying his orders.

Fifty demerits? You're putting
up some serious numbers.

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
I heard a trainer say that you'd
be a shoo-in for Septentrion.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
If that's the case, you
should try to become

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
He actually worries about
his teammates quite a bit.

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
Well, then how about
the two of you

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
share the commander position?

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:34.773 position:50% align:center
Now that's an idea.

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
Karen could take charge,
and I'd be his top lieutenant.

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
Or maybe...

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center

a new regiment structure.

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
we were able to rescue
Alice from the OSF Hospital.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
And yet, we still
couldn't turn her back.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
She just went from
one cage to another.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
I've wondered.
Did we really save Alice?

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.317 position:50% align:center
Or did we just force her to
endure an even more gruesome

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:13.653 position:50% align:center
and painful fate?

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
That fear still haunts me.

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
[FUBUKI] I begged Karen to put
an end to this. To let go.

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:25.498 position:50% align:center
But he refused to listen.

00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:29.044 position:50% align:center
He swore he'd save Alice,
no matter the cost.

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
[ALICE]
And once you're out of there,

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
you and your brother
can live with us forever!

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
He's trying to change her fate.

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:40.221 position:50% align:center
That's why he's doing
all this-- to save Alice.

00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
That would explain his actions.

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but if he was able
to travel through time,

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
then why did Alice
still end up dead?

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:50.565 position:50% align:center
It's clear he went to the past.

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
But maybe he
couldn't alter history?

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
So, does that mean
his plan failed?

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
Dunno...

00:19:57.197 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
Regardless, we have bigger
things to deal with right now.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.868 position:50% align:center
Like Togetsu.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
That's right. While we
shouldn't ignore Karen,

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
Putting a stop to
Togetsu's plans

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.375 position:50% align:center
is the more pressing matter.

00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
How do we do that?

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
What if we tried
to shut down BABE?

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
Togetsu's central computer.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
It's the obvious target.

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
BABE holds their
Red Strings research,

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
if they were to lose it,

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
I'd bet their plan would
come to a grinding halt.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
I'll leave that up to you,
since it seems you have

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
the clearest picture of
the current situation.

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
But while you deal with Togetsu,

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.898 position:50% align:center
is there anything I can
do on my end to help?

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
I can't let you do all the work.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
Could you act as an intermediary
between Suoh and Seiran?

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
If you could help ease
tensions between them,

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
that would severely limit
Togetsu's options.

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:46.079 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll do my best to
get a ceasefire signed.

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
Suoh and Seiran may disagree,

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
but neither of them
trusts Togetsu.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.334 position:50% align:center
If I were you,

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
I'd leverage that and turn
them against a common foe.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
It's worth a shot.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
Be careful, and don't
get in over your head.

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:00.677 position:50% align:center
And you as well.
Good luck out there.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.806 position:50% align:center
Back to Togetsu, huh?
We're gonna need a plan.

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
How 'bout this? Kagero and Kyoka
both know their way around.

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:10.562 position:50% align:center
So, they'll be in charge
of getting us in.

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
Fine. You got this, right?

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
Yeah. No problem.

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI]
Mm. Kagero?

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, what's up?

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
This cavern could be
our ticket inside.

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:33.877 position:50% align:center
Isn't that the cave we
used to get away last time?

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.172 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna sound paranoid,
but are you sure it'll be safe?

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
Kagero? Any thoughts?

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:43.470 position:50% align:center
Uh, I do have something
to add, but it's sensitive.

00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:46.681 position:50% align:center
Can we postpone this
strategy meeting?

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
Yuito. I think there's something
that you should know

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
before we head
off to Togetsu.

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:52.562 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
I need some fresh air.
Let's continue this outside.

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center
Everyone, you all deserve
to know the truth.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.283 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
What did you want to tell me?

00:22:07.035 --> 00:22:08.787 position:50% align:center
I can't hide it anymore.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.413 position:50% align:center
You should know what
happened on the night

00:22:10.497 --> 00:22:12.207 position:50% align:center
of your father's murder.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.583 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:17.629 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] The person who
killed the chairman...

00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:19.089 position:50% align:center
...was me.

00:22:19.172 --> 00:22:20.507 position:50% align:center
Huh?
