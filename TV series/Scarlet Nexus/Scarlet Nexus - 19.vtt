[YUITO] Hold on.
What are you talking about?

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
I told you a while back that
I was a spy for Togetsu.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.265 position:50% align:center
Chairman Sumeragi had his
suspicions about Togetsu

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.934 position:50% align:center
before he passed on,

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
but even he didn't know
anything about their plan

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.814 position:50% align:center
for taking control
over the Red Strings.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.358 position:50% align:center
All he knew was that they
were up to something.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.903 position:50% align:center
And Togetsu noticed
his suspicion,

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
which made him a threat.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
That's what happened.

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
And... that's also why
I was sent to Suoh.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
There, I joined the OSF and
waited for the perfect moment

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.289 position:50% align:center
to strike.

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
But all this time, I thought
your goal was to stop Togetsu.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Oh, it was. Which is
why I couldn't give them

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.007 position:50% align:center
any reason to
question my loyalty.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
So, I had to play their
game in every way I could.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
I had no problem
with the chairman.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50% align:center
But he was getting
closer to the truth,

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center
which put my life in jeopardy.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
So... it had to be done.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
Kagero, I don't understand
a word you're saying.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:36.359 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Kasane, you were
there that night, weren't you?

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.905 position:50% align:center
Do you remember what the
Chairman tried to tell you

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
about the OSF? I do.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.370 position:50% align:center
What he intended to say was that
there was a spy in their ranks.

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.289 position:50% align:center
He meant me, of course.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] And then the last
words he uttered were,

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
"Forget me. Save yourself."

00:04:57.047 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center

I could make it any clearer.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.705 position:50% align:center
Okay. But why tell me
all this now?

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.541 position:50% align:center
Does my reasoning really
make any difference?

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
I just figured I
should apologize.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
But, of course, I'd never
expect you to forgive me.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.633 position:50% align:center
So, what's the plan?

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
I'll take my leave now,
if you want me to.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:48.473 position:50% align:center
Is that it? That's how

Even if I don't off you here,

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:12.195 position:50% align:center
Togetsu will never stop
hunting you down.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center

are highly desirable targets,

as well.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.954 position:50% align:center
Yuito Sumeragi, the promising
rookie of the OSF.

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:23.415 position:50% align:center
And its chief, Kaito Sumeragi.

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.041 position:50% align:center
Why not let them handle
things for a while,

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
so you can take a
little sabbatical?

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:30.422 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
My family has an objective.

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center

that as well as I do.

Yuito is still in the dark,

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
about this nation and
the Sumeragi name.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50% align:center
And Kaito misconstrues
our ancestor's wish.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
Yakumo never intended the
path of violence for us.

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
He would've never allowed
the Sumeragi family

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center
and New Himuka to commit
these unspeakable sins 

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.655 position:50% align:center
against its innocent civilians!

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
For that reason, I refuse
to surrender to my death,

nor is it right for me to hide.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:10.086 position:50% align:center
I must save this nation

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
understand how to
right all the wrongs

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
that have been committed!

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Well, now,
I had taken you for a coward.

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] But you're just
like your ancestors.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.851 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Hearing you make
that heroic speech makes it

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
even harder to do you in.

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
Still,if you refuse

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.111 position:50% align:center

[KASANE grunts]

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO]
I never laid a finger on him.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
But still, after the way
that whole confrontation

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
played out in the end,

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50% align:center
I might as well
have murdered him.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
You wanted to settle all this
before going back to Togetsu?

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
And to do that, you
needed to provoke Yuito.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO]
Hm.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
I knew that he'd respond

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
with the only thing
he could, a fight.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
But then, at the last moment,

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.932 position:50% align:center
I remembered what was
most important to me

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
and I couldn't die.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
There was still a job
left for me to do.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
Thwarting Togetsu's plan.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center

Heh. You're the best, Tsugumi.

Mm.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
I think you mentioned
a "her", who was she?

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
Yeah, back in Togetsu,

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.953 position:50% align:center
you had talked about
having a family.

00:13:07.037 --> 00:13:08.580 position:50% align:center
Is that who you meant?

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:11.166 position:50% align:center
Yeah, my little girl.

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center
I left her and my
wife on the Moon.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
If they rewind history, then
she'll never have been born

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:22.719 position:50% align:center
and I'll be damned
if I let that happen.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
We can't allow Togetsu to get
control of the Red Strings.

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
But 2,000 years have passed.

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:32.103 position:50% align:center
My girls were laid
to rest ages ago.

So I probably sound
like a hopeless old fool.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.901 position:50% align:center
But, they existed once

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:42.697 position:50% align:center
and I refuse to let my
wife and child be erased.

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:44.282 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:48.620 position:50% align:center
As the head of state, I know
that my father wasn't innocent.

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
He was connected
to a lot of things,

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
probably all the stuff
with Naomi and Nagi.

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
But still, that man was the
only father I've ever had.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
Now he's gone.

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:03.927 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.722 position:50% align:center
I can see why you don't want
your family to be erased.

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:12.394 position:50% align:center
When Arahabaki destroyed
my past, I was scared.

I can't let another person

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50% align:center
Erasing somebody's past
is a terrible crime

ever get away with it.

Let's stop Togetsu.

This doesn't mean
that I forgive you.

But together, I believe we
have what it takes to win.

Is it just me, or did that
not feel like a normal quake?

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:41.232 position:50% align:center
Right. You know that time
on the Kunad Highway?

00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:42.817 position:50% align:center
Felt just like that.

Is everybody okay?

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
The Kunad Gate just went through
a momentary data anomaly.

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:59.125 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] There was a huge quake
across all of New Himuka.

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.961 position:50% align:center
But there doesn't seem
to be any major damage.

00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:03.630 position:50% align:center
We're okay, too.

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
I don't see signs of landslides
on Hieno Mountain.

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:10.053 position:50% align:center
Does this mean that the
Kunad Gate is getting bigger?

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:15.767 position:50% align:center
[YUITO] The gate was
sustained by my power alone,

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.937 position:50% align:center
so it would have vanished
if I'd been killed.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.480 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center

[KASANE gasps]

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:28.446 position:50% align:center

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:40.125 position:50% align:center
Yes. I say while we're

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.221 position:50% align:center
Huh?

something wasn't quite right?

[YUITO]
No, I don't think so.

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
Actually, since you guys
saved me from Arahabaki,

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:03.106 position:50% align:center
I haven't had
headaches or anything.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
Wonder why.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO]
That's good to hear, at least.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.236 position:50% align:center
When I was fighting
with you before,

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
it was like you suddenly had
some incredible surge of power 

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:13.742 position:50% align:center
that came out of nowhere.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.086 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] Maybe I just
sensed your emotions

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
kicking into high gear.
Do you think that could be it?

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
It's possible. Emotions can
affect psionic powers.

00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:37.098 position:50% align:center
Still, though, I don't
think that's it.

00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:38.933 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI grunts]

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
It could also be a sign
that your abilities

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center
are about to fade
away altogether.

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:45.357 position:50% align:center
Some people say that makes
you get exceptionally strong

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
for a short amount of time.

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
Huh? So, my powers
are gonna disappear?

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.864 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] It's an extremely
rare phenomenon.

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:56.368 position:50% align:center
Usually, it occurs in
brains of advanced ages.

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:59.037 position:50% align:center
I suppose that could be
what's happening here.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
[LUKA] Thing is, you've been
through a lot so far.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
Your brain's suffered
heavy damage.

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.002 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:08.963 position:50% align:center
And there's also the fact
that I used to be a dud.

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:11.257 position:50% align:center
[KASANE gasps]
What are you saying?

00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:13.093 position:50% align:center
You were a dud, really?

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
[KASANE] So, you got your
powers from their experiments?

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN] Are you sure
you were born a dud?

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:25.730 position:50% align:center
There wasn't some
kind of mistake?

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
I had my doubts at first, too.

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
But after I heard Karen
and Luka's story,

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.987 position:50% align:center
I realized I was
probably just like them.

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.908 position:50% align:center
I would be more surprised
if that wasn't the case.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:43.540 position:50% align:center
So, this enhanced power,
how long will I have it?

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
Do you think it'll
wear off in a day or two?

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:49.212 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] It's not supposed
to happen that quickly.

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
But your case is so unusual,
it's rather hard to say.

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
Well, it's not a
foregone conclusion.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:58.805 position:50% align:center
So far, it's all speculation.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
[HANABI gasps]
Mm-hm.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
I guess.

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
Let's keep moving.
Togetsu's waiting!

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
Sounds good.

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:08.064 position:50% align:center
Well then, perhaps I'd
better go on ahead

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
so I can clear a path
for the rest of you.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
Sure. Thanks a lot.

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
It's open.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Let's go.

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:41.890 position:50% align:center
[KYOKA] I'm sure they
already know we're in here,

00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center
so we'll have to operate
as quickly as possible!

00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:47.020 position:50% align:center
I say we make a
beeline for BABE.

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:48.730 position:50% align:center
[TSUGUMI gasps]
They're close!

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:52.067 position:50% align:center
[YUITO gasps]

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO] They sent a welcome
party and everything!

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
We'll break through them!

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:01.785 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI shouts]

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.915 position:50% align:center
[YUITO, ARASHI grunt]

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN grunts]
Yuito! Kasane!

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center
[YUITO, KASANE gasp]

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
[GEMMA] Seems like
they'll stop at nothing

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
to collect your brains.

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:20.762 position:50% align:center
Hm? Huh?

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
[LUKA grunts]

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:25.725 position:50% align:center
[LUKA] I can teleport us!
Everyone over here!

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:27.060 position:50% align:center
Luka!

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center
Are you saying you'll
take us straight to BABE?

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.190 position:50% align:center
[SHIDEN]
That sounds risky!

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:33.692 position:50% align:center
[LUKA] I verified this
building's structure

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
the previous time we were here.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.028 position:50% align:center
Once we get close to BABE,

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:39.364 position:50% align:center
they'll be forced to
tone down their attacks.

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Yuito! Hurry!

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:44.869 position:50% align:center
[YUITO grunts]
On my way!

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Luka, time to move!

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:51.459 position:50% align:center
[LUKA]
Here goes nothing!

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:54.754 position:50% align:center
[KASANE]
Yuito!

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
[ARASHI gasps]

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
[KAGERO sighs]
Gotta say,

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised we made
it to BABE in one piece.

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
[HANABI, LUKA grunt]

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:20.488 position:50% align:center
[LUKA]
Guess my power worked.

00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.868 position:50% align:center
You can rest a bit
if you need to.

00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:29.622 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. I really appreciate
your concern, but we should go.

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:32.459 position:50% align:center
Hey. Haruka. Wataru!

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
Just like the last time,
we can't connect to Psynet.

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:36.463 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
And for some reason,
the shaking's way worse now!

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:45.722 position:50% align:center
It must be another reaction
from the Kunad Gate!

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:48.600 position:50% align:center
[KASANE, ARASHI gasp]

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:53.021 position:50% align:center
[YUITO, KASANE gasp]

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:54.939 position:50% align:center
There isn't much time.

00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:56.941 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Hm!

00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:58.026 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
One moment.

00:21:58.109 --> 00:21:59.027 position:50% align:center
[YUITO]
Huh?

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.320 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:04.366 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Please listen
to what I have to say.

00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:07.911 position:50% align:center
I know that voice.

00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:09.496 position:50% align:center
No way...

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:15.710 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I have something important

00:22:15.794 --> 00:22:18.046 position:50% align:center
that I need to tell you.

00:22:18.129 --> 00:22:19.506 position:50% align:center
--[KASANE] Mother!
--[YUITO] It's my mom!

00:22:19.589 --> 00:22:20.799 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:32.602 position:50% align:center
