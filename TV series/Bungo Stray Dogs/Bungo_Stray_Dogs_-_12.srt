Good morning.

Huh?

00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,750
[ATSUSHI] Why are
the two of us roommates?!

00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,833
We just don't have
any more space.

Seriously?

She was happy to do it.

[OSAMU]
You understand, Atsushi.

13
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,625
No, I don't.

14
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,625
Well, the poor girl
has no family.

15
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,583
She's all alone in the world.

16
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,583
The Port Mafia might
send assassins for her.

17
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,458
That's true.

18
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,875
You must protect her.

19
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,500
I understand.
I'll do my best!

20
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,958
[OSAMU chuckles]

21
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,416
[DOPPO] Instead of messing
with Atsushi, why don't you

22
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,166
write up your report about
being captured, Dazai?

23
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,291
[OSAMU]
Heh, heh, heh. Atsushi...

24
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,541
Yes?

25
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,791
[OSAMU] I want you to
write a report for me.

26
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,166
Huh?!

27
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,916
It's going to be
all about the person

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,625
who placed the bounty
on your head.

29
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,125
[ATSUSHI]
You know who that is?

30
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,708
[OSAMU] Going off the
Port Mafia's records,

31
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,208
it looks like it
was the leader of

32
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,375
an American organization of
the gifted called The Guild.

33
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,916
I thought that they were
just an urban legend.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,875
It's said their members
hold key positions in finance,

35
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:11,375
politics, and the military,
allowing them to utilize

36
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:15,041
their vast influence
for nefarious purposes.

37
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,541
What would a group like
that want with Atsushi?

How nice to finally meet you,

That's it!

49
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,333
Oh, we parked our chopper
on a nearby highway.

50
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,916
Was that all right?

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,750
What is it you wish to discuss?

52
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,500
You've journeyed across
the world to come here.

Speak your mind.

54
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,250
My, this is a rare specimen.

55
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,250
I don't recognize
this style of porcelain.

56
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,333
What is the brand of this set?

57
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,333
Royal Blanc?
Or perhaps El Zelga?

58
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,416
It's from the ceramics
store next door.

59

My apologies.

I insist.

62
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,041
I'm the leader of The Guild.

63
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,750
We're headquartered
in North America.

64
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,541
I personally own three
conglomerates, five hotels,

65
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,416
an airline, a university--

66

[FITZGERALD]
Hm?

68
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,541
[YUKICHI] I've received
reports that you issued

69
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:41,875
a bounty to encourage the
Port Mafia to attack us...

70
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,208
Are they true?

71
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,833
Yes, that was a big
mistake on my part.

72
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,791
To think such a
famed criminal group

73
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,083
would be so incompetent.

74
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,125
To make amends, I bring
you a business proposal.

75
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,250
You've got a nice
little company here

76
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,625
and it's in an attractive
neighborhood.

77
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,791
As such...

78
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,208
...I'd like to buy it from you.

79
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,125
Don't misunderstand.

80
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,291
I could buy every
piece of property

81
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,041
that you can see from here.

82
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,416
It's not the building
I'm interested in.

83
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,000
I want one thing...

84
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,166
And that is?

85
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,541
What do you think?

86
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,125
I want your Gifted
Business Permit.

87
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,333
[FITZGERALD] You see, for a
group of gifted individuals

88
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:27,000
to open a business, they need
permission from a special branch

89
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,291
of the Ministry
of Internal Affairs.

90
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:33,541
Those fools are about the only
ones you can't buy with money.

91
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:37,666
We are a secret society that
officially doesn't even exist.

92
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,750
There's something in
this city that we want.

93
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,708
We'd rather not rile the
Ministry while we look for it.

94
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,833
The permit will allow us to--

95
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:44,833
I refuse.

96
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,500
Come now, is this not enough?

97
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:51,208
Very well then...
I'll add this.

98
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,041
It's a limited edition model,

99
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,458
made to order
with pink diamonds.

100
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,250
[YUKICHI] I'm afraid there's no
amount of money you could offer

101
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,708
that would entice me
to give up our permit.

102
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,750
[FITZGERALD]
Hm?

103
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,833
It is a symbol of hope.

104
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:08,291
Not just for our members, but
also for that of Master Natsume,

105
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,250
without whom this agency
would not exist.

106
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,125
Our permit is not for sale
to the highest bidder.

107
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,625
It is not a plaything
for the idle rich.

108
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,250
So you believe there are
things money can't buy.

109
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,000
That's the boring
mantra of the poor.

110
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,708
If your employees "vanished,"
I make a bet your little Agency

111
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,666
would cease to function.

112
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,500
Any by then it would be
too late to change your mind.

113
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,125
I'll take that
into consideration.

114
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,791
We're done here.

115
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,041
For now...

131
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,000
[FITZGERALD]
First, there was one...

132
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,333
[DOPPO] Hey! Did you
hear what happened?!

133
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,375
Yeah, it's on the news.

134
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,500
[TV REPORTER]
As we reported earlier...

135
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:41,125
A seven-story building has
completely vanished overnight.

136
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,791
According to one
of our sources,

137
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,875
the building was used
to house a front company

138
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,625
for the notorious Port Mafia.
While details...

139
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,875
So this is the message...

140
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,291
No one's seen Kenji
since yesterday.

141
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,500
I'm really starting to
worry about him now.

142
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,416
So they'll get rid of anyone,

143
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,208
whether it's us
or the Port Mafia.

144
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,541
Huh...

145
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,125

you out there on your own.

146

Work with Atsushi to find Kenji.

147
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,500
Dazai, you'll be with me.
We'll consult the President.

148
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,083
We don't know what kind
of powers they have.

149
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,791
If you encounter them,
retreat immediately.

150
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,916
Right.

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,458
I seem to recall
someone promising

162
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,916
to do anything I asked.

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,125
Yeah, but that was
yesterday when you were--

164
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,583
--[JUNICHIROU yelps]
--[OUGAI] This isn't funny!

165
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,583
[JUNICHIROU]
Let's not talk about it.

166
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,791
[NAOMI chuckles]

167
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,083
[JUNICHIROU] I still think
that you should go back.

168
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,500
[NAOMI]
Oh, really?

169
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,541
Would it help if I
reminded you of how we...

170
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,041
--[ATSUSHI] Hm?
--[JUNICHIROU] Mm?

171
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,500
[JUNICHIROU]
Naomi?

172
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,250
No, It can't be...

173
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,750
[JUNICHIROU]
Naomi! Where are you?!

174
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,625
Where did she go?!

175
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,375
Is this how they attack?

176
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,625
But I... I didn't sense
that anything was off.

177
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,708
Naomi!

178
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,250
[ATSUSHI]
Wait! It's too dangerous!

179
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,666
Where could you be, Elise?

180
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,625
Oh, I'm in big trouble now...

181
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,833
Give her back to me!

182
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,250
[JUNICHIROU]
Found you!

183
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,833
[JUNICHIROU pants]

184
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,750
[JUNICHIROU yells]

185
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,708
[LUCY]
Let's play a game!

186
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,958
[JUNICHIROU, ATSUSHI gasp]

187
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,458
[OUGAI gasps]

188
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,541
[LUCY] I'd like to welcome
all of you to Anne's Chamber!

189
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,000
My goodness!

190
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,791
There's so many of you here,
I'm a little embarrassed.

191
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:44,083
I'm not very good
at public speaking.

192
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:48,041
But still, I have to explain
what's going on to everyone!

193
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,166
You're all probably
really confused

194
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,916
about how you even got here.

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,083
If it were me, I'm sure
my heart would be--

196
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,541
Where is Naomi?

197
00:09:56,625 --> 00:10:00,041
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Allow me to explain that first.

198
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,375
Your agents are
over in that room.

199
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,166
[JUNICHIROU]
Kenji... Naomi!

200
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,875
Damn! Naomi!

201
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,666
It won't open without a key.

202
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,666
Unlike that door...

203
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,541
[ATSUSHI]
They're all frozen.

204
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,500
Has time stopped?

205
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,458
[LUCY]
My name... is Lucy.

206
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,833
I created this world
with my ability.

207
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,708
But don't worry, you can
leave whenever you want

208
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,750
through that white door.

209
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,708
But unfortunately your
companions will be trapped here.

210
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,208
What is it that you want?

211
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,583
[LUCY]
That's easy.

212
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:39,041
I just want you to play
in this room with my friend.

213
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,250
Say "hello," Anne.

214
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,291
--[ATSUSHI shudders]
--[JUNICHIROU growls]

215
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,208
[LUCY]
Anne loves to play.

216
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,583
She's a bit needy,
but she's just so cute!

217
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:00,375
[CROWD screams]

218
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,166
I forgot to mention
about the door!

219
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,208
If you leave, then you'll forget
everything that's happened here!

220
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,541
Do you understand?

221
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,541
Oh, man... There's only
three of you left?

222
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,000
It's not safe here.
You need to run.

223
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,333
But the girl I'm looking
for might be here.

224
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,250
She's beautiful, just
like a little angel.

225
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,708
Have you seen her
anywhere, perhaps?

226
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,041
[ATSUSHI]
Sorry, I'm afraid I haven't.

227
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,666
[OUGAI]
I see...

228
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,583
Her name is Elise.

229
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,791
Ever since we've been separated,

230
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:36,250
I have no idea what
to do with myself.

231
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,708
She might be just
behind that door.

232
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:43,458
If she is, I'd never
forgive myself for running.

233
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,875
So I'm going to stand my ground.

234
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,125
I understand.

235
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,041
[LUCY]
The rules are simple.

236
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,375
Play a round of tag
with my dear Anne.

237
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,583
If she tags you,
then you lose the game.

238
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,791
But if you open the door using
that key before she catches you,

239
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,625
you win, and I'll
return the hostages.

240
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,708
Well then?
Who wants to give it a try?

241
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,666
Can two people play
at the same time?

242
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,958
[LUCY]
But of course!

243
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,958
It's much more fun if
we all play together.

244
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,291
[ATSUSHI] We'll win if we use
Junichirou's Light Snow ability

245
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,208
to project illusions.

246
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,666
Are the two of you ready?

247
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,666
Yeah.

248
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,541
Ready...

249
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,125
[LUCY]
Go!

250
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,208
[ATSUSHI]
She's fast!

251
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,833
[LUCY giggles]
Caught you.

252
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,750
One down!

253
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,666
Junichirou!

254
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,125
Aaahhh!

255
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,833
[LUCY]
We've made another friend!

256
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,916
Aren't you happy, Anne?

257
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,416
Huh? What's that?
You still want more?

258
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,375
All right, then...

259
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,500
[ATSUSHI gasps]

260
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,875
[LUCY]
Incredible! I wanna see more.

261
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,250
[ATSUSHI gasps]

262
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,791
[LUCY] You have such a
strong and useful ability...

263
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,583
You must have been highly valued
from the moment you were born.

264
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,000
I know that you're an orphan.

265
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,583
I grew up in an orphanage, too.

266
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,541
I still remember the cold.

267
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,958
After using freezing
rags to clean

268
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:31,291
for hours and hours on end,
my fingers would ache for days.

269
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,875
Everyone shunned me
'cause of my ability.

270
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,666
They all thought that
I was some kind of freak.

271
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,500
I heard that when
you were taken,

272
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,541
the Agency was
desperate to find you.

273
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,208
How wonderful.

274
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,750
It must've been because
of your great ability.

275
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,083
That's not--

276
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,541
[LUCY] That's the reason
why The Guild took me in.

277
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,875
[ATSUSHI sighs]

278
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,541
[LUCY] But there's no room
for error in The Guild.

279
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,625
If I fail in this mission,

280
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,750
I'll be tossed aside
like a used napkin.

281
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:02,583
Then I'll be all alone again.

282
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,916
Tell me...

283
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,250
Why are you special?
How come I'm not special?

284
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,166
It's not fair!

285
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,125
You should know how I feel
more than anybody else!

286
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,125
You deserve to
stay here forever!

287
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,416
[ATSUSHI grunts]

288
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,416
[ATSUSHI] I need to unlock
that door with this key.

289
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,291
[ATSUSHI]
I win!

290
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,541
Kid! Be careful!

291
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,000
Huh?!

292
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,208
Aah!

293
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,208
[LUCY] You shouldn't throw
away your chance at escape.

294
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,833
Weren't we supposed to
win if I used that key?!

295
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:43,000
[LUCY] That's right.
If you could open the door.

296
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,375
I don't know how to
use this key, either.

297
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,375
It's a complete mystery to me.

298
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:52,166
[ATSUSHI] So there was no way
to win in the first place.

299
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,791
[LUCY]
The real game starts now.

300
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,166
You're obviously
really good at tag...

301
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,208
...but I wonder just how
much longer you'll last?

302
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,583
[ATSUSHI]
There's nothing I can do.

303
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,583
I'm gonna be caught.

304
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,958
There's no way for me to
fight back. It's hopeless!

305
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,291
[ATSUSHI] My only hope is
that Dazai will show up!

306
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,500
[LUCY] You're gonna
leave your friends behind?!

307
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,625
[ATSUSHI] Even in this
impossible situation,

308
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,458
he'd think of something.

309
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,416
I can't do anything!

310
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,291
[OUGAI]
Don't do it, kid.

311
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,333
Face your enemy.

312
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,625
[ATSUSHI yelps]

313
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,416
I wouldn't advise
escaping in this situation.

314
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,333
Uh, assuming...

315
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,875
...you're willing
to trust the words

316
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,083
of a simple neighborhood
physician, of course.

317
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,208
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?

If we're to believe
that girl's words,

you'll forget everything once
you leave through that door.

320
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,500
You won't remember
the enemy's guile,

Let me teach you something.

Using game theory,
the optimal strategy is to

catching your opponent
by surprise.

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,041
Then you crush your enemy.

00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,500
And if I heard correctly,

those friends of yours
behind that door...

My life has been filled
