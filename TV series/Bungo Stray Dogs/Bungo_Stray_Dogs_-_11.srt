We made it back alive.

00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,916
[ATSUSHI]
Still...

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,666
I wonder if the Agency
can look past

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,000
the people Kyouka's murdered.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,125
[ATSUSHI] What'll I do
if she and the Agency

6
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,500
are hostile towards each other?

7
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,458
Good morning, everyone...

8
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,833
Now could you turn
around for me?

00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,000
[oohs and ahhs]

00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,083
[NAOMI]
So cuuuute!

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,583
What is going on here?

12
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,083
It's pretty amazing, right?

13
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,833
She looks so incredible
in just about anything!

14
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,916
That's... not what I meant...

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,166
Mr. Kunikida...

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,083
Don't blame this on me.
You wanted to save her.

17
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,833
Is this really all right?

18
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,916
Yeah, I'm not sure myself...

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,750
[ATSUSHI] Even if everyone
else is fine with it,

20
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,125
Rampo's a real stickler
for the rules.

21
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,625
Oh... don't worry about him.

22
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:05,958
I'm back!

23
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,250
Look what I brought!

24
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,500
[JUNICHIROU] Rampo's
actually into it the most.

25
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,333
[RAMPO] This is the snack that
changes color when you mix it.

26
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,000
Go ahead, try it!

[RAMPO]
First, open the bag, okay,

29
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,583
then put the two pouches of
powder in the container...

30
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,291
They're like children.
Young ones.

31
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,416
[RAMPO]
...mix really well.

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,000
You wanna put all
your heart into it.

33
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,333
Then, mix, mix, mix,
mix, mix, mix, mix...

34
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:29,458
And finally...
look what you get!

Children is right...

39
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,583
Guess that's par for
the course for Rampo.

40
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,291
So, do you happen
to know who asked her

41
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,708
to come visit the Agency?

42
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,125
[YUKICHI]
It was me.

43
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,666
[ATSUSHI]
President!

44
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,875
[YUKICHI]
What's our current status?

45
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,500
The Port Mafia
erased her identity,

46
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,791
so the police haven't
found her yet, sir.

47
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,958
I'm sure they'll label
her a fugitive soon enough.

48
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,666
Please let me stay here.

49
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,291
I'll do anything.

50
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,541
[DOPPO]
I don't recommend it.

51
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:11,916
Not because of your background,
or not having a job for you.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,916
It's for your own sake.
It's a difficult life.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,333
[ATSUSHI] Besides, if you stay
here, the Mafia will find you.

54
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,750
Shouldn't you run as
far away as you can?

55
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,458
Akutagawa...

56
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:26,375
He told me that the only thing I
was good for was killing people.

57
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:30,000
But he's wrong. I have
to prove that to myself.

58
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,083
[ATSUSHI]

00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,208
I'd like to vouch for her.

Avulsion of the frontal bone

rupture of the brachial

and first-degree burns
over the entire body.

To top it off,
he's in a coma.

73
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,250
That's the price he paid
for failing his mission.

[ICHIYOU]
I apologize.

consciousness again.

No way...

[OUGAI]
Don't feel too bad.

78
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,208
Yes, you did fail in attacking
the Agency and capturing

79
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:14,791
the weretiger, and you allowed
the transport ship to sink.

80
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,583
But you all did your best
in the end, did you not?

81
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,541
Effort is what's important.
Results come second.

82
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't you agree?

83

of the group

Apparently they're regrouping.

[ICHIYOU gasps]

88
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,000
[OUGAI] Listen to me...
The Mafia is a business

89
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,375
which employs violence
as its currency.

90
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,833
It's allowed to desire
and kill as it chooses.

91
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:45,958
Retaliation must be weighed

92
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,708
in terms of expenditure
and liability.

93
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,083
But sir, how can you say that?

94
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,250
Akutagawa has accomplished
so much for the Port Mafia.

95
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,250
[OUGAI]
Indeed, he is competent.

96

His level of violence is high,
even by our standards.

97

were truly suited for this job?

You gotta excuse Gin.
The boss has him doing

107
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,625
a whole lot of infiltrating
and assassinating.

108
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,125
He'll slice anybody's throat
now, even one of our own.

109
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,083
If he'd been serious,
you'd be dead.

Does the boss intend
to take me out?

Not today.

Are you here just to gloat?

re-evaluate my current situation

before an assassin
arrives at my doorstep.

You, along with Akutagawa,
are a strike force

under the boss's
direct supervision.

118
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:10,333
As such, you are
our superior.

119
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:14,625
But do not mistake our
position for obedience.

120
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:18,791
It is Akutagawa's power
that commands our respect.

[RYUUROU] Tell me...
During the time

122
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,041
Akutagawa will be
indisposed, do you possess

123
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,208
something that could
compel us to obey you?

A beacon visible from
anywhere in the city.

A powerful beacon for the one
who left without a word.

The one who left without
acknowledging my abilities.

You're gonna get
yourself killed!

of Karma Transit!

This attack on
Akutagawa was personal.

160
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,250
If we retaliate
as an organization,

161
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,750
we risk triggering more
conflicts on a larger scale.

162
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,791
The brass doesn't care
about private disputes.

163
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,125
They'll turn a blind eye
to all of this.

164
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,458
Akutagawa's already
been cut off.

165
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:55,541
Even so, what can you hope
to accomplish by yourself?

166
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,083
Maybe I can't do anything.

167
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,708
Still... I have to try!
I can't just wait!

168
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,000
[ICHIYOU]
I knew where I stood.

169
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,500
I knew I wasn't
suited for this job.

170
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,708
I knew I didn't have the
respect of my subordinates.

171
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,458
[RYUUROU] If I were you, I'd
re-evaluate my current situation

172
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:19,625
before an assassin
arrives at my doorstep.

173
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,250
[ICHIYOU] It's not easy
to leave the Port Mafia,

174
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:25,541
but not impossible.
I've thought about it often.

175
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,250
But each time, I could
never go through with it.

176
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,291
[ARMED GUARD]
Huh?

177
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,250

00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,541
[ICHIYOU pants]

182
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,166
[ICHIYOU]
Damn it...

183
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,791
I can't rescue
Akutagawa in this state.

184
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,416
[ICHIYOU yells]

185
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:28,916
[ICHIYOU grunts]

[gun cocks]

187
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:41,625
I could never walk away...
because the truth is...

188
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,541
[gunshot]

189

[ICHIYOU gasps]

190
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,458
Let's take 'em all out, guys!

191
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,541
You all came... but why?

192
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,708
[RYUUROU]
You're our superior officer.

193
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,875
It's our job to see you
protected from danger

194
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,708
at all costs.

195
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,458
Okay, looks like
we're done here.

196
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,291

00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,958
Akutagawa...

199
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,875
[ICHIYOU]
Please... wake up!

200
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,541
[AKUTAGAWA breathes weakly]

201
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:42,208
[AKUTAGAWA]
Is that you, Higuchi?

202
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,125
Take this, you're bleeding.

203
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,500
[AKUTAGAWA]
I'm sorry...

204
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,291
[ICHIYOU] It's not easy
to leave the Port Mafia...

205
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,083
but not impossible.

206
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,541
But I never went through
with it, because...

207
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,166
It's my job.

208
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,166
[DOPPO] I'm leaving you
to look after the girl.

209
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,791
What? Is that okay?

210
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,958
You were the one responsible
for saving her, after all.

211
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,708
[ATSUSHI]
Right...

212
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,666
[POLICE OFFICER]
Excuse me.

213
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,416
We're from the city police.

214
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,291
[KENJI]
Oh, welcome!

215
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,458
Back again? Didn't one of
your officers get arrested

216
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,000
last time, Minoura?

217
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,416
Hm, I'd rather not
dwell on that matter.

218
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,791
We have another case.

219
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,916
[KENJI] Aw. They didn't
even stay for tea

220
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,791
when they were done
with business.

221
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:50,041
I guess the city policemen
are too busy for that.

222
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,666
[DOPPO] What are police like
where you're from, Kenji?

223
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,166
We all know each other
in my village.

224
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,208
It's common to see our
policemen doing things

225
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:01,000
like fixing the pump to the
local well, rescuing cats,

226
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,000
or standing in line to taste
the first crop of watermelons.

227
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,041
[DOPPO]
Are you serious?

228
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,083
And what happens
to your lawbreakers?

229
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,375
They get hogtied
and tossed off a cliff.

230
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,208
Uhh, Mr. Miyazawa...

231
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,416
Just call me Kenji.

232
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,666
[ATSUSHI]
Mm?

233
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,875
I was living in a small
village called Ihatov,

234
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,666
where there's no electricity,
until about two months ago.

235
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,791
After the President
recruited me, I came here.

236
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:28,041
I'm having fun learning
all sorts of new things!

237
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,375
Learning new things...
Like what?

238
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, I don't really understand
the concept of money.

239
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,166
Is that really possible?

240
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,041
Mr. Kunikida, what
should we do about

241
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,791
that request from the police?

242
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,958
[DOPPO]
Mm?

243
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:46,333
"A car in motion exploded for
unknown reasons"... Huh...

244
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,541
They're completely
stumped by it.

245
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,083
[DOPPO]
You wanna give it a go?

246
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,500
[ATSUSHI]
Mm?

247
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,625
Shadow another agent.
Try to get the hang of things.

248
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,291
I know you can do this.

249
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,708
Thanks.

250
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,000
[CROWD MEMBER A]
What's going on?

251
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,583
[CROWD MEMBER B]
Do you see that?

252
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,750
[KENJI] A car was driving along
and somehow ended up there...

253
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,833
[ATSUSHI]
This is way over my head...

254
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,500
The unidentified driver
died on impact.

255
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,333
Unidentified? Can't we
use fingerprints or teeth

256
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,041
to figure out who they were?

257
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,791
Sure. If we had any.

258
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,291
[ATSUSHI]
What?!

259
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,750
You're saying that the body...
is completely sludge now?

260
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:26,958
Now then, I know Rampo could
solve this case right away...

261
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,916
but we're just gonna have
to gather information

262
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,666
the old-fashioned way...

263
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,916
[GRAN]
Kenji, dear!

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,833
[KENJI]
Hello, lil' miss Maeda!

265
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,000
Thank you for the boar
meat the other day.

266
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,833
It was scrumptious!

267
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,416
[KENJI]
It was nothing, really!

268
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,708
My folks sent me
a lot from home.

269
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,333
"Little" miss?

270
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,625
She'd be one of the younger
ladies in my village.

271
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,625
[GUY]
Hey, kid!

272
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,000
[BOTH]
Mm?

273
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,833
[GUY] You know the vegetable
garden I told you about?

274
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,833
It isn't draining very well.

275
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,875
It must be the soil in the rows.
I'll check it out later.

276
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,333
[GUY]
Great. Thanks a lot!

277
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,291
You're really popular.

00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,541
[MAN]
Hey, Kenny...

279
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,208
[ATSUSHI]
Hm?

280
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,458
You on a job?

281
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,000
We are, as a matter of fact!

282
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,541
We're investigating the
explosion that just happened.

283
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,916
Can you tell us
anything about it?

284
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,958
Oh... with the car, right?

285
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,375
You could say...
there's rumors...

286

287

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,083
[ATSUSHI yelps]

289
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,916
I'm really not supposed
to talk about it,

290
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,041
but from what I overheard,
right before it happened,

291
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,291
those backstreet folks
from the factory district

292
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,458
bought a load of fertilizer.

293
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,875
[KENJI]
Fertilizer...

294
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,208
So do you think they realized
the beauty of farming?

295
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,666
[MAN] No, they were talking
about manufacturing something...

296
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,291
Then it was probably
nitrogen fertilizer.

297
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,666
[ATSUSHI]
What's that?

298
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,250
An ingredient for explosives.

299
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,291
[ATSUSHI]
What?!

300
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,625
[KENJI]
Thank you as always.

301
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,208
You've been very helpful.

302
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,291
[MAN]
Anything for you, Kenny...

303
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,291
[ATSUSHI]
We already have a lead...

304
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,833
Kenji's amazing.

305
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,375
[KENJI]
I'll be counting on you.

306
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,208
Speaking of the
factory district,

307
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,375
there's a hangout spot for the
Gojo Youth Association there.

308
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,791
[ATSUSHI]
Who's that?

309
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,583
To put it in city terms...
they're a gang.

310
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,958
[ATSUSHI]
A... A gang?!

311
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,041
I wonder if they maybe
they could be the ones

312
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,958
who built the bomb.

313
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,750
How about we go there and ask
them about it face to face?

314
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,166
--[ATSUSHI] Wait a minute!
--[KENJI] Mm?

315
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,625
Even if they were responsible,
why would they admit it?

316
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,208
Especially to us?!

317
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,125
If we go and ask them nicely,
I'm sure they'll tell us.

318
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,458
That's how life is!

319
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,000
What? That's how life is?

320
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,708
Are you serious?

321
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,041
You are serious.

322
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,791
I guess you're right, Kenji!

323
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,708
[DOPPO]
Hey, Junichirou...

324
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,875
Weren't you with Atsushi today?

325
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,458
Oh, actually, Kenji was
the one who went with him.

326
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,375
[DOPPO]
What?! He's with Kenji?!

327
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,750
Yeah, they went to
the crime scene.

328
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,250
Kenji has solved a lot of
difficult cases in the past,

329
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,166
so I can't imagine that
there'll be any problems with--

330
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,916
[DOPPO]
It's a huge problem!

331
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,125
Kenji's methods are way too
bizarre for him to be copying!

332
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,875
Given how naïve Atsushi is,
he very well may

333
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,041
take Kenji's approach as
being the gold standard!

334
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,291
[DOPPO]
This isn't good...

335
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,041
Huh?!

336
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,500
Did any of you build the
bomb that made that big car

337
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,541
fly into that building?

338
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,291
You're a funny guy!
You cops or somethin'?

339
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,625
Actually, we're with the
Armed Detective Agency.

340
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:22,416
Oh, that's a real nice
chain you got there!

341
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,833
Do you always keep
one of them handy

342
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,875
in case you ever have
to haul cows around?

343
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:26,875
Why you!

344
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,291
Explain yourself, kid!

345
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,416
Oh, I just wanted
to ask if any of you

346
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,458
were responsible
for what happened.

347

[GANG MEMBERS laugh]

Can't say we know
anything about it.

00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:39,875
Right?

Thank you for taking the
time to talk to me about it.

[GANG MEMBERS]
Huh?

356
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,041
[ATSUSHI]
K-Kenji, wait up!

357
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,333
They were lying
about everything!

358
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,500
They probably used
the bomb to kill someone

359
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,166
in a rival gang or something!

360
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,041
There's no way they
weren't involved!

361
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,791
But they said they didn't
know anything about it.

362
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,375
[ATSUSHI]
Well, yeah, but...

363
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,833
Whether it's cow or man...
in a village or city...

364
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:12,416
if you are honest,
others will reply in kind.

365
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,250
It works. That principle
has never failed me yet.

366
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,458
Is... Is that true?

Yes.

[ATSUSHI]
Hmm...

369
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,083
I guess I can see that.

370
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,583
Why don't we head back for now?

371
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,125
Good idea.

00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,541
[stomach rumbling]

373
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,166
Can we stop by at a beef bowl
place? I'm really starving.

374
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,541
Hang on... you eat beef
even though you keep cows?

375
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,125
Of course! I love absolutely
everything about them,

376
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,208
including how they taste!

377
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,125
[GANG MEMBER B]
I gotta say, I'm surprised

378
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,500
you private eyes figured
out we used a bomb

379
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,625
to kill a rival gang member.

380
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,166
We barely had a chance
to chat back there.

381
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,208
You wanna tell us what kind of
evidence you got against us?

382
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,291
[GANG MEMBER C] Don't think
that we'll just let you

383
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,125
run to the cops.

384
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,208
This is wonderful! I just knew
that you would all come clean

385
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,875
and tell us the entire
story eventually.

386
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,125
[GANG MEMBERS]
Huh?

387
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,041
I knew that my honesty
would be repaid in kind.

388
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,250
In all of the cases
that I've worked on,

389
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,208
everyone ends up
confessing to me like this!

Oh, don't worry about me.
This happens sometimes.

403
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,833
Out in the countryside,
cows can get in a temper

Kenji possesses
superhuman strength,

but he isn't totally invincible.
