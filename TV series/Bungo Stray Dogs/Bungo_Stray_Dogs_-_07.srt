00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,125
[DOPPO] A mysterious
criminal group is threatening

2
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,916
to detonate a bomb
somewhere in the city.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,291
Not only that,

4
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,833
they've launched a smear
campaign against our agency.

5
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,666
Sounds like we're caught
between a rock and a hard place.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,083
Do you have any
helpful information

7
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,500
on where the bomb might be?

8
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:26,375
Not much.

9
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:27,583
Right now all we have to go on

10
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,625
is the message left
by the perpetrator.

11
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:30,958
Here it is...

12
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,750
"Greetings, I hope that
the Armed Detective Agency

13
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,625
and its members
are faring well.

14
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,250
Forgive my impudence,
but I have placed a bomb

15
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,916
capable of causing
mass destruction

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,458
in a certain location
here in Yokohama.

17
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,625
Since you claim to be

18
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,166
an agency aimed
at securing public safety,

19
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,791
I request you locate and disarm
the bomb as soon as you can.

20
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,666
You only have until sundown.

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,250
I wish you the best of luck.

22
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,583
I have full faith
in your abilities.

23
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,000
Respectfully,
the Azure Messenger."

24
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,208
[YUKICHI]
A strange signature.

25
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:00,875
Who is the Azure Messenger?

26
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,500
[DOPPO]
We don't know, yet.

27
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,166
This bomb could ruin us.

28
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,083
It's rigged specifically
to make our team look bad.

29
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,958
He's setting us up so that
if we fail his challenge,

30
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,708
everyone will hold
us responsible

31
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,750
for the damages instead of them.

32
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:17,083
Our failure to stop the attack
would spread like wild fire.

33
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,500
The bomb could be anywhere.

34
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:21,458
The office staff has been
scouring the city for it.

35
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,541
But there are too
many possibilities.

36
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,541
[KENJI]
Hey...

37
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:25,875
I bet Rampo could help.

38
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,625
Have we had any luck
getting in touch with him?

39
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:30,416
It seems he's still busy
with the case in Kyushu.

40
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,791
I've asked him to contact
us as soon as possible,

41
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,625
but we need leads right now.

42
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,166
Did you get any information
from that taxi driver?

43
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,250
Unfortunately, no.

44
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,500
He denies any
knowledge of the bomb.

45
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,000
I believe him.

46
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,708
I don't think he's the type
to try to blow up Yokohama.

47
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,416
Okay then, listen up!

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,916
This is a cowardly act.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,625
Someone's endangering lives just

50
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,666
to bring down the
Armed Detective Agency.

51
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,041
We have two objectives:

52
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,958
uncover the Azure Messenger,
whoever this person is,

53
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,000
and disarm the bomb they've set.

54
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,208
The bomb takes priority
because of its deadly potential.

55
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,958
If we can't find the bomb, it
will destroy innocent lives...

56
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,500
...as well as the hard-earned
reputation of our agency.

57
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,083
[DOPPO]
Hmm...

58
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,416
Everything is at stake
for us on this case.

59
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,791
It's a full test of our skills
as a detective agency.

60
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:21,791
[phone ringing]

61
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,416
[TAGUCHI] Do you have any idea
what time it is, four-eyes?

62
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,458
[DOPPO] You're the only one
who's still sleeping at 11:30.

63
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,916
Can you find the one
who sent us that message?

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,291
The Azure Messenger?

65
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,041
Maybe I can, but
before we switch gears,

66
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,791
isn't there something else
you want to ask me about?

67
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,791
[DOPPO]
So you already know everything.

68
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,791
Come on. I only know
what I actually know.

69
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,250
[DOPPO] I want you to trace
the bomb-building equipment.

70
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,208
I'll send you
the shipping manifest.

71
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,083
A bomb? Wow, things are
really looking up for you guys.

72
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,958
[DOPPO] Cut the bad jokes and
small talk, and get cracking.

73
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,000
Hey!

74
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,416
[DOPPO]
Innocent lives are at stake!

75
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,416
I know you like to spend
all your time hacking

76
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,291
and breaking laws, but you
should make yourself useful

77
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,958
to society sometimes.

78
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,583
[TAGUCHI] Why don't you
get off your high horse.

79
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,583
Remember, you're not my dad.

80
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,833
[phone click]

81
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,083
[DOPPO]
No, I can't replace your father.

82
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,333
[SASAKI] Are you sure
you have time for this?

83
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:21,041
The Agency seems so busy dealing
with the new bomb threat.

84
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,541
Especially Kunikida.

85
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,083
He seems so anxious.

86
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,208
You've got that right.

87
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,666
Kunikida is an insane workhorse.

88
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,250
Get this...

89
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,791
He spends two hours reviewing
his notes before going to bed.

90
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,541
I couldn't stand doing
that for two minutes.

91
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,125
Maybe he's got some solider ants
working for him in his brain--

92
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,416
[OSAMU] Oh, I didn't know
you were here, Kunikida.

93
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,666
How could you ditch a
meeting during an emergency?

94
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,666
I guess you thought it was more
important to go on a fancy date.

95
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,541
Are you jealous of
my "fancy" date?

96
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,875
Uh, no, I'm not!

97
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,333
[ATSUSHI]
Yes, he is.

98
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,000
Ever since we rescued Sasaki,

99
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,208
I've been hosting
her at my place...

100
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,083
She still needs help
to ensure her safety

101
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,416
and healthy mental state.

102
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,791
That's our job, too.

103
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,250
I'm just doing the noble
thing for our new friend.

104
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,875
You are too irresponsible and
lazy for such an important task.

105
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,500
Don't be ridiculous.

106
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,833
Besides, an attractive
woman like her

107
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,208
probably has a nice
boyfriend for support.

108
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,000
Nice try, but
I know she's single.

109
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,125
She broke up with her boyfriend.

110
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,916
That's right, Kunikida...

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,708
Now's your chance!

112
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,041
Listen, Dazai!

113
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,833
I'm here for one reason:

114
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,375
To fill you in on
what's going on

115
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,250
because you skipped the
emergency meeting this morning.

116
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,791
Yeah, well, I already
know what's happening.

117
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:30,375
The Azure Messenger planted this
bomb with a specific goal...

118
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,083
...to crush our Agency.

119
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,708
[SASAKI]
Um...

120
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,416
Should I be hearing all this?

121
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,833
It sounds like you're discussing
highly sensitive information.

122
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,083
She's right!

123
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,416
[OSAMU] Unfortunately,
the attempt on your life

124
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,833
makes you part of this case.

125
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:43,791
[ATSUSHI]
Really?

126
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,166
You can help!

127
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,208
Remind me, what class do
you teach at the university?

128
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,916
[SASAKI]
Social psychology.

129
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,250
Ah, that's great.

130
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,083
We're having trouble
cracking this case.

131
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,083
I'd love to hear
your expert analysis.

132
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:54,958
[SASAKI]
Hmmm...

133
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,458
About the Azure Messenger,

134
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,875
it may have something
to do with the Azure King.

135
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,583
Remember the Azure
Flag Terrorist incident?

136
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,375
It could be connected
to the situation

137
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,708
you're dealing with now.

138
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,541
I was thinking the same thing.

139
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:10,041
I know it's a stretch, but it
could be the Azure King himself.

140
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,458
We think he blew himself up

141
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,500
after being cornered
by the police.

142
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,625
But it's possible
he faked his death,

143
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,875
and he still wants revenge.

144
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,041
[AZURE KING]
This world is incomplete.

145
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,541
One may grieve or pray,
but people still die and

146
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,500
evil goes unpunished, allowed
to flourish freely everywhere.

147
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,958
Did you know he was a
former government official?

148
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,541
He set off a bomb in a public
facility and issued a manifesto.

149
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,916
He was targeting killers

150
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,541
whose cases had to be
dropped on technicalities.

151
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,583
And legislators who
enriched themselves

152
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,541
through corruption
on a global scale...

153
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,583
He hated criminals
who evaded justice.

154
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,291
[AZURE KING] I desire the
ideal world for humanity.

155
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,125
It will be built not by
the divine hand of God

156
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:54,083
but by the work of
our own bloodied hands...

157
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,833
[DOPPO]
Hmm...

158
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,375
[ATSUSHI] But if the
Azure King is actually alive,

159
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,000
why would he attack the Agency

160
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,500
when we're on
the side of the law?

161
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,750
I couldn't tell you.

162
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,333
[OSAMU] Did you know
the guy responsible

163
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,250
for backing the Azure King
into a corner was Kunikida?

164
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,750
He located his hideout.

165
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:12,833
Maybe... Kunikida is the
target of angry vengeance.

166
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,000
No, the Azure King is long gone.

167
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,250
Military police confirmed his
death with forensic testing.

168
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,666
There's no doubt.

169
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,833
[OSAMU] Just in case,
you should stay on your guard

170
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,416
until we figure out who
the Azure Messenger is.

171
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,750
And we'll keep hiding
Sasaki at my place.

172
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,541
[DOPPO]
All right, that's enough, Dazai!

173
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,500
What did I say?

174
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,875
You really think
we're dumb enough

175
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,250
to just let you keep a
beautiful lady in your room

176
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,625
and use her personal
safety as an excuse?

177
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:37,875
[OSAMU]
Would you calm down?

178
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,458
Nothing like what you're
imagining is happening.

179
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,833
When I first let her stay,

180
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,041
I slept in a different room
and didn't try anything.

181
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,541
You can ask her,
I was a true gentleman.

182
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,666
But I knew you'd
have torrid fantasies

183
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,333
about what you
thought we were doing,

184
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,833
and that's funny to me
so I didn't correct you.

185
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,875
Can someone please explain to me
how these two guys are partners?

186
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,625
[screams]

187
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,583
I'm no expert but Kunikida seems
to have a crush on you, Sasaki.

188
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,125
Can I ask you--what's
your ideal type of man?

189
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,583
"Ideal type of man"?

190
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,708
Looking for an ideal
type of person is foolish.

191
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,000
But I like a man who has
strong moral principles.

192
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,708
Someone... who pours
his heart and soul

193
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,583
into the things
he knows are true.

194
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,041
No matter what
stands in his way.

195
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,333
Hey, what a coincidence.

196
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,958
That's totally Kunikida.

197
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,083
My work is done.

198
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,416
The two of you
can take it from here.

199
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,625
Shush, Dazai!

200
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,625
Don't assume
you know anything!

201
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,083
Oh, don't be silly, partner.
You're an open book.

202
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:32,875
[DOPPO]
Geh!!

203
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,000
That's true.

204
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,291
I'll admit, he's a
pretty intense guy,

205
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,125
but he is definitely
a person who lives

206
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,958
and breathes for his ideals.

207
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,291
Hey, would you like to see

208
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,250
what he imagines his ideal
woman should be like?

209
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,833
It's a fun read.

210
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:46,666
[SASAKI]
Oh...

211
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,208
Hey! Not again, you bastard!

212
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,000
When did you get that? Arghh...

213
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,750
Give it back!

214
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,333
Wow, Kunikida.

215
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,541
Yes?

216
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,125
Too much information.

217
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,041
[DOPPO sighs]

218
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,958
Poor Kunikida is crushed.

219
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:00,750
[phone beeping]

220
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,250
[ATSUSHI]
Hmm? Uh...

221
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,916
Rampo's ready to help us.
Time to go.

222
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:21,833
Clock's ticking.

223
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,333
Do we know where the bomb is?

224
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,458
[RAMPO sighs] You know,
I was looking forward

225
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,791
to sightseeing in Kyushu
after I solved my case.

226
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,833
You all disappoint me. Haha.

227
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,583
You can't conduct a single
investigation without me.

228
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,416
We only have until sundown.

229
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,083
Please tell us the location.

230
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,541
[ATSUSHI]
A department store?

231
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,500
A school?

232
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,083
A train station?

233
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,166
Any one of these could produce
casualties in the hundreds.

234
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,833
We need to know
where that bomb is!

235
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,041
[RAMPO]
The fishing tackle store.

236
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,458
Huh?

237
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,458
[RAMPO] The bomb is in a
fishing tackle store in Negishi.

238
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,291
Sure that makes sense.

239
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,166
[ATSUSHI, DOPPO, SASAKI]
Hmm?

240
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,666
Thanks. You're amazing, Rampo.

241
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,750
Why does he think the bomb
is at a fishing tackle store?

242
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,666
Where's a map?

243
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,666
Behind the driver's seat.

244
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,166
Look on page 97.

245
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,000
[ATSUSHI]
Ninety-seven...

246
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,500
Okay, looking... looking...

247
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,083
Got it.

248
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,500
[OSAMU] The terrorist's target
is the petrochemical complex.

249
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,916
[DOPPO]
Of course!

250
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,666
I don't know why
I didn't think of that.

251
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,291
Yokohama is known for being
one of Japan's major port towns.

252
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,375
Next to the shipping docks
on the waterfront

253
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,833
there are many large facilities
that store oil and gas.

254
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,041
If an explosion were
to occur close enough

255
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,708
to ignite the storage tanks,

256
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:33,750
the entire port would
be engulfed in flames.

257
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:37,291
However, infiltrating a fuel
storage facility would be hard.

258
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,166
They're all protected by
extremely tight security.

259
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,833
But there could
be one other way...

260
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,750
A terrorist could put a bomb
in a car and leave the vehicle

261
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,875
near one of the
storage tanks when it's full.

262
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:47,958
Considering the effective range

263
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,166
of a bomb that
can be put into a car,

264
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,583
that fishing tackle
store's parking lot

265
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,208
is the perfect place
to leave the explosive.

266
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,083
[OSAMU]
Hmph.

267
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,833
Bingo.

268
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,750
The military's bomb squad
has found the device,

269
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,333
but there's still a problem.

270
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,666
It's connected to a
motion-sensing timer.

271
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,208
They don't think they'll be able
to disarm it before sundown.

272
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,458
They've started evacuating
nearby residents,

273
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,541
but they're not sure
there's enough time.

274
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,416
Oh, no...

275
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,458
[OSAMU]
There's still hope.

276
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,458
They said we can
deactivate the bomb

277
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,083
if we can transmit
a remote stop signal to it.

278
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,875
But how do we do that?

[ATSUSHI]
All right.

--[ATSUSHI] Okay.

No, that's helpful.

304
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,791
[ATSUSHI]
I'll tell the others.

305
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,666
[OSAMU]
I understand, President.

306
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,208
I got a call from Rokuzou...

307
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,500
Someone recently ordered
a bomb transmitter,

308
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,625
plus other equipment, delivered
to a former defense facility.

309
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,666
Rampo reached
a similar conclusion.

310
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,875
That settles it...

311
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,333
And I just got a call
from the president.

312
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,666
He was informed by the
military the taxi driver's dead.

313
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,583
He's dead?

314
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,916
How can that be?

315
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,166
I thought they were holding him

316
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,125
in their isolation ward
for extra protection.

317

but he died after suddenly

00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,041
What the heck are
you talking about?

481
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,958
So this showdown
hasn't started yet?

482
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,458
[OSAMU] Sneaky.
You took a peek at my email

483
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,166
by hacking into
my account, didn't you?

484
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,750
[DOPPO]
Are you the one responsible?

485
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,333
[TAGUCHI]
No, I just wanted to take a look

486
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,958
at the person who actually is.

487
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,458
[DOPPO]
But it's really not you?!

488
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,208
Tell me the truth!

489
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,083
Look out!

490
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,791
[OSAMU] So... you're
the Azure Messenger...

491
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,083
[DOPPO]
Unbelievable.

492
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,125
[OSAMU] I doubt this
is the first time you used

493
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:15,166
your deep knowledge of
psychology to execute a crime.

494
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,041
[SASAKI] The Azure King was
a man who lived for his ideals.

495
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,625
He wanted to destroy
the criminal word.

496
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,958
His intentions were pure,

497
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,458
and he was willing to
get blood on his hands.

498
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,291
I just wanted
to fulfill his vision,

499
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,250
make his ideals come true.

500
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,125
[OSAMU] You were deeply
in love with the Azure King...

501
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,458
I'll grant you,

502
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,375
he was an idealist
determined to punish criminals

503
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,291
who managed
to get around the law.

504
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,000
But he used
illegal means to do it.

505
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,250
Put down your gun!

506
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,083
You've caused
enough harm already.

507
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,833
[SASAKI]
Don't you understand?

508
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:44,708
Huh?

509
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:45,958
It's strange.

510
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,916
You stopped him but yet
you remind me of him...

511
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,041
You developed a very
sophisticated plan for revenge.

512
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,750
Without committing
a single crime,

513
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,958
you set up the Agency to take
the fall, and you destroyed both

514
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,333
the kidnapper and the criminal
organization behind him.

515
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,000
But you have no
convictions of your own.

516
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,250
You're just being swept along
by someone else's ideals.

517
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:09,375
[SASAKI sighs]
I'm just tired now.

518
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,125
I want to be
released from all this.

519
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,750
[SASAKI]
Will you shoot me?

520
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,583
Please Dazai?

521
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,666
I suppose you can't
because I lowered my gun.

522
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,208
If you shot me now,
it would be a crime.

523
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,166
An excessive use of force.

524
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,000
And Kunikida would be a witness.

525
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,708
True.

526
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,791
But I'm not going to shoot you.

527
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,333
However...

528
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,000

[gasps]

530
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,625
I'm here because the
Azure King killed my dad.

531
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,750
Good riddance to his follower.

532
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,833
But why?

533
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,000
Why did it have
to end this way?!

534
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,166
What went wrong?!

535
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,250
Someone was wrong!

536
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,708
[OSAMU]
No one was wrong.

537
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,416
This was the only
possible outcome.

538
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,333
Shut up!

539
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,416
You're lying to yourself!

540
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,750
You could've saved her!

541
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,208
Are you really telling me
that this is justice?!

542
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,166
To me, justice is a weapon.

543
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,708
It causes people harm
but can't protect them.

544
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,250
If it's the justice
used by the Azure King,

545
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,208
a sense of justice
without law...

546
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,625
...that justice killed Sasaki.

547
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,750
The same justice you believe in.

[OSAMU]
Kunikida...

550
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,541
As long as you pursue
these ideals of yours,

551
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,125
the angry flames that burned

552
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,458
in the Azure King
will take root in you...

553
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,375
They'll destroy
everything around you.

554
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,541
[DOPPO]
You're wrong!

555
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,125
I will push right
past those flames.

556
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,916
Don't underestimate my ideals!

557
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,666
[AKIKO] Atsushi, are
you sure you're not hurt?

558
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,500
[ATSUSHI]
No, I'm feeling really good.

559
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:22,791
But thank you anyway.

560
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,958
[AKIKO]
Oh, that's so boring.

561
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,625
[ATSUSHI] Um, about your
"treatment," Dr. Yosano.

562
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,041
How does it work, exactly?

563
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,000
[AKIKO]
Why don't you ask Tanizaki?

564
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,625
He's received my treatment
a couple of times already.

565
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,750
[ATSUSHI] I have asked him,
but he just shakes with fear.

566
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,750
He won't say anything about it.
