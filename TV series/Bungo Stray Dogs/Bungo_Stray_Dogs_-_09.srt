[KYOUKA]
My name is Kyouka.

2
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:14,375
I've killed 35 people
in six months.

3
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,250
[KYOUKA]
My name is Kyouka Izumi.

4
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,791
I've killed 35 people.

5
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,041
I don't wanna kill
anybody else ever again!

6
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,375
Not ever!

7
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,583
[DOPPO] Still attracting
trouble, are you?

8
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,000
Huh?

9
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,958
That girl is a lost cause.

10
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,166
It seems that her roots
as a heartless assassin

11
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,291
run much deeper than you know.

12
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,833
She's taken out
entire organizations,

13
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,916
using her appearance
to trick her targets

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,250
into lowering their guard.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,458
She accomplished
too much, too quickly.

16
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,583
It was only a matter of
time before she was caught.

17
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:14,583
[ATSUSHI] Yeah, but whoever
was taking advantage

18
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,916
of her ability
is the one to blame!

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,083
[DOPPO] These gifts don't
necessarily bring happiness

20
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,875
to their wielders.

21
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,916
You should know
that better than most.

22
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,875
She's awake now.

23
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,791
Do you think we
can question her?

24
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,375
[AKIKO] Yeah, that
shouldn't be a problem.

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,166
[ATSUSHI]
Are you okay?

26
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,541
Oh, uh... you're in the
infirmary at the Agency.

27
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,000
How're ya feeling?

28
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,708
You remember
who I am, don't you?

29
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,125
Tell me.

30
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,666
Who's behind all this?

31
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,625
The Port Mafia is like a snake.

32
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:28,041
Unless you cut off its head,
it'll just keep coming.

33
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,125
Answer me, girl.

34
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,916
Who is your superior?

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,500
Hey, Mr. Kunikida...

36
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,666
[KYOUKA]
Tachibanadou's boiled tofu.

37
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,541
Huh? Tofu?

38
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,583
It's good.

39
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,083
Is that it?

40
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,750
You want us to get you some?

41
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,250
I'll talk if you do.

42
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,500
No problem!

43
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,708
It's a deal. Let's go!

44
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,458
Hey! Are you crazy?!

45
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,083
Huh?

46
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,166
[KYOUKA]
Mmm. Mmm...

47
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,000
More please.

48
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,625
Kunikida!

49
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,291
I'm not helping you pay.

50
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,250
Aww...

51
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,375
Now then, is there anything
that I can bring you, sir?

52
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,291
Just water...

53
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,750
[DOPPO]
Well?

54
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,625
I was left without a home
after my parents passed away

55
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,291
Then the Port Mafia took me in.

56
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,875
They wanted my special
ability, Demon Snow.

57
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:38,250
It only follows orders that
are heard through a phone.

58
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,166
[DOPPO] This is the
one they used, correct?

59
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,000
[DOPPO]
The battery's been taken out.

60
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,458
Their goal from the start was
to turn you into an assassin.

61
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,666
They were clearly very good

62
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,125
at using your ability
to their advantage.

63
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,375
Hang on, I don't understand...

64
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,333
Why didn't you toss the phone?

65
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,750
[KYOUKA]
They would've killed me.

66
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,250
Besides...

67
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,541
Even if I got away from them,
I had nowhere else to go.

68
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,958
Who was manipulating
Demon Snow through the phone?

69
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,250
A man called Akutagawa.

70
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,625
[DOPPO]
I see.

71
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,708
[DOPPO] I'll go report
this to the Agency.

72
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,375
And you...

73
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,041
Turn her over to
the military police.

74
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,750
[ATSUSHI]
But if I do that won't she be...

75
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,583
[DOPPO]
Yes, with a kill count of 35,

76
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,166
she'll be put to death.

77
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,125
Even if she went back,
she'd be killed as a traitor.

78
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,250
But still...!

79
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,041
What then?

80
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,375
Will you try to save her?

81
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,958
Uh...

82
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,458
[DOPPO]
A fugitive from justice,

83
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,041
and a traitor to
the Port Mafia...

84
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,500
...that's the kind of
person you'd be protecting.

85
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,666
Is that really what you want?

86
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, I mean...

87
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,541
[DOPPO]
Listen...

88
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:58,541
I'm not saying you shouldn't
sympathize with her situation.

89
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:02,416
But her misfortune may
be more than you can handle.

90
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,041
You only have room
for one on your boat.

91
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,458
If you're overwhelmed,
you will be pulled under,

92
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,375
and you'll both sink.

If that's all true...

00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,916
Why...?

Why did Dazai even
bother to help me?!

Your sins are grave.

After abandoning your mission
and vanishing into thin air,

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,500
you now reappear as an
enemy to the Port Mafia.

112
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,416
It's quite hard to believe,
coming from a former exec.

113
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,625
You mean coming from someone
who was your superior...

completely invincible.

As long as I don't use my
ability, you're vulnerable.

I could hurt you...

I could kill you anytime.

[OSAMU]
That so?

Just look at you now.

123
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:45,500
You were so difficult to train
when you first started out.

124

You were such a slow learner,

and you could
never follow directions.

126

Then there's that
useless ability of yours...

In that time,

we will obliterate the Agency
and capture the weretiger.

130

Once you learn of

00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,416
Like a date?

164
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,458
[ATSUSHI]
Mm-hmm!

165
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,583
A date with you?

166
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,083
[ATSUSHI]
Mm-hmm!

167
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,875
[ATSUSHI]
Hmm?

168
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,333
Oh! No! Uh!
I-I didn't mean it like that!

169
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,291
[KYOUKA]
Let's go.

170
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,416
[ATSUSHI]
Oh...

171
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,333
[ATSUSHI]
Okay.

172
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,000
[ATSUSHI]
Whoa!

173
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,541
That's a giant baseball arena!

174
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,208
[KYOUKA]
It's Yokohama Stadium.

175
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,125
[ATSUSHI]
Oh, really?

176
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,250
[KYOUKA]
I've seen it on a map.

177
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,333
[KYOUKA] This is
Yokohama's memorial hall.

178
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,750
[ATSUSHI]
Ohh...

179
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,333
[KYOUKA]
The Museum of Cultural History.

180
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,416
[ATSUSHI]
Wow.

181
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,541
[KYOUKA]
Yokohama Customs Headquarters.

182
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,708
[ATSUSHI]
Ahhh...

183
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,708
You're amazing!

184
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,875
[KYOUKA]
I just have the map

185
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,958
and building structures
memorized is all.

186
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,500
[ATSUSHI]
Oh! I know this one!

187
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,625
The Red Brick Warehouse, right?

188
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,791
[GIRL 1]
This place has the best crepes!

189
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,291
[GIRL 2]
Oo! Let me have a bite!

190
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,541
Mmm! That's delicious!

191
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,541
[GIRL 1]
Right?! Seriously!

192
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,625
That place is pretty popular.

193
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,125
I think I heard from Naomi

194
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,625
that they make really
good crepes there.

195
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,833
It wasn't on the map...

196
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,666
[ATSUSHI]
Mm?

197
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,791
[KYOUKA]
I wanna try it...

198
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,083
[ATSUSHI]
Really?!

199
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,833
But... you ate so much
boiled tofu earlier...

200
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,500
Crepes sound good.

201
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,500
Ohhh...

202
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,375
I finally got the
plushie that I wanted...

203
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,958
[ATSUSHI sighs]

204
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,833
[KYOUKA] There's just one
more place I need to go to.

205
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,125
All right.

206
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,666
[ATSUSHI]
She's really being proactive.

207
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,291
[KYOUKA]
We're here.

208
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,666
Huh?

209
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,125
[KYOUKA] Today's been
more than enough fun.

210
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,125
It really should've
ended with the boiled tofu.

211
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,458
[ATSUSHI] But, if you turn
yourself in, you'll...

212
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,125
[KYOUKA]
...be sentenced to death.

213
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,375
Thirty-five people have
died because of me.

214
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,500
It's a sin that I'm still alive.

215
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:25,500
Besides, even if I returned to
the Port Mafia, I'd be executed.

216
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,083
[AKUTAGAWA]
Executed?

217
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,000
[coughs]

218
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,250
[AKUTAGAWA]
We wouldn't execute you...

219
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,166
Not after fulfilling
your mission.

220
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,333
[COP 1]
Hey! What's going on?

221
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:53,166
[AKUTAGAWA] "I finally got
the plushie that I wanted"...

222
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,541
A transmitter is implanted
inside your body.

223
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:01,166
Your whereabouts and every
action you make are known to us.

224
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,625
Huh?!

225
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,250
[AKUTAGAWA]
Let's go home.

226
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,250
[ATSUSHI]
Where am I?

227
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,041
[JUNICHIROU]
Atsushi has been abducted!

228
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,833
Abducted?

229
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,708
Well, that's terrible timing.

230
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,166
I guess.

231
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,333
[DOPPO] That ministry escort
job already has the Agency

232
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,833
in an uproar.

233
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,833
We don't have enough hands
on deck to go looking for him.

234
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,083
Do we have any information
on what happened?

235
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,666
Oh... we do.

236
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,958
Based on eyewitness reports, he
was attacked in broad daylight

237
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,416
and shoved into a truck.

238
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,875
Destination unknown.

239
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,791
[DOPPO]
That's not good.

240
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,666
There are numerous
dedicated smuggling routes.

241
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,083
Moving a single person in
secret would be child's play.

242
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,250
[JUNICHIROU] We have to
do something to help him...

243
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,500
[RAMPO]
Do we really?

244
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,250
Why's that?

245
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,125
Huh?

246
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,666
He was captured because of the
bounty on him as a weretiger.

247
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,291
Sounds like a
personal matter to me.

248
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,791
We're not exactly
his foster family,

249
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,000
and it's not like he joined the
Agency to gain our protection.

250
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,916
Maybe not, but Atsushi
is one of our own now.

251
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,208
Actually, Rampo
is right about this.

252
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,416
We shouldn't be the
ones to take action.

253
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,375
[JUNICHIROU]
But Mr. Kunikida...

254
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,500
I guess we should
inform the police then?

255
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,625
[DOPPO] They've designated
Atsushi as a major threat.

256
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,291
If they knew he worked here,
we would certainly take a hit.

257
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,166
[NAOMI]
'Scuse me...

258
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,500
You guys clearly don't
seem to be capable of coming

259
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,750
to an agreement by yourselves.

260
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,791
So instead of going on with the
"ifs," "ands," or "buts"...

261
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:54,666
...I just went and
asked <i>him</i> for help.

262
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,083
President!

263
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,291
[DOPPO]
Please forgive me.

264
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,708
As soon as our work is done,

265
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,458
I'll gather whatever
information--

266
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,083
Our plans have changed.

267
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,833
Listen up, all of you!

268
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,250
Our newest member
has been abducted.

269
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,750
The current project
will be suspended

270
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,208
until he has been returned
to us safe and sound.

271
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,125
Suspended?

272
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,916
What shall we do about
the escort job, sir?

273
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I will contact the client.

274
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,333
Not to worry...

275
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,583
They owe me enough favors

276
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,666
that we can afford to
hold off on it for now.

277
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,000
[RAMPO]
Sir... are you sure about this?

278
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,833
[YUKICHI]
What's your concern?

279
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,250
Well, just consider
the reasoning behind it...

280
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,791
[YUKICHI]
One of our own is in danger.

281
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,166
He needs help.

282
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,416
Are you telling me
that there can be

283
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,541
any better reasoning than that?

284
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,125
[RAMPO]
Hmm...

285
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,208
Kunikida.

286
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,291
[DOPPO]
Sir.

287
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,791
[YUKICHI]
You have three hours.

288
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,333
[DOPPO]
Understood!

289
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:54,541
[yawns]

290
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:58,125
[OSAMU] If my predictions
are correct, I believe...

291
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,208
...it's about time.

292
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,500
Huh?

293
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,500
[CHUUYA]
Plotting as usual, are we?

294
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,166
I know that voice!

295
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,791
[CHUUYA] Well, this sure
is a wonderful sight...

296
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,875
Rivals a billion
dollar masterpiece.

297
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,166
Right... Dazai?

298
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,291
So creepy...

299
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,166
Just... frightening...

300
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,791
[CHUUYA]
I like your reaction.

301
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,833
[CHUUYA] It makes me
want to strangle you...

302
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,958
[OSAMU]
Still the same old Chuuya.

303
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:29,916
[CHUUYA]
Huh?!

304
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,166
What's that mean?!

305
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,291
I've always had a
question I wanted to ask.

306
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,916
Where exactly do you
get all your tacky hats?

307
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,458
Say what you want, old snake!

308
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,791
I bet you're still

309
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,333
obsessing over committing
suicide, aren't ya...?

310
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,291
[OSAMU]
Yup.

311
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,500
[CHUUYA]
Oh.

312
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,166
It's no fun if you don't
even try to deny it.

313
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,333
In any case, now you're
just a pathetic prisoner.

314
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,666
Makes you cry, doesn't it?

315
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,833
Actually...

316
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,583
I find this all a
bit too convenient...

317
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,083
You might be able
to fool Akutagawa,

318
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,875
but you can't fool me.

319
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,291
I am your former
partner, after all.

320
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,750
So out with it...

321
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,541
What's your play here?

322
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,083
Clearly it was to
be caught and killed.

323
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,000
So far I've half-succeeded.

324
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,791
[CHUUYA] That kind of reckless
planning just isn't like you.

325
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,375
If it was, I would've
killed you a long time ago.

326
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,500
You're overthinking this.

327
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,958
By the way,
just why are you here?

328
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,375
To pay you back!

329
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,708
[OSAMU]
Hmm?

330
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,291
[CHUUYA] You used to
give me a really hard time.

331
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,416
You toyed with me.

332
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,000
But now...

333
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,125
I can give you my "gratitude"
for all of that with interest.

334
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,541
I have no idea what
you're plotting...

335
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,000
...but I wanna
fight you... Dazai.

336
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,208
I want to crush you

337
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,166
and whatever scheme
you've dreamed up.

338
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,208
[OSAMU]
Chuuya...

339
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,625
Huh?

340
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,708
So you could've
escaped any time...

341
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,166
You really thought
you could stop me?

342
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,125
You must be joking.

343
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,875
I'm rather liking
this turn of events!

344
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,750
[RAMPO sighs]

345
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,666
[DOPPO] Scan all security
footage in the city

346
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,625
from the past six hours!

347
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,750
Oh, right...

348
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,583
Kenji, do you have that file?

349
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,208
Right here.

350
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,750
[RAMPO]
That's unfortunate.

351
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,958
There're no comic
strips in this paper.

352
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,041
Hey, Kenji!

353
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,125
What is it?

354
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,000
[RAMPO]
Can you find out if there're any

355
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,291
tricky homicide cases nearby?

356
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,625
Well, okay...

357
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,958
...but the president
won't be happy with you.

358
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,750
Nevermind.

359
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,500
We found it!

360
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,958
[DOPPO] This photo
was taken by a tourist

361
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,291
who witnessed the abduction.

362
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,166
[YUKICHI] That type
of truck is everywhere.

363
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,250
True.

364
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,750
Not to mention
the plates were fake.

365
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,958
However, there's only
a few places nearby

366
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,166
that make those changes.

367
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,083
After Kenji went to all the
repair shops we could think of,

368
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,750
they were happy to oblige us.

369
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,708
I found out the truck
belongs to Karma Transit.

370
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,583
They're mules with a
background in smuggling.

371
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:01,500
So they would have information
on his whereabouts... yes?

372
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,833
Correct.

373
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,875
They're the only ones
outside of the Port Mafia

374
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,875
who might have information
about the abduction.

375
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,833
Tanizaki is on
standby at the site.

376
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,041
He can move in at any time.

377
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,875
[JUNICHIROU]
Understood.

378
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,583
I'll begin the infiltration.

379
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,833
[DOPPO]
How's it look?

380
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,416
It's so quiet you could
almost hear a pin drop.

381
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,833
There's not a
single sign of life.

382
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,250
Hang on!

383
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,208
[JUNICHIROU]
We're too late!

384
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,708
They beat us to it!

385
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:34,375
Hey!

386
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,583
What's wrong?

387
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,583
[JUNICHIROU]
They shut them up.

388
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,083
All of them are dead.

389
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,666
It's Akutagawa.

390
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,916
Now that our only lead
was snuffed out, what next?

391
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,291
[YUKICHI]
Rampo...

392
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,333
[RAMPO]
Hmm?

393
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,500
[YUKICHI]
It's your turn.

394
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,375
Do I really have to?

395
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,166
Please, we need you this time!

396
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,666
Look, Rampo...

397
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,291
I'll give you something if
you can bring him back safely.

398
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,125
Like what, a bonus?

399
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,458
A promotion?

400
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm not interested.

401
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,708
I think I'll pass.

402
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,000
If you go, I'll give you ...

403
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,250
[YUKICHI]
...praise.

404
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,458
Well... why didn't you
say so in the first place?!

405
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,083
Let's do it!

406
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,083
Ability...

407
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,916
Ultra-Deduction!

408
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,125
[RAMPO]
Hmm, I see...

409
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,875
Atsushi's location is...

410
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,166
...right here!

411
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,916
The boat's traveling
at 20 knots

412
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,458
making it's way
toward the open sea.

413
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,041
Atsushi's alive...

414
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,166
...for now, at least.

415
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,500
[gasps]

416
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,750
[DOPPO]
That means...

417
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,791
[YUKICHI]
Exactly right.

418
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,000
They're shipping him overseas.

419
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,541
That's bad.

420
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,541
The moment he's out of the
country, we can't do anything.

421
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,500
[YUKICHI]
Kunikida...

422
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,541
Huh?

423
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:24,916
Use this.

424
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,791
[YUKICHI] It's the Agency's
high-speed boat.

425
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,333
Bring him back, no matter what.

426
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,375
[DOPPO]
Understood.

427
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:41,666
I promise, I will
retrieve Atsushi Nakajima!

428
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,416
[DOPPO]
Don't you die on me, kid...

429
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,250
[AKUTAGAWA]
Do you know what it's like

430
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,666
to live in the pit of despair?

431
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,625
It's an infinite darkness
where no light can reach you.

432
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,250
Teach her how
it feels, weretiger.

433
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,875
To help no one,
to be trusted by no one,

434
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:35,083
living in fear,
trembling like a worm.

435
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,708
[ATSUSHI]
This ends now, Akutagawa!

436
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,250
I can't forgive you for this!

437
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,125
[AKUTAGAWA]
The feeling is mutual!

438
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,208
