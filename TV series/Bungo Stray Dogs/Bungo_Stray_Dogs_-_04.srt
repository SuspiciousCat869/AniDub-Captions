You really shouldn't be so

This place is so depressing.

Why am I even surprised
you're creeping around?

You get on my nerves.

Stop being foolish.

We're ready...

What target requires

The target...

We won't let that happen again.

We'll annihilate the Agency
first so they can't protect him.

Those who desire

That's right.

I've lived to this day,

217

so I could commit double-suicide
together with you.

Oh, let me tell you why...

You have racked up quite a tab.

the time to laugh...

326
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,125
Eh... Huh?

327
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,916
Are you... crying?

328
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,083
Huh?! I'm... I'm...
I'm not crying!

329
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,333
Looks like you are.

330
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,583
[grunts]

331
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,791
I think it's pretty
obvious that I'm not!

332
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,583
[DOPPO]
Oh, the youth of today.

333
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:32,041
Even when given a job, you go
off and play without permission.

334
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,833
Then you cry if anyone
gives you a word of criticism.

335
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,000
So typical of your generation!

336
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,083
[ATSUSHI]
That's not it.

337
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,416
That's not what this is about.

338
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,708
[DOPPO]
But you <i>are</i> crying!

339
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,833
[ATSUSHI]
Okay, I am...

340
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,083
But not about what you think!

341
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,625
[RAMPO] The only reason
they can call themselves

342
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:21,208
a detective agency
and function as one

343
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:25,666
is due to my ability,
Ultra-Deduction.

344
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,416
Oh, a murder case has
arrived on our doorstep.

345
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,958
Okay, Atsushi!

346
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,250
Come with me while
I work on the case.

347
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,291
[ATSUSHI]
Uh...

348
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,333
I'm not sure
I'm up to the task...

349
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:40,666
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs</i> ,
episode 5: "Murder on D Street."


350
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,208
Is this going to be an
actual detective story?

351
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,166
[RAMPO]
All's well that's well for me!
