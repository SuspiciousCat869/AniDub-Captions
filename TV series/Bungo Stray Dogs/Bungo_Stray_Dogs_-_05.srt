The Black Lizard...

00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,000
The Armed Detective
Agency was attacked

3
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:23,916
by the Port Mafia's military
squad, the Black Lizard.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,791
But the entire squad
was crushed thanks

5
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:31,000
to the battle skills of
Kunikida, Yosano, and Kenji.

6
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,083
That's how powerful the
Armed Detective Agency is.

[RAMPO]
Hey, Harunochi.

9
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,458
A challenge for you:

10
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,750
Do you think you can you take
the marble out of this bottle?

11
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,666
I think I can do that.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,125
Marble, really?

Is this what you wanted?

15
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,708
[RAMPO] Mm-hmm. Marbles
are lovely, aren't they?

16
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,958
Now that you mention
it, yes, they are.

17
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,791
Um, isn't Rampo going
to help clean up the office?

I can't stay.

22
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,208
I've got to head off to a job.

23
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,333
Oh, have you been called to
assist with a new murder case?

24
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,083
[RAMPO]
Yep.

25
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,916
The police are always
so desperate for my help.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,916
They can't capture a
single criminal without me.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,875
The fact is...

28
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:21,125
...my Ultra-Deduction is the
best ability in this agency.

29
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,416
I'm sure it's the best power
in the whole country.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,083
It's no surprise that
everyone depends on it.

31
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,083
We're all indebted
to you, Rampo.

32
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,208
[RAMPO] Good, well, you know,
as long as you're aware.

33
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,083
You're funny.

34
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,833
It's odd that you call
yourselves a detective agency,

35
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,708
because the rest of you
have the deductive powers

36
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,666
of a pack of monkeys.

37
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,416
The only way you can investigate
anything is thanks to my ability

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
What you do is truly amazing.

39
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,333
With your
Ultra-Deduction skills,

40
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,458
you can see right to the
heart of a case in an instant.

41
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,250
[DOPPO] You're a role
model for the Agency--

no, for all gifted people.

43
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,416

Yeah, you're right.

Hey, kid.

Y-Yes?

46
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Never mind the clean-up here.

47
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,458
You're done.
You need to go with Rampo.

48
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,208
You two will travel by train.

49
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,375
I-I'm gonna be a
detective's assistant?

50
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,000
It's a great responsibility...

51
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,916
[RAMPO]
Don't be silly.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,791
I'm not a two-bit detective.

53
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,375
I don't need an "assistant."

54
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,750
[ATSUSHI]
Then why am I going with you?

55
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,541
Simple.

56
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,791
I never bothered to
learn how to take the train.

57
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,416
[RAMPO]
Hmmm...

58
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,750
[ATSUSHI]
Honestly, I was surprised

59
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,250
at how naive Rampo was.

60
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,583
He didn't know anything:
how to buy a ticket,

61
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,375
how to get
through the turnstile,

62
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,666
or how to figure out
which platform to go to...

63
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,208
I guess he really
can't do anything

64
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,541
without using his
supernatural ability.

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,083
You know you're late, Agents.

66
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,000
Now hold on, who are you?

67
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,500
Where's Yasui?

68
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,625
[MINOURA]
I'm Minoura.

69
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,458
I took over from Yasui.

70
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,750
This case has been
reassigned to our division,

71
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,250
so we no longer need
you or your agency.

72
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,833
[RAMPO]
That's ridiculous.

73
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,083
Every difficult case
should be overseen

74
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,458
by a master detective like me.

75
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,000
[MINOURA] We won't need
private investigators on this

76
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,833
because the victim was
a cop who worked for me.

77
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,791
[ATSUSHI]
Eh...

00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,291
The victim's a lady.

Yes, sir.

Her body was found floating
in the river this morning.

[MINOURA] She was shot
three times in the chest.

82
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,375
We don't know where
or when she was killed.

83
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,500
We haven't found
the bullets either.

84
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,250
[RAMPO]
Any suspects?

85
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,000
Not yet. As far as
anyone at the office knew,

86
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,500
she wasn't in a relationship.

87
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,375
So we doubt it
was a jealous lover.

00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,125
[RAMPO]
Very interesting.

89
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,958
So does that mean
you don't have any leads?

90
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,958
That's all the more reason why

91
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,041
we can't let some amateur
private eye handle this.

They put out nets?

Yeah, the net's
strung across the water.

I am going to end everything,

What a sweet ring it has.

By comparison, it feels so empty
to think about bidding farewell

Gyah! Sixty seconds is
impossible, don't you think?!

161
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,458
Tick tock! Fifty seconds left.

162
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,333
What?!

163
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,791
[ATSUSHI] I hope that's
not what I look like

164
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,666
when I'm under
too much pressure.

165
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,125
Hold on. I know
Yamagiwa was pursuing

166
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,916
a political corruption case

167
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,458
and also running an
investigation on the Port Mafia.

168
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,583
The murderer's M.O.
is similar to the Mafia's

169
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,416
when they want retribution.

170
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,041
Maybe the Mafia did it

171
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,583
because they knew
she was getting too close.

172
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,541
No.

173
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,166
Uh...?

174
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,291
[OSAMU] The Port Mafia's
retaliatory methods

175
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,791
are quite specific.

176
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,458
They have a signature

177
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,125
that's as unique to
them as a fingerprint.

178
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,250
First, the traitor is
forced on the ground

179
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,000
and made to bite the curb.

180
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,125
Then they stomp on
his head to shatter his jaw.

181
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,250
Finally, they flip him over
and shoot him in the chest...

182
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,833
[OSAMU]
...three times.

183
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,333
I guess if we're being precise,

184
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,083
then technically yes,
but still...

185
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,125
So this M.O. is
similar to the Mafia's,

186
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,166
but not exactly the same.

187
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,708
That means...

188
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,833
The killer was
attempting a cover up?

189
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,375
Shooting two extra rounds to
make it look like a Mafia hit.

190
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,500
How cruel.

191
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,416
Beep!

192
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,083
Nice try, Sergeant.

193
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,666
Too bad, you've got a ways to go

194
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,250
before your case
solving skills match mine.

195
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,291
But don't feel bad,
you've been useful!

196
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,583
You've helped us prove that
Minoura's best detectives

197
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,958
are inferior to me.

198
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,708
[MINOURA]
Cut the crap!

199
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,500
I'm tired of all your jabber.

200
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,791
You can't crack hard cases
just with deduction.

201
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,833
You've been reading
too many crime novels.

202
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,041
Cases are solved
through investigation:

203
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,541
interviewing
persons of interest,

204
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,416
and closely analyzing
the crime scene.

205
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,375
Uh-huh? You've got
a pretty thick skull.

206
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,375
Great detectives don't
do "investigations."

207
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:07,291
My ability, Ultra-Deduction, can
instantly identify the killer.

208
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,583
I can also figure out when and
how the murder was committed.

209
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,541
But wait there's more,

210
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,458
I can see in my mind's eye
how to make the killer confess

211
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,583
and where the evidence
lies to prove our case.

212
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,958
My power truly is a rare gift.

213
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,791
Given my line of work,

214
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,916
I know all about you
gifted types and your powers.

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,666
But if you have
such a special ability,

216
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,666
then why do my colleagues
and I still have a job?

217
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,541
My thoughts exactly.

218
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,291
Now we're starting to understand
each other, detective.

219
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,458
[growls]
You little bastard!

220
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,208
[OSAMU]
Now, now, Detective.

221
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,958
Please pardon my colleague's
tactless behavior.

222
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,916
What can I say?

223
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,625
My personal motto is...
"All's well that's well for me!

224
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,375
Catchy right?

225
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,833
[ATSUSHI] My personal
motto would probably be

226
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,791
"What's better
than being alive?"

227
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,583
Well, well, well...

228
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,875
You can't stop bragging
about your ability,

229
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,125
so let's have a look at it.

230
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,333
[RAMPO]
Really?

231
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,333
So I guess I'm on the case?

232
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,458
You should've just asked me
nicely when I first got here.

233
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,958
Heh, too bad you've got a lot
more confidence than experience.

234
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,041
You realize there's
no hard evidence...?

235
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,916
Would you like me to
count to sixty for you?

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,291
Heeeh...

237
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,291
I won't need that long.

238
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,625
Watch closely now, Atsushi.

239
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,500
This is the ability
that keeps the Agency going.

240
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,250
Once he puts on those glasses...

241
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,666
Rampo's Ultra-Deduction
is active.

242
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,083
[ATSUSHI]
I can't believe Rampo's ability

243
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,541
to solve a case like this.

244
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,291
How does a power
like that even work?

245
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,416
Ability: Ultra-Deduction!

246
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,791
Yes, I see.

247
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,833
Heh! "I see," my ass.

248
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,333
You're trying to tell us
you know who the killer is?

249
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,416
[RAMPO]
Of course!

250
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,083
Okay?

251
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,291
The killer is...

252
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,166
The killer's you.

253
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,666
[RAMPO]
That's right.

254
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,000
You're the killer...

255
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:19,083
I know that you did it,
Sergeant Sugimoto.

256
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,291
Huh?

257
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,500
[ATSUSHI]
He did it?

258
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,125
[laughs]

259
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,708
Sergeant Sugimoto
works for me on the force.

260
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,916
Sergeant Sugimoto is
the one who killed her.

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,875
Ugh! Ridiculous!

262
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,791
What stupid killer would want to
come to the scene of the crime?

263
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,583
That's precisely why he's here.

264
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,583
He wants to stay close
to the investigation.

265
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,458
And in case I didn't
mention it...

266
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,750
I know where we can
find evidence to prove it.

267
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,250
Let me see your gun.

268
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,125
Y-You've got to be kidding me!

269
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,083
I can't just hand over
my firearm to a civilian!

270
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,083
They would take my badge away!

271
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,083
How convenient for you, Rampo.

272
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,833
Your source of evidence is the
one thing you can't look at.

273
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,458
[RAMPO]
But look at it this way.

274
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,500
If we examine that gun
and come up empty,

275
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,375
then you prove your right, and
I'm an idiot with a big mouth.

276
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,833
Hmph. I've had
enough of listening

277
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,416
to your annoying voice!

278
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,416
Sugimoto, show him your gun.

279
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,041
But, sir!

280
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,291
[MINOURA] This so-called
detective has barked up

281
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,375
this tree as far as he can go.

282
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,208
If we prove him wrong,
he'll shut up and go home.

283
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,208
Go on, you can
show him your gun.

284
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,916
Hey, what's the matter,
Sugimoto?

285
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,875
Even here in a city
filled with criminals,

286
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,791
it isn't easy to acquire
government issued ammunition...

287
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,791
Or for that matter a
government issued weapon.

288
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,958
Why aren't you saying
anything, Sugimoto?!

289
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,250
[RAMPO]
He's quiet.

290
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,750
But I think his mind is racing.

291
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,708
Specifically,
he's thinking about

292
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:38,125
the three bullets he's used and
how he'll explain their absence.

the murder took place

early yesterday morning
at the abandoned shipyard,

meters upstream from here.

Ah. How'd you know that?

I'm sure we'll find
more evidence there.

Including your
footprints and hers.

you tried but failed to erase.

00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,125
Okay, save your confession...

319
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,416
...till we're back
at the station.

320
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,166
It might be your
last time there.

321
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,875
[SUGIMOTO] It was never
my plan to shoot her.

322
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,041
Y'see, she...

323
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,500
She was following leads in a
small time corruption case.

324
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,625
But as she dug into it, she
realized that she'd uncovered

325
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:00,750
a larger crime
involving a politician.

326
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,916
But the politician
knew he was vulnerable

327
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,833
and already had a
mole inside the force

328
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,375
to get rid of any evidence.

329
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,583
The mole you are talking
about, that was you, right?

330
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,583
I had always wanted
to become a police officer.

331
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,625
He found me when
I was depressed...

332
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,375
I was at a low point

333
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,250
after my third time failing
the entrance exam.

334
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,500
He asked me what I was
willing to do to join the force.

335
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,000
He used his influence
to help me become a cop,

336
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,708
but there was a price.

337
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,750
I had to report to him
and follow his orders.

338
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,333
So he ordered
you to kill Yamagiwa,

339
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,125
and you obeyed like a lap dog!

340
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,666
That's not true!

341
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,708
I was trying to
warn her about him.

342
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,541
He was on to her.
He'd kill her if...

343
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,250
...if she didn't give
up her investigation.

344
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,333
But she just
wouldn't listen to me.

345
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,708
This is no joke.
He's taking this very seriously.

346
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,375
[YAMIGAWA] Then I'll just have
to take him very seriously, too.

347
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,750
I've already made contact
with a prosecutor I know.

348
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,291
I just need to hand
over the evidence.

349
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,666
What're you doing?

350
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,541
I'm just trying to protect you.

351
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,333
Give me the evidence, or he'll
hire someone to kill you.

352
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,500
I wanna help you stay alive!

353
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,916
Please do it.

354
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,375
No, you're gonna
hand over the gun.

355
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,000
Give it to me.

356
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,833
We both know you're
not willing to shoot me.

357
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,416
[SUGIMOTO]
You're right.

358
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,083
I can't.

359
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,250
Give it to me or I'll shoot!

360
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,791
[gasps]
Sugimoto!

361
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,708
Stop! Don't!

362
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,875
[gunshot]

363
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,166
Ah!

364
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,583
[screams]

365
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,666
[SUGIMOTO gasps]

366
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,416
[RAMPO] But we both know
the story doesn't end there,

367
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,375
does it?!

368
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,208
There's still the matter of
what you did with the body.

369
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,708
You were in a bind.

370
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,375
You panicked and
made a rash choice...

371
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,625
You called the
crooked politician for help.

372
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,250
He told you to
destroy the evidence

373
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,291
by making it look
like a Mafia hit,

374
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,208
so you fired two more
shots into her chest.

375
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,875
[RAMPO]
You set her adrift in the river

376
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,666
to delay the body's discovery.

377
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,375
[MINOURA] Where's the evidence
Yamagiwa had gathered?

378
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,000
That politician is
responsible for her death!

379
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,375
Tell me, right now!

380
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,250
[RAMPO]
Hey, Sugimoto...

381
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,291
[MINOURA]
Hm?

382
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,916
Want me to guess what
her final words were?

383
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,083
I have an idea.

384
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,291
"I'm sorry." Correct?

385
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,916
I'm sorry...

386
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So sorry.

387
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,875
[SUGIMOTO gasps]

388
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:51,833
[SUGIMOTO]
How...

389
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:55,250
[SUGIMOTO sobs]

390
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:59,291
How does your power
let you see all that?

391
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,458
The evidence she
had on the politician,

392
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,541
it's in my desk drawer.

393
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,416
[MINOURA]
Thank you, I suppose.

394
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,416
[RAMPO]
Hmm?

395
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,250
[MINOURA] Also, I'm sorry I
doubted your special powers.

396
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,166
We'll come to you the next
time we get a tough case.

397
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,166
If you need my
Ultra-Deduction abilities,

398
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,666
all you have to
do is ask, Detective.

399
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,708
I may even give you a discount.

400
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,333
Appreciate the offer.

401
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,541
[ATSUSHI] What Rampo
did back there was amazing.

402
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,375
I had no idea he'd
figure everything out.

403
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,250
His Ultra-Deduction
ability is truly incredible.

404
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,958
Yes, but I might've
figured out half of it, too.

405
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,375
Half of what?

406
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,333
The case we were
just working on...

407
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,833
I pretty much know
how Rampo figured it out.

408
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,458
Well, maybe,
but he said his ability

409
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,625
lets him solve
the case instantly...

410
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,125
Oh, right, I forgot.
You don't know about him yet...

411
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,791
See, the truth is...

412
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,166
...Rampo isn't gifted
with special powers.

413
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,250
Huh?!

414
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,916
Rampo is a rare breed.

415
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,250
Despite appearances,
he's an un-gifted member

416
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,333
of the crime fighting team at
the Armed Detective Agency.

417
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,833
He himself seems to believe he's
using an ability, but he's not.

418
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,083
And even though he's childish,
he's 26 years old.

419
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,958
Eh?!

420
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,166
The reason why everyone
at the Agency respects Rampo

421
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,750
is because they know his Ultra-
Deduction <i>isn't</i> an ability.

422
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,833
I had heard about it,

423
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,500
but today I was the first time
I got to witness him in action,

424
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,541
and here's a little secret...
I put it to a test.

425
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,375
While he was "using" his
Ultra-Deduction ability today,

426
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:31,125
I was secretly pinching
his hair behind him.

427
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,250
As you well know,
my unique power

428
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,333
is to neutralize anyone's
ability if I touch them...

429
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,166
I'm "anti-gifted."

430
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,958
No gifted person
can use their ability

431
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,083
while I'm in physical
contact with them.

432
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,583
This has always been true,

433
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,375
no matter how strong
their powers are.

434
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,291
In other words,

435
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,791
Rampo's Ultra-Deduction
is not a supernatural ability.

436
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,583
He's a regular person?

437
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,291
Hold on, then how did he...

438
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,958
[OSAMU]
Pure deduction.

439
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,125
There's nothing
"Ultra" about it.

440
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,000
But how? I mean...

441
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,833
He figured out who the killer
was in such a short time!

442
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:05,041
How can deduction alone
solve a hard case like that?

443
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,125
Well, I don't have that power,
and I figured it out.

444
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,041
Do you remember what
Sergeant Sugimoto said?

445
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,750
Shooting two extra rounds to
make it look like a Mafia hit.

446
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,666
[OSAMU] Any innocent
person who saw a body

447
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,416
with three gunshot wounds

448
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,958
would assume they were
fired at the same time.

449
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,458
Oh...

450
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,166
[OSAMU]
What Sugimoto said implied

451
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,250
he knew the victim had
died from the first shot.

452
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,708
How could he have known that

453
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,583
before the autopsy
was performed?

454
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,416
'Cause he was the shooter.

455
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,583
But Rampo also knew when
the murder had been committed.

456
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,041
He said it was
yesterday morning.

457
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,958
That's because

458
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,458
he observed the body
was still in good condition.

459
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,416
We could easily ID the victim.

460
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,791
So, at most, it'd only been
floating in the river for a day.

461
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,583
Also she looked as if
she had dressed in a rush.

462
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,916
She wasn't dressed for work.

463
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,791
She had no makeup on.

464
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,916
So the murder clearly
occurred in the early morning.

465
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,791
I see.

466
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,291
But how did he know about
the crime scene's location

467
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,083
and that she was
threatened like that?

468
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,291
I've got to admit, I don't know.

469
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,166
A trained mind like
Rampo's probably caught

470
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,750
a lot more details than I could
hope to quickly observe.

471
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,375
It's really amazing.

472
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,125
Especially how he
was able to figure out

473
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,750
what her final words were.

474
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,250
[OSAMU]
Oh, well...

475
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,500
...that I knew.

476
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,458
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?

477
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,958
According to the police, she was
not in a romantic relationship.

478
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,125
But her wristwatch
told a different story.

479
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,166
It was an expensive
European model.

480
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,291
Not something a young woman
on a detective's salary

481
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,583
would ordinarily
buy for herself.

482
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,541
[OSAMU] Sugimoto's
watch was the men's version

483
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,416
of the same luxury brand.

484
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,125
So then, they were...
dating each other?

485
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,083
When he called her,

486
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,375
she went to see him right away
without a trace of makeup.

487
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,875
She trusted him.

488
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,541
They even wore
matching watches...

489
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,000
It tells me they were in love.

490
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,541
[OSAMU] With such
strong feelings for her,

491
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,500
he couldn't kick her head
in to finish the cover up.

492
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,958
He knew it wouldn't
look like the Mafia's work,

493
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,250
but it was just too
much for him to bear.

494
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,041
The ability to see all of that
would be par for the course

495
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,333
if it were an actual
supernatural power.

496
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,333
Nothing really worth
getting credit for.

497
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,416
But if it's due to his natural,
personal powers of deduction,

498
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,916
well, that's a different story.

499
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,916
Not only that,

500
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,291
Rampo has solved dozens of
cases using his un-gifted mind.

501
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,791
In every case, he was
able to instantly determine

502
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,916
the truth of the matter
with the slimmest of leads!

503
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,041
He's never been wrong!

504
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:31,000
Our city is safer thanks to his
work and the power of his mind.

505
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,250
He truly is a great man,
don't you think?

506
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,208
[RAMPO]
Somebody's not doing their job!

507
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,916
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?

508
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You're supposed
to help me find my way back

509
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,583
to the Agency, y'know!

510
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,333
[ATSUSHI]
I think I kind of get it now...

511
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,958
[OSAMU]
Huh?

512
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,250
Why everyone at the
Agency trusts Rampo

513
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,750
and tells him how great he is.

514
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,333
[OSAMU]
Heh.

515
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,416
[RAMPO]
Hm... Heh heh.

516
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,083
All's well that's well for me!

517
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,375
[DOPPO]
What is "the Ideal"?

518
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,958
There are any number
of answers to that question.

519
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:30,958
It is words.

520
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,333
It is thought.

521
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,583
From a moving plan
scheduled five years from now

522
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,000
to tonight's dinner menu,
this notebook has everything

523
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,458
in life written out
in exacting detail.

524
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,916
It represents the
entirety of my ideals!

525
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,541
[ATSUSHI]
But just to be safe,

526
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,250
you really shouldn't
show anyone the page

527
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,875
where you've written
about your ideal woman.

528
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,666
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs</i> ,

529
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,916
episode 6:
"The Azure Messenger."

530
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,625
[DOPPO] What's so bad about
looking for an ideal woman?!
