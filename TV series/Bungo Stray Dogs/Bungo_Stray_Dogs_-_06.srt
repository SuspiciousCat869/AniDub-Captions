00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:11,250
[DOPPO]
What is "the Ideal"?

2
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:14,416
The question seems
to beget more questions:

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,291
Is it merely a concept?

4
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,125
A lofty notion?

5
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,916
Or the goal of all life itself?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,583
If you were to ask me, however,
the answer is quite simple.

7
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,875
The words rest on
the front of my notebook,

8
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,000
encasing its meaning.

9
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,875
[DOPPO]
"The Ideal"...

10
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,583
Everything about
me is written here.

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:41,166
My day-to-day schedule,
my long term goals...

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,541
My future is forever
bound to this notebook.

13
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,083
[DOPPO] I've arrived a
whole ten seconds early.

14
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,416
My name is Doppo Kunikida.

15
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,291
I'm an idealist at heart,

16
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,333
and a pragmatist in
pursuit of those ideals.

17
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,000
It's time.

18
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,041
Good morning, everyone.

19
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,208
Please help us, Mr Kunikida!

20
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,500
What is it <i>this</i> time?

21
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,291
I-I-It's Mr. Dazai...

22
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:43,958
Look at him!

23
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,291
[OSAMU]
Aaahhhhh!!

24
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,250
Kunikida...

25
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,708
It's an emergency!

26
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,750
Just take a look at this!

27
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:49,625
Look at what?

28
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,416
It's right here, silly!

29
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,666
The only thing I see
is your stupid face.

30
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,416
It's here!

31
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,666
I've finally arrived!

32
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,291
I can see the pearly
gates and everything!

33
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,458
I have no idea what's going on.

34
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,375
[ATSUSHI]
Mr. Kunikida!

35
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,125
[DOPPO]
Hm?

36
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,000
I... found this.

37
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,833
I knew the <i>Complete Guide to</i>
<i>Suicide</i> was a masterpiece!

38
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,125
Who would've guessed I just
needed to eat those mushrooms

39
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,083
growing nearby to have
such an entertaining exit!

40
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,125
[laughs]

41
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,708
So those mushrooms
were poisonous?

42
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:20,291
[ATSUSHI] Well, yeah, he thought
they were, but in actuality th--

43
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,041
Yes! I've finally caught you,
rainbow pillbug!

44
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:23,875
Time for lunch!

45
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,458
[ATSUSHI]
Mr. Kunikida!

46
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,416
I'm doing my routine paperwork.

47
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,708
Wait until I'm done.

48
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,958
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?!

49
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,625
[OSAMU]
Oh, Kunikiiiidaaaa...

50
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,458
You should come
to the afterlife, too.

51
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,125
It's amazing here!

52
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,750
So many rainbow pillbugs...

53
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,000
All the drinks you can handle...

54
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,000
Mountains and mountains
of food to eat...

55
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,208
All the sleeping beauties
you could ever--

56
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,708
[roars]

57
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,791
Stop this nonsense!

58
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,125
[ATSUSHI]
How can two people

59
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,541
this completely
incompatible work together?

60
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,666
[door opens]

61
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,041
Mr. Kunikida?

62
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,958
The president has your
case file ready and waiting.

63
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,958
[DOPPO]
Dazai, quit dilly-dallying.

64
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,291
Keep up the pace.

65
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,750
[OSAMU]
Okayyyy.

66
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,666
[DOPPO] We only have
two minutes and 15 seconds

67
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,000
until our appointment!

68
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,083
[OSAMU]
That's a cause for worry.

69
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,583
Is it really okay
for me to come along?

70
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,708
[DOPPO] It's part of
your rookie training.

71
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,083
We need to solve a case

72
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,333
involving a series of
disappearances in Yokohama.

73
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,875
[ATSUSHI]
I heard about this.

74
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,791
Tourists arrive in the city and
are never heard from again.

75
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,958
A lot of people have
gone missing, right?

76
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,041
[DOPPO]
We received an anonymous tip.

77
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,500
It stated that the victims
have all been abducted

78
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,833
and gave the location
where they are being held.

79
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,666
The good, ol' "anonymous tip."

80
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,541
How very convenient
and terribly suspicious.

81
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,666
Even so, we can't ignore it.

82
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,333
So we're gonna check
out whatever this place is?

83
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,666
[DOPPO]
No.

84
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,125
[DOPPO] We're investigating
the tip's source.

85
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,250
[DOPPO] How's the work
coming along, informant?

86
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,500
[TAGUCHI]
Not bad, four-eyes.

87
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,125
Better than
your notebook, I'll bet.

88
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,083
[DOPPO] That's a lot of
attitude coming from someone

89
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,583
who'd be considered
a glorified cyber criminal.

90
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,666
If your activities
came to light,

91
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,541
your father would
be disappointed.

92
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,875
Don't you bring him
into this, Kunikida.

93
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,041
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?

94
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,791
[TAGUCHI]
More importantly, you're late.

95
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,083
How unusual.

96
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,166
So what...
were you out on a... date?

97
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,541
[DOPPO]
Course not!

98
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,791
Courting will only be
done with a specified woman,

99
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,458
followed by marriage within six
years time, as is dictated here.

100
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,333
Huh?!

101
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,583
So you're saying

102
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,958
you already have someone
that you plan to marry?

103
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,000
I will in another four years.

104
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,208
[ATSUSHI]
Uh...!

105
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,000
So, who's the new kid?

106
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,916
[ATSUSHI]
I'm Atsushi Nakajima.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,500
The name's Taguchi Rokuzou.

108
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,958
I'm a spy.

109
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,625
For the right price,
I can dig up dirt on anything.

110
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:57,375
[DOPPO] So did you figure out
who's behind the anonymous tip?

111
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,708
The Azure Messenger...

112
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,166
What?

113
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,625
[TAGUCHI] I swiped some of
the data left on the server,

114
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,583
which included these
pictures of the victims.

115
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,208
The mole can't be that
bad of a guy, can he?

116
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,083
I mean he did let you know where
they were being kept and all.

117
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,166
[OSAMU]
It's possible.

118
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,416
It'd just be a shame if we
went there and after all that,

119
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,583
they turned out to
be the kidnappers.

120
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,750
"The Azure Messenger"...

121
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,791
Stay on their trail, Taguchi.

122
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,958
Sure, if I have the time.

123
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,833
I'm very busy
looking after my fish.

124
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,833
Right... Thank you very much.

125
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,375
I called a cab.

126
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,625
We'll head to the abandoned
hospital the tipster mentioned.

127
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,041
[OSAMU]
Tell me, Kunikida:

128
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,833
Why are you looking
after that Rokuzou boy?

129
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,208
[DOPPO]
What do you mean?

130
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,541
[OSAMU] It's not like you
to give a hacker a job.

131
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,875
Not only that, you could've just
talked to him over the phone.

132
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,958
But you took the time
to meet him face to face.

133
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,125
His father's deceased, isn't he?

134
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,416
Are you trying to
fill that role for him?

135
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,791
[DOPPO]
We came here

136
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,875
so that Atsushi could
formally meet our informant.

137
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,083
That's all there is to it.

138
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,166
Nothing more.

139
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,458
[OSAMU]
Then I won't press the matter.

140
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,666
[DOPPO] This driver is
another one of our informants.

141
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,291
He used to be an actor.

142
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,625
[DRIVER]
My career never took off,

143
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,875
so I had to find paying work.

144
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,791
It was fortunate for us you did.

145
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,375
You know these streets.

146
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,625
No on else's knowledge of
Yokohama even comes close.

147
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,458
It's also helpful that
you happened to see two

148
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:32,583
of the 11 victims just before
they were reported missing.

149
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,083
It's true,
as fate would have it,

150
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,708
I had driven both of them
from the port to their hotel.

151
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,333
Are we sure these
people were abducted?

152
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,500
There haven't been
any ransom requests.

153
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,083
[DOPPO] You're certain these
were the two who you drove?

154
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,250
Yes, there's no mistaking them.

155
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,541
Even their clothes are the same.

156
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,000
[OSAMU]
I see!

157
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,208
That's gotta be it!

158
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,333
Check this out.

159
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,500
Both of these guys
are wearing glasses!

160

It's gotta be a serial
glasses abduction case!

This is totally
your time to shine!

162
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,541
Not all of the people who
were abducted wear glasses,

163
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,083
so it's not a pattern.

00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,708
Awww, too bad...

165
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,666
I guess maybe it'll never
be your time to shine.

All right,
now you've gone too far.

We've arrived, sir.

The abandoned hospital,
just as you requested.

00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,875
[OSAMU]
What a cheery atmosphere.

173
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,041
Think it's haunted?

Yeah, right.

creepy in here, isn't it?

[OSAMU] I think it's
refreshing, actually.

Really gets my blood pumping.

[DOPPO] You'd better not have
eaten another weird mushroom.

[OSAMU] You seem a
little jumpy, Kunikida.

00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,458
[ATSUSHI] Is he afraid
of ghosts or something?

I-I'm not afraid of ghosts!

Don't fall behind then.

Thank you so much...

You saved my life.

My name is Sasaki Nobuko.

I'm a lecturer at one of

Did you happen to see who
it was who abducted you?

201
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,083
I didn't. I blacked out
back at the train station.

When I came to,

203

I was drowning in that tank,
just as you all came in.

Dazai, what's your

Indeed.

You should've
picked sexier glasses.

296

Here you are in the paper, and
those do not photograph well.

That's right.

00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,958
The abductions happened here.

320
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,541
You're the kidnapper.

321
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,083
You subdued
passengers with sleeping gas,

322
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,833
and abducted them after
they fell unconscious.

323
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,541
You wore a gas mask
to escape the effects.

324
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,708
Why would he go
through all that trouble?

325
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,791
[OSAMU]
I can think of one reason.

326
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:04,583
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?

327
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,750
Merchandise.

328
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,791
[ATSUSHI]
What do you mean?

329
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,250
He'd sell the bodies
for their parts.

330
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,666
There's quite a large
black market for organs

331
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,083
if you know where to look.

332
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,791
The cut may not be ideal

333
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,875
because of the various
economic factors involved,

334
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,625
but if you're flying solo,
the pay's not bad.

335
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,750
[ATSUSHI]
That's horrible.

336
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,791
Hang on... that's impossible.

337
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,916
If I'd kidnapped
people in this taxi,

338
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,333
I would've been found out

339
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,500
when the police traced
their last known whereabouts.

340
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:33,250
Actually, the police didn't look
give this taxi a second look.

341
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,333
Why would they?

342
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,000
All the victims had vanished,

343
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,875
and subsequently each one became
untraceable the following day.

344
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,875
After the targets got in
your taxi and were sedated,

345
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,458
you proceeded to strip them of
their clothes and belongings.

346
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,208
That's why most of the
victims at the hospital

347
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,583
were only in their underwear.

348
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,083
You would then don their clothes

349
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,375
in order to disguise
yourself as them,

350
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,375
and followed up by
checking into hotels

351
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,416
where they had
previously made reservations.

352
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,833
You made sure

353
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,291
you would show up on security
cameras for that reason.

354
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:07,166
The victims being the same size
as you was no accident either.

355
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,583
You chose people who wore hats

356
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:12,166
and glasses because they
were easier to impersonate.

357
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,000
If the security feed
showed someone

358
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,958
looking close
enough to the victim,

359
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,875
the police were
inclined to believe it.

360
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,375
By the time the
last known sighting

361
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,625
of the "victim" was recorded,

362
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,458
the real victim had
already been abducted.

363
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:29,416
[OSAMU] Ms. Sasaki's abduction
was even easier, wasn't it?

364
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,333
After she collapsed
at the train station,

365
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,833
a good Samaritan passing by

366
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,416
paid for her cab ride
to the hospital.

367
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,958
It's faster than
calling an ambulance

368
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,625
at the train station, isn't it?

369
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,500
[DRIVER] That's all
circumstantial evidence.

370
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,125
[OSAMU]
Hmm?

371
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,000
I suppose.

372
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,208
Guess we got nothing.

373
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,375
What's your move now, Kunikida?

374
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,500
Come on, are you
being serious right now?

375
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,416
How about we all make a deal?

376
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,791
What do you mean?

377
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,625
If you agree to my conditions,
I'll turn myself in.

378
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,458
I need the assurance of
the Armed Detective Agency!

379
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,125
You have to keep me safe
till the prosecution concludes

380
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,708
their questioning and arranges
witness protection for me.

381
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:06,708
[DOPPO]
What's this about?

382
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,166
It wasn't my idea
to do this job.

383
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,541
I was approached by
a new organ smuggling ring

384
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,458
who told me this
was a great opportunity

385
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,791
and I'd never get caught.
Those liars!

386
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,750
So there's a group
behind all this?

387
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,125
Do you know where they are?

388
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,041
Sadly, no. I was always
instructed to meet them

389
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,041
in the Harbor Central Building.

390
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,708
That must be it.

391
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,625
[OSAMU] One question:
Why do you need <i>our</i> protection?

392
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,125
[DRIVER]
Well...

393
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,458
It appears that one of the
people I abducted was actually

394
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,916
with the Port Mafia.

395
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,791
How unfortunate...

396
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,833
They didn't take
long in finding us...

397

I'm not getting any signal.

They must be jamming it.

403

If we lose the driver, the truth
may never come to light.

You can't even shoot
a straight bullet.

I don't have killing
anyone in my schedule.

It appears the Agency isn't
merely a group of clowns.

Don't come back.

[OSAMU] I turned the

440
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:54,000
[ATSUSHI] So... this is the same
building the organ traffickers

441
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,000
used for their hideout?

[DOPPO]
They've already left.

443

[ATSUSHI] The walls are
completely scorched.

444
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,458
[OSAMU] This is where the Azure

445
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,458
[DOPPO]
Correct.

446
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,958
[ATSUSHI]
What?

447
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,833
Are you talking about the
infamous Azure Flag terrorist?

448
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,291
That Azure King?

449
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,875
Yes.

00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,833
many national and
corporate facilities.

452
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,541
When I first heard the
handle "Azure Messenger,"

453
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,833
I wondered if perhaps they
had some sort of connection

454
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,416
to the Azure King.

455
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,708
I remember seeing all the news
coverage about that explosion.

456
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,625
So this is where it happened...

457
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,583
It was out desperation after
the police had cornered him,

458
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,416
isn't that right?

459
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,625
[DOPPO]
Exactly.

460
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,583
I had determined
this to be his hideout

461
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:45,000
and reported the location
to the local authorities.

462
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,541
I'd heard it was a big
operation; what happened next?

463
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,666
The public safety
bureau, army, police,

464
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,208
everybody was working in tandem,
which created mass confusion.

465
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,791
Upon receiving the report,

466
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,500
only five detectives arrived at
the scene in a timely manner.

467
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,375
[DOPPO]
To exacerbate matters,

468
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,666
the Azure King received word
of the authority's actions,

469
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,416
and proceeded to
hole up inside the building

470
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,125
with an explosive device.

471

After a set of
conflicting orders,

472
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,416
a decision was made
to raid the building.

However, without
special training or abilities,

they didn't stand a chance.

that were deployed that day,

479
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,875
one of them was Rokuzou's
father, wasn't he?

480
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,750
[DOPPO] He was a good
man with strong morals.

481
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,416
If I hadn't tipped
off the authorities,

482
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,333
none of this would've happened.

483
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,791
I may as well have
pushed the button myself.

484
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,333
That's not true!

485
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,791
It's the terrorist's fault for
choosing to blow himself up.

486
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,708
[OSAMU]
You're absolutely right.

487
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,041
Even so, Kunikida can't help
but take Rokuzou under his wing

488
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,083
as a surrogate father.

489
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,833
He feels it's the
least he can do.

490
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,083
[beep]

491
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,041
[DOPPO]
Hmm?

492
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,791
[ATSUSHI]
What is it?

493
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,416
[DOPPO]
Another job for the Agency.

494
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,208
The client is...

495
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,666
...the Azure Messenger.

496
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,250
How interesting.

497
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,083
They're starting to
reveal their true colors.

498
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,041
So... what's the job?

499
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,666
[DOPPO]
It's to go disarm a bomb.

500
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,083
[ATSUSHI]
A bomb?!

501
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,250
[DOPPO] If we fail to disarm it,
by sunset tomorrow...

502
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,583
...hundreds will die.

503
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,791
[ATSUSHI] So what exactly
are we looking at here?

504
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,000
With these schematics,

505
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,583
the explosive would
be quite advanced.

506
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:38,875
It's not going to be an easy
task to find and dismantle it.

507
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,166
[ATSUSHI]
No way...

508
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,208
[DOPPO]
Don't worry.

509
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,000
Nobody is going to be hurt.

510
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:43,958
Huh?

511
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,000
I promise...

512
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,708
I won't let that happen again!

513
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,333
[ATSUSHI]
What should we do?

514
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,416
If we don't find and disarm
the bomb by sundown,

515
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,250
there'll be hundreds
of casualties.

516
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,333
[YUKICHI] If such an unfortunate
event were to happen,

517
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,541
we would no longer
have any right

518
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,208
to call ourselves
a detective agency.

519
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,791
[ATSUSHI]
President Fukuzawa...

520
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,875
[YUKICHI]
The future of the Agency

521
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:34,166
depends on the
outcome of this mission.

522
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,375
Begin the investigation!

523
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,750
[ATSUSHI]
Oh, boy!

524
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,291
Where did Mr. Dazai run
off to at a time like this?

525
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,250
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs</i> ,

526
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:46,541
episode 7: "Love for
the Disease Called Ideals."
