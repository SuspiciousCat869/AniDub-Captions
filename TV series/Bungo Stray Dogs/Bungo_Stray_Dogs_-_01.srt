00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,333
We're private... investigators.

162
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,000
Investigators?

163
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,416
[DOPPO] But we handle more than
lost pets and cheating spouses.

164
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,000
Our office has...
uniquely gifted investigators.

165
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,625
We're the Armed
Detective Agency.

166
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,208
[gasps]

167
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,708
[ATSUSHI] I've heard of
the Armed Detective Agency.

168
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,958
But I thought
those were stories...

169
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,791
Tales of an agency
specializing in cases

170
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,625
that can't be entrusted to
the police or the military...

171
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,291
An armed force
that straddled the natural

172
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,083
and supernatural worlds.

173
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,500
But there was even more,

174
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:48,375
I'd heard that many members
of this elite agency possess...

175
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,583
...supernatural powers...

176
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,958
Am I in the presence
of two super humans?

177
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,750
Huh?

178
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,041
Ahh!

179
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,416
Check out that support
beam up there!

180
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,916
Huh?

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,958
Don't even think about hanging
yourself in this teahouse!

182
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,916
I'm not. I'm thinking of the
"hanging health technique."

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,125
What are you talking about?

184
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,291
[OSAMU]
What?! You don't know?!

185
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,208
It's so good for
releasing muscle tension

186
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,375
and shoulder cramps!

187
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,125
[DOPPO] Whoa! That would
be perfect for me!

188
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,333
[OSAMU] It would,
you should write this down!

189
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:22,583
This effective technique is
the hanging health method...

190
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,083
I'm messing with you.

191
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,375
[ATSUSHI]
Are these two weirdos actually

192
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,875
with the Armed Detective Agency?

but it doesn't end there!

bill for an ungrateful kid

to stuff himself.

196
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,083
My schedule for
today was perfect,

197
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,791
but now I have to start
over from square one!

198
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,750
So, about the job you said
you're both working on...

199
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,708
What?!

200
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,583
[ATSUSHI]
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

201
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,000
I really shouldn't have asked!

202
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,500
Right, that was my mistake.

203
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,291
Of course your jobs
are classified!

204

Please forgive me
and don't hurt me!

205
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,750
Actually, since you
mentioned it,

206
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,500
today's job doesn't
require any secrecy.

207
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,333
It's for the government...

208
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,541
We're looking for a tiger.

209
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,750
A tiger?

210
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,125
[OSAMU]
Yes, a ferocious man-eater

211

who's recently
appeared in the city.

Well, not that we know for
sure it's devoured anyone,

213
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,708
but it's ransacked warehouses,
eaten farm animals,

214
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,416
and caused general chaos.

215
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,666
The authorities have received

216
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,708
all kinds of scary
reports about it.

What's wrong, Atsushi?

Not so fast.

Do you know something
you're not sharing with us?

223

[ATSUSHI]
Don't try.

224
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,375
There's no way you
can stop that animal!

00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,500
Really now?

Tell us what you
know about the tiger.

227

It's after me.

228
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,875
It almost killed me!

00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,041

I have to go, now!

or tell us everything.

[OSAMU]
Now, now, Kunikida.

236
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,000
Whenever you ask questions,

it quickly deteriorates
into an interrogation.

Okay, now what do you
know about this tiger?

That tiger kept attacking
my orphanage.

242
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:13,375
It ruined our vegetable garden.
It decimated our chicken coop

243

and emptied out
our food warehouse.

I mean no one died,

already on a tight budget.

have one less mouth to feed.

before the

But I've caught glimpses
of it many times since then.

come to the city hunting me.

saw the tiger stalking you?

and come here?

319
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,000
[OSAMU]
I know it will.

320
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,291
[gasps]

321
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,166
[OSAMU]
But don't worry.

322
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,958
When it shows up,
it'll be no match for me.

323
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:36,833
I may not look tough, but I'm
with the Agency for good reason.

324
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,000
I admire your confidence.

325
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,708
In fact I'm kind of jealous.

326
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,791
They called me a good-for-
nothing at the orphanage

327
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,208
as far back as I can remember.

328
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,625
And now, I don't even know
where I'll sleep tonight

329
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,166
or how I'll get
through tomorrow.

330
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,500
Get out, you good-for-nothing!

331
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,083
[ORPHANAGE MAN 2]
No matter how long you search,

332
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,958
you'll never find a
place where you belong!

333
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,000
[ATSUSHI] No one would mind
if I died in a ditch somewhere

334
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,541
or just disappeared forever.

335
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:07,666
Yeah, maybe I would be better
off getting eaten by a tiger...

336
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,083
Well, then...

337
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,500
I think it'll be soon.

338
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,083
[crashing]

339
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,625
What?!

340
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,750
I just heard
something back there.

341
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,041
[OSAMU]
Yes, me too.

342
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,083
[ATSUSHI]
It's probably the tiger, Dazai!

343
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,333
Not quite.

344
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,416
I think the wind just
knocked something down.

345
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,625
It's the man-eater!

346
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,875
It tracked me down to eat me!

347
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,708
[OSAMU]
Calm down, Atsushi.

348
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,500
Tigers don't suddenly
appear out of nowhere.

349
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,958
How do you know that for sure?!

350
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,333
[OSAMU] Because something's
not right with your story.

351
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,625
Huh?

352
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,500
[OSAMU] Just because
their finances went south,

353
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,875
why would an orphanage
banish a poor helpless child?

354
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,125
It's not in some
provencial farming village

355
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,666
from a bygone era.

356
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,250
Banishing one or
two mouths to feed

357
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,083
would hardly put
a dent in their deficit.

358
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,708
It'd make more sense to downsize

359
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:57,416
by transferring half of the
kids to a different orphanage.

360
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,500
[ATSUSHI]
I-I don't understand.

361
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,416
What are you
talking about, Dazai?

362
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,458
[OSAMU] Think about it: You came
to this city two weeks ago...

363
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,708
The tiger also
appeared in this city...

364
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,541
two weeks ago.

365
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,875
And you told us you were in the
Tsurumi ward just four days ago.

366
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,166
According to reports,

367
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,458
the tiger was also sighted
there four days ago.

368
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,625
Remember what Kunikida said?

369
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,416
The Armed Detective Agency
is comprised of individuals

370
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,875
with supernatural powers.

371
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,875
Though not a well-known fact,

372
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,166
quite a few people
possess supernatural abilities

373
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,791
in this world.

374
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,375
Some people use their abilities
to achieve great success,

375
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:44,708
while others fall into ruin,
unable control their powers.

376
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,000
[OSAMU] I'm guessing that
the orphanage staff knew

377
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,541
who the tiger was.

378
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,458
But out of fear,
they declined to enlighten you.

379
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,166
You were the only
one in the dark, Atsushi.

380
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,625
You see? You also
have supernatural powers.

381
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,791
In the moonlight,
you can transform

382
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,875
into a wild beast.

383
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,833
An impressive display.

384
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,291
You could snap a person's neck.

385
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,958
You could tear a man's
heart from his chest.

386
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,875
[OSAMU]
Hmm. Hmm...

387
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,875
Come to think of it, this isn't
a bad way to meet my doom...

388
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,083
...being eaten by a tiger...

389
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,708
But even all your
strength can't kill me.

390
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,541
My ability is...

391
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,791
...No Longer Human.

392
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,166
My power allows me to
reverse anyone else's power.

393
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,791
It works through a simple touch.

394
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,666
If you're flirting,
I'm not interested.

395
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,750
[DOPPO]
There you are, Dazai!

396
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:16,875
[OSAMU]
Hmm?

397
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,666
You are late, Kunikida.

398
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,708
I've captured our predator.

399
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,083
[DOPPO]
What do you mean?

400
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,416
It's the boy?

401
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,000
Yup, he can change
into a deadly tiger.

402
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,208
Ah... Jeez.

403
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,416
[OSAMU]
Hmm?

404
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,416
What was with this note, huh?

405
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,291
"The tiger will be in the
fifteenth district's warehouse.

406
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,083
Secure the perimeter
so that it can't escape."

407
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,125
My what a lovely
and concise note.

408
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,291
[DOPPO]
You left out the vital detail!

409
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,791
Next time, you better
tell me what's going on.

410
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,375
Thanks to you, I brought in
agents who weren't even on call.

411
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,291
First round's on you.

412
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,791
[KENJI]
Hey!

413
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,500
[AKIKO] Please don't tell me
there are no casualties?

414
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,500
Talk about boring.

415
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,500
[RAMPO] You've gotten better
at solving cases, Dazai.

416
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:06,208
But my logical skills
will solve the big ones.

417
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,541
[KENJI]
He's not dead.

418
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,750
What are we going to do
with him when he wakes up?

419
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,791
He didn't know he
could do this, did he?

420
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,333
Apparently, or so it seems.

421
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,916
Now what, Dazai?

422
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,750
He's been designated
a security threat.

423
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,958
Heh...

424
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:20,708
[DOPPO]
Hmm?

425
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:21,875
[AKIKO]
Hmm?

426
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,750
I've already made my decision.

427
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,541
[KENJI]
Hmm?

428
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,791
[ATSUSHI] They called
me a good-for-nothing

429
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,958
at the orphanage as
far back as I can remember.

430
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,375
And now, I don't even know
where I'll sleep tonight

431
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,250
or how I'll get
through tomorrow.

432
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,750
No one would mind if
I died in a ditch somewhere

433
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,208
or just disappeared forever.

434
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,583
Yeah, maybe I would be better
off getting eaten by a tiger...

435
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,166
We're going to
make him one of us.

436
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,041
Cool!

437
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,750
Seriously?

438
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,083
Dazai, you are an idiot.

439
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:05,041
Oh?! What gives you the
right to decide that, huh?

440
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,916
Up, Atsushi!

441
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,041
[OSAMU] Here, in a city
teeming with the supernatural...

442
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,208
in a detective agency
full of eccentrics...

443
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,166
A strange tale's
about to unfold.

444
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,541
This is only a sign
of things to come...

445
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,416
A premonition...

446
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,625
It starts now...

447
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,416
Hello?

448
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,875
[ATSUSHI grunts]

449
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,750
Who're you?

450
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,750
[OSAMU]
Atsushi...

451
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:39,708
Do you remember anything from
when you were transformed?

452
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,250
[ATSUSHI]
What are you talking about?

453
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,500
Oh!

454
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,958
Look at that, your right
hand didn't change back.

455
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,708
My right hand?

456
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,416
Whaaaaaaaat?!

457
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,958
What the--? What is this?

458
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,500
What the hell?! Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off of me!

459
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,916
Atsushi Nakajima!

460
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,333
[gasps]

461
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,833
From this day forward,
you're going be one of us.

462
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,208
[ATSUSHI]
Uh...

463
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,583
You're the new member of
the Armed Detective Agency.

464
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,666
[ATSUSHI]
Uh...

465
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,500
I'm what?

466
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,083
[ATSUSHI]
Ahh...

467
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,958
It's been a long time
since I've slept on a futon.

468
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,625
I feel reborn...

469
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,166
[DOPPO] Hey, kid,
hightail it over to the agency.

470
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,583
There's an emergency.

471
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,041
[ATSUSHI]
An emergency?

472
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,041
[DOPPO] A man's taken
a hostage in our office,

473
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,458
and he's got a bomb!

474
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:08,041
[ATSUSHI] I don't want to go,
that sounds dangerous.

475
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,291
That's all coming up next time,
