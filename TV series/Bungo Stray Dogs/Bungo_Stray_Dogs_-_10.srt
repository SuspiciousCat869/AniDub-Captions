1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,708
[DOPPO] Speed: 20 knots,
heading out to open sea.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,208
Don't you die on me, kid!

3
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,333
[CHUUYA grunts]

4
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:05,166
You call that a punch?!

5
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,375
That wasn't even a massage.
Your martial arts skills

6
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:11,458
are below average
for the Port Mafia.

7
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,000
It doesn't even
matter that I can't

8
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,875
use my ability against you.

9
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:20,250
Now get up. The party's
only just getting started!

10
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:24,916
Heh... You always were the best
with hand to hand combat.

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,750
Whoopsie daisy...

12
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,333
Thought my arm would
get destroyed there...

13
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,333
[CHUUYA] He blocked my strike
at the last second?

14
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,500
He must've predicted it.

15
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,458
[OSAMU] We've known each
other for a long time.

16
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:41,291
I'm very familiar with your
moves, pacing, and behavior.

17
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,958
That's what made me a
great partner... right?

18
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,416
[OSAMU]
He's fast!

19
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,333
Then I bet you saw this
coming too, didn't ya?!

20
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,291
Watch closely now!
This is how you punch!

21
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,583
[OSAMU grunts, coughs]

22
00:02:55,666 --> 00:03:00,208
Did you really think you could
predict all of my moves?

23
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:04,375
Before I kill you... why did
you let yourself get caught?

24
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,250
What the hell were
you waiting here for?

25
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,791
Ah. Not talking, huh?

26
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:15,291
All right... I'll just enjoy
torturing you a bit more.

27
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,791
The main reason...
was for Atsushi.

28
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,291
Atsushi?

29
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,333
[OSAMU] The weretiger
you're all obsessed with.

30
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,625
I wanted to know who
was responsible for putting

31
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,500
the seven billion
price tag on his head.

32
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,583
[CHUUYA] You put your own life
on the line just for that?

33
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,750
Heh. I'd like to say that's
a real feel-good story there,

34
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,000
but look where you ended up.

35
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,833
Seems even a genius like you,

36
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,833
the youngest executive in
Mafia history, can screw up.

37
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,958
I guess Lady Luck isn't
on your side today.

38
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,875
It just so happens I
caught you on the very day

39
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:52,375
I returned from putting out
fires in the West. Heh.

40
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,375
Lady Luck must be on my side.

41
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,583
[OSAMU]
Heh.

42
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,416
What's so funny?

43
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
[OSAMU]
You should probably know this.

44
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,875
Tomorrow... the five
execs are meeting.

45
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:06,000
Impossible. They only meet
to make decisions about

46
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,041
the future of the organization.
Critical decisions.

47
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,166
And that only happens
every few years.

48
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,666
If that was happening tomorrow,
I would know about it.

49
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,458
This particular meeting
is in regards to a letter

50
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,833
I sent them the other day.

51
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,125
Allow me to make a prediction.

52
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,083
You are not going
to kill me after all.

53
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,791
Not only that, you're going
to give me information before

54
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:32,041
leaving this room, about who's
paying the weretiger's bounty.

55
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,500
Plus, once you exit,

56
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,833
you'll prance and talk
like a little rich girl.

57
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,333
Huh?!

58
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:42,208
My predictions always come true.
But you already know that.

59
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,833
You think you can
wiggle out of this?

60
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:48,000
Your letter...
What did it say?

61
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,500
Would you like me
to recite it for you?

62
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,916
"Should Dazai fall...
all of your secrets

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,708
will finally be revealed
and brought to light."

64
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,416
You've gotta be bluffing!

65
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,208
[OSAMU]
So, yes, you've caught me,

66
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,375
a former executive
turned traitor.

67
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,666
But you have a problem.
If you kill me, a list of

68
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,041
all the organization's
transgressions will be released.

69
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,583
The public prosecutor?

70
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,375
He'll feel obliged to execute
all the Port Mafia leaders.

71
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,666
That's more than enough of a
threat to trigger a meeting.

72
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,208
[CHUUYA] You really think
you can push around

73
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,458
the Port Mafia with
a bunch of words?

74
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,666
The only execution...
will be yours!

75
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,541
[OSAMU]
Possibly.

76
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,833
But in the end, that'll be
the Council's decision.

77
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,375
If you kill me without
their permission, your action

78
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,708
will be considered unsanctioned
and therefore a betrayal.

79
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,666
You'll be discharged.
Or executed.

80
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,000
Even if I decided to go ahead
and kill you anyway, I have

81
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,625
a feeling that you'd actually
enjoy that, wouldn't you?

82
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,250
I think it's time
you made up your mind.

83
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,041
[CHUUYA groans]

84
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,458
Well then.
What do you say?

85
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:58,375
I'm waiting, Chuuya...

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,458
Really? Not doing it?

87
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,750
I was so hoping I'd be the
reason you were thrown out...

88
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,916
I'm a little disappointed.

89
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,458
Don't tell me...

90
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,416
The main reason...
was for Atsushi.

91
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,416
[CHUUYA] Dazai! Was your
second reason for coming here

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,833
to force me between
a rock and a hard place?!

93
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,416
[OSAMU chuckles]

94
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,000
By the way, just why
are you here?

95
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,208
To pay you back!

96
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,125
So this whole time,
you had set me up

97
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,500
so you'd have the last laugh.

98
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,375
[OSAMU] With a reunion
this long in the making,

99
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,958
I had to do something special.

100
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,916
Someday... I swear
that I'll see you killed!

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,625
By the way... you realize
you're the one

102
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,250
who broke my chains
and freed me, right?

103
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,791
If I were to run away
right now, I'm certain

104
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,041
you'd be suspected
of aiding my escape.

105
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,208
[CHUUYA]
Why, you!

106
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,291
If you do as I say,
I could make it look

107
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,458
like someone from the Agency
came and rescued me instead.

108
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,208
Why should I believe
a thing you say?!

109
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,333
I never lie in these
kinds of negotiations.

110
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,791
I think you know that.

111
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,500
Bastard...
What do you want, anyway?

112
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,208
[OSAMU]
I mentioned it earlier.

113
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,166
[CHUUYA] If it's
about the weretiger,

114
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,833
Akutagawa's leading that
operation. He should have

115
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,541
records in the comm storage
room on the second floor.

116
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,250
How interesting! I had a pretty
good hunch that was the case.

117
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,791
What?!

118
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,458
Oh, you're such an ass.

119
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,750
Just finish what you came for
and get outta here.

120
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,250
[OSAMU]
I duly appreciate it!

121
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,666
Just one last thing...

122
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,708
My dream is to commit suicide
with a beautiful woman,

123
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,458
so dying by your hands never
really interested me. I'm sorry.

124
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,708
[CHUUYA]
Okay...?

125
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,125
I'll let you know
when I find

126
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,500
a beautiful woman
willing to kill herself.

127
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,083
[OSAMU]
Chuuya!

128
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,541
You are...
such a wonderful human being!

129
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,208
[CHUUYA] Go to hell.
I was being sarcastic.

130
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,791
Listen to me carefully...

131
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,416
This isn't the end!

132
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,708
Next time, you won't
be so lucky!

133
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,166
[OSAMU]
No, you're doing it wrong!

134
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,875
Aren't you forgetting something?

135
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:04,916
[CHUUYA grunts]

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,500
[OSAMU]
Come on!

137
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:10,750
You know you're forgetting
something, Chuuya...

138
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,125
[CHUUYA growls]

139
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,416
Next time, you won't
be so lucky!

140
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,416
[CHUUYA] ...y-you won't...
be so lucky...

141
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,375
Jeez, you could at least laugh!

142
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,625
[ATSUSHI groans]

143
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,208
[ATSUSHI]
Hey...

144
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,750
Did you... come here
to rescue me?

145
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,916
[ATSUSHI yells]

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,083
[ATSUSHI grunts, groans]

147
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,666
[AKUTAGAWA]
I had struck to kill.

148
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,125
However, it seems your healing
powers are partially in effect.

149
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,541
[ATSUSHI]
Where am I? At sea?

150
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,625
[AKUTAGAWA] This ship is usually
used for smuggling weapons,

151
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,833
but today it's been
reserved just for you.

152
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,458
You should savor this voyage
before we hand you over.

153
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,083
It'll likely be your last.

154
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,041
[ATSUSHI] I can't win
in a fight against him.

155
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,500
I need to find an
opening and run.

156

It's a quagmire.
Desolate. Full of anguish.

Continue killing for the Port
Mafia, or perish by my hand.

to use Kyouka like that?

313
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,083
[AKUTAGAWA]
I didn't use her.

314
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:24,791
The sole purpose of her ability,
Demon Snow, is to kill.

315
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,458
Only by upholding
this responsibility

316
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,500
does Kyouka's existence
have any purpose.

317
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:35,625
I merely did my part in
giving her life meaning.

318
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,333
[ATSUSHI]
About that...

319
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,583
Whether someone is
worthy of being alive...

320
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,666
...isn't your decision!

321
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,916
[ATSUSHI] Why did you tell
her those horrible things?

322
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,916
She didn't need
to hear any of that.

323
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,583
People need to hear
that they're worthwhile

324
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,041
and that somebody
cares they're alive!

325
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,666
That's human decency!
What don't you get about that?!

326
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,208
[AKUTAGAWA]
He ripped it off!

327
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,166
And he's regenerating!

328
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,125
[ATSUSHI yells]

329
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,750
[AKUTAGAWA] I have to make sure
that I keep him at a distance.

330
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,291
Rashoumon!

331
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,000
Sawarabi!

332
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,041
[ATSUSHI groans]

333
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,958
Akutagawa!

334
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,583
[AKUTAGAWA chuckles]

335
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,541
Rashoumon!

336
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,166
Goku Mon Agito!

337
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,333
[AKUTAGAWA]
Just die already.

338
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,291
[AKUTAGAWA gasps]

339
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,583
[AKUTAGAWA]
He used his tail...?!

340
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,708
[AKUTAGAWA]
Devoured Space!

341
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:57,458
[ATSUSHI yells]

342
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:07,166
My new apprentice is superior
to you in every way imaginable.

343
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,916
[ATSUSHI yells]

344
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,750
[KYOUKA grunts]

345
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,666
[KYOUKA gasps]

346
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,166
[DOPPO]
Hmph. You big idiot...

347
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,666
[DOPPO]
Well done, kid.

348
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,125
[OSAMU]
Let's see here...

349
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:12,375
Who in the world wants to spend
seven billion on a tiger?

350
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:16,250
I should know
right about... now.

351
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,583
[OSAMU gasps]

352
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,250
Is it really them?

353
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:25,583
[bell peals]

354
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,125
[FITZGERALD]
They're late.

355
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,958
The bounty approach
seems to have failed.

356
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:41,166
Those Mafia types
sure are a mediocre lot.

357
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,458
It's a small setback, though.

358
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,875
The Promised Land will
soon belong to The Guild.

359
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,000
[DOPPO] We have a challenging
assignment that even

360
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:23,875
the local police passed on.
I'm counting on you, Atsushi.

361
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,833
[ATSUSHI]
Right! I'll do my best!

362
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:29,833
[DOPPO] What's that? Kenji was
assigned to help him out?

363
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,583
[ATSUSHI]
That's amazing, Kenji!

364
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,833
You've already
found a lead for us!

365
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:35,875
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs</i> ,

366
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:40,083
episode 11: "First, an
Unsuitable Profession for Her.

367
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,708
Second, an Ecstatic
Detective Agency."

368
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:46,333
[DOPPO] This has to be
the best and worst team ever.
