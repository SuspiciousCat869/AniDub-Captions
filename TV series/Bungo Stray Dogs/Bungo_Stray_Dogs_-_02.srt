1
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:14,208
[ATSUSHI] I haven't smelled
tatami mats... in a long time.

2
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,166
Hmm... Huh?

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,750
Where am I?

4
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,291
What happened last night?

5
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:32,041
Uhn... Was it... a dream?

6
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,833
Do you remember anything
from when you were transformed?

7
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,375
[ATSUSHI]
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:41,041
Oh! Look at that, your right
hand didn't change back.

9
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,791
My right hand?

10
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,916
[gasps]

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,625
[pants]

12
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,125
[sighs]

13
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:07,291
[ATSUSHI] Sleeping under
a roof feels... so good.

14
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:09,833
[cellphone ringing]

15
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,166
W-What? What? What?!

16
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,250
Huh? Uhh... Okay,
I'll get it. I'm coming!

17
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,541
Coming! Coming! Coming!

18
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:18,791
I'm doing it!
Right this second!

19
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,333
Which button am I supposed
to push? This one?

20
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:24,041
Uh, no, no, no. Uh, this one?
Nope! C'mon! Yes! H-Hello?!

21
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,125
And good morning to you!

22
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,875
[ATSUSHI]
Oh... Hi, Dazai.

23
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:31,041
It's another beautiful day!

24
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,458
What do you think of
your new accommodations?

25
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,875
They're great, thanks.

26
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,458
I mean, compared
to sleeping outside,

27
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,333
this place is like heaven to me.

28
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,208
I'm happy to hear that.

29
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,125
The change of clothes
at your pillow is a gift

30
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,375
from everyone at the agency.

31
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,791
Oh, wow!

32
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,625
Thank you so much for
everything you've done for me.

33
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:52,083
By the way, Atsushi,
I apologize for asking, but...

34
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,083
...I need help with a teensy
weensy emergency.

35
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,291
[ATSUSHI]
Emergency?

36
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,208
[OSAMU]
Yes, and it's quite urgent.

37
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,708
I'll give you the
specific location,

38
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,958
and I need you to meet
me there immediately.

39
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,291
This is a crisis, and you're
the only one who can help!

40
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,125
Understand?

41
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,416
O-Okay, I understand.

42
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:39,833
[OSAMU]
Listen carefully.

43
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,250
Are you ready, Atsushi?

44
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,500
Yes!

45
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,958
[OSAMU]
First, when you leave the room,

46
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,958
make sure you close
and lock the door.

47
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,375
Then look behind you!

48
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,750
Behind me...? Uh?!

49
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,875
[ATSUSHI]
Uh... What are you doing?

50
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,291
[OSAMU]
What do you think?

51
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,916
[ATSUSHI] I think I'm
hallucinating this whole thing?

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,500
[OSAMU]
Wrong! Guess again!

53
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,166
An attack from a
dangerous suspect?

54
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,000
Or did you get caught in a trap?

55
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,166
[OSAMU]
I got in myself.

56
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,333
Huh?!

57
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,750
[OSAMU]
Well, you see...

58
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,000
I read about this fascinating
way to commit suicide

59
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:19,375
by getting stuck in an oil drum,
so I decided to give it a shot.

60
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,208
Securing the feet is key...

61
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:25,250
But now that I've managed to do
that, I'm really just suffering.

62
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,333
I've wedged myself
in pretty deep,

63
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,166
and I can't get out on my own.

64
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,291
I might die.

65
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,625
I see...

66
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,750
So this is a way
to commit suicide.

67
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,666
You chose to do it, and
you think that it's working.

68
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,375
I don't see what the problem is.

69
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,416
I like the idea of suicide,

70
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,000
but I'm not all interested
in pain and suffering.

71
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,583
Who wants that?!

72
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,791
All right...

73
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,333
[sighs]

74
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,958
There.

75
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,291
My name is Atsushi Nakajima.

76
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,583
[ATSUSHI] Just last night,
I turned into a wild tiger

77
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,166
and went on a
destructive rampage.

78
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,041
This man, Osamu Dazai,
brought me back to normal.

79
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,875
[groans]

80
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,125
[ATSUSHI] Dazai has a special
power, and he's not alone.

81
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,000
He works with a team
of people endowed

82
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,250
with supernatural gifts in
the Armed Detective Agency.

83
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,875
[OSAMU]
Atsushi Nakajima!

84
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,250
[ATSUSHI gasps]

85
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:28,666
From this day forward,
you're going be one of us.

86
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,166
You're the new member of
the Armed Detective Agency.

87
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,000
[OSAMU sighs]
That was painful.

88
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,125
I owe you a favor, Atsushi.

89
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,583
Without your ingenious help,

90
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,125
I would've eventually
snapped in two at the waist.

91
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,458
Such agony.

92
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,375
Why didn't you call
your coworkers?

93
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,083
Couldn't they've helped
you get out of the barrel?

94
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,875
Oh, I called them, all right.

95
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,000
I told them I was
at death's door.

96
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,958
They didn't understand
my predicament.

97
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,708
They were all like,
"Well, congratulations!

98
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,208
You're finally doing it!" 

99
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,625
[ATSUSHI]
Supportive friends.

100
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,000
Heh heh heh...

101
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,625
[OSAMU]
Jeez.

102
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,500
Anyone gifted
with supernatural powers

103
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,166
isn't totally right in the head.

104
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,125
[ATSUSHI]
"Gifted"... Hmm...

105
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,708
Dazai.

106
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,125
[OSAMU]
Hm?

107
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,541
[ATSUSHI] Everyone at the
Armed Detective Agency...

108
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,291
I mean, the private
investigators...

109
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,416
They're all gifted
with powers, right?

110
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,041
[OSAMU] Right, we're an
armed force taking on enemies

111
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,750
the police don't stand
a chance against.

112
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,750
[ATSUSHI] Then I don't stand
a chance at joining the agency.

113
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,166
[OSAMU]
What are you talking about?

114
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,375
You're plenty gifted.

115
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,500
[ATSUSHI] It's true that
I have the supernatural ability

116
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,625
to turn into a tiger.

117
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,875
But what good is it

118
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,458
if I have absolutely no
control over my power?

119
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,916
I'm not even aware of it
once I start to transform.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,625
And I can't will myself
to change into a wild tiger.

121
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,791
So I don't understand
how I'd be of any use,

122
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,458
even if I could join.

123
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,791
I really appreciate
the offer, though.

124
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,500
I am sorry.

125
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,416
[OSAMU]
Very well.

126
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,833
What's your plan, then?

127
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,083
I've decided I'll look

128
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,916
for a low-skilled,
low-wage job I can handle.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,875
I'm just a little afraid it
won't be very easy to find.

130
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,875
[OSAMU] I think I may know
of the perfect job for you.

131
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,208
Huh?

132
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,833
I might even be able
to help you get it.

133
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,333
Seriously?

134
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,208
[ATSUSHI]
Thank you so much!

135
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,041
We'll meet with the supervisor.

136
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,125
He'll give you all the
details about the work,

137
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,416
your co-workers,
and the organization.

138
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,958
I've got a good
feeling about this.

139
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,333
He'll love you.

140
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,125
What's the job title?

141
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,708
[OSAMU]
No point spoiling the fun.

142
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,250
But just so you know,
there may be a test of sorts.

143
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,041
Eh?! A test?

144
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,250
Atsushi, can you read and write?

145
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,416
I can!

146
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,541
They taught me at
the orphanage school.

147
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,625
Great. Then you'll be perfect.

148
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,333
Whew!

149
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,875
[OSAMU] Yes, you'll be
just fine at this place.

150
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,750
I guarantee it.

151
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,833
Thank you so much.

152
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,291
[OSAMU laughs]
You'd better thank me...

153
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,625
Just leave it to me,
and everything will be fine!

154
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,125
Don't you worry!

155
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,375
After all, I am Dazai...

156
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,250
The most trusted member of
the Armed Detective Agency,

157
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,916
and a true hero to
adoring fans everywhere.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,458
I've been looking
everywhere for you, Dazai!

159
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,583
You bandage-squandering machine!

160
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,000
Ohh!!

161
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,041
Oh, you Kunikida.

162
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,208
Why couldn't you come up
with a better nickname?

163
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,708
Because you're delusional!

164
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,791
You think you're "the most
trusted member" of the agency?

165
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,750
You get more complaints
than anyone else!

166
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,083
People curse you
out on a regular basis!

167
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,833
Really?

168
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,625
What? No way.

169
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,208
Since when did <i>I</i>
ever get a complaint?!

170
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,625
[DOPPO] Here was a call
we received in August:

171
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,708
"A so-called employee
of yours has been caught

172
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,250
in our offshore fishing net.

173
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,625
Can you come retrieve him?"

174
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,541
Here is a call from September:

175
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,416
"Some weirdo's got
himself buried on my farm.

176
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,416
Could he be one of yours?"

177
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,541
[OSAMU]
Th-Th-Th-Th...

178
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,125
[DOPPO] "That skinny rat
needs to pay his tab, okay?!

179
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,333
All six months worth!"

180
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,916
I'm flabbergasted...

181
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,083
Who knew you were so
skilled at doing impressions

182
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,541
of other people?!

183
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,666
[growls]

184
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,750
You worthless cad!
Stop ridiculing me.

185
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,958
I'm gonna shake you silly!

186
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,375
I'm starting to have
second thoughts

187
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,916
about accepting his help.

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,625
Maybe I should look
for a job on my own.

189
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,833
[DOPPO]
Oh, right!

190
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,041
Huh?

191
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,291
I just lost a whole
minute with this idiot.

192
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,416
He's got a knack
for wasting my time.

193
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,041
We've gotta get to the agency!

194
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,083
We do?

195
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,666
We have an emergency!

196
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,125
A man has taken a hostage and
threatened to blow up our office

197
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,208
Huh...?

198
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,083
A mad bomber?

199
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,125
[ATSUSHI]
Uh...

200
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,791
[DOPPO]
What? What's your question?

201
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,666
The agency's
on the fourth floor.

202
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,416
[ATSUSHI] Eh, no, I wasn't
thinking about that.

203
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,583
It was more, well--

204
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,375
[OSAMU] Let's take
the stairs to be safe.

[ATSUSHI]
E-Excuse me, but I--

--[DOPPO] Quiet!
--[ATSUSHI] Oh, sorry.

207
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,708
[OSAMU]
Atsushi, it's show time.

208
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:46,958
[ATSUSHI]
It is?

209
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,583
[JUNICHIROU]
I can't...

210
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,208
I can't take it anymore...

211
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,250
It's all <i>your</i> fault...

212
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:57,166
The awful Armed Detective
Agency's fault!

213
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,541
Now, where's the president?

214
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,291
Bring me the president!
If you don't.

215
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,166
I'll blow everyone in
this place to kingdom come.

216
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,500
[NAOMI screams]

217
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,666
[OSAMU] Sounds like this
guy has a personal grudge.

218
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,000
That's inconvenient.

219
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,375
[DOPPO]
Agreed.

220
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,625
[ATSUSHI]
Why'd you bring me here again?

221
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,791
Based on what he's saying,

222
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,416
the bomber seems
furious at the agency.

223
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,458
Honestly, I don't think
I can help you.

224
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,750
May I go now?

225
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,083
[OSAMU]
Because of the work we do,

226
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,166
we attract a lot of ill will.

227
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,625
[ATSUSHI]
Did you hear what I said?

228
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,583
[OSAMU] That is a military
grade, high-level explosive.

229
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,375
If the bomber acts on
his threat and detonates it,

230
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,708
It'll kill us and
destroy the whole floor.

231
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,958
Oh no.

232
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,458
We may be able to reduce
the force of the blast

233
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,041
<i>if</i> we can find
something to cover

234
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,125
the bomb before it detonates.

235
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,458
[boom]

236
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,625
But given the circumstances...

237
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,333
Since he took her hostage,
he's not only mad, he's cruel.

238
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,875
Do you know who she is?

239
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,166
[OSAMU]
Her name is Naomi.

240
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,250
She's a part-time
office assistant.

241
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,000
[ATSUSHI]
She's not an agent?

242
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,708
Then she's just an innocent
victim in this terrible mess!

243
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,291
So what do we do?

244
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,791
He wants to see the president.

245
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,041
Bring him here.

246
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,916
Are you insane?
He'll try to kill the president!

247
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,416
We can't let the boss walk
into a bad situation like this!

248
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,458
Plus, he's off
on a business trip.

249
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,875
Right, I forgot.

250
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,000
Then there's only one option...

251
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,250
[ATSUSHI] Are they going
to use their powers?

252
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,875
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?

253
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,625
[laughs]

254
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,791
Nah-nah-n'nah-nah.

255
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,791
[DOPPO]
Hey.

256
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,083
Easy does it, kid.

257
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,041
Stay away! I only want
to see the president!

258
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,291
Don't you try anything funny,
or I'll blow this place to bits!

259
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay.

260
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,541
[JUNICHIROU]
I know who you are.

261
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,083
You're Kunikida!

262
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,750
You want me to lower my guard

263
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,916
so you can use that annoying
ability of yours to stop me!

264
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,041
Well that sure ain't happening.

265
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,458
Lay down on that desk
on your hands and knees

266
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,375
and keep both feet
above your head!

267
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,208
[DOPPO]
Huh?

268
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,125
You'll do exactly as I say,

269
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,958
or I'm taking everyone
here down with me!

270
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,083
Fine.

271
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,791
This is bad.

272
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,375
Because of his personal
grudge against the Agency,

273
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:14,000
he's done his research on all
the members names and faces.

274
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,291
If I go out there
and try to talk to him,

275
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,750
it'll only make him more angry.

276
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:23,125
Oh my...
Whatever shall we do now?

277
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,750
[ATSUSHI] Uh-oh. I just
got a really bad feeling...

278
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,125
A-tsu-shi can...

279
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,583
[ATSUSHI]
Absolutely not.

280
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,458
I haven't even
said anything, yet.

281
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,750
I already know
what you're gonna ask.

282
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,791
[OSAMU]
Listen to me, Atsushi...

283
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,500
You're the only option.

284
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,666
You're not a formal member,

285
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,666
and the bomber doesn't
know you at all.

286
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,875
You're right.

287
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,916
But if I go, I won't be
able to do anything.

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,833
[OSAMU]
You'll be fine.

289
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,666
We just need you to
distract him for a little while.

290
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,875
Try talking to him.

291
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,958
We'll take care
of everything else.

292
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,875
Let me think here...

00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,541
Ah! How about you put on
an act? Make it depressing--

294
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,875
like you think you're a
real worthless human being.

295
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,416
I know you can do it. Right?

296
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,375
Here are some props.

297
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,583
[OSAMU]
Trust me.

298
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,708
Scuffles on this
scale are child's play

299
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,791
compared to what we
normally deal with...

300
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,208
You can handle this, Atsushi.

301
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,583
[ATSUSHI]
D-D-D-Don't do it!

302
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,125
Huh?!!

[ATSUSHI] Wh-Wh-Wh-What are
you hoping to get out of this?

304
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,500
I... I bet this would make
your parents really sad!

305
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,041
Who the hell are you?!

306
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,916
I'm sorry!

307
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,125
I don't know who you are.

308
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,666
You're not with the agency.

309
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,583
[ATSUSHI] Uh!
I-I-I'm a newspaper boy.

310
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,750
I was just paaing by
as I was on my route.

311
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,416
Why the hell would you
get involved in this situation?

312
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,416
Because what you're
doing isn't right.

313
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
No matter how you feel

314
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,500
you shouldn't
threaten to kill people.

315
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,000
Think about the wonderful
things worth living for.

316
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah, like what?

317
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,208

What's something to live for?!

319
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,458
Y-Y-Yummy tea on rice!

320
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,416
Tea on rice is a reason to live!

321
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,875
[JUNICHIROU]
Hmm?

322
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,625
Oh, and sleeping somewhere
with a roof over your head!

323
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,375
Waking up under a roof is great.

324
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,333
And when you open your eyes,
every day is a new day...

325
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,125
But...

326
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,541
If you push that button,

327
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,541
neither of us will ever
see another new day...

328
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,375
...and that's because
we'll be dead.

329
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,875
I understand the concept.

330
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,708
Wait!! Seeee...

331
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,666
I really don't think
you've thought about this

332
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,416
from all the angles.

333
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,083
I mean, if you die,

334
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,666
you're really dead!

335
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,666
I'm sure you wish you
were dead sometimes,

336
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,583
but there are many people
who keep on living,

337
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,916
even though their lives
are completely awful.

338
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,041
Oh, people like me!

339
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,666
I don't have any family,
and no friends either!

340
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,666
I even got chased out
of an orphanage.

341
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,500
I have nowhere to go,
and no hope for the future...

342
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,708
What's worse,
I turn into a wild tiger.

343
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,416
Yeah, you heard me right!

344
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,416
In fact, it might be true that
I lack redeeming qualities,

345
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,333
and everyone agrees I'm
a useless member of society.

346
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:10,000
But I'm still alive and
I haven't gone psycho!

347
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,958
[OSAMU]
Doing great, Atsushi.

348
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,500
It's almost like
this performance

349
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,375
isn't just an act for you.

350
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,791
Now why don't you put
down that bomb detonator...

351
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,375
...and we can look
for jobs together, okay?

352
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,625
No, thanks.

353
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm not exactly looking
for work these days...

354
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,500
Now, Kunikida!

Okay, everyone.

363

One man down. Well done.

Are you're kidding me?!

[OSAMU]
Huh?

369
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,333
Fine, so it was just one guy,

370
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,125
but I had to do all
the hard physical work.

Unlike you.
You're all talk and no action.

Oh, now you're being ridiculous.

00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,541
That was my only option.

374
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,416
After all, you lost
at rock-paper-scissors.

ends well, teammate.

still in one piece.

But speaking of your health,
I've been meaning to tell you...

380
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,041
I heard that
if you're too neurotic,

381
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,791
your aging becomes accelerated.

382

Really, is that true?

with a capable young man.

[OSAMU]
You did well.

451
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,875
I brought up the idea
that the Agency hire you,

452
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,166
but since you've been
designated a major threat

453
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,708
throughout the ward,

454
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:18,625
there was disagreement as to
whether we should take you in.

455
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:22,458
Then Dazai asked me a question.

456
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,625
[OSAMU]
President.

457
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,583
What if the most gifted
person in the world came

458
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,000
into your office, wanting to
work here, would you hire them?

459
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,833
[YUKICHI]
Power alone doesn't make one fit

460
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,875
to be a member of the agency.

461
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,458
[OSAMU]
Mmm...

462
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,708
That's exactly why
I'm recommending him.

463
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:44,291
With that in mind, are you
ready to make your decision?

464
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,708
Ah...

465
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,041
[YUKICHI]
I'll let Dazai decide.

466
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,500

You can trust me, sir.

me about this morning was...

too violent for me,

00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,166
to protect the rest of us.

480
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,125
That takes a special
kind of person.

481
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,166
You know he's right.

482
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,583
I can't believe how
brave you were!

483
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,291
You'll do fine working here.

484
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,291
Will I...?

485
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,666
Have you reached
a decision, sir?

486
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,250
Do you think the young man
preformed competently enough

487
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,750
to join the agency?

488
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,500
[KIRAKO] Oh, a tea leaf's
standing straight up...

489
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,625
I think that's a very
good omen, President.

490
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,541
[YUKICHI]
Too hot!

491
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,625
[OSAMU]
Now, obviously,...

492
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,666
...we can't force you to join.

493
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,333
But if you don't, there
are a lot of considerations

494
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,625
that cause me to
worry for your future.

495
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,958
You'll have to vacate

496
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,416
your present Agency-owned
living accommodations.

497
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,750
You don't really have
any specialized skills,

498
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:13,833
nor do you have friends

499
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,083
or any personal
contacts in the city...

500
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,625
That will make finding
a job very difficult.

501
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,000
And let's not forget,

502
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,916
you are a wanted tiger
with a bounty on your head.

503
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,666
Should anyone discover
of that personal detail,

504
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,166
you'd get fired...

505
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,541
Or worst, you'd be captured,
tied up and maybe shot dead.

506
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,208
[ATSUSHI]
Sh-Shot dead?

507
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,458
But if you were with the Agency,

508
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,500
it would be a
much happier story...

509
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,000
So I'm stuck here?

510
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,083
Welcome aboard!

511
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,958
We're excited to
work with you, Atsushi.

512
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,500
Right, sweet brother?

513
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,208
Remember to follow
the rules, rookie.

514
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,458
Well, I'm glad it's settled...

515
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,916
Oh, brother.

516
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,916
[ICHIYOU]
The weretiger has been located.

517
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,500
[ATSUSHI]
So Dazai, tell me,

518
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,083
what did you do before
you entered the Agency?

519
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,625
[OSAMU]
Take a guess.

520
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:57,000
If you get it right, I'll give
you a prize of 700,000 yen.

521
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,625
[ATSUSHI]
700,000?!

522
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,416
[OSAMU] Meanwhile, we have
a guest at the Agency office.

523
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,166
It looks like there's
been another incident.

524
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,750
[ATSUSHI]
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs</i> ,

525
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:10,625
episode 3: "Yokohama
Gangster Paradise."

526
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,125
[OSAMU]
Think about it.

527
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:15,541
I could have been a manga artist
or even an anime producer!
