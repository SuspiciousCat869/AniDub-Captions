00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,416
[banging sound]

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,625
[JUNICHIROU]
I... I... I'm really sorry!

3
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:23,916
Eh...?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
[JUNICHIROU]
I know it was for a test,

5
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:28,000
but I was still
really rude to you.

6
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,958
I'm sort of an assistant
here at the agency.

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,875
My name's Junichirou Tanizaki.

8
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,541
Can you ever forgive me?

9
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,625
It's fine.

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,500
Don't worry about it!

11
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,666
[ATSUSHI] He seems like
a nice enough person.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,750
And this here is--

13
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,750
His little sister, Naomi!

14
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:46,500
You... You two are
brother and sister?

15
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,458
For some reason I thought you
had a different relationship.

16
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,791
Oh? You think I'm lying?

17
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,958
There's absolutely no doubt that
we're related to each other.

18
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,666
None at all.

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,416
The two of us are more
similar than you'd think.

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,083
Right, big brother?

21
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,750
[giggles]

22
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,708
[ATSUSHI]
Uh, hang on...

23
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,750
You'll leave this subject alone
if you know what's good for you.

24
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,875
Uh... 'kay.

25
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,333
Listen closely, kid.

26
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,833
Now that you have
joined our ranks,

27
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,625
you should try
to act accordingly.

28
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,291
Unlike some people
here I could mention!

29
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,458
I work to uphold the
Agency's good name.

30
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:21,708
[ATSUSHI]
Hmm?

31
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,458
We are committed to that goal.

32
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,750
Well, at least some of us are.

33
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,291
Right... Dazai?

34
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,166
[OSAMU]
Would you strangle me

35
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,583
with these beautiful,
delicate fingers, young miss?

36
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:34,166
[DOPPO] Were you listening
to a single word I just said?!

37
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,250
My hands might
not be as nice as hers,

38
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,041
but if you're looking for
someone to break your neck,

39
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,833
I think that honor
should go to me!!

40
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:40,750
Wouldn't you say?!

41
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,791
I was wondering:

42
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,833
What were the two of you doing
before you joined the Agency?

43
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,416
[OSAMU, DOPPO]
Mm?!

44
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,250
Eh... No big deal,
was just curious is all.

45
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,500
[OSAMU]
Take a guess.

46
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,375
Huh?

47
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:53,958
It's a game.

48
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,083
We've played it
a lot here, actually.

49
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:59,083
The newcomer tries to guess his
colleagues' former occupations.

50
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,375
Think of it as part of training
to be a private investigator.

51
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,125
[ATSUSHI]
Hmmm...

52
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:08,333
I wanna say Junichirou
and Naomi were students?

53
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:11,166
Whoa, you got it. Nice one!

54
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,166
How did you figure that one out?

55
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,791
I was told you work
at the Agency part-time,

56
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,666
and you're wearing a uniform,

57
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,083
so there was a good chance
you were still in school.

58
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,166
Plus, Junichirou and I
seem to be similar in age.

59
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,333
Just made sense!

60
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,291
Not half bad, Atsushi.

61
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,458
What about Mr. Kunikida?

62
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,291
Nobody cares about what
I used to be, all right?!

63
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,000
[ATSUSHI]
Hmmm...

64
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,041
An official?
Did he hold a government job?

65
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,833
Almost! He was a public
school teacher,

66
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,208
and he taught
mathematics to be exact.

67
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,583
Hmm...

68
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,333
For the last time,

69
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,041
you have to use the law
of exponents in this one!

70
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,791
I can totally picture
that, actually...

71
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,291
It was another life.

72
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,125
I don't even wanna
think about it.

73
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,583
What about me then?

74
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:54,916
[ATSUSHI]
What did you do?

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,833
Yep.

76
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:56,916
My job.

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,958
[ATSUSHI]
Hmmmm...

78
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:04,000
Mr. Dazai... Mr Dazai...

79
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,208
I have no idea.

80
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,958
Not a single clue.

81
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,750
Don't even bother.

82
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,458
His former profession
is a mystery to all of us.

83
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,333
Nobody here has guessed it.

84
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,458
The person who finally figures
it out collects an award,

85
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,916
isn't that right?

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,625
[ATSUSHI]
A reward?!!!

87
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,625
Yeah, that's true.

88
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,416
And because no one's guessed
right, it's just skyrocketed.

89
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,375
[ATSUSHI]
The reward...

90
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,666
...has skyrocketed?!

91
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,708
S-So, just out of curiosity,

92
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,208
how much is this
reward right now?

93
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,083
Seven hundred thousand yen.

94
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,125
[ATSUSHI]
Seven... hundred... grand?!

95
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,208
[ATSUSHI] So if I guess
correctly, then it's mine?

96
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,708
This isn't just some
kind of prank?

97
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,916
A suicide advocate
keeps his promises.

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,708
I gotta say,
he looks really fired up.

99
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,541
There's no way
he'll ever guess it.

100
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,000
That reward... will be mine!

101
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:55,875
Stockbroker?

102
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:56,583
No.

103
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,083
[ATSUSHI]
Writer?

104
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:57,875
Uh-uh!

105
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:58,375
[ATSUSHI]
Office worker?

106
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,375
Incorrect.

107
00:03:59,458 --> 00:03:59,958
[ATSUSHI]
Researcher!

108
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:00,625
Wrong.

109
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,375
[ATSUSHI]
Lawyer?

110
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,166
Noooope.

111
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,166
[ATSUSHI]
Journalist?

112
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,166
[ATSUSHI]
Carpenter!

113
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,166
Try again!

114
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,166
[ATSUSHI]
Fortuneteller!

115
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,083
[OSAMU]
Nah.

116
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:07,916
[ATSUSHI]
Pilot!

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,791
[OSAMU]
Wrong again.

118
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,791
Is he even close?

119
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,625
No idea...

120
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,833
[ATSUSHI]
Shinto priest!

121
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:14,750
[OSAMU]
Blasphemous!

122
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,750
[ATSUSHI]
Model!

123
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:16,875
[OSAMU]
No! Buuuut...

124
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,583
[giggles]

125
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,625
That's very flattering...

126
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,333
I bet you were just wandering
around doing nothing at all.

127
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,416
[OSAMU]
Not true.

128
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,375
I would never lie about
something like this.

129
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,833
[ATSUSHI]
Hm?

130
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,041
[OSAMU]
You've given up, right?

131
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,875
Eh?

132
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,791
Then... you can be the
one to pay the bill tonight!

133
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,291
[ATSUSHI]
Awww...

134
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,250
It's our Agency's
favorite restaurant,

135
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,041
so you can always
start a tab with them

136
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,291
if you don't have
enough money on you.

137
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,750
Hi, this is Junichirou.

138
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,166
Yeah, okay.

139
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,083
Got it.

140
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,250
Is it a job?

141
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,166
[JUNICHIROU]
Yeah.

142
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,291
The client's already waiting
for us back at the agency.

143
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,625
Well, let's get to work then.

144
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,125
Let's save the guessing
game for another time.

145
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,750
I assume that's
all right with you.

146
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,875
[JUNICHIROU]
Now then...

147
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,166
You mentioned wanting
to request an investigation,

148
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,250
but what manner of investigation
are we speaking of here?

149
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,916
[OSAMU]
So beautiful...

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,291
You remind me
of a lotus blossom.

151
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,958
All at once
elegant and ephemeral.

152
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,166
Would you care to
join me in a double sui--?

153
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,708
[ICHIYOU]
Huh?

154
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,541
[sighs]

155
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,333
[DOPPO] Allow me to
apologize for the distraction.

156
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,583
Please continue on.
I'll take care of this.

157
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,291
[DOPPO]
The hell is wrong with you?

158
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,208
Please let me expand
a little on my request.

159
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,208
Oh! Of course!

160
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,750
[ATSUSHI] Wow, she's acting as
if this is all perfectly normal!

161
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,208
You see, there's recently been

162
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,083
a group of seedy
looking individuals

163
