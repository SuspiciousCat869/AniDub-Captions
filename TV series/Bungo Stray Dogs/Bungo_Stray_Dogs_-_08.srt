for someone or something?

[GREY SUIT]
I'm pretty sure this is where

00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,083
I saw her yesterday too.

8
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,166
It's like she hasn't even moved!

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,750
Maybe she's
actually a mannequin.

[DOPPO]
You can't track down Dazai?

18
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,791
He's not returning
any of my calls,

19
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,625
and I can't find
him at home either.

20
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,791
He's probably floating
down some river again.

21
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,458
Maybe he got
himself thrown in jail.

22
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,625
[RAMPO] My guess is
he's off with a woman.

23
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,000
But...

24
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,291
...what if he's been
attacked by the Port Mafia...?

25

Aren't you worried?

26
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,000
That man's ability
to avoid death

27
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,375
approaches nightmarish
proficiency.

28
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,708
Even after all
those suicide attempts,

29
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,291
he's still as lively as ever.

30
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,916
[RAMPO]
Ha! I doubt even the Mafia

31

could get the better of him.

Yeah, but still...

[ATSUSHI] Junichirou,
are you feeling better now?

I am, thankfully.

36
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,208
[ATSUSHI] I didn't know what
to do when everything happened,

00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,291
I'm so glad you're all right.

Sorry, if I worried you.

[DOPPO] Good to see
you back on your feet.

It's all thanks to
Dr. Yosano's treatment.

Of course...

42
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,958
How many times?

43
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,541
F-F-Four times...

44
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,458
That's a lot...

Atsushi...

46
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,458
As long as you're
here at the Agency,

47
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,125
make sure you never
get injured, okay?

No, I'm... I'm fine, actually.

Option one, turn yourself in.

as you can and escape.

form of science"?

323
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,458
What a load!

324
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,375
I will kill anyone who
does not venerate life!

325
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,458
Wait...

326
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,583
I remember now...

327
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,041
You must be the
Agency's physician...

328
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,208
You're Akiko Yosano, aren't you?

329
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,666
My special ability is called
"Thou Shalt Not Die."

330
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,250
It's able to heal
any type of injury.

331
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,958
This includes my own
wounds, as you can see.

332
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,958
The conditions,
however, are unpleasant.

333
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,083
It only works
when the injury is fatal.

334
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,416
So terribly inconvenient.

335
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,083
In order to cure
moderate injuries,

336
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,041
I need to bring my patients
to the brink of death.

337

[MOTOJIROU whimpers]

338
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:18,125
Myyyy... you're hurt,
aren't you, little boy?

339
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,416
Would you like me to treat you?

340

[MOTOJIROU wails]

341

[ATSUSHI]
This is...

342
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,500
[ATSUSHI]
It's over.

343
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,125
My name is Kyouka Izumi.

344
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:59,708
I've killed 35 people.

345
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,333
Where can I find the bomb?

346
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:05,208
My latest victims included
an entire family of three:

347
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,125
A father, a mother,
and their little boy...

348
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,083
Their throats were
slit by Demon Snow.

349
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,666
Why would you do this?

350
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,791
What are you?!

351
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,958
Your words sound so empty...

352
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,791
It's like there's
nothing inside you.

353
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,333
No emotions at all.

354
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,750
You're like a killing machine.

355
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,791
If you feel anything
right now, then tell me.

356
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,875
'Cause I really don't
understand what's going on.

357
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,458
Please tell me that you
don't actually want to do this!

358
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,125
This is the conductor.

359
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,458
Atsushi... you still alive?

360
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,333
Dr. Yosano!

361
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,041
[AKIKO] According to this
sorry sack of meat here,

362
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,583
that bomb has a
remote detonator.

363
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:51,666
If you make one mistake trying
to defuse it, it'll explode.

364
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,625
You'll have to use the
detonator to deactivate it.

365
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,375
It should be on
that Mafia agent.

366
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,791
You heard what she said.

367
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,791
Give it to me.

368
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,125
Uh! No way!

369
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,958
[AKUTAGAWA] Did you
press the button, Kyouka?

370
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,541
There's no need to
deactivate the bomb.

371
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,833
When you die with the
rest of the passengers,

372
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,083
you'll teach the
world to fear us.

373
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,791
We've gotta take the bomb off!

374
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,666
[ATSUSHI]
How much longer do we have?!

375
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,833
There's no time!

376
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,125
Huh?

377
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,791
[ATSUSHI]
I'm such an idiot...

378
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:47,416
It wasn't until she pushed me
away that I finally realized...

379
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,708
Her power was always
activated by the voice

380
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,166
on her cell phone.

381
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,583
She's not able to
control her own ability.

382

[KYOUKA]
My name is Kyouka Izumi.

I've killed 35 people.

384
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,125
I don't wanna kill
anybody else ever again!

385
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,291
Not ever!

[disconnected beeping]

393
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:35,041
No matter how fierce,
a pawn is just a pawn...

394
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,791
How about you then?

395
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,375
Are you the player

396
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:44,208
or a lowly pawn to be used
until its own inevitable demise?

397
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,833
[ATSUSHI] She didn't kill
people of her own free will.

398
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,958
These abilities can be as
much of a curse as a blessing.

399
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,125
I know that better than anyone!

400
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,375
But if I hand her
over to the police,

401
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,708
they'll execute her for sure.

402

[KYOUKA]
Where are you taking me?

403

[ATSUSHI]
That's... Um... Hey!

404
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,541
You wanna go out on a date?

405
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,666
[KYOUKA]
A date?

406
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,083
With you?
