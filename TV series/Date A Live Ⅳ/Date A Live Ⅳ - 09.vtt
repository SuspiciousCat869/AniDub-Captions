sorely outnumbered, no?

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.284 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MANA grunts] After I'm
done killing you guys...

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
...get ready, I'm coming
for you all next!

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
Shido? Shido?

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.043 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is everything okay
with you, Shido?

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.172 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO gasps]

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.132 position:50% align:center line:84%
Um. Yeah, sorry.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center line:84%
Guess I spaced out
there for a second.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's fine. Now then, allow me
to explain something.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
Very little has changed.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center line:84%
My goal is the same
as it always has been.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
You have Spirit power
contained within your body

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:27.025 position:50% align:center line:84%
and I simply wish to devour it.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's not any more
complicated than that.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center line:84%
I mean, think about it:
there are ten Spirits worth

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:33.740 position:50% align:center line:84%
of power stored inside you.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's rather
remarkable, after all.

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO] In other words, what
you're trying to say is that

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center line:84%
you've come here
to kill me, right?

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
[giggles]

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] Well, I wasn't going
to put such a fine point on it,

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center line:84%
but yes. I have.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your goal is to seal
my Spirit power.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.341 position:50% align:center line:84%
Same as ever?

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.594 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah. Well, partly, but that's
not the extent of it.

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh?

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.139 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO] I want to give you
the opportunity to atone 

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center line:84%
for all the harm you've done
so you can live a happy life.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center line:84%
At the end of the day,
that's all I want--

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center line:84%
I mean, all <i>we</i> want.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
[giggles]

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sometimes I think you're too
kind for your own good, Shido.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:16.282 position:50% align:center line:84%
But, you see, there's one
major problem.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our desires are mutually
exclusive, they can't coexist.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tell me something, Shido.

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:25.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
Rather than settling for
a stalemate or truce,

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:28.378 position:50% align:center line:84%
where both our dreams
remain unfulfilled,

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
wouldn't it be better if at
least one of us achieve

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center line:84%
their goal when all this
business is said and done?

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:34.843 position:50% align:center line:84%
Think about it.

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center line:84%
One of us would still get
to walk away a winner,

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:39.055 position:50% align:center line:84%
even if the other was forced
to sacrifice everything.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO gasps]

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't be frightened
and make no mistake:

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have no intention of taking
your Spirit power away from you

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center line:84%
by violence or force.

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center line:84%
On the contrary, I'm more than
happy to do things your way.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO gasps]

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI giggles]

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50% align:center line:84%
How about we solve
it this way:

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center line:84%
whichever of us makes the
other one fall for them

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.996 position:50% align:center line:84%
is the winner and takes all.

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO gasps]

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's not that difficult, Shido.
If I fall in love with you,

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center line:84%
then I promise to give up
my Spirit power willingly.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO gasps]

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] On the other hand,
if I somehow make you

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center line:84%
fall in love with me first, then
I win and get the pleasure of 

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center line:84%
devouring you, along with all
that delicious Spirit power.

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, come on.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center line:84%
You really think I'm
gonna admit I'm in love

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center line:84%
knowing I'll die if I do?

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.567 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
Don't rule it out.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.903 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm confident I can
make you say it.

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50% align:center line:84%
I think I can make
you fall so hard,

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:39.032 position:50% align:center line:84%
you'll sacrifice your life.

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.408 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO grunts]

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:42.869 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's the matter, do you
doubt your prowess now?

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.121 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're confident you can
make me fall head over heels,

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center line:84%
aren't you?

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO grunts]

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.044 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, I am. Let's do this.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.921 position:50% align:center line:84%
[giggles]

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:56.758 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO] You're finished.
You'll choose death for me.

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center line:84%
You'll love me more
than life itself.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's the spirit,
no pun intended!

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:07.769 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, then, shall we begin our
date-battle to the death, Shido?

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:16.319 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI shouts]

[SHIDO groans]

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:22.659 position:50% align:center line:84%
Who said you get to make
a decision like that?

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you lose, you die, dummy!

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO]
I'm sorry, but...

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thing is... I wasn't able
to connect to Fraxinus.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.669 position:50% align:center line:84%
What was I s'posed to do?

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI sighs]

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center line:84%
I understand that you had
no choice in the matter.

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center line:84%
I mean, if you didn't accept her
challenge who knows what kinda 

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:41.052 position:50% align:center line:84%
messed up crap she would
have tried to get away with.

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:44.055 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nevertheless, knowing that
and forgiving you for it?

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center line:84%
Those are two very
different things!

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:47.308 position:50% align:center line:84%
Stupid Big Brother!

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center line:84%
When are you gonna start
thinking of yourself,

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.729 position:50% align:center line:84%
you big stinkin' idiot?

00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:52.981 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's a little harsh.

00:12:53.064 --> 00:12:55.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[KOTORI grunts]
--[SHIDO] Hm?

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
So now it's your turn
to lay into me.

00:12:57.902 --> 00:13:01.072 position:50% align:center line:84%
Letting comms go out at a time
like that is a huge infraction.

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:05.618 position:50% align:center line:84%
It means I failed to support you
at the worst possible time.

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:09.205 position:50% align:center line:84%
If that's what'll earn
your forgiveness...

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.249 position:50% align:center line:84%
You ready to get skewered?

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:14.836 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah. Lay it on me.

--[SHIDO] Heh! Take this!

[SHIDO]
Take that!

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
Phew...

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center line:84%
Fine, I'll let you
off easy this time.

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's cruel and
unusual punishment.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.152 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shido! We're coming in!

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hiya! Sorry we're late!

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center line:84%
Addition. We had to make
one miniscule change

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.492 position:50% align:center line:84%
in regard to the
strategy meeting.

[YOSHINON gasps]
Holy smokes!

what it looks like.

Aw, there, there.
It'll be okay, Kotori.

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center line:84%
What did you just do to your
little sister, you nasty brute?

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.469 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NIA] Yeah, what the
heck's going on here?

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:06.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's just like a
scene from an anime!

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.682 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hold up! It's not like
that and you know it!

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:12.394 position:50% align:center line:84%
Doubtful. Then why not explain
what it is like, Shido?

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.896 position:50% align:center line:84%
Kotori, is there anything
we can do to help?

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:18.817 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aww! Why does Kotori always get
to have all the fun around here?

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, you're into little sisters?

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center line:84%
How convenient.

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center line:84%
I just happen to have these
adoption forms on me,

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.741 position:50% align:center line:84%
Big Brother.

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:29.828 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO] Okay, this is getting
way out of hand.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center line:84%
Okay, now that we've
regained sanity,

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center line:84%
let's move on to more
important matters.

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:37.794 position:50% align:center line:84%
Here's what we do know: Shido
and Kurumi will be competing

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center line:84%
to see who can make the
other fall for them.

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.925 position:50% align:center line:84%
She is after Shido's Spirit
power, but what we don't know

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:47.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
is whether she'll come after
you guys to try and get to him.

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center line:84%
So be on your guard,
even more than usual.

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right, got it.

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center line:84%
Copy that. I won't
go outside. Ever.

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:59.065 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't be silly, you don't
have to take it to extremes.

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:02.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh. It's quite
the conundrum, indeed.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
What is this Kurumi after?

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is there something specific
she stands to gain

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.908 position:50% align:center line:84%
by stealing his Spirit power?

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:12.620 position:50% align:center line:84%
Simply wanting the power itself
can't be her endgame, can it?

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh. I can help on that front.

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center line:84%
I think I have a good
idea of Kurumi's goal.

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
I should've mentioned
it sooner, sorry.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.671 position:50% align:center line:84%
What?

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:25.258 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NIA] I wasn't trying to hide it
or anything like that, I swear!

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.594 position:50% align:center line:84%
But here's the deal.
Kurumi dropped by my place

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center line:84%
for a friendly little
visit not too long ago.

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center line:84%
She said she'd come to use
Raziel to gather intel.

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50% align:center line:84%
She was after information
about the Spirit of Origin.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
Specifically how to beat it.

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
She wants to defeat it?

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:46.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NIA] Mm-hm. As you know, the
Spirit of Origin first appeared

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
approximately 30 years ago.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.701 position:50% align:center line:84%
She wanted to know every minute
detail about where, when,

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center line:84%
and how it showed up, but her
main goal was to understand

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
the nuances of its power.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
So she could learn
exactly how to kill it.

00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:00.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.671 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seriously?

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.799 position:50% align:center line:84%
So that would be the
reason she asked about

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center line:84%
the exact time and place
of its appearance, then.

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, she wants to nip it in
the bud, make it so Spirits

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:14.724 position:50% align:center line:84%
would never manifest
here in the first place.

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center line:84%
Also, when I was in the
other world, and Kurumi

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:21.356 position:50% align:center line:84%
came to assist me, she stated
that as her intention.

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh, interesting.

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:26.027 position:50% align:center line:84%
That implies Kurumi's
able travel to the past.

00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
But in order to do so,

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.490 position:50% align:center line:84%
she has to acquire the
power inside Shido.

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:32.826 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see. She'll go
back 30 years,

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:35.829 position:50% align:center line:84%
kill the Spirit of Origin,
and change history.

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:39.249 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's as lofty a goal
as it is terrifying.

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wonder what could be driving
her to do all of this.

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center line:84%
No kidding! The answers
just raise more questions!

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why would she kill
the Spirit of Origin?

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:52.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
What would she gain by that?

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ORIGAMI]
Until we discover her motives,

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's risky to dig deeper.

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:59.352 position:50% align:center line:84%
But, it's still worthwhile
to connect all the dots

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center line:84%
and find answers, agreed?

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.732 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, of course.

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thing is, Kurumi is
so freakin' secretive!

wanna say about all this, too.

[SHIDO]
Mana! What happened to you?

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's no big deal.
Just minor fleshwounds.

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
Excuse me, miss! Did I not
tell you to park your butt

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center line:84%
in a medical pod
till full recovery?

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center line:84%
I gave her clearance to leave.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center line:84%
She said she had something
important to say,

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center line:84%
and I thought we should hear it.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.805 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thank you. I'll direct
your attention to this.

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.349 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:49.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is that Kurumi's clone army?

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MANA]
That makes sense.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.989 position:50% align:center line:84%
I bet this solves the
puzzle about what caused

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center line:84%
the disruption in communication.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center line:84%
In any case, at the very least,

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.330 position:50% align:center line:84%
I managed to thwart
DEM's efforts.

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:02.374 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, yeah, now you're just
repeating what you said

00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:05.669 position:50% align:center line:84%
in your report.
So riddle me this, Mana.

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center line:84%
How were you able to
predict Ellen's attack

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center line:84%
with such tight accuracy?

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:12.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, I--

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:14.219 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was Nightmare.

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center line:84%
Kurumi Tokisaki
told me all about it.

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:26.231 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MANA] She just showed up
out of nowhere and said that

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:29.234 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ellen would be launching
an attack on Big Brother.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center line:84%
She told me the precise location
and when it would take place,

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:35.573 position:50% align:center line:84%
which was yesterday, obviously.

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI] Fine.
But, here's another riddle:

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:39.244 position:50% align:center line:84%
why would the lovely, sweet,

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center line:84%
ordinarily forthcoming Mana
keep such a huge secret?

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.250 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's just... I figured you
wouldn't let me go fight her

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center line:84%
if I said anything,
you know? Bad idea.

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:50.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
You know me even
better than I thought.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.507 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't worry, you and I are
gonna have an extended

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.342 position:50% align:center line:84%
heart-to-heart about it later.

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MANA]
Gah! Have mercy, I beg you!

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI grunts] Now, back to
this Kurumi business.

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
All right. So how did
Kurumi know about

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.602 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ellen's attack in
the first place?

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center line:84%
And what could her
motive possibly be

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.523 position:50% align:center line:84%
for disclosing that to Mana?

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:09.858 position:50% align:center line:84%
Her motive?

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center line:84%
That seems clear. She wants
to protect you, Shido.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center line:84%
It all makes sense.

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center line:84%
Kurumi's after
your Spirit power.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center line:84%
I imagine she'd hate someone
else getting to you first.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center line:84%
Especially if that
someone was DEM.

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:24.497 position:50% align:center line:84%
And she can deploy her army
of clones to gather information,

00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center line:84%
which gives her an advantage
on the intelligence front.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have a feeling that's how
she was able to discover

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center line:84%
DEM's plan to attack.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:34.674 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO grunts]
Yeah, that's likely correct.

are you doing here?

What's the problem?

00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:05.205 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is there something out of
the ordinary for classmates

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center line:84%
to want to walk to school
together sometimes?

on the offensive.

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll contact Kotori now.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center line:84%
What? Why would you
think I'd be interested

in something like this?

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come on. These guys love people.

Well, if you insist,
but if I get attacked, 

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm putting all the
blame on you.

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center line:84%

be afraid, little kitty.

Heh. Sorry.

Cats will always let you know
if they don't want attention.

It's okay. I mean, there are
tons of other cats around.

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center line:84%
Try petting another one.

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:35.670 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't think so.
If it runs away again,

00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center line:84%

be too much for me.

go better this time.
