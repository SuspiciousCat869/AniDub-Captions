Though I have to say,

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.064 position:50% align:center
it's not bad considering the

of inverted Spirit power.

Qlipha!

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
And now, at long last,
I take one great stride

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:22.542 position:50% align:center
towards the fulfilment
of my deepest desires!

No way! Did he just
absorb a Sephirah?

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
Your eyes do not
betray you, Shido Itsuka.

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
Observe.

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:50.653 position:50% align:center
Just as you gained the powers of
the eight Spirits, I did this.

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.238 position:50% align:center

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:53.990 position:50% align:center
Beelzebub.

Aha, curious, isn't it?

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:06.086 position:50% align:center
Just by making physical
contact with a Demon King,

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
one may learn exactly
how to use its power.

[ELLEN gasps]
Ike!

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:13.885 position:50% align:center
Do you see this, Ellen?

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
Behold one of the
majestic Demon Kings

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.807 position:50% align:center
which shall light
our path forward!

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.268 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, just one
Demon King will not suffice.

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
It is not nearly enough to
satisfy our ambitions.

Shido! Are you okay?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.619 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm fine!
But I'm not sure about Nia!

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center
[WESTCOTT] Ellen, now that
we've achieved our goal,

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
I think we should call it a day.

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
[ELLEN]
What? Are you sure?

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:50.588 position:50% align:center
Absorbing multiple Demon
Kings at once isn't easy,

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:52.590 position:50% align:center
and even a body of
my caliber will struggle

00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
with completing that process.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
Besides, it would be a
criminal waste not to allow

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
myself to savor each
and every one of them.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
[WESTCOTT] Tsk. We will
meet again soon,

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
Shido Itsuka and Spirits.

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
Someday, I'll make you invert,
just like I did poor Nia here.

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
And then I will take
your Qlipha, as well.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:13.778 position:50% align:center
But in the meantime,

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center
I do hope you will enjoy
your final days of peace.

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:24.539 position:50% align:center
Nia! Hey! Hang in there!

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center
[NIA grunts]

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
Shido, wait! It's faint, but I
can sense her Spirit power!

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center
What, really?

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.006 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Just before
Artemisia stabbed Nia,

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:34.924 position:50% align:center
you pulled part of Nia's
consciousness back,

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
you must have saved it.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
So, at that point, Nia wasn't
fully inverted anymore.

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
She probably has a fragment
of Sephirah left in her body.

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
In other words,
you can seal her.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
Nia, please, open your
heart to me!

00:19:55.695 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
I don't care if you use every
bit of my power. Please!

Jeez, why are you
guys being so loud?

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
I'm, like, two feet away,
you know.

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
Sorry!

First sunrise of the year.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:15.919 position:50% align:center
Hey, Boy? I hope you know
how much this means.

00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:16.836 position:50% align:center
For real.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.129 position:50% align:center
Don't mention it.

00:22:18.213 --> 00:22:21.299 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's not
like I did it alone.

00:22:21.383 --> 00:22:25.887 position:50% align:center
And I did some serious thinking
while I was recovering.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:28.765 position:50% align:center
I decided I wanna patch
things up with Takajo,

00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:29.974 position:50% align:center
be friends again.

00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:31.810 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Yeah, that's a good call.

00:22:31.893 --> 00:22:33.978 position:50% align:center
Takajo's probably a good person.

00:22:34.062 --> 00:22:36.356 position:50% align:center
"Probably"?

00:22:36.439 --> 00:22:37.691 position:50% align:center
It's kinda weird.

00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:40.360 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it stinks to
have lost my power,

00:22:40.443 --> 00:22:42.862 position:50% align:center
but I also feel
at peace with it.

00:22:42.946 --> 00:22:45.490 position:50% align:center
I had Raziel for
almost 30 years,

00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:48.868 position:50% align:center
but maybe that kind of power is
too much for someone like me.

00:22:48.952 --> 00:22:49.953 position:50% align:center
[ORIGAMI]
Thirty years?

00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:52.080 position:50% align:center
You became a Spirit
that long ago?

00:22:52.163 --> 00:22:53.581 position:50% align:center
I had no idea.

00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:57.168 position:50% align:center
Well, to be precise,
it's more like 27 or 28.

00:22:57.252 --> 00:22:59.254 position:50% align:center
I look good for my age,
though, right?

00:22:59.337 --> 00:23:01.464 position:50% align:center
To be fair, your Spirit
power probably halted,

00:23:01.548 --> 00:23:03.717 position:50% align:center
or at least slowed
the aging process.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.595 position:50% align:center
But now you'll age like a normal
person, so better up that SPF!

00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:09.764 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Great. Love that for me.

00:23:09.848 --> 00:23:12.767 position:50% align:center
Speaking of timelines, when did
all you guys become Spirits?

00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:15.061 position:50% align:center
It's been about
five years for me.

00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:17.439 position:50% align:center
I did a year or so ago,
give or take.

00:23:17.522 --> 00:23:19.065 position:50% align:center
Not until recently.

00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:22.569 position:50% align:center
Always been one. The rest
of us are Pure Spirits.

00:23:22.652 --> 00:23:24.571 position:50% align:center
Wait, what do you mean?

00:23:24.654 --> 00:23:26.990 position:50% align:center
I thought all Spirits
were once human,

00:23:27.073 --> 00:23:29.325 position:50% align:center
at least in the
beginning of their lives.
