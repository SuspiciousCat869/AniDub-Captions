I was also told to bring this to

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:04.601 position:50% align:center
It's bizarre. We figured out
quickly that spirit power

and Angels don't work here,

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.855 position:50% align:center
so we didn't have much choice

Not quite.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.024 position:50% align:center
It'd be more accurate
to say we're in a world

[SHIDO] C'mon, that's your
own frickin' manga.

Got any clue how we can
get back to our world?

Well, Westcott won't be
letting us out any time soon,

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
that's for sure.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
Which means, our first priority
has to be finding someone who

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center

take to break us out of here.

gonna conveniently find

about to find out.

Agreed. I had a hypothesis.

wake you successfully,

It would appear that Kotori's
special feelings for Shido

have made their way
into her dreams.

We found ourselves in

[YUZURU]
Explanation.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50% align:center
We'd gotten quite hungry, so we
decided to snack on the walls

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
and roof to fill our bellies.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] A-ha. You're Hansel
and Gretel, huh?

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] This creepy old hag
did actually try talking to us

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
at one point, but we just
ignored her and ran away.

She chased us with a speed

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.759 position:50% align:center

and terrifying.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center

keep pace with us!

Kaguya had tears in her eyes
and may have, in fact,

it together, find the others,

is, where do we even start?
