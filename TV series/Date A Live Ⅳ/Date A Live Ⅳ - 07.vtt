00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:18.935 position:50% align:center
[ASAHI gasps] Wow, you can
really see the stars tonight.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.147 position:50% align:center
Every star has a name.
Each unique unto themselves.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.189 position:50% align:center
Did you know?

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:24.566 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Uh-uh.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
[ASAHI giggles] That bright
one is called Sirius.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.448 position:50% align:center
And you see those three
lined up in a row?

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.616 position:50% align:center
That's Orion's Belt.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO giggles]

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
Brrr!

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.582 position:50% align:center
Aren't you cold?
Come snuggle up and keep warm.

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Mm-hm.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:46.087 position:50% align:center
[ASAHI]
Look right over there.

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
You see that little
cluster of stars?

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:51.259 position:50% align:center
That's Pleiades.
Oh, and that one--

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:54.512 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO'S MOTHER] Girls!
Come in, dinner's almost ready!

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:57.682 position:50% align:center
[ASAHI, MUKURO giggle]
Coming!

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:05.482 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:42.787 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Shido. Hello?
Shido, do you copy?

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:47.500 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]
Kotori? Yeah, I'm all good.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.045 position:50% align:center
[KANNAZUKI]
Mukuro's happiness is rising.

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center
If it keeps going
this way, then soon,

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:54.674 position:50% align:center
it'll be high enough
to seal her powers.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:58.636 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Mm. Shido, don't worry,
we've got your back, okay?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.348 position:50% align:center
You just do your own thing
and proceed with the date.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:02.849 position:50% align:center
Ten-four.

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:05.226 position:50% align:center
Shido, what have you been
mumbling about this whole time?

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm sorry about that.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:11.816 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what did you
have in mind for today?

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
You have an idea of something
that would make Muku happy?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.491 position:50% align:center
Well, um. There's lots of
things. We'll have to decide.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:22.660 position:50% align:center
No we don't. I'd rather you
just show me all of them.

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.287 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's get going.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.498 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Wait, just a sec!

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
Your hair's getting
pretty dirty.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.250 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Hm?

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:30.835 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
You know,

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.380 position:50% align:center
it might be a good idea to do
something about how long it is.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.423 position:50% align:center
Why not cut it?
I think that would be--

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.718 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO] Nay! I won't
give my consent to cut it,

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:41.221 position:50% align:center
not even if it's you
who's doing the asking.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Hm?

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.933 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO gasps]
I'm sorry Shido.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:48.395 position:50% align:center
I'm against it, though I can't
actually remember why.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] Oh. I see.
Well, then, sorry I asked.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center
Still, I really don't think
we can leave it as it is.

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.406 position:50% align:center
Do you have any problem
with tying it up?

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
No, only cutting it.
What do you think we should do?

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
Um, let's see.
Give me just a minute.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:08.665 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.625 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
We're getting some choices.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
There you go, everyone!

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Walk behind Mukuro,

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
carrying it like a wedding dress
train and nuzzling it tenderly.

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:26.016 position:50% align:center
Okay, that might be the
silliest idea I've ever heard.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
Who the heck picked that?

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
Me! I did!

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI groans] MARIA, you come
up with the choices

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.691 position:50% align:center
all on your own, right?

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
[MARIA] Technically, no, I don't
come up with them independently.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
They're generated based
on various factors such as

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
happiness level and
the date's progression.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
I've always wondered about
something: Is there always

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
a risky choice on purpose or
is that purely coincidence?

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.249 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
Yes, it's purposeful.

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
There's typically a favorite,
a contender,

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
and a dark horse in
every batch of options.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.381 position:50% align:center
"A dark horse."
Just to be clear,

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.676 position:50% align:center
nobody's using MARIA's computing
power to predict horse racing,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.970 position:50% align:center
are they?

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.431 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center
Shido, listen, do "two,"
just tie it up for her.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50% align:center
Here's a thought.
Wanna come to my house?

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:15.774 position:50% align:center
We've got combs and
hair clips, stuff like that.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Mm-hm! That sounds like fun.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
All right then.
I'll leave it to you.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
Thank you.
It's an honor, my lady.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.579 position:50% align:center
You're really good at this, huh?

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
That's a surprise.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks. Kotori always
makes me help with her hair,

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
so I guess I've
gotten okay at it.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
Kotori? Who's that?

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:42.217 position:50% align:center
She's the girl who was with
me yesterday. She's my sister.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.306 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] Hm? Hey, we should
change your clothes, too.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.642 position:50% align:center
You can just borrow
some of hers.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Oh, Mister, it doesn't fit me.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
It's way too small.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:06:01.611 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO groans] No prob.
That's not exactly what I meant.

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:03.655 position:50% align:center
I was thinking you could
maybe reproduce them

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:04.906 position:50% align:center
with Spirit power.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:07.701 position:50% align:center
Ah! That's an excellent idea.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.167 position:50% align:center
There, this should
do quite nicely.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Dude. Are you kidding?

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.212 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you just
start with this?

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50% align:center
You made her try that stuff on
for no reason, Pervy McPerv!

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:26.970 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO chuckles]
Well, shall we go, then, Mukuro?

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.264 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I can't wait.

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Wow, you were right, Shido.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.783 position:50% align:center
Today was even more fun
than I could've imagined.

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you like your fan.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.540 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO giggles] To think that
you would do so much for me.

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:57.500 position:50% align:center
It makes one wonder.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
Could it be that my
Mister loves Muku?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
I do, a lot. So I really
wanna protect you.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad!
I'm fond of you, too!

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center
I love you, Shido.

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
But, you know...

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
If you choose to vow yourself
to Muku, that means you're also

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
vowing to stay far away
from all those other girls.

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
[gasps] But I...
I can't promise you that.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
It's important to me to be
able to save all the Spirits.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.119 position:50% align:center
I love the other sealed Spirits
as much as I love you,

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.455 position:50% align:center
so I'm really hoping
you'll all get along.

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:36.831 position:50% align:center
It'd mean a lot.

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:39.959 position:50% align:center
I just want to make sure
everyone I love is happy.

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
You have a kind soul, Shido.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center
So, yes, you just leave
everything to Muku.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.552 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Wait, what?

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO] Well then, I suppose
this is farewell for tonight.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.600 position:50% align:center
Let's meet again soon, Mister.

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.313 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Mukuro!

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
What the heck is she thinking?

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO hums]

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.164 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI sighs]

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.541 position:50% align:center
Morning! Hungry?

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
Ah, g'morning. I, uh--

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI screams]

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.675 position:50% align:center
What? What's wrong?

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50% align:center
Tell me who you are,
right now!

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
And what you're
doing in my house!

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center
Uh. Come on.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
What're you going
on about, Kot--?

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.935 position:50% align:center
Just get lost!
Or I'll call the police!

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Get outta here!

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.610 position:50% align:center
[pants]
Who was that guy?

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO pants]

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:55.952 position:50% align:center
Man, sleepwalking can be
a terrifying thing. Phew...

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess... I should
just head to school.

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50% align:center
[AI, MAI, TONOMACHI laugh]

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:02.500 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Morning.

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
[AI, MAI, TONOMACHI]
Hm?

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO grunts]
Why the weird face, Tonomachi?

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
Is something going on?

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:13.803 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry, but who
are you again?

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
Transfer student?

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.473 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.893 position:50% align:center
Oh! I know what it is,
you must've been at karaoke!

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
Sorry, dude! There were
so many people,

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
I guess it would've been
impossible to remember everyone.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
Tonomachi! What the crap
are you talking about?

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.361 position:50% align:center
It's me, Shido Itsuka!

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:34.366 position:50% align:center
Shido... Itsuka?
Do you guys know him?

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
Yamabuki! Hazakura, come on!

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.244 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?!

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:41.498 position:50% align:center
Wait. What's happening?
Don't you guys know me?

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
Sorry. What?

Ew. Is he hitting on us?

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.753 position:50% align:center
So basic.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.880 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's super-lame.

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:51.257 position:50% align:center
They don't... know me?

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
Ah! Hey, everyone! Mornin'!

[SHIDO gasps]
Tohka! Origami!

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center
What? Something wrong?
You seem really stressed out.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
The class is acting so weird!

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50% align:center
Wait. Was Kotori
not sleepwalking?

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:06.272 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'm sorry, but I'm
not quite following you.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:09.150 position:50% align:center
Who are you anyway? Name?

[gasps]

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.320 position:50% align:center
C'mon, you couldn't
really mean that!

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
Just lemme see your homework!

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
Negative. I think you
should do it yourself.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.784 position:50% align:center
Please! Just gimme a break!

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.953 position:50% align:center
Kaguya! Yuzuru!

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
Hey, you two totally know
who I am, don't you?

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]
No. Why, should I?

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:27.252 position:50% align:center
Confusing. Maybe if you
tell us which class you're in?

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center

Yeah, I'm comin'... Delivery?

Huh? Who're you? Are you a fan?

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center

[YOSHINO, NATSUMI gasp]

Okay. Let's get the
shopping over with fast.

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
Yeah, totally agree.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center

[YOSHINO gasps]

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.250 position:50% align:center
Yes? What's going on here?

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.753 position:50% align:center
Whoa! This should be good.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
Hey. Do you know me?
You do, right?

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
Um. Not sure. It's hard to say.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
How 'bout telling me
your name again?

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.433 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I don't have a clue.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINON chuckles]
Sorry about that, pal.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:31.483 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] Dammit!
What the hell's going on?

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.
Why doesn't anyone know me?

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
Wait, who's left? Reine?
The Ratatoskr crew members?

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
Kurumi?

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:41.868 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
Mukuro! If I'm right
about this, then.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:49.084 position:50% align:center
Haniel!

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
Kaleidoscope!

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
If this is Mukuro's doing,

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
then there might be a way I
can turn it back to normal!

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Segva.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.187 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:17.946 position:50% align:center
Mukuro!

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO] I had a feeling you
might figure it out, Mister.

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
Well done.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
What've you done here?
Made everyone forget me?

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course! I locked all
their memories with Michael.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
And this way, we can
finally have our chance

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.211 position:50% align:center
to be all alone together!

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:36.339 position:50% align:center
So you can cherish Muku
with all your heart.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Please tell me again.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
You love Muku,
don't you, Mister?

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
So yesterday, I met this
really bizarre guy at school.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
He knew both me
and Origami on sight.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's interesting.
I just met a real weirdo myself.

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
First thing this morning,

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
I woke up to a perfect stranger
just chillin' in the kitchen.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.459 position:50% align:center
Hold on, that's
totally weird. Same.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.045 position:50% align:center
Some random guy I don't
know called me up today

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:16.379 position:50% align:center
out of the blue.

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
I immediately hung up,
of course, but here, look!

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.009 position:50% align:center
He's in my call history! See?

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:22.635 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Huh? "Darling"?

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I don't remember
saving it like that,

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.639 position:50% align:center
so this is super freaky!

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yuzuru. Do you think
it could be that guy?

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center
Recollect. I believe we
must have met him, too.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.314 position:50% align:center
You know what?

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
I chased away a weird
fan at my place, too.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
Something strange is going on.

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:39.652 position:50% align:center
I agree. Us, too.

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center
And the thing is, the guy
looked like he was

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:44.282 position:50% align:center
really upset about
something, too.

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm...

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.163 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
What's up, Origami?

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:53.041 position:50% align:center
My head. It just
started hurting.

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
You okay? Think you
need to go home?

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:56.544 position:50% align:center

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:02.050 position:50% align:center
Hold on, I'm gonna reach out
to Ratatoskr's medical team.

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
[ORIGAMI grunts]
No, it's all right.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.307 position:50% align:center
I'm terribly sorry to
have worried you guys.

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
Are you...? Hey, Origami?

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
Yes? What is it?

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:17.857 position:50% align:center
Um, you are Origami, right?

00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:21.569 position:50% align:center
Yes, I am, but it's a different
me than usual, so to speak.

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
So you might find some
things surprising.

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
But let's back up. Is what
you're saying really true?

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
Nobody in this house
can even remember him?

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Hm? "Him"?

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:36.626 position:50% align:center
Which "him" is it?
Yuzuru, do you know?

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
Negative. I don't have any idea.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:44.551 position:50% align:center
[ORIGAMI] Hm. I see. I assume
this is Mukuro's doing, then.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
In which case,
what can I do about it?

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
Listen, slow down a minute.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.307 position:50% align:center
You're making zero
sense right now.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
Who's Mukuro?
And who is this "Him"?

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:56.229 position:50% align:center
You guys should know
more than anyone.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
'Cause I mean, after all, He,
Shido Itsuka, is who saved us.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Shido Itsuka?

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.990 position:50% align:center
That's... That's my
last name, too.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center

Oh. My poor Shido.

Tohka!

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.206 position:50% align:center
What is going on? Now you, too?

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO hums] This is fun!
Are you having fun, too?

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.179 position:50% align:center
I am. Lots of it, in fact.

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
That makes me happy!

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
Now tell me again,
do you love Muku?

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:35.810 position:50% align:center
Of course, I love you.

00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:40.023 position:50% align:center
[giggling]
Muku, too! This is bliss!

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:43.109 position:50% align:center
Loving a person and
being loved in return,

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
is such a precious
and wonderful thing!

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.031 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Hey, Mukuro?

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:51.117 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Hm? What is it, Mister?

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:54.120 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] You said before
that we were "close".

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:57.290 position:50% align:center
What did you mean
by that, exactly?

00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO] I don't know,
that's just how it feels.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.088 position:50% align:center
But if I had to say...

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:06.007 position:50% align:center
After you did the thing where
you held Muku and fell,

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
I had this very unusual dream.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:09.052 position:50% align:center
"Dream"?

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
Yes, it was a dream
about a lonely,

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:12.639 position:50% align:center
young girl who was on her own.

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:15.475 position:50% align:center
She was trying very
hard to find a family.

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
Then, when Muku woke up,
Muku wanted more than anything

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:22.232 position:50% align:center
to see you for some
inexplicable reason.

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:23.858 position:50% align:center
That dream is just so--

00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
[ORIGAMI]
Itsuka!

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.743 position:50% align:center
Finally found you!

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
Uh! Origami?

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center
Long time no see, Itsuka.

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Are you this world's Origami?

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
I mean, after Kurumi
and I changed history?

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
That's right!
Though it is weird saying,

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.466 position:50% align:center
"Long time no see,"
considering the fact

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
that the other me has been right
beside you this entire time.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
You know me! You actually
remember who I am?

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
Of course! But definitely
not the other me,

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
since her memories
have been locked away.

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
I'm confused, but oh well.
No worries!

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.443 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to lock your
memories up all over again,

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
I guess... Michael.

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
Mukuro, don't!

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
You have to stop!

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
If you truly manifest your
Angel now, they'll find you!

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
"Find you"? Who will?

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
There you are.

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Tohka!

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA] Looks like there
are some extras here, too.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.882 position:50% align:center
Hmph. No matter.

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
I'll turn you all
into ashes in no time.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.888 position:50% align:center
Tohka! Have you been inverted?

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:38.850 position:50% align:center
Nehemoth!

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
Begone.

00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Lataib.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA] Tsk! Little fool.
How do you dare defy my attack?

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
What could possibly be
the matter with you?

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:56.576 position:50% align:center
No, I'm afraid that's my line.

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:59.579 position:50% align:center
Your memories should be
securely locked by Michael.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
If you intend to get in
Muku's way, then just be warned.

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
I won't hold back.

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
Please, hold on!

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
--What for?
--You dare to interfere?

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:14.844 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Well, I um.

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
Please calm down
and listen, Mukuro.

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
Tohka. Take a breath.

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
--What now?
--Tohka? 

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
Could it be you're
referring to me?

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:24.229 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
Listen, it's obvious that Mukuro
loves Itsuka more than anything,

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
which is why she got so upset
about you coming to get him.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's a fair
way of putting it.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
But, the thing is,
Itsuka really hates violence.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
Surely, there's a
better way to do this.

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:44.916 position:50% align:center
Try winning Itsuka's
love some other way.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:51.256 position:50% align:center
And... also, Tohka. May I
ask what your end goal is?

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
It's not actually to
fight Mukuro, right?

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:56.553 position:50% align:center
As if goals matter one bit.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:19:00.140 position:50% align:center
I will never rest. Not until
I've purged the shame.

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:02.809 position:50% align:center
The mountain of pain
caused by this man.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
You mean... I think you're
referring to when

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
you manifested at
DEM's base, aren't you?

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
Think, though, if you beat
Itsuka using brute force alone,

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:16.614 position:50% align:center
then can you truly say
you've beaten him at all?

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:20.994 position:50% align:center
Use not force, but heart.

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
I mean, unless you
conquer his heart,

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.582 position:50% align:center
can it even be
considered a victory?

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:28.460 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey. Origami?

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:30.378 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what must
I do in order to win

00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:31.963 position:50% align:center
this man's undying devotion?

00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
What must I do to
humiliate this man

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:36.217 position:50% align:center
to the point of actual death?

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
There's a way to do
both of these things

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:42.349 position:50% align:center
and still determine
a true victor.

00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
Mm!

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:45.810 position:50% align:center
All you have to do
is go on a date,

00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:48.730 position:50% align:center
and the one who steals a kiss
from Itsuka's lips wins it all!

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center

[MAID A]
Welcome home, Master!

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:02.452 position:50% align:center
Why are we doing this?

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.496 position:50% align:center
Mainly because I think
it's always a good idea

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:06.623 position:50% align:center
to become friends before
you kiss someone.

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
Not that part!

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
What's going on, like,
why has Tohka inverted?

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.462 position:50% align:center
And why--? Whoa!

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:14.297 position:50% align:center
What do you two think
you're sitting around

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:15.507 position:50% align:center
whispering about?

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
Just eat my damn
strawberry already! Here!

[SHIDO grunts]

Itsuka!

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.304 position:50% align:center
Just what are you doing?

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
[MAID B] Ladies! Come, come,
let's not cause a scene!

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
There are other
masters here, so behave!

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
Nobody needs that.

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:29.729 position:50% align:center
Who the hell are you?

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center

Listen, if you're too rowdy,

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
you'll trouble Master,
and we can't have that.

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
Well, what do you think
we should do now?

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
This: I'll teach you
some magic words

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
that'll make Master
hungry for yummy cake

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:49.708 position:50% align:center
and not be satisfied
with anything else!

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:54.295 position:50% align:center
Be tasty, be tasty,

00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
There! Now Master just can't
wait to eat some cake!

What?

He can't wait to eat some cake.

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
Yes! Right! Shido loves cake!
Like, really loves cake!

[MAID B giggles]
I'm glad. Now then, enjoy!

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:22.699 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA] Now I see.
I've learned something new.

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:28.830 position:50% align:center
Go forth and be tasty!
