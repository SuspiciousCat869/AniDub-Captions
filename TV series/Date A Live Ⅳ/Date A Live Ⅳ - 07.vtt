00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.753 position:50% align:center
So basic.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.880 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's super-lame.

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:51.257 position:50% align:center
They don't... know me?

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
Ah! Hey, everyone! Mornin'!

[SHIDO gasps]
Tohka! Origami!

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center
What? Something wrong?
You seem really stressed out.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
The class is acting so weird!

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50% align:center
Wait. Was Kotori
not sleepwalking?

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:06.272 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'm sorry, but I'm
not quite following you.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:09.150 position:50% align:center
Who are you anyway? Name?

[gasps]

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.320 position:50% align:center
C'mon, you couldn't
really mean that!

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
Just lemme see your homework!

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
Negative. I think you
should do it yourself.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.784 position:50% align:center
Please! Just gimme a break!

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.953 position:50% align:center
Kaguya! Yuzuru!

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
Hey, you two totally know
who I am, don't you?

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]
No. Why, should I?

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:27.252 position:50% align:center
Confusing. Maybe if you
tell us which class you're in?

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center

Yeah, I'm comin'... Delivery?

Huh? Who're you? Are you a fan?

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center

[YOSHINO, NATSUMI gasp]

Okay. Let's get the
shopping over with fast.

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
Yeah, totally agree.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center

[YOSHINO gasps]

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.250 position:50% align:center
Yes? What's going on here?

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.753 position:50% align:center
Whoa! This should be good.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
Hey. Do you know me?
You do, right?

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
Um. Not sure. It's hard to say.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
How 'bout telling me
your name again?

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.433 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I don't have a clue.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINON chuckles]
Sorry about that, pal.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:31.483 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] Dammit!
What the hell's going on?

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.
Why doesn't anyone know me?

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
Wait, who's left? Reine?
The Ratatoskr crew members?

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
Kurumi?

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:41.868 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
Mukuro! If I'm right
about this, then.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:49.084 position:50% align:center
Haniel!

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
Kaleidoscope!

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
If this is Mukuro's doing,

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
then there might be a way I
can turn it back to normal!

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Segva.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.187 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:17.946 position:50% align:center
Mukuro!

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO] I had a feeling you
might figure it out, Mister.

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
Well done.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
What've you done here?
Made everyone forget me?

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course! I locked all
their memories with Michael.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
And this way, we can
finally have our chance

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.211 position:50% align:center
to be all alone together!

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:36.339 position:50% align:center
So you can cherish Muku
with all your heart.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Please tell me again.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
You love Muku,
don't you, Mister?

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
So yesterday, I met this
really bizarre guy at school.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
He knew both me
and Origami on sight.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's interesting.
I just met a real weirdo myself.

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
First thing this morning,

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
I woke up to a perfect stranger
just chillin' in the kitchen.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.459 position:50% align:center
Hold on, that's
totally weird. Same.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.045 position:50% align:center
Some random guy I don't
know called me up today

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:16.379 position:50% align:center
out of the blue.

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
I immediately hung up,
of course, but here, look!

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.009 position:50% align:center
He's in my call history! See?

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:22.635 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Huh? "Darling"?

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I don't remember
saving it like that,

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.639 position:50% align:center
so this is super freaky!

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yuzuru. Do you think
it could be that guy?

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center
Recollect. I believe we
must have met him, too.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.314 position:50% align:center
You know what?

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
I chased away a weird
fan at my place, too.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
Something strange is going on.

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:39.652 position:50% align:center
I agree. Us, too.

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center
And the thing is, the guy
looked like he was

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:44.282 position:50% align:center
really upset about
something, too.

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm...

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.163 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
What's up, Origami?

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:53.041 position:50% align:center
My head. It just
started hurting.

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
You okay? Think you
need to go home?

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:56.544 position:50% align:center

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:02.050 position:50% align:center
Hold on, I'm gonna reach out
to Ratatoskr's medical team.

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
[ORIGAMI grunts]
No, it's all right.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.307 position:50% align:center
I'm terribly sorry to
have worried you guys.

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
Are you...? Hey, Origami?

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
Yes? What is it?

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:17.857 position:50% align:center
Um, you are Origami, right?

00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:21.569 position:50% align:center
Yes, I am, but it's a different
me than usual, so to speak.

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
So you might find some
things surprising.

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
But let's back up. Is what
you're saying really true?

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
Nobody in this house
can even remember him?

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Hm? "Him"?

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:36.626 position:50% align:center
Which "him" is it?
Yuzuru, do you know?

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
Negative. I don't have any idea.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:44.551 position:50% align:center
[ORIGAMI] Hm. I see. I assume
this is Mukuro's doing, then.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
In which case,
what can I do about it?

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
Listen, slow down a minute.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.307 position:50% align:center
You're making zero
sense right now.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
Who's Mukuro?
And who is this "Him"?

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:56.229 position:50% align:center
You guys should know
more than anyone.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
'Cause I mean, after all, He,
Shido Itsuka, is who saved us.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Shido Itsuka?

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.990 position:50% align:center
That's... That's my
last name, too.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center

Oh. My poor Shido.

Tohka!

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.206 position:50% align:center
What is going on? Now you, too?

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO hums] This is fun!
Are you having fun, too?

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.179 position:50% align:center
I am. Lots of it, in fact.

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
That makes me happy!

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
Now tell me again,
do you love Muku?

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:35.810 position:50% align:center
Of course, I love you.

00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:40.023 position:50% align:center
[giggling]
Muku, too! This is bliss!

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:43.109 position:50% align:center
Loving a person and
being loved in return,

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
is such a precious
and wonderful thing!

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.031 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Hey, Mukuro?

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:51.117 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Hm? What is it, Mister?

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:54.120 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] You said before
that we were "close".

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:57.290 position:50% align:center
What did you mean
by that, exactly?

00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO] I don't know,
that's just how it feels.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.088 position:50% align:center
But if I had to say...

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:06.007 position:50% align:center
After you did the thing where
you held Muku and fell,

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
I had this very unusual dream.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:09.052 position:50% align:center
"Dream"?

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
Yes, it was a dream
about a lonely,

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:12.639 position:50% align:center
young girl who was on her own.

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:15.475 position:50% align:center
She was trying very
hard to find a family.

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
Then, when Muku woke up,
Muku wanted more than anything

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:22.232 position:50% align:center
to see you for some
inexplicable reason.

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:23.858 position:50% align:center
That dream is just so--

00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
[ORIGAMI]
Itsuka!

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.743 position:50% align:center
Finally found you!

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
Uh! Origami?

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center
Long time no see, Itsuka.

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Are you this world's Origami?

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
I mean, after Kurumi
and I changed history?

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
That's right!
Though it is weird saying,

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.466 position:50% align:center
"Long time no see,"
considering the fact

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
that the other me has been right
beside you this entire time.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
You know me! You actually
remember who I am?

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
Of course! But definitely
not the other me,

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
since her memories
have been locked away.

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
I'm confused, but oh well.
No worries!

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.443 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to lock your
memories up all over again,

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
I guess... Michael.

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
Mukuro, don't!

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
You have to stop!

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
If you truly manifest your
Angel now, they'll find you!

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
"Find you"? Who will?

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
There you are.

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Tohka!

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA] Looks like there
are some extras here, too.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.882 position:50% align:center
Hmph. No matter.

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
I'll turn you all
into ashes in no time.
