[ELLIOT] To think that we could
be trounced so thoroughly.

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:23.898 position:50% align:center
But then again,
that's Ike, I suppose.

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:27.193 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] Isaac's like a child.
The only thing he cares about

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.946 position:50% align:center
is strutting around
with his new toy.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.200 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT] Hm! Has everyone
already been evacuated?

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
[KAREN] It's underway.
Have a little patience.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.300 position:50% align:center
[WESTCOTT] Hey, there.
What's up, Elliot?

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.594 position:50% align:center
Hi, Karen.

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:55.055 position:50% align:center
It's certainly been
a long time, Ike.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:57.432 position:50% align:center
If one were to judge by
your violent entrance,

00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
they might doubt that you
and I were ever old friends.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:01.728 position:50% align:center
It's funny, right?

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
But don't worry,
I don't want too much.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.192 position:50% align:center
I'm only here to bring
you and Karen back to DEM,

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:09.986 position:50% align:center
where you both belong.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.988 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT]
Oh? And what if I refuse?

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:16.534 position:50% align:center
Well, that's simple. Then you'll
just have to play with me.

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:18.578 position:50% align:center
Beelzebub.

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.375 position:50% align:center
All right, so be it.
How unfortunate for you.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:27.545 position:50% align:center
You've never been one
to listen to anyone else.

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:29.547 position:50% align:center
Wait, Elliot, please don't.

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:33.051 position:50% align:center
Everything will be fine, Karen.

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:34.636 position:50% align:center
Now that I think of it,

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.306 position:50% align:center
this is actually the first time
we've ever faced off, isn't it?

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.976 position:50% align:center
[WESTCOTT] Yeah. I'm pretty
stressed out, as you can see.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.980 position:50% align:center
Shaking in my boots at the
very thought. Shall we?

So that's Mukuro?

Deploy Protect Territory!

Odd.

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:06.579 position:50% align:center
Hey, check it out, Shido.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.998 position:50% align:center
You can get to your girl
without a spacesuit.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50% align:center
You ready? It's do
or die time, now.

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.378 position:50% align:center

[KOTORI]
Goetia.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.140 position:50% align:center
She sure got us good back before
history was changed, but now?

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
I'm thrilled to see we're
gonna get a shot at revenge.

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:32.063 position:50% align:center
Deploy Dual Territory:
Spatial Control and Defense!

Sir!

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.317 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Time to teleport.
Mukuro's all yours, Shido.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] Leave it to me!
Stay safe, everybody!

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.412 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
You're Shido, is that correct?

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:51.666 position:50% align:center
I already told you:
Muku doesn't want to be saved.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.793 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] The thing is,
I didn't actually come here

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
to talk with you, though.
I'm here for the real Mukuro.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
The one whose
heart isn't locked.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.217 position:50% align:center
Seems pretty silly
since it was Muku

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.136 position:50% align:center
who locked Muku's own heart.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.348 position:50% align:center
Have you ever considered minding
your own business, perhaps?

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50% align:center
Look. It doesn't make sense
to lock your own heart.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
So, what happened
that made you--?

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO] You are, of course,
free to disregard my warning.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
Just as Muku is free to
deal with that rudeness

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
in whatever way I
deem appropriate.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
As if I'd just hang out

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
and let my big brother get hurt!

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:29.704 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
You're the best, Kotori!

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Duh.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
We're using Territory to detect
and dodge all incoming objects.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50% align:center
[MARIA] But be careful,
don't over-rely on it.

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
You won't last getting
hit by an Angel.

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center
Got it! Thanks! Guys, you rock!

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
Haniel!

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Huh. Interesting.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center
An Angel you stole from
a Spirit, I suppose?

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.938 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Kinda harsh to say I stole it.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center
I mean, come on, I'm borrowing
it to save you! Kaleidoscope!

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
What's happening?

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
 Mukuro, I'm gonna open
your heart with this!

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center
Commander,
it's the Bandersnatch.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50% align:center
That's not all, either!
This response is...!

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
Artemisia Ashcroft.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
Kotori!

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
We're gonna get out
and fight, too.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.343 position:50% align:center
I'll help! Don't forget me!

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:27.554 position:50% align:center
We'll make the wind blow like
nothing they've ever seen,

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
even out here in
the airless sky!

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.850 position:50% align:center
Concur. One thing we
won't do is sit around

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.768 position:50% align:center
and do nothing
while this happens.

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Hmm. Well, then, so be it.

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
I was hoping to keep you
guys out of the fight

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
for as long as possible, but...

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:44.946 position:50% align:center
MARIA, it's time for <i>that</i> .
Origami can handle it, for sure.

That's the
A-W-1-1-1, Brunhild.

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50% align:center
It's our latest model.
Put it to good use.

[ALL grunt]

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:10.930 position:50% align:center
That's a Territory hit!
No damage, though!

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.016 position:50% align:center
Gosh, not even a
greeting first?

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
Now that's a low blow, I'd say.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
There's a transmission.
Receiving.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:21.358 position:50% align:center
So we meet again,
Kotori Itsuka.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
What do you want, Ellen Mathers?

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
Our surrender? Is that really
what you're holding out for?

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.406 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's correct.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
I see you have a new ship,
but it's useless.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center
You have to know that.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
I'll wreck it again
without hesitation.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.541 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Yeah, no doubt.
We can't be naÃ¯ve about that.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.794 position:50% align:center
And there's no way they're
unaware that in the other world,

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
Fraxinus was
destroyed by Goetia.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.926 position:50% align:center
Beelzebub's power
is impressive, indeed.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.386 position:50% align:center
How nice for you.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center
The boss must be in a good mood.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
Good instincts. It's true.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.851 position:50% align:center
His spirits have been
uncharacteristically high.

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Well, yeah,
that's pretty obvious.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, he wouldn't be out
here invading enemy bases

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
by himself.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
[ELLEN gasps]
Wait, what did you say?

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
Ike attacked Ratatoskr?

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Oh wow, you mean
you didn't know? Weird!

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.492 position:50% align:center
Here I was thinking you
two were super tight,

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
but I guess he doesn't
actually trust you.

[ELLEN gasps]

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center
If you think I'm lying,
go check it out for yourself.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
Or are you scared
to know the truth?

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
Trying to rile me won't work.
Save your breath.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:28.383 position:50% align:center
I'll just plan to look into it
once this battle is over.

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:31.261 position:50% align:center
It won't take me more
than five minutes.

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:37.434 position:50% align:center

the move to surround.

Okay, change of plans:

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
only Tohka and Origami go out.
Everyone else, standby.

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50% align:center
Aww! Why? I wanna go, too!

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center

help in the way of backup.

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.612 position:50% align:center
Don't sweat it, guys.
I've got a plan.

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
So for now, please just
do as I say.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:56.202 position:50% align:center
Go ahead. Bring it on,
dear rival o' mine.

power of the new Fraxinus.

How strange. Are you positive
that you're truly human?

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, that's what I like
to tell myself, at least!

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:27.025 position:50% align:center
And now, Artemisia Ashcroft?

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center

I'll be taking that Spirit!

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:21.244 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] You definitely
just said, "lick"!

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
[ALL cheer, laugh]

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.040 position:50% align:center
Hello, my darling!

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:27.876 position:50% align:center
I've come here to wash your
back and whatever else!

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center
Shido! How are you?

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
Still the same?
I'm here to help, okay?

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:33.757 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy to find you
in the healing bath.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
Isn't it just great?

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
Reminisce. When it comes
to bathing together,

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.637 position:50% align:center
you're gonna want the
Yamai Sisters every time.

00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
That's for sure.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone. Keep in mind
Shido came here to heal,

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:46.519 position:50% align:center
so let's not forget
that, all right?

00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:48.021 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's clear.

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
Not all of us were needed to
assist Shido with his bath.

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINO giggles]
It's true.

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
But bathing together with
everyone still sounds fun to me!

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
I just had a brilliant idea!
How 'bout if you and Yoshino

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
take turns washing
each other's backs?

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
[NATSUMI gasps]
You're serious, though?

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:02.994 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't mind?

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
Ah! Let me tell you.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center
These cuties make for
such a killer view!

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:12.754 position:50% align:center
[ALL laughing, shouting]

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.423 position:50% align:center
Look at you!

00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
Yes, we may have shaken hands
a little bit too hard.

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
I guess Elliot was excited
to see me, though.

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't anyone be,
you know?

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
[ELLEN] So, what you're
saying is, it's the truth?

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
You attacked Ratatoskr's base
without telling me a thing?

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Unfortunately, though,

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:35.110 position:50% align:center
I seem to have allowed Elliot
to slip right out of my reach.

00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
Oh, and your little sister, too.

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
Still, with Realizers,

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:43.201 position:50% align:center
I should be back up
on my feet tomorrow.

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
You didn't fare so
well yourself, either,

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:47.038 position:50% align:center
did you, Ellen?

00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
I accept that due to my own
shortcomings, I fully deserve

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:53.169 position:50% align:center
whatever punishment there
might be in store for me.

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
But, listen, Ike, I really do
think you owe me an explanation.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:21:00.343 position:50% align:center
How could you not have
told me that about Elliot?

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
Tell me this. If I'd brought
you, isn't it safe to assume

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:06.182 position:50% align:center
you would've killed
Elliot without question?

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:07.475 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Ready to go, Shido?

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:19.112 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but where're we going?
Where am I meeting Mukuro?

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
Am I heading back to space?

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.533 position:50% align:center
That's the big question,
isn't it?

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
I mean, she said she'd come
back so we feel pretty certain

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:28.079 position:50% align:center
that she will, but still...

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI gasps]

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:31.624 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Hello. It's time, Mister.

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps, shouts]

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Shido!

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:49.476 position:50% align:center
You see? Here we are
on the surface,

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:52.020 position:50% align:center
just exactly like
you wanted, right?

00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:54.522 position:50% align:center
Do you remember? You said
there were lots of fun things

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:57.275 position:50% align:center
for people to do down here!

00:21:57.359 --> 00:22:00.528 position:50% align:center
So! Let's get going,
shall we, mister?

00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:39.586 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Shido has succeeded
in opening Mukuro's heart.

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.254 position:50% align:center
And as a new battle begins,

00:23:41.338 --> 00:23:44.090 position:50% align:center
a brand-new Origami and
Tohka come to life.

00:23:44.174 --> 00:23:46.843 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Locked Memories."

[MUKURO]
Be tasty! Moe Moe Kyun!
