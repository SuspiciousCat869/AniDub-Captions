Well, I hope.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
Indeed, very well.

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center line:84%

I'm sure you're right,

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:48.468 position:50% align:center line:84%
In fact, I'd love
the opportunity

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center line:84%
to give Shido something.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:52.972 position:50% align:center line:84%
Would you just stop?
You're clearly disappointed.

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:55.767 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, that's it, then.
Kurumi plans to win their battle

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.061 position:50% align:center line:84%
by taking him on
a Valentine's date.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:01.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
And if Darling loses,
she'll take his Spirit power

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.608 position:50% align:center line:84%
away from him,
and then, his very life.

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.193 position:50% align:center line:84%
He won't admit defeat.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center line:84%
I just don't think
Shido would do that.

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not if doing so could
possibly cost him his life.

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center line:84%
And here's the thing,
Kurumi would never risk

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
challenging him unless she
truly believed she could win.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:19.958 position:50% align:center line:84%
The way I see it, we have two
plays here: The first one being

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
that all of us would give
him chocolate, too.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, I get it,
drown her out, huh?

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50% align:center line:84%
Like it... I mean,
it makes sense.

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center line:84%
If Kurumin randomly
gave me chocolate,

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm fairly certain
I'd fall for her, too.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.264 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's a smart move,

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.891 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I was already planning
to give him some.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:40.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, that leads us to
the other possible play.

Referring to us as "DEM's thing"

on to the next plan.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center line:84%
Reine gathered these
ingredients for us.

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:35.417 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you don't know what to do,
feel free to ask me or Reine.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.835 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's a lot.

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:39.879 position:50% align:center line:84%
There are, like, so many
ingredients to choose from.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:44.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
Excuse me, what is the
difference between

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.385 position:50% align:center line:84%
the light and dark?

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:47.929 position:50% align:center line:84%
Can you explain
it to me, please?

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh? Oh, right. Well, uh--

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's about the milk
to cocoa ratio.

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:57.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, basically, darker means
it's more bitter,

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center line:84%
whereas lighter
means its sweeter.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.693 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's the gist of it.

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center line:84%
Okay. Now I get it.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.822 position:50% align:center line:84%
And now I've
learned something.

of chocolate will you make?

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:15.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, just melting it
into a shape feels

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
so run of the mill

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center line:84%
I want to make some
chocolate that I can drizzle

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:49.699 position:50% align:center line:84%
over my entire body.

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NIA] I've been thinking I'd
like to make him some 

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center line:84%
super-energy-boost bars!
What should go in them?

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.040 position:50% align:center line:84%
Maybe Kale or some kind
of tea or something--

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just make normal chocolate!

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
What're you making?

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.677 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's silicone for--
for a mold casing.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't get it, a mold of what?

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:12.305 position:50% align:center line:84%
Me, of course.

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI groans]

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.352 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see. And I hear you,

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center line:84%
but there is one problem if
you choose that route.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.898 position:50% align:center line:84%
Another one?

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.109 position:50% align:center line:84%
[REINE] If you really think
about how much sheer volume

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center line:84%
there is to a human body,

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:29.197 position:50% align:center line:84%
considering the dimensions,
Shin would end up consuming

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center line:84%
quite an excessive
amount of sugar.

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ORIGAMI gasps] I hadn't
even considered that.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.788 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm ashamed.

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, you've just been too
busy thinking about Shin.

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:43.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
Next time, you might want to try
keeping his health in mind,

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center line:84%
as well.

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ORIGAMI grunts] All right.
I see what I have to do now.

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.301 position:50% align:center line:84%
Size down, but maintain quality.

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:52.887 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI sighs]

00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:56.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am so sorry to drag you
into this on your one day off.

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks, though.

00:16:57.642 --> 00:17:01.938 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, um, I've always wondered
about something, Reine:

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:05.150 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why is it I've only ever heard
you refer to Shido as Shin?

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:06.943 position:50% align:center line:84%
How did that start?

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:10.572 position:50% align:center line:84%
[REINE] Hm. When we met,
I made the honest mistake

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
of thinking his
name was Shintaro.

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:16.703 position:50% align:center line:84%
It stuck, and I've been calling
him that ever since.

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see. I guess that makes sense.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now then, I should get
started on mine.

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center line:84%
I think I've procrastinated
quite long enough.

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seriously? But, like,
who is it for?

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, there's the Fraxinus crew,

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:34.971 position:50% align:center line:84%
and my colleagues at Raizen,
and Shin, too, of course.

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aw, now I get it. I thought
maybe you'd finally found

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:39.851 position:50% align:center line:84%
someone special
after all this time!

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm very sorry to disappoint
you, but I'm afraid not.

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's no one like that
for me these days.

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center line:84%
Confirmation. You just
specifically said, "these days."

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.989 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, that's right! So there was
someone you liked in the past.

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.282 position:50% align:center line:84%
Spill the beans!

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:57.202 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[KOTORI] Really?
--[NATSUMI] Are you serious?

00:17:57.285 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center line:84%
[REINE] Mm. Yes. I loved
once and only once.

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALL]
Ooh!

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center line:84%
This blows my mind.
What were they like?

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center line:84%
If somebody earned
Reine's admiration,

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:13.259 position:50% align:center line:84%
then I bet they
were just lovely.

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:16.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, he really was.
He was extremely kind.

00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:19.766 position:50% align:center line:84%
And such a thoughtful person.

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
No one else, past or future,
could ever stand a chance

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center line:84%
of surpassing his
place in my heart.

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center line:84%
He was my very first love and I
feel sure he will be my last.

00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI giggles] What a
beautiful story, Ms. Murasame.

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center line:84%
And heartbreaking, too.
I'll admit, I almost envy you.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why is she here?

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:49.713 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] I see. So, this is
where you've been living, is it?

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:53.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
How lovely, it's exactly
as I imagined.

00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:56.594 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I can be really honest here,
I was actually already planning

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center line:84%
on giving Shido a bunch
chocolate on the day.

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:03.143 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you don't mind, may I join
you in your preparations?

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MUKURO, MIKU, YOSHINO gasp]

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center line:84%
Okay. Sure, you can join us.

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:13.278 position:50% align:center line:84%
I concur. It's a perfect
chance to gather some data.

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can go ahead and
return to Fraxinus.

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, please do.

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:22.370 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wonderful. That was a lot easier
than I thought it would be.

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center line:84%
And since I have your
permission, I'll get started.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center line:84%
I hope you're prepared for this.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because Shido's heart
is going to be all mine.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, that's not happening!
I'll protect Shido myself!

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:35.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
Same. I'll do my best, too!

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center line:84%
This won't go
your way, you know.

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:42.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, we'll see. But be warned,
I won't go down easily.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:48.980 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOHKA] So, Kotori,
how exactly do I start?

00:19:49.064 --> 00:19:53.068 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, Kotori? How does a person
even go about melting chocolate?

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI gasps]
Great question! Let's see.

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.782 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, my goodness, Kotori.

00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:01.993 position:50% align:center line:84%
Could it be that this is your
first time tempering chocolate?

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center line:84%
What? No way! Of course
I've done it before!

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI] Tempering?

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:13.213 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]
Tempering...? Temper.

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:15.298 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI]
Temper!

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh? Temper? Not me.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, it's nothing!
You can ignore me.

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
[grunts]

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center line:84%
'Course I can melt chocolate.
It's as easy as this!

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center line:84%
Turn that heat down, quick!

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just take the pot off the stove!

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:36.653 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ah! That's hot!

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
My, my...

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center line:84%
Man, this sucks.

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:42.784 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, tell me this, Origami,
you seem as if you actually know

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
how to make chocolate,
is that correct?

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:50.709 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sorry, what?

00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI groans]

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:54.337 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, um, Kotori?

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:55.797 position:50% align:center line:84%
What is it?

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.882 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, um, I was thinking.

00:20:57.966 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center line:84%
While it's true that I'm not
yet super confident,

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:04.055 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm pretty sure I at least know
the basics for getting started.

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:07.267 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI gasps]
You're the best!

Wow, thanks so much, everyone!

much chocolate before!

Hey, Mister, you can't let
yourself lose to that girl!

chocolate at school, too.

meaningful demise.

And my sake.

00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:01.363 position:50% align:center line:84%

Tokisaki was a normal human.

as "The Worst Spirit",
