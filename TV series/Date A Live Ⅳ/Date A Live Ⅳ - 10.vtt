Referring to us as "DEM's thing"

kinda pointless.

on to the next plan.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center line:84%
Reine gathered these
ingredients for us.

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:35.417 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you don't know what to do,
feel free to ask me or Reine.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.835 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's a lot.

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:39.879 position:50% align:center line:84%
There are, like, so many
ingredients to choose from.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:44.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
Excuse me, what is the
difference between

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.385 position:50% align:center line:84%
the light and dark?

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:47.929 position:50% align:center line:84%
Can you explain
it to me, please?

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh? Oh, right. Well, uh--

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's about the milk
to cocoa ratio.

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:57.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, basically, darker means
it's more bitter,

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center line:84%
whereas lighter
means its sweeter.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.693 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's the gist of it.

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center line:84%
Okay. Now I get it.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.822 position:50% align:center line:84%
And now I've
learned something.

Thanks, Reine. You're the best.

of chocolate will you make?

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:15.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, just melting it
into a shape feels

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
so run of the mill
and uninspired now.
