Kotori, what do you
think I should do?

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.270 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] To be honest,
I'm not so sure, myself.

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.814 position:50% align:center
This is a bit unexpected.

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:25.692 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean, if you
really think about it,

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:29.571 position:50% align:center
anime and manga characters
are actually ideal companions.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:32.282 position:50% align:center
When you compare a fictional
character to a real person,

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.951 position:50% align:center
reality will always
be a letdown.

Interesting. You speaking
from experience?

Tsk, tsk, tsk. Come on.

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center
I do like voice actresses,
too, Commander.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.711 position:50% align:center
Oh, shocker.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Commander, didn't Nia
mention that she liked

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
a particular character?

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.469 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Tokiya.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.512 position:50% align:center
Yes, you're right.

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50% align:center
Okay, Shido, help is on the way.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.851 position:50% align:center
Just follow my plan
to the letter.

He's taking forever.

strategizing with Kotori.

Yes, and who's fault is that?

But Commander. While it's
true that the plan failed,

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
the fact that her levels
rose is undeniable.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:38.945 position:50% align:center
Precisely right.
It wasn't totally futile.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.364 position:50% align:center
Because now we know for certain
that if a character she

really likes is brought to life,

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:46.453 position:50% align:center
it's possible to raise her

Good news, here.
Happiness is rising steadily.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
Once Nia finally gets her
fill of playing the game,

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
then we can have Shido
appear before her again,

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
but this time he'll be "Itsuki".

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, seeing as
how it's actually him,

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.121 position:50% align:center
there'll be nothing
to screw up.

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:41.795 position:50% align:center
[NIA] Ah. Incredible!
Bummer that this is just a demo.

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:45.757 position:50% align:center

buy myself the real version.

I wonder if this publisher
has made anything else?

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center

Not a big surprise, though.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.491 position:50% align:center
Think about it.
You'd be pissed, too.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.536 position:50% align:center
You guys used a fake game
to basically spy on her.

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50% align:center

Uh... Well, I uh...

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:25.672 position:50% align:center
I was curious about that, too.

see if she might've had

This might be an
obvious question,

but couldn't we make
Shido suit her preferences?

talking about 2D, here.

Here's another idea.

What if I tried making him
into a manga page with Haniel?

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.193 position:50% align:center
I think it could work.

See, I think Natsumi
has the right idea.

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
Let's put Shido on a manga page.

[ALL
Huh?!

00:08:58.663 --> 00:08:59.914 position:50% align:center

suggest that we not transform

Shido himself, but instead,

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.836 position:50% align:center
make a manga where Shido
is a central character.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.838 position:50% align:center
That could work.

[SHIDO yelps]

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:09.215 position:50% align:center
I get it!

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
And that's a much safer
way of making him 2D!

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
Right! It'll be fine as long
as we write stuff that's true.

That's gonna be
the key to success.

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
Yes, that makes sense.

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
If Nia was to learn
all the details

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
about everything Shido's done
for us, I'm sure she would

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
end up liking Shido
the same way we do.

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
You guys... Are you serious?

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:31.154 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA gasps]
Shido's gonna be in a manga!

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.698 position:50% align:center
That's so awesome!
I definitely wanna help!

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
Agreement. After tying
in our 39th match,

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
the "Best Manga
Submission" competition,

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center
the two of us are due to put
our skills back to the test.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
Well, past due, I'd say.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.879 position:50% align:center
You guys must be exhausted
from all that competing.

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:50.173 position:50% align:center
--[beeping]
--Huh? The outside line?

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50% align:center
I wonder who it is?

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
[NIA] Yo! Still plotting
away, are we?

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:58.765 position:50% align:center
I had Raziel tell me
about this line

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
and about what you're
busily planning.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
Tell me this.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center
Even if you all do succeed
in making a manga,

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
why would you just
take it for granted

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
that I would ever bother
myself with reading it?

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.196 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
Sure. I might've taken a look
at it before, 'cause why not?

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:17.742 position:50% align:center
But now, thanks to you people,

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
I'm smack in the middle
of "angry mode".

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
And with Comico coming up soon,

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
I can't afford to waste
any precious time.

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
Comico? Seriously?
You're entering Comico?

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
That's right.
My first in five years.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
Miku, can you explain
what Comico is?

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
Comic Colosseum.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
It's a convention for people
with like minds to gather,

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
and to sell all the
<i>doujinshi</i> that they create.

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] So, if our manga
was worth reading,

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
would you actually commit

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
to taking the time to
sit down and read it?

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Huh?

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] For example,
if our manga manages to sell

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
more copies than
yours at Comico.

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.862 position:50% align:center
Would you possibly agree
to read it at that point?

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:57.323 position:50% align:center
Wait. Are you actually serious?

00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Yeah. Let's make it official.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.412 position:50% align:center
If we end up winning,
you have to read our manga.

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
[NIA laughs]

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:10.045 position:50% align:center
Okay! You are so on!

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:11.880 position:50% align:center
So, you really do think
you guys can beat

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
Souji Honjo, do you?

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:17.052 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]
Kotori, what was that?

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Hm. Don't worry.
You know me, I've got a plan.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
[NIA sighs]
Man. They underestimate me.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50% align:center
How could they possibly think
they could beat a pro like me?

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50% align:center
It's not as if I could
like a real person anyway,

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
regardless of what happens here.
No doubt about that.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
And besides, let's be real,

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:46.956 position:50% align:center
it's not like anyone would
end up liking me, either.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI] That's the
all-knowing Angel, Raziel.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.838 position:50% align:center
The book, is it not?

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
[NIA gasps, grunts]

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
It's very nice to
meet you, Nia Honjo.

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Kurumi Tokisaki.

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Hm...

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:27.914 position:50% align:center
Kurumi Tokisaki, the Spirit
who manipulates time.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.001 position:50% align:center
Now I see. You must be the
one who saved me from DEM,

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.460 position:50% align:center
am I right?

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center
How nice, that saves me the
trouble of an explanation.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
I'm aware that you're the second
Spirit to be seen after the

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
"Spirit of Origin".

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:42.595 position:50% align:center
You have no idea how I've
been longing to meet you.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Hm? And why's that, exactly?

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:48.768 position:50% align:center
Please don't worry,
there's no need to be on guard.

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:52.105 position:50% align:center
I just came here to ask a favor
of you, if you wouldn't mind.

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Hm.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
I would be so appreciative
if you could look into

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
something with Raziel.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:01.448 position:50% align:center
I'd like for you to find out
about the Spirit of Origin.

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
Especially... how one
goes about killing it.

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.500 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA gasps]
Look how fancy we are!

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.878 position:50% align:center
"Professional", that's us.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center
You know Comico's
in two days, right?

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center
You really think we
can do this in time?

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:21.343 position:50% align:center
Afraid we'll have to.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
First we need to see how well
everyone draws though.

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
And you've gotta
draw something, too, okay?

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
Wait, me?

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.395 position:50% align:center
You used to sketch all the time
if I'm remembering correctly.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:35.440 position:50% align:center
The Black Knight,
Lievan, or something?

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
[gasps, yells]

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
If you're done drawing,
let's see them!

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Aw, look. Yeah, very cute.

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but unfortunately,

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.211 position:50% align:center
I don't think it'll work
for us this time.

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:58.755 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA sighs]
Oh, okay.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry, Tohka.

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI, MIKU gasp]

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.429 position:50% align:center
Next one! Next!

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
That's not fair,
though, my darling!

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.145 position:50% align:center
Whoa! You guys are
actually pretty darn good!

00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:16.272 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so far there's
no doubt that you two

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:19.651 position:50% align:center
are the best candidates.
So, who's up next?

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
[yelps]
What did you draw, Origami?

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
Oh, that. It's just Shido
and me becoming one.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.869 position:50% align:center
No one said to
draw pornography!

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
True, but if we're attempting
to sell <i>doujinshi</i> ,

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
going 18-plus is the
smartest thing to do.

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:38.211 position:50% align:center
Maybe you weren't aware
that we're actually planning

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
to enter as a
"General Audience" booth.

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.508 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's up with
you all of a sudden?

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:45.844 position:50% align:center
If you drew something,
let's see it. C'mon.

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50% align:center
[NATSUMI whimpers]
Listen, it's really bad,

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:50.223 position:50% align:center
so don't expect too much, okay?

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:53.018 position:50% align:center
First of all, I didn't sleep
well at all last night,

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:55.937 position:50% align:center
and I just haven't
drawn in forever.

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Okay, fine, but
c'mon, just show us already!

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
[NATSUMI whines]

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
Incredible work, Natsumi!

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you
had such skill!

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not sure
I'd call it "skill".

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
But I did imitate a
manga artist once,

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:14.205 position:50% align:center
I mean, I only did that because
I thought it would be fun.

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:17.250 position:50% align:center
That settles it!
Natsumi's our main artist.

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:18.752 position:50% align:center
With Yuzuru, Kaguya,

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
Origami, and Shido
supporting her, as well.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Roger that!

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
[NATSUMI] Uh! Are you really
okay with me doing this?

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.346 position:50% align:center
Absolutely! No doubt!

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
We need your talent
to help Nia out.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.062 position:50% align:center
Fine, but don't complain
about it later.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
Kotori, what can the rest of
us do while she's working?

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINO]
Hm.

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry, I have
another job for you guys.

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:45.445 position:50% align:center
In fact, in a way,

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center
it might be even more
important than the manga.

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:49.199 position:50% align:center
[MIKU]
Hm?

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA, YOSHINO]
Huh?

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI CLONE A]
Well, dear me.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
That's rather troubling news,
now isn't it?

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
Yes, so what do
you suppose we do?

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
Hard to say. According to what
I have gleaned from Raziel,

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
even if I managed to
gather Spirit power,

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.684 position:50% align:center
there's still not a realistic
chance that I could stand up

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center
against the Spirit of Origin.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.062 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI CLONES gasp]

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:23.817 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI] Although, he, he, what
does it actually matter, anyway?

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.611 position:50% align:center
Considering I'm the spirit
with power over time.

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
The bottom line is, the notion
of time makes everything else

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
insignificant by comparison.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.998 position:50% align:center
Gah! I keep messing
up on the grid.

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
Shoot! The tears are invading
the white! Unacceptable!

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.045 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same here.

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
The ink spread under the ruler
and made an enormous mess.

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
Uh! It's okay. This can
be fixed, I know it can.

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:53.096 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shido, do you
have a minute?

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.514 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Uh.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
My name's Hiroki Takajo.

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, the manga artist!

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
[REINE]
Yes. Looking into Nia's--

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:05.316 position:50% align:center
that is, Souji Honjo's friends,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.278 position:50% align:center
ended up leading
me right to her.

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:11.114 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I hear that you guys
are relatives of Honjo's,

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
is that true?

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.200 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center
We've been terribly worried
because we're having a lot of

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
trouble getting in
contact with Nia.

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:20.498 position:50% align:center
So we're hoping you can
share anything you know,

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
since we're going to need
some help, for sure.

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.878 position:50% align:center
Honestly, just between
you and me,

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
I've been worried
about her, as well.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
So, needless to say,
I was relieved and overjoyed

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
to hear the news that she's
gone back to making manga.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
But since it seems that
she doesn't like me,

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure if I
can be of any help,

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
regardless of how
much I'd like to.

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI, SHIDO gasp]

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:42.020 position:50% align:center
[HIROKI] At one time, she and
I used to get along

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
as well as two people
possibly could.

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:47.859 position:50% align:center
But then she suddenly changed
and acted cold towards me,

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:50.236 position:50% align:center
so we drifted apart.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
[HIROKI] I've wondered if
I might've done something

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
rude to her without
realizing it at the time.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
Don't misunderstand.
Honjo is naturally a kind,

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
friendly person, but as for her
life before becoming an artist?

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.167 position:50% align:center
She rarely spoke about

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
any of the friends
she had in the past.

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
And I feel like she does this
thing where she'll suddenly

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:11.716 position:50% align:center
distance herself if she starts
sensing there are new friends

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
in the making.

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
Almost like an involuntary
reflex or something.

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
If only I could figure
out exactly what it was

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center
that I did to upset her, I'd
take that chance to apologize,

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center
but as it is, I just don't know.

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
I can't shake the
feeling that Raziel 

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50% align:center
might've played a part in this.

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:32.529 position:50% align:center
Think about it, if you had the
power to know anything,

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
you'd look up every person
who crossed your path,

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
why wouldn't you?

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:39.202 position:50% align:center
So, in Nia's case,

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
that probably made her
unable to trust other people.

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center
To some extent, probably
everyone has done mean things

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
behind people's backs at
some point in their lives.

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
You'd realize how gross and
pathetic people are in no time.

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.803 position:50% align:center
So, she only opens
her heart to 2D,

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.305 position:50% align:center
because maybe she recognizes
that they're the only ones

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
she can be sure
won't betray her.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:02.976 position:50% align:center
That's so sad.

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.894 position:50% align:center
You think that's all it is?

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
I mean, I get that Raziel
shows her people's dark side.

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
But knowing Nia's personality,
I have a feeling she might

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:16.239 position:50% align:center
be more likely to
look past that.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:19.409 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's focus
on the <i>doujinshi</i> .

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
We need another chance
to talk with Nia.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
Without that, we'll get nowhere.

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:42.682 position:50% align:center
Finally! I've finished
page 57 at last!

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:45.393 position:50% align:center
Nice timing. I just
finished page 58, too.

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA laughs] I, whom only
hurricanes can subdue,

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
have now finished
the final page!

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.234 position:50% align:center
Check this out!

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center
Gather up. I'll start
scanning in all of our pages

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:58.948 position:50% align:center
and turn them into
one big digital file.

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
When you factor in all
the editing and printing,

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
it's definitely gonna
be a close one.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.582 position:50% align:center
Been working hard, huh, Shido?

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
Just look at you.
You look exhausted, too.

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
What've you been up to, anyway?

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:16.466 position:50% align:center
Sorry, that's a secret, Shido!

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
Look forward to it, 'kay?

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:22.055 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, are you
all right, Natsumi?

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
Natsumi, you should think
about taking a break.

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:30.355 position:50% align:center
Huh...? Mm.

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
Swap out. You've been working
non-stop ever since we started.

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
[NATSUMI] Mm-mm. No, it's fine.
I'm almost done.

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:42.200 position:50% align:center
But you've done
the storyboard, the draft...

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:43.993 position:50% align:center
You've worked harder
than anyone else.

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
That's right, Natsumi.

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
The convention
is the real battle.

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:50.000 position:50% align:center
You should really
leave the rest to us.

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:51.334 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
You've worked way too hard
on all of this, Natsumi.

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:56.131 position:50% align:center
Rest is important, too.

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:57.674 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
I know I won't be that much
use at the convention itself.

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
This is about all I
can do, so, I figure.

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:05.890 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] 
Okay, but...

00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:07.976 position:50% align:center
The thing is,
I'm really grateful

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:11.521 position:50% align:center
and happy that I was saved
by all of you guys before.

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
And this time,
I realized I can finally

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:17.444 position:50% align:center
do my part to pay it forward
and help another Spirit.

00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
And that makes me feel...
happier than ever.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
So, what I'm doing is nothing.

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
And I plan on showing
that silly-head, Nia, too.

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:31.916 position:50% align:center
Having friends is
the best thing ever.

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:39.424 position:50% align:center
All right, that's...
the last one.

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:41.092 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Natsumi?

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
Excellent work, Natsumi.

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:48.099 position:50% align:center
[ALL chuckle softly]

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:56.066 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Hm! And now we have our weapon.

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:59.986 position:50% align:center
Guys, we've gotta win,
no matter what!

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:03.323 position:50% align:center
Now then, let's begin
our date, shall we?

00:23:35.457 --> 00:23:37.208 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The <i>doujinshi</i> convention!

00:23:37.292 --> 00:23:39.002 position:50% align:center
It's a battle of passion!

00:23:39.085 --> 00:23:41.504 position:50% align:center
Full of untold thrills
and excitement!

00:23:41.588 --> 00:23:44.799 position:50% align:center
The love and fervor of artists
heats up the winter cold!

Next time:
"What's Yours Is Mine."

Westcott's intentions are
finally known.
