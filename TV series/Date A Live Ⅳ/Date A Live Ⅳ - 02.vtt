00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
Yes, that makes sense.

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
If Nia was to learn
all the details

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
about everything Shido's done
for us, I'm sure she would

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
end up liking Shido
the same way we do.

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
You guys... Are you serious?

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:31.154 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA gasps]
Shido's gonna be in a manga!

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.698 position:50% align:center
That's so awesome!
I definitely wanna help!

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
Agreement. After tying
in our 39th match,

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
the "Best Manga
Submission" competition,

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center
the two of us are due to put
our skills back to the test.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
Well, past due, I'd say.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.879 position:50% align:center
You guys must be exhausted
from all that competing.

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:50.173 position:50% align:center
--[beeping]
--Huh? The outside line?

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50% align:center
I wonder who it is?

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
[NIA] Yo! Still plotting
away, are we?

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:58.765 position:50% align:center
I had Raziel tell me
about this line

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
and about what you're
busily planning.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
Tell me this.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center
Even if you all do succeed
in making a manga,

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
why would you just
take it for granted

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
that I would ever bother
myself with reading it?

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.196 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
Sure. I might've taken a look
at it before, 'cause why not?

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:17.742 position:50% align:center
But now, thanks to you people,

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
I'm smack in the middle
of "angry mode".

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
And with Comico coming up soon,

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
I can't afford to waste
any precious time.

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
Comico? Seriously?
You're entering Comico?

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
That's right.
My first in five years.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
Miku, can you explain
what Comico is?

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
Comic Colosseum.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
It's a convention for people
with like minds to gather,

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
and to sell all the
<i>doujinshi</i> that they create.

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] So, if our manga
was worth reading,

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
would you actually commit

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
to taking the time to
sit down and read it?

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Huh?

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] For example,
if our manga manages to sell

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
more copies than
yours at Comico.

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.862 position:50% align:center
Would you possibly agree
to read it at that point?

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:57.323 position:50% align:center
Wait. Are you actually serious?

00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Yeah. Let's make it official.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.412 position:50% align:center
If we end up winning,
you have to read our manga.

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
[NIA laughs]

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:10.045 position:50% align:center
Okay! You are so on!

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:11.880 position:50% align:center
So, you really do think
you guys can beat

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
Souji Honjo, do you?

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:17.052 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]
Kotori, what was that?

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Hm. Don't worry.
You know me, I've got a plan.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
[NIA sighs]
Man. They underestimate me.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50% align:center
How could they possibly think
they could beat a pro like me?

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50% align:center
It's not as if I could
like a real person anyway,

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
regardless of what happens here.
No doubt about that.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
And besides, let's be real,

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:46.956 position:50% align:center
it's not like anyone would
end up liking me, either.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI] That's the
all-knowing Angel, Raziel.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.838 position:50% align:center
The book, is it not?

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
[NIA gasps, grunts]

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
It's very nice to
meet you, Nia Honjo.

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Kurumi Tokisaki.

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Hm...

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:27.914 position:50% align:center
Kurumi Tokisaki, the Spirit
who manipulates time.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.001 position:50% align:center
Now I see. You must be the
one who saved me from DEM,

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.460 position:50% align:center
am I right?

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center
How nice, that saves me the
trouble of an explanation.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
I'm aware that you're the second
Spirit to be seen after the

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
"Spirit of Origin".

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:42.595 position:50% align:center
You have no idea how I've
been longing to meet you.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Hm? And why's that, exactly?

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:48.768 position:50% align:center
Please don't worry,
there's no need to be on guard.

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:52.105 position:50% align:center
I just came here to ask a favor
of you, if you wouldn't mind.

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Hm.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
I would be so appreciative
if you could look into

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
something with Raziel.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:01.448 position:50% align:center
I'd like for you to find out
about the Spirit of Origin.

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
Especially... how one
goes about killing it.

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.500 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA gasps]
Look how fancy we are!

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.878 position:50% align:center
"Professional", that's us.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center
You know Comico's
in two days, right?

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center
You really think we
can do this in time?

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:21.343 position:50% align:center
Afraid we'll have to.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
First we need to see how well
everyone draws though.

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
And you've gotta
draw something, too, okay?

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
Wait, me?

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.395 position:50% align:center
You used to sketch all the time
if I'm remembering correctly.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:35.440 position:50% align:center
The Black Knight,
Lievan, or something?

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
[gasps, yells]

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
If you're done drawing,
let's see them!

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Aw, look. Yeah, very cute.

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but unfortunately,

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.211 position:50% align:center
I don't think it'll work
for us this time.

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:58.755 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA sighs]
Oh, okay.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry, Tohka.

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI, MIKU gasp]

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.429 position:50% align:center
Next one! Next!

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
That's not fair,
though, my darling!

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.145 position:50% align:center
Whoa! You guys are
actually pretty darn good!

00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:16.272 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so far there's
no doubt that you two

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:19.651 position:50% align:center
are the best candidates.
So, who's up next?

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
[yelps]
What did you draw, Origami?

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
Oh, that. It's just Shido
and me becoming one.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.869 position:50% align:center
No one said to
draw pornography!

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
True, but if we're attempting
to sell <i>doujinshi</i> ,

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
going 18-plus is the
smartest thing to do.

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:38.211 position:50% align:center
Maybe you weren't aware
that we're actually planning

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
to enter as a
"General Audience" booth.

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.508 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's up with
you all of a sudden?

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:45.844 position:50% align:center
If you drew something,
let's see it. C'mon.

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50% align:center
[NATSUMI whimpers]
Listen, it's really bad,

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:50.223 position:50% align:center
so don't expect too much, okay?

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:53.018 position:50% align:center
First of all, I didn't sleep
well at all last night,

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:55.937 position:50% align:center
and I just haven't
drawn in forever.

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Okay, fine, but
c'mon, just show us already!

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
[NATSUMI whines]

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
Incredible work, Natsumi!

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you
had such skill!

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not sure
I'd call it "skill".

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
But I did imitate a
manga artist once,

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:14.205 position:50% align:center
I mean, I only did that because
I thought it would be fun.

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:17.250 position:50% align:center
That settles it!
Natsumi's our main artist.

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:18.752 position:50% align:center
With Yuzuru, Kaguya,

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
Origami, and Shido
supporting her, as well.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Roger that!

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
[NATSUMI] Uh! Are you really
okay with me doing this?

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.346 position:50% align:center
Absolutely! No doubt!

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
We need your talent
to help Nia out.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.062 position:50% align:center
Fine, but don't complain
about it later.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
Kotori, what can the rest of
us do while she's working?

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINO]
Hm.

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry, I have
another job for you guys.

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:45.445 position:50% align:center
In fact, in a way,

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center
it might be even more
important than the manga.

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:49.199 position:50% align:center
[MIKU]
Hm?

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA, YOSHINO]
Huh?

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI CLONE A]
Well, dear me.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
That's rather troubling news,
now isn't it?

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
Yes, so what do
you suppose we do?

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
Hard to say. According to what
I have gleaned from Raziel,

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
even if I managed to
gather Spirit power,

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.684 position:50% align:center
there's still not a realistic
chance that I could stand up

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center
against the Spirit of Origin.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.062 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI CLONES gasp]

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:23.817 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI] Although, he, he, what
does it actually matter, anyway?

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.611 position:50% align:center
Considering I'm the spirit
with power over time.

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
The bottom line is, the notion
of time makes everything else

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
insignificant by comparison.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.998 position:50% align:center
Gah! I keep messing
up on the grid.

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
Shoot! The tears are invading
the white! Unacceptable!

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.045 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same here.

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
The ink spread under the ruler
and made an enormous mess.

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
Uh! It's okay. This can
be fixed, I know it can.

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:53.096 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shido, do you
have a minute?

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.514 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Uh.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
My name's Hiroki Takajo.

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, the manga artist!

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
[REINE]
Yes. Looking into Nia's--

are relatives of Honjo's,

That's right.

We've been terribly worried
because we're having a lot of

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
trouble getting in
contact with Nia.

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:20.498 position:50% align:center

I've been worried
about her, as well.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
So, needless to say,
I was relieved and overjoyed

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
to hear the news that she's
gone back to making manga.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
But since it seems that
she doesn't like me,

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center

can be of any help,

possibly could.

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:47.859 position:50% align:center

and acted cold towards me,

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:50.236 position:50% align:center
so we drifted apart.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
[HIROKI] I've wondered if
I might've done something

rude to her without
realizing it at the time.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
Don't misunderstand.
Honjo is naturally a kind,

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
friendly person, but as for her
life before becoming an artist?

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.167 position:50% align:center
She rarely spoke about

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
any of the friends
she had in the past.

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
And I feel like she does this
thing where she'll suddenly

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:11.716 position:50% align:center
distance herself if she starts
sensing there are new friends

If only I could figure
out exactly what it was

that I did to upset her, I'd
take that chance to apologize,

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center
but as it is, I just don't know.

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
I can't shake the
feeling that Raziel

might've played a part in this.

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:32.529 position:50% align:center
Think about it, if you had the
power to know anything,

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
you'd look up every person
who crossed your path,

Yeah, you're right.

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:39.202 position:50% align:center
So, in Nia's case,

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
that probably made her
unable to trust other people.

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center
To some extent, probably
everyone has done mean things

her heart to 2D,

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.305 position:50% align:center

that they're the only ones

won't betray her.

I mean, I get that Raziel
shows her people's dark side.

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
But knowing Nia's personality,
I have a feeling she might

be more likely to
look past that.
