So... we can't locate
Tohka or Origami, either?

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right. They're definitely
not in east Tengu.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.887 position:50% align:center line:84%
And unfortunately,
we can't use GPS.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center line:84%
They left their phones behind.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.516 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI] Have the other
Spirits had any luck searching?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.601 position:50% align:center line:84%
Anything at all?

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIKIMOTO]
No, nothing thus far.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:09.356 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI] Hm... What are
your thoughts, Reine?

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why would they do that?

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.735 position:50% align:center line:84%
Start acting weird and then
disappear out of nowhere?

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:15.945 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, regardless of
why they did it,

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.573 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's evident that Tohka has
become an Inverse Spirit.

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's the issue here.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center line:84%
As for Origami,
I think what's happened

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:27.499 position:50% align:center line:84%
is that a second personality,
unknown to us, has come forward.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah. The history of this world.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.253 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seems it's been
completely rewritten.

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
And you're right, there are two
personalities inside Origami:

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center line:84%
We've got the Origami
of the previous world,

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:41.262 position:50% align:center line:84%
and now the Origami of
the world that changed.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
But, it's like whenever I
even try to think about it,

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.810 position:50% align:center line:84%
my thoughts get
completely jumbled up.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't understand it,
why is that happening?

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center line:84%
Also, who was it that managed
to change the world, anyway?

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:59.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
And, is it possible it all
revolves around Shido Itsuka?

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARIA] Kotori, I was able to
locate their Spirit waves.

[MARIA] Roger. I'm also
detecting Spirit waves

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center line:84%
from the two others
they're currently with.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm monitoring them.

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:13.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI] What others
are you referring to?

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARIA]
One boy and one girl.

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though, thus far, only the boy's
waves appear to be abnormal.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center line:84%

on down there, guys?

actual hell is happening?

them long to kick us out.

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50% align:center line:84%
Guess I'm not surprised, though.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, Tohka.
What are you, exactly?

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's an Inverse?
Like, what are Spirits, even?

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.817 position:50% align:center line:84%
Honestly, I resent
being called "Inverse".

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.610 position:50% align:center line:84%
I mean, if we're
being technical,

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:03.113 position:50% align:center line:84%
it is the original
form of Spirits.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait. What are you saying?

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.410 position:50% align:center line:84%
When the Spirit of Origin
first created Sephirah,

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.578 position:50% align:center line:84%
the forms they inhabited
then were actually what you

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
would now refer to as "Inverse."

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.125 position:50% align:center line:84%
But they needed to be
compatible with humans,

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50% align:center line:84%
so they were
subsequently "refined."

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.172 position:50% align:center line:84%
They--wait, hold on a minute!
The Spirit of Origin what?

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center line:84%
And what do you mean
"compatible with humans".

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.302 position:50% align:center line:84%

You must not mistake me, human.

simply to appease you,

What exactly is "family" to you?

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:16.883 position:50% align:center line:84%
Long ago,

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center line:84%
I used to look up at stars
with my sister, just like this.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.057 position:50% align:center line:84%
That was back before
Muku was a Spirit.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.851 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why didn't I see it for myself?

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why did Muku worry all the time

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
when Sis, Mommy, and Daddy
loved me so much?

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why do we do that to ourselves?

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:40.073 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's natural. Nobody really
wants to be alone.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:41.658 position:50% align:center line:84%
And no one wants
to lose the place

where they feel like
they've always belonged.

You know what?

I feel like Mister is just
the same as Muku.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
That might explain it,

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
why Muku has always felt so
calm and at ease around you.
