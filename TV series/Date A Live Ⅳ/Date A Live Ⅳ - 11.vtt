00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center line:84%

Not a bad job there,
Shido, not bad.

[REINE] Kurumi isn't lying,
by the way.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's obvious she genuinely
enjoyed the date with Shido.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.516 position:50% align:center line:84%
She doesn't seem to have
closed her heart off, either.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
If anything,
she's grown fond of him.

holding her back:

some kind of resolve, or will.

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, that means, we have
some work to do.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:34.866 position:50% align:center line:84%
Until we find what it is,
and root it out,

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm afraid we won't be
able to seal her power.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.456 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see. Her will, huh?

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, uh, Kurumi?

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes? What is it, Shido?

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center line:84%
Could you tell me something?

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:50.674 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you--

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.551 position:50% align:center line:84%

kill the Spirit of Origin?

heard it from Nia, huh?

What a big blabbermouth
she's turned out to be.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center line:84%
The question is,

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:05.605 position:50% align:center line:84%
are you actually prepared to
find out the truth, Shido?

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center line:84%
All about my... everything?

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center line:84%

How about now? Still wanna know?

one of my bases.

You told me you were ready
to learn the truth.

To know everything there is
to know about me and my life.

Inversion? And what's refined?

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center line:84%
Usually, in the beginning,
Sephirah and humans don't meld.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center line:84%
Unable to control its power,
the human tends to go berserk,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center line:84%
and that's to be expected.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, this girl whom you
killed is quite typical.

In order to make Sephirah
compatible with humans,

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:45.412 position:50% align:center line:84%
they must be refined.

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:47.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
The way that's accomplished
is by consistently giving it

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center line:84%
to humans, over and over again.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not that the humans will
ever stop going berserk,

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center line:84%
of course, but gradually, the
Sephirah will become compatible.

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:01.511 position:50% align:center line:84%
And then, a human who
also happens to have a

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
strong affinity will be able to
remain themselves as a Spirit.
