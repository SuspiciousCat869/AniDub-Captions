she was coming, either!

[TOHKA]
Shido! Happy Valentine's Day!

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.812 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, wow. How sweet. Thank you.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:22.731 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sure! I'm proud of these!

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center line:84%
Cool, can I open it right now?

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.526 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOHKA]
Of course, you can!

Is it kinako-flavored?

[TOHKA]
Yup! You better believe it!

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I made 'em for you
with all my heart!

--[KAGUYA giggles]
--[TOHKA] Huh?

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good morning!
Happy Valentine's Day!

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.582 position:50% align:center line:84%
We brought you a
little somethin'.

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:45.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
Two presents. All for you.
We've been waiting on these.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.548 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO]
Thank you. They're awesome.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:50.675 position:50% align:center line:84%

Yes?

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:01.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO]
Uh. There are no words.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.855 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's incredible. Thank you.

I'm glad.

That's really impressive.

[MALE STUDENTS chanting]

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.342 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TONOMACHI] You deserve
every ounce of our hatred,

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.762 position:50% align:center line:84%
and don't you dare pretend
you don't know that!

Who ever would've guessed
that getting chocolate

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:12.257 position:50% align:center line:84%
from a cute girl could make
it taste so much sweeter?

My, my...

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:25.812 position:50% align:center line:84%
You all are quite the lively
bunch this morning.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.231 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI giggles]

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
Always good to see
your face, dear Shido.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
Kurumi.

no need to be so tense.

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:46.666 position:50% align:center line:84%
I say we save the fun for later,
sound good to you?

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, can't wait.

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your room is already set up.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's just over in
the Spirit dorm.

Kurumi?

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, hi.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, tell me, what's new
with you these days, Shido?

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.360 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not much.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center line:84%
I just came over to ask
you out on a date with me.

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, my goodness!

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you're really up for it,
then I'd love to!

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO]
Hm.

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.039 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[KURUMI] Shall we?
--[SHIDO] Yeah.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ORIGAMI, TOHKA grunt]

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOHKA]
Shido. Good luck!

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:01.259 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI] Okay, Shido,
some choices came up.

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:05.055 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let's decide where
you should take her.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.892 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO] Hold up, Kotori.
I've already decided that.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
Leave it to me.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARIA] In other words, you no
longer trust my capabilities?

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please explain.

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO]
No, it's not like that, MARIA.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARIA]
Ha. Just kidding.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're here to serve
as a support role.

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.910 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you have a strong conviction,

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center line:84%
then protocol states that
you should follow it.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.206 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wouldn't you agree
with that, Commander?

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, sure thing.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
After all, at this point,
he's the world's best,

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center line:84%
most experienced specialist
at dealing with Spirits.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.839 position:50% align:center line:84%
So I say go for it.

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks for that, both of you.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thank you.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI hums]

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.181 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO]
Hey! Sorry for the wait.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
It's okay.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center line:84%
By the way, Shido,
there's somewhere

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.938 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd particularly like to go,
if it's all right with you.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, actually, I had a
certain place in mind, too.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
I bet it's the same
place as yours.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center line:84%
You think so?

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then why don't we
see if you're right.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.909 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] Go ahead.
Lead the way, Shido.

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center line:84%
Take me to wherever
it is you had in mind.

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] Oh! I have to admit,
when I asked you to bring me,

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:23.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
I never imagined
we'd end up here.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.509 position:50% align:center line:84%
Really?

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.636 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's kinda hard to assume you
want anything out of this

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center line:84%
other than seeing me in
some fancy underwear.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center line:84%
No! I swear, it has
nothing to do with that!

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:34.019 position:50% align:center line:84%
I mean, I would definitely be
into it, but that's completely

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.353 position:50% align:center line:84%
beside the point right now!

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center line:84%
Listen, you guessed right.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
You're full of surprises, Shido.

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wanted to come here, too,
I just didn't think we would.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:48.033 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you remember when you brought
one of my clones to this place?

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ever since, I've always
wondered how the "me"

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center line:84%
who was with you felt that day.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.122 position:50% align:center line:84%
What was going through her head?

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
What did it feel like for her,
being here with you?

00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:00.462 position:50% align:center line:84%
The "me" whose heart you managed
to steal intrigues me,

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:01.921 position:50% align:center line:84%
as I'm sure you can tell.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's a lot to process.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because although
she was very naive,

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50% align:center line:84%
she was still "me," you know?

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:13.266 position:50% align:center line:84%
Listen to me, are you sure
you want the same date?

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
I think it's a good idea.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center line:84%
Clone or not, I made that
Kurumi Tokisaki fall for me.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center line:84%
So we'll just repeat
the same date

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.151 position:50% align:center line:84%
as I had with her back then.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
Believe me, by the
end of the day,

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:29.407 position:50% align:center line:84%
you won't be able to think of
anything or anyone else but me.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center line:84%
My, are you confident.
You really think you can make me

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center line:84%
fall head over heels
for you today?

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.289 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO]
I sure do.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:55.684 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tell me, Shido.

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:58.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you remember this place
at all, or should I remind you?

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50% align:center line:84%
Of course I remember.

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.107 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is the very spot where
you made me watch you

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.566 position:50% align:center line:84%
and Mana fight it out.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:08.279 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI giggles, gasps]
I can't believe I almost forgot.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
Happy Valentine's Day.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks so much!

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seriously, though,
you really forgot?

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.372 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:20.041 position:50% align:center line:84%
I guess it just goes to show
how much fun I've had with you.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center line:84%
In fact, I think it's likely
to go down in history

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
as one of the best days I
can ever remember having.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
[giggles]

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've got something for you, too.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO]
Happy Valentine's Day, Kurumi.

Aw, that's so sweet!

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.309 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, there's no rule
against a guy giving out

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
chocolate too, you know.

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center line:84%
Open it up.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50% align:center line:84%
All right, yeah, you, too.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center line:84%
At the same time.

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:47.569 position:50% align:center line:84%
Okay.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO gasps]

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] Oh my gosh,
are these candied orange peels

00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
in chocolate? Delicious!

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yours are super-good, too!

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.879 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is this hazelnut? 'Cuz yum.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not a bad job there,
Shido, not bad.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.427 position:50% align:center line:84%
[REINE] Kurumi isn't lying,
by the way.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's obvious she genuinely
enjoyed the date with Shido.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.516 position:50% align:center line:84%
She doesn't seem to have
closed her heart off, either.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
If anything,
she's grown fond of him.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center line:84%
[REINE] However, Something's
holding her back:

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center line:84%
some kind of resolve, or will.

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, that means, we have
some work to do.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:34.866 position:50% align:center line:84%
Until we find what it is,
and root it out,

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm afraid we won't be
able to seal her power.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.456 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see. Her will, huh?

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, uh, Kurumi?

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes? What is it, Shido?

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center line:84%
Could you tell me something?

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:50.674 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you--

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why exactly do you want to
kill the Spirit of Origin?

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:57.013 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] Oh, I suppose you
heard it from Nia, huh?

00:09:57.097 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center line:84%
What a big blabbermouth
she's turned out to be.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center line:84%
The question is,

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:05.605 position:50% align:center line:84%
are you actually prepared to
find out the truth, Shido?

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center line:84%
All about my... everything?

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah.

[SHIDO, KOTORI gasp]

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANNAZUKI] We've lost both
cameras and intercom.

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're now completely
cut off from Shido.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOTORI]
Send some replacements!

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, Shido.

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center line:84%
How about now? Still wanna know?

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.811 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, even now.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.612 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO]
What is this?

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:57.032 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
An abandoned building nearby.

00:10:57.115 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's kind of become
one of my bases.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center line:84%
You told me you were ready
to learn the truth.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50% align:center line:84%
To know everything there is
to know about me and my life.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:12.505 position:50% align:center line:84%
In that case, have fun
taking it all in.

Well, that's no fun.
I hope you feel better soon.

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:31.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks, that's really
nice of you.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SAWA] Hey, do you want to come
over to my place after school?

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:38.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
My aunt will be bringing
Marron's siblings over

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:39.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
to play this afternoon.

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
Really?

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh. Sadly, I have plans
I can't miss today,

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:48.526 position:50% align:center line:84%
so I'm really sorry, but I don't
think I'll be able to make it.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah? That's too bad.

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:54.157 position:50% align:center line:84%
You seem a lot busier
than usual lately.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm so sorry.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:58.536 position:50% align:center line:84%
But promise me...
you'll ask me some other time!

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, of course I will.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] For real, though!
I seriously mean it!

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.420 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah. So do I.

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIO] Kurumi, I'm counting
on you once again.

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, of course.
Leave everything to me, Mio.

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center line:84%
Deploy Spirit armor, Elohim!

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:28.775 position:50% align:center line:84%
Zaphkiel!

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.322 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yep, I think that
should do it.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center line:84%
Very persistent, aren't we?

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.214 position:50% align:center line:84%
Excellent work.

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center line:84%
As always, I will take
care of the cleanup,

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center line:84%
so you are free to go now.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right, thanks. I appreciate it.

00:18:58.054 --> 00:18:59.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
Have a good day.

00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:02.517 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI pants]

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I hurry, I might still
be able to visit Sawa

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center line:84%
and all those sweet kitties!

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:09.941 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait, here's an idea.

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
What if I invited Mio
to come along too?

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:14.279 position:50% align:center line:84%
We haven't gotten the
chance to talk much

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:16.573 position:50% align:center line:84%
in any kind of casual way.

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:22.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
Mio!

00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
Sawa?!

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIO] Oh, is this
someone you know?

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.464 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm terribly sorry to hear that.

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIO]
What a shame.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:40.263 position:50% align:center line:84%
I had hoped to have you
as a partner for much,

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center line:84%
much longer than this.

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI gasps]

00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:46.978 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIO] You see, Spirits are
simply humans

00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center line:84%
who were given Sephirah.

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, actually, it would be
far more accurate to say

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:54.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
that I bestowed my
power upon them.

00:19:55.028 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
[yells]

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:04.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
Zaph--Zaphkiel, Daletto!

[KURUMI pants]

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIO]
I'm quite shocked.

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:14.589 position:50% align:center line:84%
It appears you managed to
avoid inversion all on your own.

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:16.925 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good. That's a relief.

00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
It would've been
incredibly bothersome.

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your refined Sephirah
going right back to normal.

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:25.350 position:50% align:center line:84%
Inversion? And what's refined?

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center line:84%
Usually, in the beginning,
Sephirah and humans don't meld.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center line:84%
Unable to control its power,
the human tends to go berserk,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center line:84%
and that's to be expected.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, this girl whom you
killed is quite typical.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center line:84%
In order to make Sephirah
compatible with humans,

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:45.412 position:50% align:center line:84%
they must be refined.

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:47.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
The way that's accomplished
is by consistently giving it

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center line:84%
to humans, over and over again.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not that the humans will
ever stop going berserk,

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center line:84%
of course, but gradually, the
Sephirah will become compatible.

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:01.511 position:50% align:center line:84%
And then, a human who
also happens to have a

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
strong affinity will be able to
remain themselves as a Spirit.

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.143 position:50% align:center line:84%
A human like you.

00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:12.230 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, thanks. Recovering Sephirah
can be terribly difficult,

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center line:84%
and you have been a
tremendous help with that.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:18.278 position:50% align:center line:84%
How, though?
How could you do it?

00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:21.489 position:50% align:center line:84%
It isn't that I have any kind
of grudge against you people.

00:21:21.573 --> 00:21:24.826 position:50% align:center line:84%
However, I can't stop until
I've achieved my goal.

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's the only thing
that matters now.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:31.124 position:50% align:center line:84%
Till then, good night, Kurumi.

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center line:84%

Kurumi.

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:47.766 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Spirit tried to do a number
on me and take away my memories.

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's only one reason I'm able
to remember anything right now.

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:54.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's all thanks to Zaphkiel.

00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:57.692 position:50% align:center line:84%
I solemnly vow to you here
and now that I will kill

00:21:57.776 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Spirit of Origin.

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:02.030 position:50% align:center line:84%
No matter what it takes.

[NARRATOR]
Kurumi Tokisaki:

00:23:37.334 --> 00:23:40.211 position:50% align:center line:84%
A Spirit crueler and yet
kinder than any other.

00:23:40.295 --> 00:23:42.797 position:50% align:center line:84%
What is her resolve?
What is her will?

00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:44.591 position:50% align:center line:84%
What will she do?

00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:46.926 position:50% align:center line:84%
Next time:
"Cycle of Salvation."

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.429 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Worst Spirit
shows her devotion.
