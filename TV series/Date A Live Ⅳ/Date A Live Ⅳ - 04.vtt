[STUDENTS]
Good morning!

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:14.139 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE STUDENT C]
It's been a while.

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:15.557 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE STUDENT D]
Happy new year.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.100 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE STUDENT E]
You, too.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center
[TOHKA] Hm? Shido? Why do
you seem all spaced-out?

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:26.276 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh. I just have a lot
on my mind lately, I guess.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.446 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] Wait, all Spirits used
to be human at some point?

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not sure about it.
I mean, I know I was, so...

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:37.078 position:50% align:center
I just assumed it was a thing,
and others were, too.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.998 position:50% align:center
But, now that Raziel's
incomplete, I doubt I'm ever

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
gonna get another chance
to look any further into it.

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.880 position:50% align:center
No matter how deeply I delved
into researching the topic,

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:50.175 position:50% align:center
I could never find out much
about the Spirit of Origin.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:51.509 position:50% align:center
All that being said,

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.970 position:50% align:center
my power isn't
completely gone, after all.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.430 position:50% align:center
I think I could still
be strong enough

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.182 position:50% align:center
to hinder Westcott somewhat.

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:00.435 position:50% align:center
I can stop him from using
Future Entry, at least.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:03.730 position:50% align:center
[MANA] Artemisia Ashcroft is the
British Anti-Spirit Team's ace,

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:05.774 position:50% align:center
the top Wizard of
the organization.

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:08.109 position:50% align:center
As far as Wizards go,
she's way better than me.

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:09.694 position:50% align:center
There's really no contest.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:13.615 position:50% align:center
And yet, I was always under
the impression she hated DEM,

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:17.243 position:50% align:center
so I wonder why she joined
forces with Westcott?

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:18.661 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:19.954 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Oh?

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:22.707 position:50% align:center
Welcome back, everyone.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.543 position:50% align:center
I do hope you all had
a wonderful break!

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:27.337 position:50% align:center
Today marks a fresh start.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.798 position:50% align:center
It's a new semester,
and a brand-new year.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:33.385 position:50% align:center
My birthday's in March, so you'd
better start thinking of gifts!

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:35.553 position:50% align:center
How old do you think I am?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.515 position:50% align:center
[TAMAE]
Since I refuse to turn "thirty,"

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.975 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna say I'm "sirty."

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:46.815 position:50% align:center
[TAMAE giggles]
Clever, right?

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.650 position:50% align:center
Uh, you feeling okay?

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.569 position:50% align:center
I liked that so much, I also
came up with another idea:

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.947 position:50% align:center
when you speak to me,
please call me "Sir!"

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.199 position:50% align:center
Um, Right! Sir, yes, Sir!

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center
Sir! Did anything odd happen
to you over the break, Sir?

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.246 position:50% align:center
Oh, nothing too
out of the ordinary.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.581 position:50% align:center
My best friend, Eri, did set
a date for her wedding.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.208 position:50% align:center
I guess that's something.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.586 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
So happy for her.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.463 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.049 position:50% align:center
Yet here I am, still all alone.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.301 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of starting to think
the god of marriage has

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.679 position:50% align:center
something against me,
you know what I mean?

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:23.226 position:50% align:center
[TAMAE laughs]

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.146 position:50% align:center
Okay! It's time to
take attendance, friends!

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.731 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:30.358 position:50% align:center
Sir! Don't be mad, but you
don't seem okay, Sir!

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:32.736 position:50% align:center
Sir! I think you need
a longer vacation, Sir!

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.988 position:50% align:center
Sir! That is so
totally lame, Sir!

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:37.782 position:50% align:center
[TAMAE]
No, no, friends, I'm all right!

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.869 position:50% align:center
Although, if a demon appeared to
grant a wish in exchange for 

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:43.705 position:50% align:center
my soul, I might just take
him up on it and tell him:

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:45.790 position:50% align:center
"Send a giant,
extinction-level asteroid

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.418 position:50% align:center
hurtling right toward Japan
at top speed, please!"

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
Abracadabra, baby!
Drop on asteroid on my head!

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:56.718 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS shouting]

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.222 position:50% align:center
[MAI]
An asteroid?

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Did she really summon one?

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.561 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center
[MII, AI, MAI gasp]
Tamae!

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.066 position:50% align:center
Shido, is that...?

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
--[phone rings]
--[SHIDO gasps]

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Shido, head to
temp command right away.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:18.656 position:50% align:center
Huh? Don't tell me...

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.410 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Yeah. It's a Spirit.

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:27.499 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
And the Spirits?

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
On standby. I put them
on alert, like you asked.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
So, then, what happened here?

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Check this out.

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
Something fell from the sky and
landed in the schoolyard, right?

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:08.600 position:50% align:center
Well, you guys weren't alone.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
The same thing happened

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.270 position:50% align:center
in all of these
locations simultaneously.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
All these places simultaneously?

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.649 position:50% align:center
DEM had been hit,

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:20.528 position:50% align:center
and so have the Anti-Spirit
Teams in other countries.

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
I have a theory.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
They may have targeted
Spirit power and magic.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:27.077 position:50% align:center
But who would target them?

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
Was it her?

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.293 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Yeah. It's a Spirit
we've never encountered before.

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:37.128 position:50% align:center
We're assigning a code name,

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:40.090 position:50% align:center
We've settled on "Zodiac"
for the time being.

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] This video is
from three hours ago.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.975 position:50% align:center
DEM discovered Zodiac first.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
We noticed odd movements
from DEM ships

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
and decided it would be
best to probe the area.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.941 position:50% align:center
That's when we found her.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
We're not sure, but we
think it's likely

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center
Westcott found her
by using Beelzebub.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
Though it's incomplete,

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
he must have found
some way to manage it.

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Segva.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.891 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] So that thing
with her is an Angel?

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
[REINE] Yes, "Michael". If she
jabs that key into something,

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
it will lock it up and shut down
any abilities it might have.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.750 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Lataib.

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50% align:center
Is it an attack?

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:18.563 position:50% align:center
[REINE] It's another
of Michael's powers.

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:22.192 position:50% align:center
The key is released into "space"
and it opens a portal.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:25.612 position:50% align:center
The closest comparison I can
make is to a warp gate.

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:29.616 position:50% align:center
She has control. She can dictate
where the portals' exit will be.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] I see! So, then the
asteroid at school...

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Bingo.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:36.873 position:50% align:center
It's what Zodiac used to carry
out her attack on Earth.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] She opened portals
in space and tossed

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.336 position:50% align:center
DEM ship debris through,

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center
so it would fall to
specific points on Earth.

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] She was probably
upset at being awoken

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.343 position:50% align:center
from her nice little nap.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:50.970 position:50% align:center
And let's be real,
who can't relate to that?

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:54.391 position:50% align:center
What can we do?
'Cause I'm no astronaut.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. As per usual,
I've got an idea.

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center
[KANNAZUKI]
It's a 3D projection.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.568 position:50% align:center
If we broadcast it into
space and send out

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:08.446 position:50% align:center
a specialized camera,
you can talk to her just as if

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50% align:center
you were actually
out there with her.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center
Now, the time is upon us!

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:16.246 position:50% align:center
How about some long-distance,
VR, space love!

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Uh, hey. What's up?

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.420 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
Kotori, help me! My head!
She blew my whole dang head off!

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:30.969 position:50% align:center
Relax, you moron! If it's gone,
how're you talking?

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:36.016 position:50% align:center
Please remain calm.
I swear I'm not an enemy.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.184 position:50% align:center
Fumo.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]
Ah, come on! Don't hit me!

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
This lady needs anger
management classes, man!

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
She's murdered me, like,
five times already!

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:51.740 position:50% align:center
Indeed. I didn't anticipate
her being this violent.

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
It's fortunate that we decided
to go with the projection idea,

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
for your sake.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
How unusual.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.165 position:50% align:center
I would have expected
that you'd perish already.

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:02.959 position:50% align:center
Great, finally, she uses
some diplomacy.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:06.338 position:50% align:center
This is just a projection.
I'm not really here.

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.757 position:50% align:center
[MUKURO]
Only a projection, you say?

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
Curious. Curious indeed.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
If you don't mind,

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
do you think you could
tell me your name?

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:18.808 position:50% align:center
Mukuro. I'm Mukuro Hoshimiya.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
Pleasure. My name is--

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:29.986 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Make your choices, everyone!

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.533 position:50% align:center
Interesting. Three, huh?

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center
Yeah. One and two work,

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
but I vote we go
on the offensive.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.121 position:50% align:center
A bold strategy!

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center
 I concur! Seeing as
how we haven't

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
seen her happiness
move either way yet.

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center
The strongest option will
give us the most info!

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.046 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Shido, three it is.

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.214 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Oh, come on. Whatever happens,

It has been such a long time.

I remember pain, but time
has erased all the details.

Nevertheless, Muku wants to keep
all things away from her heart,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.767 position:50% align:center

[MUKURO] All right, then,
let's suppose you were to

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.881 position:50% align:center
seal my power, could you really
guarantee Muku would be safe

an on-base visitor

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:51.553 position:50% align:center
Who is it?

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
It's Chairman Elliot Woodman.

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
The chairman?

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.100 position:50% align:center
Shido, do you know him?

00:16:57.183 --> 00:17:00.353 position:50% align:center
I mean, no, the name
isn't ringing any bells.

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:02.063 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT]
Hello. It's been a while.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.239 position:50% align:center
Oh, It's you!

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:12.574 position:50% align:center
I remember now!

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:15.618 position:50% align:center
You're the guy who
asked for directions.

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.746 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT] You're correct,
that was me indeed.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.166 position:50% align:center
Lest I remain "Directions Guy",
I'll introduce myself.

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
My name is Elliot
Baldwin Woodman.

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.507 position:50% align:center
Kotori, you called him,
"The Chairman"?

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:32.052 position:50% align:center
Yes, the chairman of
Ratatoskr's round table.

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:35.055 position:50% align:center
The people responsible for
making all the big decisions.

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:37.057 position:50% align:center
He's its head and founder.

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
Well, Shido Itsuka,
you have my thanks.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.398 position:50% align:center
I am incredibly grateful to you
for saving so many Spirits.

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:47.984 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, I owe you thanks.

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:50.987 position:50% align:center
I mean, without Ratatoskr,
I'd have gotten nowhere.

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:53.114 position:50% align:center
I have a few questions for you.

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
First off, Mr. Elliot
Baldwin Woodman.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.120 position:50% align:center
Sorry--that is what you
said your name was, right?

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:00.038 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT]
Yes.

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Tell me something, then:

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
As one of DEM's
founding members,

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
what's behind your newfound
motivation to save Spirits,

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
when 30 years ago,

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
you were the one who manifested
them in the first place?

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps] You're saying
they manifested Spirits?

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
I sure am. And if these people
hadn't manifested Spirits

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.184 position:50% align:center
or created DEM, we wouldn't
have had to go through

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
all that unnecessary
pain and suffering.

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:26.731 position:50% align:center
So, I wanna know: what exactly
are you plotting now?

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
Ha! Oh, I see.

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.860 position:50% align:center
You're the one who had the power
to look up anything you wanted

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:32.779 position:50% align:center
to know about anyone
you wished, aren't you?

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
It's no surprise that
you would have been

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
compelled to look
into me long ago.

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
I never intended to
hide anything from you.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center
Yes, It is true
that I founded DEM,

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:44.708 position:50% align:center
along with Isaac Westcott
and Ellen Mathers.

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
Back then, our motivation
was simple:

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
we hoped to utilize
the power of Spirits.

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:51.881 position:50% align:center
But that was before
I had the opportunity

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
to lay eyes on the
Spirit of Origin.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.469 position:50% align:center
Once I did, I was
changed forever.

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
I left control of DEM
with Karen Mathers,

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
whom you see behind me.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
She was of the same mind as me
about DEM and the rest of it.

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
Wait, Mathers?

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT] That's right, she is
Ellen Mathers' little sister,

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
though Ellen looks more like the
younger of the two siblings.

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center
In any case, from that point on,
I dedicated my life

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:20.785 position:50% align:center
to the protection of Spirits,
despite the knowledge

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
that it would make Ike
and Ellen my enemies.

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:26.666 position:50% align:center
So, then, what exactly happened?

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT] Hm. What happened?
Love did, my friend.

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:32.297 position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.674 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT] The moment I first
laid eyes the Spirit of Origin,

00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:36.092 position:50% align:center
she stole my heart away,

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:38.386 position:50% align:center
and I could no longer
proceed as before.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:45.810 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT] That's why I can't
stand seeing other Spirits

00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
like her in pain.
I am forever changed.

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:53.109 position:50% align:center
As silly as it might seem to
you, that is the real reason.

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
I don't think it's silly at all.
To be honest, sir. I'm relieved.

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
I'm glad Ratatoskr was founded
by someone like you.

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT]
Hm. Well, that's kind.

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:07.665 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but would it
be possible for me

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
to get a better
look at your face?

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Um, why not?

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:19.219 position:50% align:center
It's incredible.
You do look just like him.

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:21.304 position:50% align:center
Exactly as I remember.

Once I deal with things here,
I'll leave some other way,

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
but you must hurry,
before it's too late.

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center

Please remain safe.

save Zodiac if you can.

are out there, exactly?
