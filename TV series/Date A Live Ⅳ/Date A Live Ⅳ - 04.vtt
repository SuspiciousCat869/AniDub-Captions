It has been such a long time.

I remember pain, but time
has erased all the details.

Nevertheless, Muku wants to keep
all things away from her heart,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.767 position:50% align:center

[MUKURO] All right, then,
let's suppose you were to

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.881 position:50% align:center
seal my power, could you really
guarantee Muku would be safe

from further endangerment?

Sorry--that is what you

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:00.038 position:50% align:center

Yes.

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Tell me something, then:

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
As one of DEM's
founding members,

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
what's behind your newfound
motivation to save Spirits,

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
when 30 years ago,

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
you were the one who manifested
them in the first place?

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps] You're saying
they manifested Spirits?

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
I sure am. And if these people
hadn't manifested Spirits

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.184 position:50% align:center
or created DEM, we wouldn't
have had to go through

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
all that unnecessary
pain and suffering.

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:26.731 position:50% align:center
So, I wanna know: what exactly
are you plotting now?

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
Ha! Oh, I see.

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.860 position:50% align:center
You're the one who had the power
to look up anything you wanted

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:32.779 position:50% align:center
to know about anyone
you wished, aren't you?

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
It's no surprise that
you would have been

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
compelled to look
into me long ago.

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
I never intended to
hide anything from you.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center
Yes, It is true
that I founded DEM,

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:44.708 position:50% align:center
along with Isaac Westcott
and Ellen Mathers.

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
Back then, our motivation
was simple:

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
we hoped to utilize
the power of Spirits.

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:51.881 position:50% align:center
But that was before
I had the opportunity

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
to lay eyes on the
Spirit of Origin.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.469 position:50% align:center
Once I did, I was
changed forever.

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
I left control of DEM
with Karen Mathers,

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
whom you see behind me.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
She was of the same mind as me
about DEM and the rest of it.

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
Wait, Mathers?

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT] That's right, she is
Ellen Mathers' little sister,

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
though Ellen looks more like the
younger of the two siblings.

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center
In any case, from that point on,
I dedicated my life

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:20.785 position:50% align:center
to the protection of Spirits,
despite the knowledge

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
that it would make Ike
and Ellen my enemies.

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:26.666 position:50% align:center
So, then, what exactly happened?

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT] Hm. What happened?
Love did, my friend.

Sorry?

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.674 position:50% align:center
[ELLIOT] The moment I first
laid eyes the Spirit of Origin,

00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:36.092 position:50% align:center
she stole my heart away,

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:38.386 position:50% align:center
and I could no longer
proceed as before.

you, that is the real reason.

To be honest, sir. I'm relieved.

by someone like you.
