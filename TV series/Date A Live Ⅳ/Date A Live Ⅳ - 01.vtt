00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.569 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's mostly for reference,

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:32.614 position:50% align:center
but it also serves as special
thanks for your service!

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
Look! I may not have boobs, but
I've got style for days, right?

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.745 position:50% align:center
Here. Is this good enough?

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
Jeez! Trying to play cool?

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you're not bad!

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.503 position:50% align:center
More of where that came from!

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.254 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center
All finished!

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
[groans] I don't think I've had
to focus that hard in ages!

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Thanks for all the help!

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
Here! Come get your pay.

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
Wha--? What're you doing?

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.479 position:50% align:center
Aw, don't be so fussy!

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
C'mon! Grab it!

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Oh.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
[NIA groans] Is having small
boobs some kind of sin or what?

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:19.577 position:50% align:center
I, uh. I'm leaving for real now.

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center
Keep the money. It was
a learning experience.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Wait! Wait!

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.585 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but that won't
sit right with me!

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.212 position:50% align:center
But I have an idea.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
Next Saturday, I'll go
on a date with you!

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:32.757 position:50% align:center
A date?

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
In Akihabara!

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
Haven't bought much
for myself lately,

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:38.430 position:50% align:center
so I think it's high
time I did that!

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
You're saying if I go with you,
I'll be your bag carrier?

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:42.434 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Oh, uh!

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
Sorry, you should
ask someone else.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
Maybe try one of your
friends or something?

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:50.150 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Hm?

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
Well, thing is, I don't
really have friends!

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.530 position:50% align:center
So, anyway...

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
Do you think you can
afford not to go?

00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Now, then.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.382 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.135 position:50% align:center
[NIA] Am I wrong,
or isn't it your job

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:20.013 position:50% align:center
to make Spirits fall
for you, Shido Itsuka?

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.140 position:50% align:center
I do believe it is.

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:34.569 position:50% align:center
It's already been a month
since Sister's escape.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
You know, I can always
punish the facility crew

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
if you'd like me to do that.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
There's no need.

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:43.036 position:50% align:center
Our talented researchers
are valuable.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:44.579 position:50% align:center
And besides...

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:47.791 position:50% align:center
Besides... what, exactly, Ike?

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:50.835 position:50% align:center
[WESTCOTT] Hm. They couldn't
have done a better job.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
What is your deal?

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center
You've gotta give a better
reaction than that!

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:59.260 position:50% align:center
I mean, come on, I just
transformed for you!

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:01.763 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
I was expecting a:

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center
"What in the heck?"
at the least!

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.643 position:50% align:center
Or even better,
"This girl's transformation

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
just made my heart
skip a beat!"

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Look, check me out!

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.900 position:50% align:center
My Spirit Armor's actually
pretty sexy, don'tcha think?

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] Stop! Listen!
Quit teasing me, okay?

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center
Nia, I totally get that you're
a Spirit and all, but um,

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:23.326 position:50% align:center
how did you know that about me?

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
That I, like...

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
You mean how you date
Spirits and make 'em fall

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
head over heels for you?

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
[gulps]

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.960 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
That's easy.

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
Raziel!

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
This is my Angel, Raziel.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center
It can see everything that's
happening in the world.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
The whole world? For real?

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
[NIA] Yes, anything that's going
on anywhere in the world.

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center
What any and everyone is doing.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
For example... Oh!

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:56.192 position:50% align:center
You had just finished shopping
and were on the way home.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it's useful to
know that kinda thing.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:12:59.696 position:50% align:center
Make sense?

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
Huh? So, you mean,
us meeting--?

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you really thought
it could be a coincidence.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
That's right, some random girl
you found on the ground

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center
just happened to
turn out to be a Spirit!

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
Wowzer, I wouldn't want to be
any part of a story that bad.

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO grunts] So you collapsed
on purpose, knowing I'd help?

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:18.465 position:50% align:center
It was your whole
plan from the start?

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Yup.

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
Did you have a particular reason

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
for making me help
with the manga?

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.971 position:50% align:center
Sure! Mainly just that
I wanted to meet the deadline.

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:26.348 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Are you kidding me?!

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center
Ugh. All right, then.
What exactly are you after?

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't say I'm after
anything at all, really.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
The truth is, I felt
the need to meet you.

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
You see, until very recently,
I was being held captive by DEM.

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:41.571 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
DEM? You mean Westcott?

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
Yup. Hence the reason
I was "away" for five years.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:47.243 position:50% align:center
But I finally found my
one chance to escape,

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:50.246 position:50% align:center
and now I'm so happy that I
can finally get back to work!

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.999 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Wow, five years with DEM.

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:56.920 position:50% align:center
Yes, but while I was being held
captive, Ratatoskr, was it?

00:13:57.003 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
Anyway, a secret organization
started looking for Spirits.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. So then,
with your Raziel,

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.680 position:50% align:center
do you now know
everything about me, too?

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Huh? Well, not quite everything.

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
Obviously, even Raziel
can't read the future,

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
let alone what's
in people's hearts.

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:16.064 position:50% align:center
But it can definitely do this.

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.610 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
Woah! What? My body!
Why's it moving on its own?

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
[NIA yelps]

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:34.666 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps] Hold up!
What was that all about, huh?

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:36.084 position:50% align:center
"Future Entry".

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:39.587 position:50% align:center
Just remember, everything
written in Raziel is true.

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:41.631 position:50% align:center
Even if it's something
that ended up being added

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center
to it later on.

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
Future... Entry?

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.302 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Yup!

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center
The things written in
Raziel always become true.

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.933 position:50% align:center
Of course, having said that,
it can be a pretty big pain

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:54.519 position:50% align:center
in the butt to write
everything out, for sure.

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.146 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I see.

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
It seems like it would
be super inconvenient.

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:00.358 position:50% align:center
Boy, that's not all.

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
You don't get how
terrifying Raziel can be.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
So, tell me.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
Considering how you seem to
know your way around a manga,

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
be honest, you've tried to
draw one before, haven't you?

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.245 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.497 position:50% align:center
I wonder what kind
of manga it was?

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:17.459 position:50% align:center
Let's ask Mr. Raziel, shall we?

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:22.589 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Ooh! The Black Knight, Lievan!

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:25.842 position:50% align:center
Uh, this girl definitely
needs some work.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.386 position:50% align:center
Yes! What a cool attack!
Look at that!

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
Flashing Thunder Wave!

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:33.641 position:50% align:center
Aw, it's all your original
characters from middle school!

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
That's not embarrassing
or anything, right?

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Stop, I beg you!

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.148 position:50% align:center
It's no joke, huh?

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
See how terrifying
Raziel can be?

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] I do! And it's
a freaking nightmare!

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry
for doubting it.

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:49.657 position:50% align:center
Well, seeing as you helped
out with the manga,

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:51.701 position:50% align:center
and your rice soup was tasty,

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.746 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd give you
a chance after all.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.206 position:50% align:center
Chance for what?

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.542 position:50% align:center
[NIA] To make me fall for
you with a date, of course.

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
If you think you can win
me over, then win me over.

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:04.631 position:50% align:center
I can't wait.

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.758 position:50% align:center
Looking forward
to next Saturday.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.636 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO groans]

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:19.187 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Akiba!
I'm here! I'm back home!

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.438 position:50% align:center
Home! Home! Home...!

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
How to put this...
You're really decked out.

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Shido, you copy?

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I hear you.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Listen, I know
she doesn't seem hostile

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:34.160 position:50% align:center
from everything you've
told us about her,

00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
but be on your guard anyway.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Got it.

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
Let's boost her happiness
as much as we can today

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:41.751 position:50% align:center
before DEM finds her.

[KOTORI]
Hey, guys.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
Sorry about the makeshift
command room, but let's

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:48.466 position:50% align:center
just try to bear with it until
Fraxinus is repaired, okay?

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.718 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Roger!

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:53.096 position:50% align:center
Now, what do you say we
finally begin our date?

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
[KANNAZUKI]
Commander, we have choices!

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.560 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Good! Make your choice!

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.649 position:50% align:center
Oh? That's a bit surprising.

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:08.111 position:50% align:center
The safest choice actually
came in third this time.

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, because...
How should I say this?

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.992 position:50% align:center
Nia's clothes are just kinda...

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:15.243 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
Complimenting that get-up
would only end up

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
coming across as sarcasm.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
In that case, isn't number
two the best choice?

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
A harsh comment followed
by a glimpse of kindness

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
seems like a safe bet.

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center
I see no reason why picking out

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
some new clothes for her
wouldn't work out well.

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:31.885 position:50% align:center
No. Think about it again.

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:34.637 position:50% align:center
Nia's intention in coming here
today didn't involve shopping

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.097 position:50% align:center
for a new outfit.

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:38.266 position:50% align:center
Manga, light novels,
figures, and Blu-rays!

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
That's her whole goal,
full-stop.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.269 position:50% align:center
So forcing her to
shop for clothes

00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:43.313 position:50% align:center
would be nothing short of
torture for a soul such as hers!

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:44.564 position:50% align:center
Don't you see that?

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
Ooh!

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
That's Nakatsugawa, "The Man
With a Hundred Wives," for you!

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:49.944 position:50% align:center
Your knowledge of love

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:52.322 position:50% align:center
practically transcends
dimensions, my good sir!

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.282 position:50% align:center
[KAWAGOE] Hmph. And according
to what Shido

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:55.867 position:50% align:center
has told us about her,

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.661 position:50% align:center
she's the type who tends to make
naughty comments all the time.

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
So, making a dirty joke might
actually bring them closer.

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.917 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Hm...

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
Shido, try three.

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
What's goin' on?
Why so quiet, Boy?

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:13.051 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'm not. Well... I mean...

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:15.095 position:50% align:center
Hey. So, uh...

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
Your outfit looks really comfy,
but I'd like to take it off.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
Uh, I...!

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
[NIA laughs]

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised at you, bad Boy!

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.150 position:50% align:center
You really wanna take
it all the way today?

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
I had no idea you
were such a player!

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
I'm not. You've got
the wrong idea.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.949 position:50% align:center
[NIA] Seriously, though, do you
really have to go that far

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
in order to seal
my Spirit power?

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:39.786 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
lemme change my panties.

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:40.912 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps]

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
Calm down,
I'm just kidding, silly Boy!

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.082 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO sighs]

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:46.418 position:50% align:center
Tell me, you're getting
advice from Ratatoskr,

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:47.627 position:50% align:center
isn't that right?

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.257 position:50% align:center
[NIA laughs]
Yay! That's awesome!

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.510 position:50% align:center
Kotori? You seeing this?

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
Tell her it's Ratatoskr,
you dolt.

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
[NIA gasps, giggles]

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
Hey, Boy. I'm impressed.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:09.024 position:50% align:center
Carrying my stuff
like a real gentleman!

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:11.317 position:50% align:center
It's not a big deal
or anything.

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Yoink.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] She's making
all the moves, Shido!

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:16.364 position:50% align:center
I don't know what to say.

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Ooh! Target spotted! Let's go!

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
[NIA] I haven't been here
in such a long time!

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, it all feels so new!

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:29.085 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
I don't get it,

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
can't you keep up
to date with Raziel?

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
[NIA] Nah, I try to refrain from
using Raziel when it's not

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
absolutely necessary,
you know what I mean?

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.845 position:50% align:center
Mainly 'cuz I just
hate spoilers.

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:40.221 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
Speaking of Raziel,

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:45.185 position:50% align:center
did DEM make you use it
while you were captured?

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:48.104 position:50% align:center
[NIA] Hmm? I actually
don't remember.

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:50.607 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Huh? The whole five years?

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.025 position:50% align:center
[NIA] Oh, they never
stopped tampering

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
with my mind and stuff,
that's for sure.

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center
But honestly, if they had
such a hard time doing that,

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center
then I doubt they
were able to use it.

00:19:58.406 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
I don't see how they could.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO] You never thought
of using Raziel to find out

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.955 position:50% align:center
exactly what happened to you?

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:07.540 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Nah, I'd rather not.

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:11.169 position:50% align:center
I know for a fact it won't be
pretty, so why would I do that?

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:14.547 position:50% align:center
[NIA gasps] Look at all the
gorgeous Tokiya merch!

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
You like him that much?

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding?

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50% align:center
"Like" doesn't even
begin to describe it!

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center
He's the reason
I got into manga!

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:24.683 position:50% align:center
Tokiya is my wife!

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:28.478 position:50% align:center
Like, he's a guy, but he's
100 percent my wife!

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Uh, you like this stuff, too?

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
Huh. Those who operate
without a Maiden Circuit 

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
could never understand.

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:36.945 position:50% align:center
Is that even
something people say?

00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:38.655 position:50% align:center
Don't you knock it, Boy.

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
Pros in this field can
perceive anyone's nature

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.784 position:50% align:center
in a single glance!

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
Timid bottom.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:49.249 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO gasps] Hey, hold up!
How did you just classify me?

00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:51.543 position:50% align:center
[KANNAZUKI]
The mood is looking good.

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:54.963 position:50% align:center
We haven't had a date go quite
this smoothly in a long while.

00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I think it's about
time for the next step.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.635 position:50% align:center
[REINE]
Mm.

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
[NIA sighs]
Well, that was fun!

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
I'm totally satisfied!

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.600 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I had a good time, too.

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center
[NIA]
Hm?

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.897 position:50% align:center
Hey, why don't we
swing by a cafÃ©?

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
This way's a shortcut.

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:16.192 position:50% align:center
[NIA yelps]

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
Nia!

00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center
Now's your chance, Shido!

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
Um. Nia.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.256 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
I...

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.969 position:50% align:center
[NIA gasps]
Sorry.

00:21:43.053 --> 00:21:45.513 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Uh?

00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:46.765 position:50% align:center
It's no use.

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Huh?

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:51.353 position:50% align:center
[NIA] Listen, I really don't
wanna be chased by DEM,

00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:53.980 position:50% align:center
so on one hand, I kinda wouldn't
mind if you went ahead

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:56.024 position:50% align:center
and sealed me right now.

00:21:58.485 --> 00:22:03.490 position:50% align:center
But the truth is... I can
only fall in love with 2D guys.

00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:04.824 position:50% align:center
[SHIDO]
Huh?

00:22:05.408 --> 00:22:10.413 position:50% align:center line:10%

00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:37.042 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The opening narration

00:23:37.125 --> 00:23:38.918 position:50% align:center
can do the episode preview.

00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:40.295 position:50% align:center
Now that's freedom.

00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:43.715 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Shido's dates
are once again underway!

00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:47.260 position:50% align:center
Next time:
"So Be It! 2D It Is!"
