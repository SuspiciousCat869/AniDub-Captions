00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] I'm not saying that
everything I've done was right.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not by a long shot.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.230 position:50% align:center line:84%
I did the Spirit of
Origin's bidding,

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:23.565 position:50% align:center line:84%
murdered countless people,

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:25.692 position:50% align:center line:84%
and even took the life
of a close friend.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:29.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't even begin to process
all the terrible things I did.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.281 position:50% align:center line:84%
And it's not over.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:34.034 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because to rid this world
of that awful Spirit,

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm going to end up leaving
behind a mountain of corpses.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:43.293 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm a devil. Nothing more or
less than an enemy of humanity.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] I kill, and I kill,
and I kill some more.

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.719 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm a waking, living nightmare
of endless death.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:55.388 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've realized that if
there really is some kind

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.516 position:50% align:center line:84%
of an afterlife,
then I'm obviously bound

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.811 position:50% align:center line:84%
for the lowest level.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
But it's fine.
I don't care about that.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:07.400 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not if I manage to slay
the Spirit of Origin,

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mio Takamiya, by my own hand.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.238 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then it'll all be worth it.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:14.240 position:50% align:center line:84%
Takamiya?

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.284 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] I'm going to redo
everything.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:18.328 position:50% align:center line:84%
Bring all that's happened
back to zero,

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:22.624 position:50% align:center line:84%
back to the beginning of it all,
before the nightmare began.

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:24.042 position:50% align:center line:84%
But to do that,

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:27.462 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm going to have to use
that power you hold, Shido!

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.255 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I have your power
to assist me,

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.258 position:50% align:center line:84%
then I know I can
change history!

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:33.927 position:50% align:center line:84%
History?

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.845 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's right.
If I go into the past

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.889 position:50% align:center line:84%
and erase the Spirit of Origin,

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:41.768 position:50% align:center line:84%
then I'll never become a Spirit,
and that will erase so much.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:45.146 position:50% align:center line:84%
The death of Sawa and the
deaths of everyone else.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.274 position:50% align:center line:84%
It'll simply be as if
they never happened.

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:49.859 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I eliminate that Spirit,

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.780 position:50% align:center line:84%
even my devouring of you
should cease to take place.

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.990 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shido, please! Help me!

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm begging you, let me borrow
your power to make it happen!

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please, help me end this!

Of course...

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.919 position:50% align:center line:84%
...there's nothing I can
offer you as a fair trade.

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] I mean, after all,
it doesn't change the fact

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:13.049 position:50% align:center line:84%
that I'm asking for your life.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.509 position:50% align:center line:84%
That can't be helped.

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:17.429 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, I feel like this
is the least I can do.

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:19.305 position:50% align:center line:84%

I've given it some thought,

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.569 position:50% align:center line:84%
and all I have to offer
you is my everything.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everything that isn't
my Spirit power.

We're so terribly

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
Especially considering you're
a bunch of phony Spirits.

Oh? You're calling
us phony now, huh?

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center line:84%
You know what I think?

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
You just insulted our father.
That's what I think.

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center line:84%
And that's unforgivable!

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
Failure, again?

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.761 position:50% align:center line:84%
That seems quite curious.

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know Beelzebub set
her up for success.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center line:84%
So another failure strikes
very odd, indeed.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center line:84%
If basic inability isn't the
reason for the lack of success,

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center line:84%
then I would love
to hear what is.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.441 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wow, Ellen, just look at you go.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, then.

You girls have anything
to say about all of this?

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, she's asking for it.

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't forget, you've failed
more than anyone, so...

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.831 position:50% align:center line:84%
She looks like a mad
old grandma, sitting there.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.833 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, being old
must really suck.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center line:84%
Excuse me?!

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50% align:center line:84%
Would you get a
load of this, father?

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.756 position:50% align:center line:84%
All people ever do
is get in our way!

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
"Nightmare," was it?
That's pretty rich.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why is she such a nuisance?
What's her problem?

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
She's constantly in our way.

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center line:84%
If not for her,

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center line:84%
we could've killed Shido

don't you think?

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:44.988 position:50% align:center line:84%
It just seems too implausible.
It does, even for Nightmare.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center line:84%
She doesn't play nice.
She's defied all of our plans.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, that's true enough.

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50% align:center line:84%
Makes one wonder if she
knows what we plan to do.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even before we do it.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you suggesting the
plans were leaked?

No.

Yes. The me there before you.

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:29.657 position:50% align:center line:84%
She's sleeping so peacefully.

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please, it would be best
to let her rest for a while.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center line:84%
She's completely exhausted.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center line:84%
She was already
tired to begin with,

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:41.544 position:50% align:center line:84%
but then there was all the
fighting on top of that.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center line:84%
What do you mean, "fighting"?

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.298 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] I'll go ahead and
get straight to the point

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
for you, Shido.

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:50.303 position:50% align:center line:84%
The thing you don't know yet
is that you've already died.

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:51.346 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wha--?

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
That's right. To be precise,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center line:84%
you should actually be
dead right this minute.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, no, to be fair, I
suppose what I should say

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.398 position:50% align:center line:84%
is that it's possible you died.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.192 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, Kurumi.
I'm here, as promised.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:06.820 position:50% align:center line:84%

about you this morning.

You're different now than I
remember you being, Shido.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.283 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh...

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:15.328 position:50% align:center line:84%
You seem to have matured in the
time since our last meeting.

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:17.914 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though, I suppose it's
expected with all the carnage

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.332 position:50% align:center line:84%
you've lived through.

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center line:84%
A bloodbath like that would

[NIBEELCOLE CLONE A] Hey now,
you mustn't interfere.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NIBEELCOLE CLONE B]
I don't know.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center line:84%
If anything, I think we're
probably the ones interfering.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center line:84%
What? What's with these guys?

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.724 position:50% align:center line:84%
Confused. Tell us who you are!

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.728 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ORIGAMI]
Metatron!

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.567 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.005 position:50% align:center line:84%

Shido, ahh!

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI CLONE A]
Here you go, me. For you.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI grunts]

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.546 position:50% align:center line:84%
Zaphkiel, Daletto!

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:35.677 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now are you all right,
other me?

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.096 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
Yes.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.265 position:50% align:center line:84%
[explosions]

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
What is that?

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.442 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI CLONE A] Tohka and the
others are busy fighting.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:54.988 position:50% align:center line:84%
I guess they've gone inverse,
haven't they?

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center line:84%
Inverse.

00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
Not that it's any surprise,

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
what with Shido being killed
right before their very eyes.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI CLONE B, C]
Me.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.667 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI gasps]
That's...

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI CLONE B] Yes, it is.
We barely made it out.

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI CLONE C] I couldn't
make myself just go off

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center line:84%
and leave him behind.

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center line:84%
Daletto.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shido, wake up! Please, Shido!

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
As I thought, it's no use now.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center line:84%
Daletto's bullet does
reverse time, but it...

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:39.324 position:50% align:center line:84%
It doesn't have the power
to bring back a life

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center line:84%
once it's been lost.

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center line:84%
Have I just failed
at everything?

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center line:84%
First Shido, and now,
to make it even worse,

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've failed at erasing
the Spirit of Origin, too?

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI sobs]
Goodbye, love.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI gasps]

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center line:84%
Zaphkiel!

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]
Wait, what's going on?

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:37.090 position:50% align:center line:84%
My sixth bullet, Vav,
has somehow been restored!

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI CLONE C]
The question is why, though?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.345 position:50% align:center line:84%
Vav sends a mind into the past,
so why restore that now?

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.431 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI CLONE B] I don't know,
but I remember it was broken

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:47.017 position:50% align:center line:84%
during the fight with Kotori.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI CLONE A]
And ever since then,

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50% align:center line:84%
we haven't been able to use it!

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]
You think it could be...?

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:57.152 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]
I'm not sure I follow.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center line:84%
I suppose I'll have
to jog your memory.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:02.407 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was right after the
fight I had with Kotori,

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
and before I left,
I gave you a brief kiss

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
as a form of thanks
for saving my life.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center line:84%
So my theory is,
the moment that happened,

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.294 position:50% align:center line:84%
the moment we made
that connection,

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
my sixth bullet,
Vav, was sealed.

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which means, though it
may not have been fully,

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.844 position:50% align:center line:84%
it was at that point that
I first opened my heart

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.137 position:50% align:center line:84%
to you, Shido.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's the only explanation
that makes sense,

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.516 position:50% align:center line:84%
so that has to be it.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] There was a good reason
I wasn't able to use Vav,

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center line:84%
but it wasn't the
reason I thought.

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:38.026 position:50% align:center line:84%
It wasn't because Zaphkiel
was broken, it was because

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:41.446 position:50% align:center line:84%
part of my Spirit power had
been sealed by that kiss.

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] So, just now,
by kissing him once again, 

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
has that power really been
returned to me in full?

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[KURUMI] Me-s.
--[KURUMI CLONES gasp]

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please give me your word,
you'll die for Shido's sake.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.424 position:50% align:center line:84%
[chuckles]
Yes, yes, of course.

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center line:84%
And with pleasure.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI CLONE B] Considering the
fact that our lives

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.971 position:50% align:center line:84%
are fleeting anyway
as we speak,

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:10.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
I say go ahead and use us
to your heart's content.

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI CLONE D]
If it means saving Shido,

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center line:84%
then it isn't even a question.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center line:84%
I would gladly visit the
other side for his sake.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center line:84%
You should've known we wouldn't
turn down the challenge.

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI CLONE G]
After all, you're "me",

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center line:84%
so you should really know
that without having to ask.

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI CLONES giggle]

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:32.789 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, in that case, I actually
do have a proposition for you.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:36.626 position:50% align:center line:84%
Join me. Come on an
endless journey of death.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:41.172 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
Zaphkiel, Vav.

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
Huh?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI sighs] Well, looking at
this, it seems like it worked.

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:59.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, you see, from February
18th until today,

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:01.526 position:50% align:center line:84%
all of us have been
protecting you, Shido,

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center line:84%
without your knowledge.

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:05.989 position:50% align:center line:84%
Always doing our very
best to keep you safe.

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:07.532 position:50% align:center line:84%
That first attack?

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was only thwarted thanks to
a helpful assist from Mana,

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center line:84%
though there's no way
you could've known that.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI]
Two hundred and four.

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:23.131 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's how many times it's
happened since February 8th.

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:26.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
You've fallen into
DEM's hands 204 times

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:28.386 position:50% align:center line:84%
and we've stopped it.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO grunts]

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] On the morning
of February 10th,

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center line:84%
they even dared to attack
you when you were at home.

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:35.268 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIDO gasps]

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:40.982 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURUMI] And many more times,
over and over.

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center line:84%
Each time, I've kissed you
in order to regain Vav

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center line:84%
and send my mind
back into the past.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
And over time, it's become
more difficult.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:52.327 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm afraid it's put a
terrible strain on my heart.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.496 position:50% align:center line:84%
And repeating the same
days so many times

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:56.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
has pushed my
psyche to its limits.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wasn't prepared for how
challenging it would be.

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, Shido.

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:09.302 position:50% align:center line:84%
Maybe for now, just allow me to
rest as much as I need to, okay?

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:12.472 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't understand.

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:15.308 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why didn't you just devour
me from the beginning?

00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seriously, that would've
been easier on you

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center line:84%
than repeating everything.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.691 position:50% align:center line:84%
I mean, 204 times?

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:28.029 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please. How could you ask
me anything so thoughtless?

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:31.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
My feelings were far too strong.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, me, it sounds like you've
had a very interesting time.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:47.340 position:50% align:center line:84%
Have you enjoyed your
little chat with Shido

00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center line:84%
while I was busy getting
my beauty sleep?

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center line:84%
Was it fun?

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm so sorry about that, Shido.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:55.515 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please forgive her, she's new.

tend to be so foolish

if they're given half a chance.

to get me wrong, okay?

There's only one reason I
helped you, understand that.

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center line:84%
I had no choice. I did it
purely so I wouldn't lose

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:14.325 position:50% align:center line:84%
all the Spirit power
you've sealed thus far.

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:17.370 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah. I know.
And I totally get it.

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center line:84%

leave it at that for today.
