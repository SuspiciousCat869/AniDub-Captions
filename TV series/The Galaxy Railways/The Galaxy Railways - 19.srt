1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,583
[Narrator] Regardless of
what people do in life,

2
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,916
there is always a need
to take a step back

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,916
and look for peace
and tranquility.

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,833
But for those who live
a disciplined life

5
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,333
of fighting for
justice everyday,

6
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:55,208
that peace and tranquility
can be hard to find.

7
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,958
Emergency transmission
from Mother Venus No. 131!

8
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,916
A woman on board is
going into labor!

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,291
They're requesting
that she be taken

10
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,208
to a medical facility
on the nearest planet!

11
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,625
Right!
Understood.

12
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,541
Let's get the Fomalhaut
Platoon on this! On the double!

13
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,750
We've just received word
from the Albireo Express

14
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,125
currently traveling
past the Veil Nebula!

15
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,291
They're reporting that a
troop of drunken performers

16
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,291
is engaging in acts of
disorderly conduct, Sir!

17
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,833
Send out the
Arcturus Platoon now!

18
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,125
Emergency
Transmission.

19
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,958
Creatures have woven a
web over an orbit ring.

20
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,541
Orion Express went
right through it.

21
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,541
The web got into the
train. It's everywhere.

22
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,916
Passengers
inhaled it.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,333
It's causing allergic
reactions, Sir.

24
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,208
Dispatch Algol
Platoon at once!

25
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,708
[Shelley] Don't tell
me that he won again!

26
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,500
You're quite a
player, Manabu!

27
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,083
No, not
really.

28
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,041
It's just a game. I don't know
why you're getting so serious.

29
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,750
You'd think that we
were playing for money.

30
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,333
Ah, sorry.

31
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,000
I've only been losing
because I'm playing for fun!

32
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,750
If you want to play
serious let's do it!

33
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,125
Ah, okay.

34
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,208
I didn't want you to pick
that one, Louis! Really!

35
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,125
Oh, you know...? I haven't
finished packing yet.

36
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,250
Sit down! This
isn't over!

37
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,875
Uh, yes Ma'am.
Sitting down.

38
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:35,083
[Jose] Come on Silver! Show
'm what a real man can do!

39
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,625
[Schnader] What are you
waiting for? Take him down!

40
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,291
I can't wait to see
the look on your face

41
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,291
when I break
your arm, Bruce!

42
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,000
Why don't you go
ahead and give up now?

43
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,875
Maybe if you had a
tractor and a wench

44
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,291
you could pull this arm over
but all I see is you, Silver!

45
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,125
And your skinny butt isn't
gonna cut the mustard!

46
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,458
Oh yeah?! Bring
it, Blondie!

47
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,541
Let's see... 
one packed lunch?

48
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,208
Why not? Nice day
for a trip, eh?

49
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,708
And would you like a drink
with that...? It's free.

50
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,583
Only if you tell
me when you're off.

51
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,666
Right... so... no
drink. Anything else?

52
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,333
Yeah. Are you
free tonight?

53
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,541
Would you like
desert with that?

54
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,875
I can't get a break with
these cards! They're cursed!

55
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,083
No one can lose that
many times in a row!

56
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,333
I knew
she'd blow.

57
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,708
Yep. She was showing
all the classic signs.

58
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,083
What a sore
loser. Goodness.

59
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,166
You took all the good luck
and left me nothing but bad!

60
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,625
How dare you, Manabu! And
wipe that smile off your face!

61
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,708
Hey come on guys, stop
that... That's enough.

62
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,041
Can't you
be quiet?!

63
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,458
There are other people
on this train you know!

64
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,416
Do you want me to
get the SDF in here?!

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,291
[All] Sorry...

66
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,958
Can't people just play
cards. What's his deal?

67
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,166
This younger generation's
gone to the dogs.

68
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,875
I thought you'd like to know
the last stop's coming up.

69
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,083
The Planet Carcalla. It's
known for its hot springs.

70
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,250
Look
there!

71
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,250
Amazing!

72
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,916
It's beautiful...

73
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,583
Would you mind if I
burned these cards?

74
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,833
Well, Manabu. This place
is lovely don't you think?

75
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,750
Murase
Family Spa!

76
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,083
Awesome!

77
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,666
Your parent's place looks
really great, Captain.

78
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,291
Yeah, If you
like old things.

79
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,291
So Captain, does this
place have a hot tub?

80
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,750
'Course it
does, Jose.

81
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,958
Hello. Welcome to
our humble spa.

82
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,958
We didn't know our son was
nice enough to have friends.

83
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,750
You must all be exhausted.
Please come in.

84
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,333
Thank you
so much.

85
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,625
It's our
pleasure.

86
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,500
Well, let's get in
out of the cold.

87
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,375
Let's go, Mr. Yuuki.
What's the hold up?

88
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,041
Ah, yeah
right...

89
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,125
Where's that
hot tub, Boss?

90
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,125
Well now, where'd
you come from?

91
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,375
Captain?
The hot tub?

92
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,125
Hey there, Shirobata!
Glad to see me?

93
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,125
Oh, you haven't
changed a bit.

94
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,958
Unlike Mom and Dad who have
that grey, vintage look.

95
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,666
You'd think you were
describing an automobile, Son.

96
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,125
You're not a
kid anymore;

97
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,125
when did you forget how
to talk to your parents?

98
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,375
Where's
the respect?

99
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,916
In my bag. Aw, come
on, Pop! Loosen up!

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,125
You still look young, you know,
for y'know... an old man!

101
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,291
Hey, Captain. How
about that hot tub.

102
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,625
(Meow)

103
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,833
I haven't forgotten
about you.

104
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,083
At least someone
here missed me.

105
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,958
Captain! Come on!
Where's the hot tub?!

106
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,541
Tell 'im it's
Hot Springs.

107
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,166
And if some bubbles start
coming up while he's in there,

108
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,458
stay clear. It
could be toxic.

109
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,625
Look
at that!

110
00:06:58,708 --> 00:06:59,666
Oh wow.

111
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,833
It's breathtaking.

112
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,125
This is what we came
here for, isn't it?

113
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,375
Well, don't forget about
the food and drinks.

114
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,500
Not to mention the
hot springs, right?

115
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,916
Don't take this
the wrong way,

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,083
but doesn't it sound like
they share the same brain?

117
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,250
[Shelley] What are
we waiting for?

118
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,750
[Ai] I'm ready
for a good sweat.

119
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:15,833
[Maggie]
Tennis anyone?

120
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,541
Should I play the
way I normally do

121
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,958
or just let
them win...?

122
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,125
Let's win this
one, Manabu!

123
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,875
Ah, sure thing.

124
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,500
Sure thing.
What a jerk.

125
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,791
He thinks he's
perfect at everything.

126
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,458
Come on!
Serve it!

127
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,416
Here it
comes, guys!

128
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,500
Manabu!

129
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,083
Are you okay?

130
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,041
I'm fine!

131
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,500
Fifteen-
Love.

132
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,708
Here goes!

133
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,750
Gotcha!

134
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,250
Figures.

135
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,750
Game, set
and match!

136
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,750
Good
game!

137
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:56,875
You too!

138
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,291
Thanks for making
me sweat, you guys!

139
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,833
Ugh! They were
all over him.

140
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,250
Why don't you join
us, Louis...?

141
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,708
What d'ya say? You wanna
play a little tennis

142
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,583
with some
real men?

143
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,166
Sure. Where
are they?

144
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,083
Ohhh!!
That hurt!!

145
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,833
She dogged us!

146
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,958
Hahaha! You're really
too cute for words,

147
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,541
you silly
kitty cat!

148
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,583
You're just so
cute aren't you?

149
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,708
You're just the cutest
thing in the universe...

150
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,416
You know it's
true, don't you?!

151
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,833
Ah, sorry...

152
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,666
For what?

153
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,125
My son's vulgar
behavior.

154
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,250
I hope his childish antics
aren't bothering you, Dear.

155
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,750
Don't worry,
I've seen worse.

156
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:52,166
You're just so cute!
I wanna eat you up!

157
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,333
It's nice.
Don't you think?

158
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,125
Oh, yeah! Nice!

159
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,208
You look serious,
Captain. That's not good.

160
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,833
Hey! Why don't we go to
a tavern? What d'ya say?

161
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,291
We'll take a soak; then
we can hit the streets.

162
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,541
I know a place that's
crawling with girls!

163
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,000
A nice hot soak and
a night on the town.

164
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,291
Bruce, what
d'ya think?

165
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,041
Sounds good!

166
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,000
Hey,
Yuuki?

167
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,125
We're going
to the spa.

168
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,041
Be there
in a minute.

169
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:39,500
Huh? You again? Oh,
you're not Murase's cat.

170
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,125
Tora! I've been looking
for you everywhere.

171
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,875
You little rascal. You love
making me worry, don't you?

172
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,166
This cat has always
been a curious one.

173
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,000
Whenever we come
to a new place,

174
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,625
Tora likes to do a little
exploring without me.

175
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,041
Ah, I guess he's
a naughty boy...

176
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,083
He's a rude one,
isn't he, Tora?

177
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,208
Tora's a female,
young man!

178
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,083
Oh, sorry!
I didn't know!

179
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,083
Maybe you should try to get in
touch with your feminine side?

180
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,000
Uhh, what's that
supposed to mean?

181
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,208
Huh?

182
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,375
Louis can we ask
you a question?

183
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,375
What's really going
on between you two?

184
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,583
Between who?

185
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,583
Don't play innocent.
Between you and Manabu?

186
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,875
Oh, him...
There's nothing;

187
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,625
We're just shipmates and
that's all there is to it.

188
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,916
What? It's
the truth!

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,375
So, then I guess you won't mind
if I'm interested in Manabu?

190
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,875
Go ahead. He's
not my type, Ai.

191
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,375
Now, now. Don't tease
her like that, girls.

192
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:44,083
But Captain! I am
serious about Manabu!

193
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,125
Hey, Manabu, do
you wanna race?

194
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,750
The first one to the other
side of the pool's the winner!

195
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:01,500
But you have to swim it
all underwater! Ready! Go!

196
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,916
Hey! That's
not fair!!

197
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,125
Manabu Yuuki?

198
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,333
Girls, we're
under attack.

199
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,291
Captain! It's not
what you think!

200
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,500
Louis! You could
have killed him!

201
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,666
Manabu!
Are you okay?

202
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,916
Nice, Kid!
That was huge!

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,750
So's the knot
on my head!

204
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,291
Hey, check
this out!

205
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,958
Not another race.

206
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,416
No, it's the
fresh snow!

207
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,958
It's like a blank canvass
waiting for us to paint it!

208
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,375
Lemme guess, yellow?

209
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,708
That's nasty! That would
be a desecration!

210
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,958
I'm talking about making
a snow-angel, Manabu!

211
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,000
Hey, knock
yourself out, pal.

212
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,375
Aww. It looks a lot
better if two people do it.

213
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,708
Age before
beauty.

214
00:11:55,791 --> 00:12:01,291
I thought we came here to
relax and have some fun!

215
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,958
David?! Are
you okay?!

216
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,166
Yeah. But snow was a lot
softer when I was a kid.

217
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,375
It sounded solid.
Like a rock.

218
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,833
Really...? Oh,
you're right...

219
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,083
He knocked
his head!

220
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,458
Don't worry
he'll be fine.

221
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,083
Don't forget he's
part of the S-D-F...

222
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,250
It'll take a lot more than
that to keep him down.

223
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,333
Hey,
Louis?

224
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,333
Yes, Ma'am?

225
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,833
I know it's none
of my business...

226
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,916
But are you ever
going to tell him

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,625
how you really
feel about him?

228
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:37,125
What? What do
you mean...?

229
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,833
You're not fooling
me, Louis.

230
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,000
I think you should tell
him how you really feel.

231
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,125
If you wait for someone as
shy as Manabu to speak up,

232
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,333
you might end up
waiting forever...

233
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,041
Loving someone from afar
is a very noble thing,

234
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,958
but sometimes unspoken
love starts to fade away.

235
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,250
Just keep that
in mind and...

236
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,208
do what your heart
tells you to do.

237
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,083
You know... we
could teach you...

238
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,833
some table tennis...
what do you say?

239
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,416
You're wasting
your time boys.

240
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,291
It's never
gonna happen.

241
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,375
Aaahh! Dogged again!

242
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,000
SDF Talent
Show?!?!

243

far better thing I do now

244
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,791
than I have ever
done before.

245
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,166
Adieu! Adieu!
Farewell my friends.

246
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,083
Parting is such
sweet sorrow!

247

[Bruce] So, why the
long face, partner?

252
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,541
I don't know...

253
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,000
I guess something just
doesn't seem right to me.

254
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:44,125
It's like everybody's forgotten
about work all of a sudden.

255
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,625
For all we know, at
this very moment,

256
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,166
something terrible
might be happening

257
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,458
somewhere along the orbit
routes of the Railways.

258
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,625
Pretty view isn't
it, Yuuki...?

259
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,666
The air's so
fresh here.

260
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:02,500
You don't really
see your breath.

261
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,833
That's because the air
is so crisp and clean.

262
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,958
You're right- I
never noticed that...

263
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,791
But maybe it's
because it's so cold?

264
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,208
Don't think about
it, just enjoy it.

265
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,791
What about you, Bruce?
Are you enjoying yourself?

266
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,125
What? I don't look
like I'm having fun?

267
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:27,125
Not really! If you ask me,
you look bored to tears...

268
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,458
So, am
I right?

269
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:32,541
Well, sometimes even the
truth is best left untold.

270
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,541
(Choking)

271
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,000
...Thought I
was gonna die.

272
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,250
I really like this place.
It's very peaceful.

273
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,583
You're kidding,
right?

274
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,125
No, not
at all.

275
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,250
Well to me, this is the most
boring place in the Universe.

276
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,458
Sorry to
hear that.

277
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:52,250
Yeah... That's the
reason I left here.

278
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,125
If you like it, why
don't you move here?

279
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,750
Now why would I want to
move here all by myself?

280
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,083
Well, I'd be
out here, too.

281
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,791
At the most boring
place in the Universe?

282
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,791
I don't mean now. Maybe
when we're a little older.

283
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,791
You'd be a bear
if you were bored!

284
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,333
I think we could keep
ourselves occupied.

285
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:28,916
Oh, no! She's gone! This
is terrible! Just terrible!

286
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,500
What's all the
commotion about?

287
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,458
It's Tora! My cat;
I can't find her!

288
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,875
Since when?

289
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,458
I'm not sure! I just now
noticed that she was missing!

290
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,916
It's below zero!

291
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,541
If she's out there too long
she could freeze to death!

292
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,041
Sirius Platoon!
Let's move!

293
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,541
Front torches
are lit!

294
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,458
Roger! Lighting
back torches!

295
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,458
Communications
system, ready!

296
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,958
Assigning
search grids!

297
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,125
Equipment
check.

298
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,625
Anoraks -
check.

299
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,625
Boots and
snowshoes - check.

300
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,708
Synchronize radios! Sirius
Platoon! Vega Platoon!

301
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,291
Gear up and
prepare to depart!

302
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,416
There's not much time,
troops! Let's look sharp!

303
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,583
Vega Platoon is
ready for search!!

304
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,458
Standby for
coordinates!

305
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,625
Isn't this...
a bit much?

306
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,375
We're members
of the SDF!

307
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,500
There's no such thing as too
much when a life's in danger!

308
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,666
...R- Right.

309
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,958
Go SDF!! You can do
it! I know you can!!

310
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,708
Sirius Platoon!
Let's move out!

311
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,708
Vega Platoon,
move out!

312
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,458
Kiyoji, what's
going on?

313
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,208
It seems that
Tora's missing.

314
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,208
I saw Tora
earlier...

315
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,666
Yes, she was by the hot
springs with Shirobota.

316
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,833
Hmm?!

317
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,125
Why didn't you
say something?!

318
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:05,750
Tora!

319
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,625
What's the matter?
Did something happen?

320
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,208
Uh, no. We thought
Tora was lost.

321
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:17,083
Tora? She's been
here the whole time.

322
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,791
We've become
good friends...

323
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,166
They've been
keeping me company.

324
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,583
They're very
sweet cats...

325
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,666
Hey! Come on!
That's enough!

326
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,750
Sure is some nice
scenery here...

327
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,041
I know. I don't think I'll be
able to sleep after that.

328
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,666
It is our
last night.

329
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,416
Maybe we should have some fun
since we're all still awake!

330
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,625
Let's party!

331
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,458
We can start out by
taking a late night dip

332
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,416
in the hot
springs!

333
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,375
Yeah!! Huh?!

334
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,958
Um, Captain... You
sure about that?

335
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,083
(Jose choking again)

336
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,625
Are you okay
over there?

337
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,708
Well son...

338
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,000
is there something you'd like
to tell your mother and I?

339
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,791
I don't think so, Dad. Oh,
yeah. Thank you for having us!

340
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,458
No, that's
not it.

341
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,000
He's
clueless.

342
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,458
Now wait! That's
not gonna happen!

343
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,083
At least not for a few
more years anyway!

344
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,375
Come on,
Captain!

345
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:21,708
Trust me, you'll be
the first to know!

346
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,291
I think she's going to make
a fine landlady someday!

347
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,625
I hope. She's too good
for him if you ask me.

348
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:34,000
Tora. Are you sure this
is what you want to do?

349
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,791
All right!
We're ready!

350
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,208
Smile everyone! Let's
make this one a keeper!

351
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,750
Okay, What station
are we going back to?!

352
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,083
Des-tin-y!

353
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,958
All
right!!

354
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,958
True relaxation often comes
in short fleeting moments.

355
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,500
Not long after it arrives,
it usually departs...

356
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,541
But even though these
times of peace are brief,

357
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,583
they leave an indelible
imprint on our hearts.

358
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,833
[Manabu] Next time
it's quite an honor

359
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,666
when the Space
Panzer Grenadiers-

360
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,000
the elite troop that my
brother used to belong to-

361
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,958
asks me to join
their platoon.

362
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,791
But is taking a big
step in my career

363
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,000
worth leaving everything
that I care about...?

364
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,583
See ya next time
on the Railways!
