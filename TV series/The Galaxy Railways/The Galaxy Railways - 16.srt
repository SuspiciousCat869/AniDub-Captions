1
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,166
What is a Soul?
What is Love?

2
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,708
Neither can be
seen or touched

3
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,625
and yet people have always
believed in their existence.

4
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,833
Perhaps these intangibles
are more real

5
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:55,083
than the things we see around
us, for all things must pass.

6
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,083
But can the same
be said of Love?

7
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,875
Can the same be
said of the Soul?

8
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,166
Mmm!

9
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,333
I don't
have a job.

10
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:11,500
I spend most of my free-time
rock climbing or sailing.

11
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,833
Now we're
talkin'!

12
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,041
Hey!

13
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,458
There you are! What
are you doing, Silly?

14
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,250
Let's go have
fun! Come on!

15
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,833
You promised you would
teach me how to play poker!

16
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:22,708
I can't.

17
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,125
What do you
mean you can't?

18
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,791
I'm sorry, but my well's
gone dry. It's empty.

19
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,250
My business went belly
up and now I'm broke.

20
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:34,041
I had a little left. But I put
it all on a hand and lost it.

21
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,708
Are you telling me you don't
have anything of value at all?!

22
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,041
No way!

23
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,541
I have the most priceless
treasure in the world!

24
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,750
I have you! That's all
I need to be happy!

25
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,208
You really are
an idiot!

26
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,458
Did you think I was
hanging around you

27
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,500
for your charm and
good looks?! No!

28
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,666
There's only
one reason

29
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,666
I'd be with a cross
eyed toad like you!

30
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,375
Oh, yeah! And I can't stand
that annoying voice of yours!

31
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,291
She didn't even like
the way I talk?

32
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,041
Bartender, get Mr.
Ohyama the usual.

33
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:05,791
Gladly, Sir.

34
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,583
Thank you,
Conductor.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,750
Here you go,
Mr. Ohyama.

36
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,291
She wasn't the right
one either. Was she?

37
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,458
'Fraid not, Sometimes
I wish I wasn't loaded.

38
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,583
Don't worry. You'll meet
the right one someday.

39
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,458
I promise. She'll be
just like an angel.

40
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,083
You're always
liftin' my spirits.

41
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,625
I wish you could have
a drink with me.

42
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:33,375
Well, I can't drink what you
drink but I can sip on this!

43
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,750
Perfect! Here's
to friendship!

44
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,416
Were they
shooting at us?

45
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,250
Yes! They're
space pirates!

46
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,625
Space Pirates!!??

47
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,416
Headquarters!!

48
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,416
The Grace Wealthy has
derailed, Commander!

49
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,958
It's on a crash course
with Planet Guin!

50
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,000
Dispatch Sirius
Platoon immediately!

51
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,875
Wow! I've never seen
a train like this!

52
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,333
That's because
you've never seen

53
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,708
the Grace Wealthy before...
She's is one of a kind...

54
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,791
A Galaxy Railways
luxury liner.

55
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,625
You won't find a nicer
casino train anywhere.

56
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,875
Awesome!

57
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,583
I've always dreamed of
gambling on that beauty.

58
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,083
What a place to crash. Planet
Guin; the train-eating monster.

59
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,958
It's the soil and
atmosphere here.

60
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,208
They rapidly corrode
any kind of metal.

61
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,000
Even with the special
anti-corrosive coating

62
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,791
that SDF trains
are equipped with,

63
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,916
Big One couldn't last more
than six hours on this planet.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,833
Ordinary passenger trains can
only survive for an hour.

65
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,166
Sir, our scanners
have detected metals

66
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,083
50 kilometers
east of here!

67
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,541
Captain! I'd like
to join the search!

68
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,875
That's out of
the question!

69
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,125
Your body is part metal,
Yuki! It's too dangerous!

70
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,958
Not if I wear a
protective suit.

71
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,916
There may be crash victims
who need medical attention.

72
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,791
There they
are, David.

73
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,916
Right!
Got it!

74
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,916
Down here!!

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,250
Help us!!

76
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,000
Captain. We've found
the crash sight.

77
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,583
There are a few
dozen survivors.

78
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,625
We're going in
for a landing.

79
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,125
Just be
careful.

80
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,708
Hey Yuki. I'd double check
the joints in your gear.

81
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:09,916
You never know.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,166
Right. Thanks, Bruce.

83
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,958
Over here! Huh? What the
hell? Just land already!

84
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,958
You incompetent
grunts! Come on!

85
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:21,583
Let's get the show on the
road! Get us out of here.

86
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,416
Typical government employees!
Slow and inefficient!

87
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:32,666
Get out
of my way!

88
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,916
Yuki! ...Are you
out of your mind?!

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,625
We came here to
help you people!

90
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,500
Is that a fact? You mean
sometime this year?!

91
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,791
Come on!

92
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,166
Take it
easy, Yuuki.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,250
I know they're rude,
but they almost died.

94
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,916
Let's cut 'em
some slack.

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,333
Right.
I hear ya.

96
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,250
I'm okay.
Don't worry.

97
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,166
There's room for everyone.
Please take your time.

98
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:18,458
So much for my dream
train. What a let down.

99
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,541
Are you okay?!

100
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:30,000
Somebody help me! Please!
I think he's dying!

101
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,000
Hang in there!
Don't you give up!

102
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,125
Do you hear me?!
Help is on the way!

103
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,833
You're gonna
be all right!

104
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,333
This is Manabu! We've
found a crewmember!

105
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,250
Hurry! He's not
doing very well!

106
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:44,458
Please. It's no use. I'm
afraid it's too late.

107
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,833
What do you mean
it's too late?

108
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,708
Don't say that,
Conductor!

109
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:51,958
Thank you for... 
being my... friend.

110
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,416
Don't worry! You're going
to make it! You'll see!

111
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,291
Good bye.

112
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,416
We'd better get you to the
transport. Come with me.

113
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,666
This may not be
appropriate for a robot,

114
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,541
but may he
rest in peace.

115
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,583
This stinks!

116
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,958
They should at least have
someone serve us cocktails!

117
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,333
They've got us herded in
here like a bunch of animals!

118
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,791
This is a
disgrace!

119
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,708
They just survived a crash and
all they can do is complain.

120
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,083
Really... Where's
the love?

121
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,625
Uhh. Excuse me.
Mr. Ohyama?

122
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,416
I thought you might
like to have this.

123
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,250
Hey, who are you?
What's your name?

124
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,750
Oh. I'm Manabu.
Manabu Yuuki.

125
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,291
Thanks you, Manabu.
Thank you very much.

126
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,791
Why are we just
sitting here?!

127
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,958
Yeah! Take
off already!!

128
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,125
I'm hungry!

129
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,041
This is some rescue!
I'll have your job!

130
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,458
Vertical
thrusters.

131
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,791
What's happening?! Is the
engine malfunctioning?

132
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,125
No! It's a cargo
overload alarm!

133
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:40,750
Too heavy?
There's no way!

134
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,541
Uh-oh, looks like
we've got company!

135
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,958
Try to shake him off-
he's on the roof!

136
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:56,000
Right!

137
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,333
Get down!!

138
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,583
Huh? Come
back here!

139
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,583
No!!

140
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,541
Mr. Ohyama!!

141
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,208
Yuki!!

142
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,750
Yuki!!

143
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,208
I can't believe
she jumped.

144
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,583
Yuki...

145
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,875
I'm taking
us down!

146
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,208
No! Negative!

147
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,375
What d'ya mean?!
Why not, Bruce?!

148
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,791
We can't put our
passengers in danger!

149
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,458
Manabu!

150
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,416
Yuki! You're
all right!

151
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,083
We've got a fix on your
transmission! Hold on!

152
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,875
Don't you dare land until you
take those passengers back!

153
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,583
Yuki! Use these
'til we get back!

154
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,291
Right!

155
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,750
Yuki...

156
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,416
[Buldge] Manabu! David
and Louis just returned.

157
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,583
I'm sending them back
out in a fighter.

158
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,625
Yes, Sir!

159
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,125
Eagle One is ready
for take-off...

160
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:50,958
[Buldge]
Proceed!

161
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,791
We can't stay out
here in the open...

162
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,500
My train is
sending help.

163
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,250
Let's just hide
until they get here.

164
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,500
We've got to get
out of here.

165
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,625
They'll be more of
them on the way.

166
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,416
Bring her back, guys!
Don't fail! You can't!

167
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,625
Captain, Yuki has closed
her communications channel.

168
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,625
We have no way
of tracking her.

169
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,375
[Buldge] Don't give
up! Keep trying!

170
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,625
Eagle 2!
Watch the time!

171
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,291
The corrosion's already eating
through Big One's coating!

172
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,208
Yes, Sir!

173
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,750
[Buldge] Eagle One,
did you copy that?!

174
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,500
The protective coating on Big
One is starting to give way!

175
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,291
We need to find Yuki
and get out of here!

176
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,958
[David] Roger,
Captain! We copy!

177
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,333
Manabu! We've got the
West side of the jungle!

178
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,541
You and Bruce
take the East!

179
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,500
[Manabu]
Got it!

180
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,500
That'll be us if
we don't take-off!

181
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,875
Why the hell are
we waiting?!

182
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,375
Yeah! Let's get
out of here!

183
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:57,750
Big One! This is Yuki! Do
you copy? Please come in!

184
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,833
You've been out for a
while. Are you okay?

185
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:20,083
Y- You've been taking
care of me all this time?

186
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,500
Are you crazy? Do you realize
you jumped out of a transport?!

187
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,666
I would have been a goner
for sure. You saved my life.

188
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,125
I don't know how to
thank you for that.

189
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,375
You don't have to.
It was my duty.

190
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,958
Well, there aren't many
people in the Galaxy

191
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,958
who would do somethin'
like that. Trust me.

192
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,250
I think you're a
very special person.

193
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,583
Oh. Well, I guess I
was created that way.

194
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,583
Huh? I guess we all
were, weren't we?

195
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,208
It's just that most of us
have lost sight of that.

196
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,500
Besides my own mother,
you're the only woman

197
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,583
who's been truly
kind to me.

198
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,041
And you're the
first pretty girl

199
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,500
who's ever given me
the time of day.

200
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,916
I was always one
of those guys

201
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,541
that nobody ever
seemed to notice.

202
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,416
But my company discovered
Cosmonite on my home planet-

203
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,291
and it changed
everything!

204
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,958
Then people started
being nice to me.

205
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,958
What's wrong?

206
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,291
Nothing... Ce'st
la vie! And besides,

207
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,500
I didn't think I'd ever meet
someone like you in this life!

208
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,333
Oh? What do
you mean?

209
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,583
You're so genuine and kind;
everything a human should be!

210
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,291
It's funny you say
that. You see I'm...

211
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,625
Never mind, it's not important.
What is important is you.

212
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,458
My mission is to get
you out of here alive

213
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,625
and that's what we
need to focus on.

214
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,291
Come in, Big One. This
is Yuki. Please respond.

215
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,291
Hey, Yuki?

216
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,583
What is it?

217
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:48,416
If we do get out of this
alive... Well, I uhh...

218
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,958
I was thinking that maybe if
you didn't have a boyfriend,

219
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:51,916
we could...

220
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,541
U-uhh, what
am I saying?

221
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,500
You're too beautiful
to go out with me!

222
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,250
That's not true,
Mister Ohyama!

223
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,625
You don't have to say
that Yuki... It is true.

224
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,125
I must have died
and gone to heaven!

225
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,083
There's something
you need to know.

226
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:18,958
What?

227
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,250
I'm a medical
Sexaroid...

228
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,041
Try to breathe deeply
and slowly if you can.

229
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,250
The concentration of oxygen
in the air on this planet

230
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,208
is so high that it
causes hyperpnoea.

231
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,833
Just let me know if you have
trouble breathing again.

232
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,833
I can neutralize
it for a while.

233
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,291
Are you going
somewhere, Yuki?

234
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,333
My shipmates will have
a hard time finding us

235
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,041
if we stay in here.
We should go outside.

236
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,625
Yuki! What's wrong?!
Are you okay?!

237
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,583
Yes, don't
worry. I'm fine.

238
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,083
The corrosion is
beginning to affect me.

239
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,416
My body's not like
yours. It's a machine.

240
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,833
If I don't get out
of here soon,

241
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,708
I'll end up like
the conductor.

242
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,458
Please. Don't
say that.

243
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,583
All Sirius Platoon members:
return to Big One!

244
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,666
The corrosion has
reached critical levels!

245
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,791
Abandon
the search!

246
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,916
Captain, just give me a few
more minutes! I can find her!

247
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,291
[Buldge] Negative, Manabu!
We're out of time!

248
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,916
Return to Big One!
The search is over!

249
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,916
But we can't just
let Yuki die!

250
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,833
[Buldge]
Manabu!!

251
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,250
Please! Just a
little longer!

252
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,250
I can't give up on her
now! I have to try!

253
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,041
[Bruce] Yuuki! We
can't commit suicide

254
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,333
with all the
passengers!

255
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,958
Get back to
Eagle Two! Now!

256
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,875
Do it, Manabu!
That's an order!

257
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,708
Yuki...

258
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,208
Preparing
for take-off.

259
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,416
Manabu...

260
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,041
Mr. Ohyama!!

261
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:36,833
Manabu... you were
always there for me.

262
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,208
Yuki!

263
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,541
Yuki!!

264
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,875
Manabu!

265
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,458
Captain Bulge!

266
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,625
Manabu and the others
have just returned!

267
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,416
Yuki's alive
and well!

268
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,333
Good news!
Let's move out!

269
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,916
You risked our lives
for an Android!

270
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,250
What's wrong with
you people?!

271
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,666
Are you out of your
minds or what?!

272
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,541
What minds?!
They're all idiots!

273
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,000
Anyone knows that an
Android can be replaced!

274
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,625
Manabu...

275
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,625
That's enough
outta you!

276
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,583
[Manabu]
Mr. Ohyama?

277
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,708
[Yuki] You know that's
not the case, Mr. Ohyama.

278
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,750
I'm not sure why
you're saying that.

279
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,625
Because it's true.
You're human.

280
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,541
But I'm a
Medical Sexaroid.

281
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,375
My body is operated
and controlled

282
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,083
by Artificial Intelligence.
I told you that.

283
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,083
It has nothing to
do with your body.

284
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,916
I'm not sure
I understand.

285
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,666
Being human has to do
with how a person acts.

286
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,125
It's your kindness
and compassion

287
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,541
that makes you human...
And your love...

288
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,708
Do you
love him?

289
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,291
Manabu Yuuki... Are
you in love with him?

290
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:12,041
How can I be...? 
That's impossible.

291
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,041
Although... I do feel
that way sometimes.

292
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,916
I don't know why. It's
difficult to explain.

293
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,916
It must have something to
do with how I was created.

294
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,541
There was a woman
from Earth.

295
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,958
I was given her personality
and appearance.

296
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,000
Manabu must resemble someone
she kept in her memory;

297
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,500
someone that she
loved very dearly.

298
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,541
Hey, Louis.
How is she?

299
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:46,458
Oh... Great... She just needs
a few minor parts replaced

300
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,166
when we get back and
she'll be just fine.

301
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,250
What a
relief!

302
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,958
There you are, Manabu! I'm
leaving Yuki in your hands!

303
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,500
Take good
care of her!

304
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,000
What is this invisible
mystery called love?

305
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,625
Many deny its
very existence...

306
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,416
But those who experience
it know it to be real.

307
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,916
Though they can
not touch it,

308
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,333
they can feel it
in their heart.

309
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,500
And those who have
experienced pure love

310
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:24,916
all agree on
one thing...

311
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,708
That life would be but a
hollow pageantry without it.

312
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,666
An eager pack
of treasure-hunters

313
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,541
crash land on a
remote planet of ice,

314
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,458
the resting place for
a priceless jewel

315
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,958
known to grant
immortality.

316
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,083
And when Big
One swoops in

317
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,583
to rescue the only
remaining survivor,

318
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,250
I get more than what
I bargained for!

319
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,791
Will an old flame be
a stroke of good luck

320
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,291
or my own
misfortune?

321
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:34,916
See ya next time
on the Railways!
