1
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,708
Schnader!

2
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,666
Shame on all of you! Is
that the best you've got?

3
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,833
Ah, no sir!

4
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,500
If you can't manage this
level of field simulation,

5
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,000
you should pack
up and leave!

6
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:42,541
We're S-P-G... Space Panzer
Grenadiers... not the S-D-F.

7
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,875
Now let's try it again!

8
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:46,833
Yes, Sir.

9
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,791
All of us must make our way
along the road called life.

10
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,750
And when that road
eventually comes to a fork,

11
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,166
we must rely on
instinct to make a choice

12
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,958
and decide
which way to go.

13
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,083
You've enrolled me in the
S-P-G training program?

14
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,875
But, Sir...
Why me?

15
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,625
It's to improve the interaction
between our two outfits.

16
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,666
So we can learn
from each other.

17
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,166
Well, that's the
official version anyway.

18
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,791
If you ask me they're doing it
to look for some new recruits.

19
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,416
So don't hold back.

20
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,458
Right.

21
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,250
You won't be
going in alone.

22
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,375
Schnader from Vega Platoon
and Ai from Spica Platoon

23
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,416
have both been
selected to accompany you.

24
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,833
It should be an
awesome experience.

25
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:55,166
These guys are the most
elite fighters in the Galaxy.

26
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,500
The S-P-G.

27
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,000
[Thinking] Mamoru was
a member when he died.

28
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:08,083
Manabu, there's a reason
I met you here alone.

29
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,916
I want to talk to you about
something away from the others.

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,583
Away from the
others? But Why?

31
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,500
So, you think the
SPG wants Manabu?

32
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,333
Really? Are you
sure about that?

33
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,458
That's what I heard
through the grapevine.

34
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,833
It's the unofficial buzz.

35
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,041
I'm sure that once he passes
the training the Space

36
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,750
Panzer Grenadiers will
make a formal announcement.

37
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,875
Well, I'm sure Captain
Murase has told Manabu

38
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,416
all about this
by now.

39
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,541
But why
Captain Murase?

40
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,875
Ah, wait a second;
I think I know.

41
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,375
It's Captain Johansson...

42
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,625
he was Murase's senior officer
way back at training camp.

43
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,125
And he's the one who
would make the call.

44
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,333
From what I hear the S-P-G
has had its eye on Manabu

45
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,708
for some time now...

46
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,666
I think it's wonderful!

47
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,041
One of our very own is being
recruited by the S-P-G!

48
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,791
[Louis] Manabu won't
join the S-P-G!

49
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:07,250
Well, it doesn't make
any sense does it?

50
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,500
Even my scores were
higher than his were!

51
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,166
Besides!
Just think about it!

52
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,541
Manabu's far too reckless and
stubborn to be an S-P-G member!

53
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,666
Am I right?!
Well! Am I?!

54
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,125
[Bruce] Manabu can be
whatever he wants to be.

55
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,625
Only he can decide which
direction he wants to take.

56
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,750
It's up to
him, not us.

57
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,750
Oh. Hey, Captain.

58
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,750
I appreciate you
giving me the heads-up.

59
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,541
But Murase already told
me all about it earlier.

60
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,250
It's not a done deal.

61
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,000
You can make
your decision

62
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,666
once you've gone through
all the training.

63
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,958
I know that this is
important to you...

64
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,208
and it's
important to us, too.

65
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,916
Thanks, Captain.

66
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,541
Look. Just try to keep
this in mind, Manabu.

67
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,708
No matter what you decide,
you'll be working

68
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,041
to preserve life and to
keep peace in the Universe.

69
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:11,416
I'm sure Captain Yuuki
would say the same thing

70
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,666
if he were here.

71
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,250
Thank you.

72
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:47,833
Gotcha!

73
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,291
What the...

74
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,250
Damn it!

75
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,083
We have an enemy aircraft
approaching at eight o'clock.

76
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,125
Uploading the
escape route, now.

77
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,125
New enemy aircraft approaching
your position at two o'clock.

78
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,833
Four bogies converging!
No, wait a second! There's six!

79
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,333
Your escape route's
been compromised.

80
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:27,583
They're everywhere!
Be careful! Look out! No! No!

81
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,291
Stupid.

82
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,875
Do you think you can
catch a train on foot?

83
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,875
What's the meaning
of this, Cadet?

84
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,166
You're supposed to
be sleeping now...

85
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,208
Getting the proper amount
of rest is mandatory.

86
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,708
Sir!

87
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,583
Sir?

88
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,000
What is it?

89
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,625
The S-P-G wants me...
Captain Murase told me they do.

90
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:03,916
But, Sir... I need to know.
Why me? Because of my Dad?

91
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,958
Because I'm
Mamoru's brother?

92
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,500
You're strong-willed,
much the same way he was.

93
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,041
He persevered through
all the hard training.

94
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,000
He never complained once.

95
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,041
I've never seen such
a dedicated soldier

96
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:23,375
as your brother Mamoru.
He was outstanding.

97
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,666
Mamoru.

98
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,458
I have to stay
here, brother.

99
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,791
Not only was he
a good soldier,

100
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:42,708
he was a fine man;
the best of the best.

101
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,333
So tell me, what made
you join the S-D-F?

102
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,791
Was it out of admiration of
your Father and Brother

103
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,625
or something else?

104
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,125
That's why I
joined initially.

105
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,458
But now, my reasons
are different.

106
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:58,416
I just want to protect people.
I want them to be happy.

107
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,458
No matter what you choose,
the work will be the same.

108
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:07,166
Whether it's SDF or SPG...
you'll work for peace.

109
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,041
What the SPG
needs now

110
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,375
are passionate and
dedicated youths like you.

111
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,208
Your service record
speaks for itself.

112
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,500
I know it would mean a
big change in your life

113
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,125
so I want you to take time
to weigh all your options.

114
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,583
I'm looking forward to
hearing your decision.

115
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:54,750
I've had it. We work 24
hours a day at this job.

116
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:58,250
And you can forget about having
any kind of personal life.

117
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,875
So why moan about it? You
haven't met anyone have you?

118
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,625
That's the point! How can
I when I'm always working?

119
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,625
Oh, let it go. You love
your job and you know it!

120
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,083
[Kinuko] Hey, boys!

121
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,083
Hey, what's up, Kinuko...
So, How 'bout a cold one?

122
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,875
Sure! No prob!

123
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,500
Why, thank you.

124
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,333
That was my last stout, Bruce.
But look what I have for you!

125
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,000
Not bad. But stout
sounds better.

126
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:30,791
Tastes better, too! The
perfect way to end a shift.

127
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,708
Right, Manabu?

128
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,083
Oh yeah...

129
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,416
I know how you
feel, David.

130
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,833
Things just don't seem right
without Manabu around, do they?

131
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,333
Well, I'll bet
that he stays!

132
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,250
Manabu wouldn't leave
all of his friends!

133
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,416
I'll put 5,000
Ables on it, Bruce!

134
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,416
That sounds like
a sucker bet.

135
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,250
Hey! Don't give him any
tips! That's not fair!

136
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,041
Well, Bruce, what's he
gonna do? Stay or go?

137
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:02,708
Only he knows. But my money
says that he goes to the SPG.

138
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,708
I'm not worried. I'm sure
that he'll come back...

139
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,625
Manabu would never leave his
platoon and all of his friends.

140
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,000
He's staying and that's
all there is to it.

141
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,333
But he may not...

142
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,958
Becoming a
member of the SPG

143
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,125
would be a huge
honor for anyone.

144
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,208
Who could blame Manabu
for going for it?

145
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,458
We should be happy
for him, you know?

146
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,458
This is the
opportunity of a lifetime.

147
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,541
You're right Louis.

148
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,791
Conducting training
tests in a magnetic storm?

149
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,541
Only the S-P-G would
be this extreme.

150
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,375
If we get thru in one
piece we'll be set...

151
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,333
No screw-ups.
Okay, Manabu?

152
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,875
Right...
No more screw-ups.

153
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,166
Rescue Shuttle Pod Docked.

154
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,333
We are now entering
the Six-Five-Oh.

155
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,791
Request permission to
begin search and rescue.

156
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,833
This is Six-Six-Six...
we copy.

157
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,125
Begin search and
rescue immediately.

158
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,041
You must also restart
the Six-Five-Oh's engine

159
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,083
and get it out of
the magnetic storm.

160
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,916
Please proceed in an orderly
manner to the rescue pod.

161
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,125
Let's move!

162
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,208
Don't worry! You're
all going to be fine!

163
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,083
No matter what
you choose,

164
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,875
the work will
be the same.

165
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:42,583
Whether it's SDF or SPG,
you'll work for peace.

166
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,708
[Thinking] I need to let go
and stop worrying about it.

167
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,583
This way; please
hurry, folks!

168
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,458
There's nothing
to be afraid of!

169
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,041
[Ai] We've got a
log-jam here!

170
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,416
Please stay calm
and keep moving!

171
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,375
Let's go already people!
Get the lead out!

172
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:11,541
I love when they stop walking.
That's my favorite part.

173
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,583
That's the last
one! All clear!

174
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,208
Double check! I'll get the
shuttle pod ready for take off!

175
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,916
Now the only thing left is
to do is restart the engine.

176
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,125
Right. I can handle that.

177
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,541
Be careful.

178
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,166
The Sensors are
detecting an anomaly.

179
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,208
There's a sudden increase
in magnetic energy levels.

180
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,958
Hold on!

181
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:59,708
I'm heading back!

182
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,166
Schnader, wait! Manabu's
still on the train!

183
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,791
Manabu!

184
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,500
Manabu! Are you receiving me?
Please come in.

185
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:13,791
No signal! The communication
link is down!

186
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,958
Captain! All sensors
are failing, Sir!

187
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,125
There's no way to know what's
happening on the Six-Five-Oh.

188
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,208
[Captain] Redirect our ship

189
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,958
to intercept the
Six-Five-Oh immediately.

190
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:22,916
Yes sir.

191
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,125
What's happening?!

192
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,666
The Main Engine's damaged!
We're losing power!

193
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,958
She's shutting down!

194
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,541
Switch to auxiliary! Now!

195
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:38,583
The Six-five-oh is gone,
Captain! It just vanished!

196
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,083
Manabu!

197
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,291
Expand the search
to include Area G!

198
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,125
Monitor all frequencies! He
might be trying to reach us!

199
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,291
Yes, Sir!

200
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,375
I expect you to do
your duty out there.

201
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,000
Just be the best that
you can be, Manabu.

202
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,416
Uhh, man. I feel
like a train hit me.

203
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,541
Huh?! What happened?!!

204
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:19,250
From the looks of it I'd
say we were attacked!

205
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,375
This is Manabu Yuuki
on the Six-five-oh!

206
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,041
Can anyone hear me?
Please come in! Over!

207
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:31,375
I'm adrift in the middle of
nowhere. What do I do now?

208
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,583
When are you gonna
learn? Just calm down.

209
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,125
Then you'll be
able to figure out

210
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,791
exactly what
you need to do.

211
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,333
The Song of the Engine!
Thank Whitman I'm not dead yet!

212
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,916
Hang in there,
Manabu. You can do it.

213
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,291
I've got five-thousand
riding on you!

214
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,375
You just have to make
it back, Manabu!

215
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,500
Can you do
that for me?

216
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,458
Yes!

217
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:25,000
This is it!

218
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,291
I don't have
a choice!

219
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,583
You can do it, Manabu...
I know you can.

220
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,125
Thank you, Louis.

221
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,416
It's not looking
good, Captain.

222
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,416
We've been searching for
six hours and still no trace.

223
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,000
Should we call
it off, Sir?

224
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,458
Manabu.

225
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,875
We can't just give up! He's
gotta be out there somewhere!

226
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,625
He's Manabu Yuuki
of the SDF

227
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,791
and he's gonna make
it, understand?

228
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,041
Is that it?

229
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,541
It's him!

230
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,916
He's alive!

231
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah!

232
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,208
Manabu here...
Mission complete.

233
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,083
Manabu really did a
great job out there.

234
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,333
Anybody else would have
been a goner for sure.

235
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,750
The SPG would be
fools not to take him

236
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,125
after a performance
like that.

237
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,541
Don't say that.

238
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,125
What? Oh, sorry.

239
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,875
Well it is an honor.

240
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:28,375
Looks like I owe you
5,000 Ables. Aye, Bruce?

241
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,125
Guess so.

242
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,666
I'm going to miss him.

243
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,041
Come on now! Be happy
for him! My goodness!

244
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,750
The least we can do is
send him off with a smile!

245
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,750
What does that guy think
he's doing? Is he crazy?

246
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,166
What guy?

247
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,958
Manabu Yuuki. He's out
of his mind, Bulge.

248
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,666
He just turned
down a commission

249
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,458
with the Space
Panzer Grenadiers!

250
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,958
Manabu, at least tell me the
reason for your decision.

251
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,625
There's a lot I
can still learn

252
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,500
from the Sirius Platoon,
Sir... And besides...

253
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,166
Yes...

254
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,083
Well, someone told me that
no matter what I chose

255
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,083
the work would be the same,
whether it's S-P-G or S-D-F.

256
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,041
I'll still be working
to uphold peace.

257
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,666
Manabu really
said that?

258
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,166
What a guy!

259
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,750
This is terrible!

260
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,625
His head's going to be so big
it won't fit through the door!

261
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,458
And his grades aren't anywhere
close to what mine are!

262
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,833
Louis?

263
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,791
He was already cocky enough.
Now he'll be impossible.

264
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,833
Somebody needs to teach
him a lesson if you ask me.

265
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,250
I think you're right.

266
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,833
Just a little something to
put him back in his place.

267
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,166
I know exactly how
to handle this.

268
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,500
Now guys. Don't be
too hard on him.

269
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,166
Of course not!

270
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,833
Never!

271
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:05,166
Sometimes even ambitious people
turn down a higher position...

272
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,083
To these rare few only
feelings matter, not status...

273
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,833
They realize that without the
love shared between friends

274
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,583
and a joyful
outlook on life,

275
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,958
even a promotion
can be a step down.

276
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,875
So... did
you miss me?

277
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,500
Next time we receive an
Emergency Rescue Signal

278
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:27,916
from Kowloon City...

279
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
one of the most dangerous
places in the Galaxy!

280
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,375
Is this just a trick or
is this former enemy

281
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,708
really trying
to help us?

282
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,291
Looks like we're
about to find out!

283
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,750
See ya next time
on the Railways!
