1
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,375
Take it.

2
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,166
But I have
a gun already.

3
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:43,875
It's
broken.

4
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,666
A gun that doesn't fire
is worthless, Yuuki.

5
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,166
Now take it or
quit the SDF.

6
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,791
All right. I'll take it...
But... I won't use it!

7
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,708
You'll use it someday,
Yuuki. It's inevitable.

8
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,000
You can't avoid
it in space...

9
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,208
You have to kill if
you want to survive.

10
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,458
Galaxy Railway trains stop
not only on planets,

11
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,875
but also at numerous
Space Junctions

12
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,166
located throughout
the Galaxy.

13
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,750
There, people can change trains
and choose their destinations.

14
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,541
Every so often
these stops

15
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:28,125
become a turning point
in people's lives.

16
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,916
Attention all
personnel:

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,958
Prison Train arriving at
Alpha 32 Space Junction.

18
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,458
We're having
a party?

19
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,000
Uh, huh!

20
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,416
Sirius Platoon's planning a big
get-together. I can't wait.

21
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,208
How nice!

22
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,375
That sounds
like fun.

23
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,625
Yeah, and I just won
a bet the other day.

24
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,250
If you like, we can
all share the prize

25
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,125
together this weekend...
Expensive Wine!

26
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,291
Awesome!

27
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,416
What
about me?

28
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,708
Yeah. You, too...
Of course...

29
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,791
Hey, Captain. You're gonna
be there too, right?

30
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,708
Come on, Captain! You
just have to be there!

31
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,875
She's right!

32
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,166
Hmm... Well, let me
see what I can do...

33
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,500
But whether I can
make it or not,

34
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,833
I'm still planning to
cover the expenses.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,291
Wow! Thanks,
Captain!

36
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,375
That's great! You're
the best, Captain!

37
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:39,041
Oh, well- I had planned on
covering the whole thing...

38
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,375
Well, hey! If our
expenses are covered...

39
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:46,333
Let's add some caviar... and
some mozzarella cheese...

40
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,375
Yuki- You'll be
there, too. Right?

41
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,083
She went to
the Med Coach.

42
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,333
I guess she's gonna
stand us up again...

43
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,875
What's the
big deal?

44
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,500
Yuki's never come to one of
these little off-duty shindigs.

45
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,958
Well, I guess the
verdict's out.

46
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,958
She just doesn't
like us. That's all.

47
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,125
C'mon! Now where's
your sense of humor?

48
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,541
Uh, huh. I knew
you were kidding.

49
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,000
Try and locate
an escape-Pod!

50
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,000
Affirmative!

51
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,166
Our sensors are indicating
that 4 prisoners have escaped

52
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,333
from a Prison Train docked at
the Alfa 32 Space Junction!

53
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,000
Send out the
alarm signal.

54
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,000
The prisoners are
heading to the A25 Block

55
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,166
of the Space
Junction right now!

56
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,291
Attention! This is
an Emergency Alert!

57
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,541
Close down the Alfa 32
Space Junction immediately!

58
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,750
Yes, Sir!

59
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,583
Yes...
Come in.

60
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,208
Manabu. What's the matter?
Are you feeling sick?

61
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:11,666
Huh...? Oh, no, I feel
fine... It's just...

62
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,666
Is this about work? Or is
it something personal?

63
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,625
You don't have to worry. I'm
programmed to keep secrets.

64
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,458
Huh?

65
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,625
So am I to
understand that

66
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,416
you're not here for
counseling then?

67
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,750
Check the grid to see if
there are any SDF trains

68
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,333
near the Alpha 32
Space Junction.

69
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:30,208
It looks like Big 1's coming
back from Ariadne Junction.

70
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,916
Sorry you think
it's so funny.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,583
But you said that
you weren't sick.

72
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,416
So, well, I
just assumed...

73
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,125
That's okay. I was worried
about you. That's all.

74
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,000
Well, it's
about the party.

75
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,916
Oh... I'm sure you'll
have a very good time.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,583
Yuki. Is
there something

77
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,083
that you don't really
like about us... you know?

78
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,166
Of course not.

79
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,208
Oh, well, hey! Why
don't you join us?

80
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,625
You've never
gone to a party?

81
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,833
It's a lot of fun to get
together with your shipmates!

82
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,958
Shipmate? As I understand
the term it is by definition

83
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,708
meant to describe a human
being. Is it not...?

84
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,416
I'm just a Sexaroid
that's been assigned here

85
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,583
for medical care... So the term
doesn't really apply to me.

86
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,291
What d'ya mean?!

87
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,958
What in the world could make
such a nasty smell like that?

88
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,791
Acetic acid?

89
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,958
Well. Whatever it
is, it's awful...

90
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:47,500
Do you think it could it be
from him? Oh yeah... It is him!

91
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,000
Careful! Don't
touch the blood!

92
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,125
Uhhh...

93
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,333
It's just that the
chemical composition

94
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,750
of Antlian blood
is very unique.

95
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,000
It starts to oxidize
once it's exposed to air

96
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,125
and the process continues
until the blood

97
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:03,708
actually turns into acid.
It's quite dangerous.

98
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:07,541
This chemical will
reduce the effect.

99
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,125
That should
neutralize it.

100
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,208
Amazing!

101
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,875
All right, Sirius
Platoon, everybody listen.

102
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,000
Four prisoners have escaped.
At least one of them is armed.

103
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,708
He's carrying a handgun that he
took from a fallen SDF member.

104
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,916
Two of the prisoners
are traveling together.

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,583
The other two don't
know each other.

106
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,750
They're by
themselves,

107
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,000
traveling solo in
different directions.

108
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,791
What's
wrong, Liza?

109
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,750
Huh? Nothing. Don't
worry about me!

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,916
Keep up or I have no choice...
I'll leave you behind!

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,416
No! I can
do it!

112
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,166
All of them are
convicted criminals,

113
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,625
imprisoned after being
found guilty of murder.

114
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,291
No one
searches alone.

115
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,041
They're too dangerous
and unpredictable.

116
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,500
You'll each work
with a partner.

117
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:26,250
Yuki. Unfortunately, I need you
to join the search this time.

118
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,583
Yes,
Captain.

119
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,458
David, you go with Louis.
Manabu, you take Yuki.

120
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,708
Bruce, you're with
me. Let's move out!

121
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,583
[All]
Yes, Sir!

122
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,583
There's a good chance you'll
need to use a gun this time.

123
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,791
These are very dangerous
people... Play it safe.

124
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,666
Your real gun is
loaded, right?!

125
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,916
Yes.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,750
All right, then. Good
luck. You'll need it.

127
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,625
Well, I'm over thirty and I'm
still playing hide and seek.

128
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:23,541
Well, you know the old
saying. What goes up...

129
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,083
Must
come down!

130
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's go!

131
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,166
This is Manabu. We've found
nothing in Block A-25.

132
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,666
We are now moving
to Block B-18.

133
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,458
[Buldge] Okay. Remember,
one of them is armed.

134
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't relax
your guard!

135
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,375
Yes, Sir!

136
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,916
He's alone!
Let's go!

137
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,083
Bruce and I are in pursuit
of one of the prisoners!

138
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:23,083
We're currently headed
toward Block F9! Standby!

139
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:26,666
Stay where
you are!

140
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,458
Man!
He's fast!

141
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,833
We'll get 'im!

142
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,166
Well what
d'ya know!

143
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,125
Looks to me like you've just
come to the end of the road.

144
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,750
Get your
hands up!

145
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,083
We nabbed
one, Captain!

146
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:57,833
Good work!

147
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,541
Which way?!
Right!

148
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,666
Once we're in the
dark, it's my game!

149
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,791
You might be able
to see in the dark,

150
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,208
but you have a lousy
sense of direction.

151
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,541
We got
another one!

152
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,458
Two down;
two to go.

153
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,125
Manabu!

154
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,708
See that... That's
oxidized Antlian blood.

155
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:34,666
Over here, too... The blood
trail leads this way.

156
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,625
One of them must've
had Antilian blood

157
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,958
splashed onto
their body.

158
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,208
Whoever it
is will die

159
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,666
if we don't get to them
and treat it them soon.

160
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,625
Right! Let's
get a move on!

161
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,291
Get up! Liza!
We've got to go!

162
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:25,958
Can you
keep going?

163
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,458
The blood trail
ends right here...

164
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,250
Look out!
Get Over here!

165
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,000
We can't forget
that they're armed!

166
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,333
They might be
right next to us!

167
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,791
They're smart; they tried
to stop the bleeding.

168
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,291
But it can't
be stopped.

169
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,500
We should be able to see
more bloodstains soon.

170
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,625
They're covering
their tracks.

171
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,125
But they can't get too
far with that wound.

172
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,875
We don't have
much time!

173
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,125
They'll die if we
don't find them soon!

174
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,500
Stop it!

175
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,666
You can't treat their wound
if you're dead, Yuki!

176
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,125
There! You see! Hey!
You can't escape!

177
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,291
So why make things
worse for yourselves!

178
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,791
Heh! That's
a laugh!

179
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,125
We'll be sent to Alcarz no
matter what we do here!

180
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,916
It can't get any
worse than that!

181
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,875
You're on a junction
in deep space!

182
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,291
There's no way
out of here!

183
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,583
We'll see
about that!

184
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,041
Let's go!

185
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,625
We've just made contact
with the two prisoners!

186
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,958
They're armed and heading
towards Block C-48!

187
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:40,583
We're on
our way!

188
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,333
Come on!

189
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,750
She doesn't
have much time.

190
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,958
Her body will oxidize
in a few minutes...

191
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,708
If she doesn't get the proper
treatment now then she'll die.

192
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,750
Listen to me!
She's gonna die soon

193
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,208
without the
proper medicine!

194
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,583
I'll die?

195
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,958
Toss your gun where I can
see it and surrender!

196
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,083
While there's
still time!

197
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:23,250
Nice try, kid, but
I'm not buying it!

198
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,916
It's the
truth!

199
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,458
She's come in contact with
Antilian blood, hasn't she?!

200
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,750
You're lying!

201
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,750
Please! Throw your
gun out... now!

202
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,708
Your friend is
running out of time!

203
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,916
Damnit!

204
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,625
Listen to me, if you
don't surrender right now

205
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,250
we may not be
able to save her!

206
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,958
Good. You did
the right thing.

207
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,541
We're coming over
with the medicine.

208
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:10,125
I missed them! Liza, we've
got to get out of here now!

209
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,208
Come on!

210
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,833
I can't go on.
It hurts too bad.

211
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,625
We're out of time. She's
dying... I have to go now.

212
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,500
Yuki! Wait! What do
you think you're doing?!

213
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,750
It's too dangerous to
go! You'll be killed!

214
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,416
Please don't worry.
It'll be all right.

215
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,125
You see, if I'm shot I
won't feel any pain...

216
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,708
And besides, if I am destroyed
it won't affect the platoon.

217
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,375
Another Sexaroid
will take my place.

218
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,250
That's crazy! Don't
you know by now

219
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,166
just what you mean
to us, Yuki?!

220
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,875
I'm the certified
Medical Sexaroid

221
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,000
currently assigned to
the Sirius Platoon.

222
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,416
No! You're our
shipmate! Understand?!

223
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,041
And I can't allow a shipmate
to foolishly expose herself

224
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,416
to danger
like that!

225
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,458
Shipmate... The truth is
I'm a Medical Sexaroid...

226
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,583
one who's been programmed
to help humans...

227
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,375
And whenever I see a human
in front of me who's in pain

228
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,291
it's impossible for
me to ignore it.

229
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,583
Now get out of
my way, Manabu.

230
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:07,041
Leon... I don't wanna die... 
please let them help me...

231
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,791
Our medical expert is coming!
She can help your friend!

232
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:14,000
So don't shoot! Trust
me! This isn't a trick!

233
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:18,666
Okay then... But she comes
alone! You Understand me?!

234
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,958
Don't worry. You'll
be well in no time

235
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,625
once I give you
the treatment.

236
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,416
All right. Get
up. Right now!

237
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,291
Not before
I treat her!

238
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:43,458
You can do whatever you want to
her later! Right now stand up!

239
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,583
Yuki! You
let her go!

240
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,416
Don't move!
Drop your gun! Now!

241
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,208
And then go and find
me an Escape-Pod.

242
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,875
Sorry! I
can't do that!

243
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,583
Didn't I tell you? Things
can't get any worse for me.

244
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,875
You're dealing with someone
who has nothing to lose.

245
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,125
Don't you
understand?

246
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,583
She'll die if we don't
treat her immediately!

247
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,208
So What's it going to
be?! The gun or her life?!

248
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,083
Manabu!

249
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,916
The other
one, too!

250
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,291
Please! I don't
wanna die!!

251
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,833
Leon, just let her do her
job before it's too late...

252
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:27,125
How long could it take?
Please, Leon. I need help!

253
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:33,083
You don't
care... Do you?

254
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:40,000
What?! No! You're-
You're out of your mind!!

255
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,541
Come on, she wouldn't
have made it anyway...

256
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,291
The way I see it
I did her a favor.

257
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,625
But she would've made it
once she got the treatment!!

258
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,291
You mean... if...

259
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,291
What?! ...You were never
gonna let her have it?!

260
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,166
What do
you think?

261
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,208
You...
murdered her!

262
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,000
All right, now.
Throw your gun down

263
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,333
and put your hands
up! ...Or else!

264
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,958
Don't you do it,
Manabu! Forget about me!

265
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:06,416
You've got to carry out your
duty! No matter what happens!

266
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:16,125
Manabu!

267
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:21,750
Hurry up!
I'm warning you!

268
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,583
Manabu!
Why...?

269
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,916
Hey, forget about
that space pod!

270
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,625
I'll be better off
if you're dead!

271
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,375
Damn, you!

272
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,666
Yuki!

273
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,041
Yuki!!!

274
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,958
Manabu!

275
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,541
Are you
all right?

276
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:06,500
Yuki!! Yuki! Are you injured?!
A little help! She's been hit!!

277
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,208
Yuki, can you
hear me?

278
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,416
Can you
stand?

279
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,250
I think so.

280
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,541
Do you regret
doing that?

281
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,916
Do you need me
to carry you?

282
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,625
No.

283
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,875
No. I don't
regret it at all.

284
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,250
Thanks...
for everything.

285
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,208
Let's go, Yuuki!
Get the lead out!

286
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,291
Right!
Yes, Sir!!

287
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:00,000
Courage and compassion;
such a rare combination.

288
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,666
You've taken another bold step
toward your destiny, Manabu.

289
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:10,125
It was the easiest
bet I've ever won!

290
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,500
What are you waiting
for? Here! Have a drink!

291
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,791
Thanks. I
love wine.

292
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,791
Don't have too much; you might
have to drive us to the store.

293
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,125
Sorry I'm so
late, you guys.

294
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:26,166
Now there's a young woman
who can light up a room!

295
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,625
Wow. I guess clothes
do make the man!

296
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,958
That's it?!
What a geekoid!

297
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,291
He may be a little
tongue-tied

298
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,000
but you should have seen
the look on his face

299
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,166
when you
walked in!

300
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,375
Who...? Me...? You're
just saying that.

301
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,375
Yeah,
right!

302
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,708
Sorry, I'm late. I had
to draft a report.

303
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,000
It's my first day
back on the job...

304
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,166
I'm really looking forward to
working with all of you again.

305
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,666
Things just haven't
been the same.

306
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,625
Well, then. I think Yuki's
return to Sirius Platoon

307
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,500
calls for a toast!
What d'ya say?!

308
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,875
In life, we build
so many walls

309
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:09,416
to protect the delicate and
innocent beauty within us.

310
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,666
But occasionally, life leads us
to friends who truly love us;

311
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,333
friends who need not be
boxed out of our hearts.

312
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,708
Captain! Will
you do the honors?

313
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,250
To Yuki! The best medical
officer in the fleet!

314
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,833
[Attendant]
Please be seated.

315
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:27,708
As Captain it's imperative that
I not be controlled by emotion.

316
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:30,000
Stern detachment is
the shield I use.

317
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,958
But occasionally someone
slips through my defenses.

318
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,333
And for me that
someone is Catalina.

319
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,458
See you next time
on the Railways!
