1
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,583
[Yuki] Louis!
She's unconscious!

2
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,583
Her system's
in shock!

3
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:53,166
Louis!

4
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,041
David! What's the
status on the engines?!

5
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,458
The main engine
is down, Captain!

6
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,833
Back-up engine
is still on-line!

7
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,166
Keep that
engine running!

8
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,166
We have to avoid
crashing at all costs!

9
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,416
Manabu! Start Scanning the
topography of the planet!

10
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,125
Find a place for
an emergency landing!

11
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,041
Right!

12
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,083
Captain!
System failure!

13
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,500
Well fix it! Now!

14
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,500
Somebody figure out
what the hell's going on!

15
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,750
We're approaching
the atmosphere.

16
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,875
Bring the back-up
engine to full power

17
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,500
and keep the train
as level as possible.

18
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,333
Yes, Sir!

19
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,750
Yuki. Use this.

20
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,708
I'm adjusting the entry
angle. Three degrees!

21
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,750
Hold on!!
We're coming in hot!!

22
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,666
Glad I brought
spare pants.

23
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,791
We need to get Louis to
the Medical Coach! Quick!

24
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,458
[Manabu]
Louis.

25
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,041
[Bruce]
Manabu!

26
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,916
[Ivanov]
Just leave her be.

27
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What?!

28
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,791
We're facing a
Galactic Emergency here!

29
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,375
First things first!

30
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,125
Get me the coordinates of the
Dimension Hole off that chip!

31
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,916
I want you two to get
the communication and radar

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,791
systems up
and running again.

33
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,208
Contact HQ as soon as
the systems are up.

34
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,916
And get me the
Supreme Commander.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,416
Excuse me.
Are you saying

36
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,916
that we can't try to
save our own shipmate?

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,041
Do you realize
that there are

38
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,166
hundreds of millions
of lives at stake?

39
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,750
Every second
is critical.

40
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,750
Now, do we finally
understand each other.

41
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,416
All too
well, General.

42
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,000
In her condition, she
wouldn't have made it anyway.

43
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,416
She'll be decorated for
dying in the line of duty.

44
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,541
What's your problem?

45
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,125
Do as you're told or
I'll have you detained!

46
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,041
That's it you've gone
too far, General!

47
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,041
That man is
guilty of treason!

48
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,416
Put the gun down!

49
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,625
I'll put it down when
you obey my orders!

50
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:04,375
I will not tolerate
mutinous behavior on my...

51
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,541
Manabu. Bruce.

52
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,166
Take Louis to the
Medical Coach right now.

53
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,083
Yuki, please do your
very best for her.

54
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,083
[All] Yes, Sir!

55
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,000
Bulge, what's the
meaning of this?

56
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,958
I'll take full
responsibility, Sir.

57
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,333
General, will you
please remove your foot?

58
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,458
My foot?

59
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,083
She lost her
life for us.

60
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:34,500
I can't let her courageous
death be in vain.

61
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,041
Nor can I just let
one of my crew die...

62
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,166
They risk their lives
out here everyday.

63
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,500
And it's my job to
get them home alive.

64
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,958
But you are right,
General...

65
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,000
Sacrifices must be made.

66
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,708
But we should make them,
not our subordinates.

67
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,125
That's right.
How could I forget?

68
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,666
Now I know where
you get it from.

69
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,041
Your Captain died making
a sacrificial attack

70
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,250
to save his crew.

71
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,833
Well, your Captain
got it backwards.

72
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,708
The leaders are the ones
who are supposed to survive!

73
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,333
What was his name?
Wataru Yuuki?

74
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,583
That's right...
What an idiot he was.

75
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,541
Vega, Rigel, and
Acrux Platoons

76
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,208
have been
deployed, Commander.

77
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,916
All have been fully equipped
with a compliment

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,375
of first-class weapons.

79
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,000
They are now leaving
the atmosphere

80
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,500
and will reach
the Warp Zone

81
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,458
leading to Kowloon
in 2 minutes.

82
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,041
What's the status on
Big One's ID signal?

83
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,250
We're still not
picking it up, Sir!

84
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,708
They've got to be
out there somewhere.

85
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,666
Keep trying to reach
them on all channels.

86
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,583
Brad, have Spica
Platoon standing by

87
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,250
and ready
for take-off!

88
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,250
On it, Sir!

89
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,125
Something is
approaching.

90
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,583
No, it's not. It's always
been very close to us.

91
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,458
But I can't see it.
I don't know what it is.

92
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,750
What's wrong?

93
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,916
What is this force that's
blocking our vision?

94
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,958
If I don't perform surgery
on her within two hours

95
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,625
I'm going to
lose her.

96
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,375
But I don't have
enough blood to operate.

97
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,416
Even my basic
suture instruments

98
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,583
were destroyed
in the attack.

99
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,416
Let's take her
to a hospital.

100
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,875
I'm afraid that's
not possible.

101
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,583
She's too weak
to transport...

102
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,875
There's no way that
she'd survive the trip.

103
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,583
I can give Louis
some of my blood.

104
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:33,333
Can you look up our blood types
and see if we're compatible.

105
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,291
I already have. None of you
have the right blood type.

106
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,625
Let's go, Manabu.

107
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,041
Bruce, wait. I haven't
checked you out yet.

108
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,500
We've got to
find a hospital.

109
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,666
Right.

110
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,791
Yuki... We'll
bring what you need.

111
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,583
But What about your injury?!
You said that you were hit!

112
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,583
It's just a bruise.

113
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,958
Louis. Hold on.

114
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,750
Just be ready for
anything, Yuuki.

115
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,791
She won't die...
She's gonna make it.

116
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,041
I know she will...

117
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,458
It's what Liffle said
that I'm worried about.

118
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,583
I believe that she was
telling us the truth...

119
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,916
which means that this
is the biggest case

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,291
in the history
of the S-D-F.

121
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,208
If we don't prevent
these invaders

122
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,000
from taking
over our Galaxy

123
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,541
then they'll be
no stopping them.

124
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,916
The fate of the entire
Universe is in the balance.

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,791
Your right, Bruce.
This is it.

126
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:50,375
Stay loose... We'll
take it one step at a time.

127
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:54,375
Stop it! Let go of
me! No-ho-ho! Please!

128
00:08:54,458 --> 00:09:02,208
Let me out! Stop it!
Leave me alone!

129
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,375
Come back!
Please! Help me!!

130
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,916
Why today?

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,916
Manabu!

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,875
I'm there!

133
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:23,083
Help me!!

134
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,875
S-D-F? What are you
guys doin' way out here?

135
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,333
Yeah, Man. What gives?
This is messed up.

136
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,958
We're setting up a
new base out here.

137
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:41,458
This is our territory now... You
guys had better behave.

138
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,958
What! A base?!

139
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,458
Isn't that nice!?

140
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,916
Man! This stinks.

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,125
Thank you, guys! I
don't know what to say!

142
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,208
You can say that
you won't hitchhike

143
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,458
on deserted roads
anymore for one.

144
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,875
Sorry.

145
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,708
You would've been sorry if
we didn't show up, stupid.

146
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't you
call me that!

147
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,416
Okay, if you promise
to use your brain,

148
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,958
I won't call you stupid.

149
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,750
Oh, no! My hat!

150
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,250
Just forget about
it. We're in a hurry.

151
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,708
Bruce?

152
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,875
Hmm?

153
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,083
Are you all right?

154
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,208
Yeah, I'm fine.

155
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,375
Aren't you driving
a little fast?!

156
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,541
It's an emergency. We're trying
to save our friend's life.

157
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,833
What?! Are you serious?!

158
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:35,875
We're running out of time.
That's the last one.

159
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,000
Louis. I'm sorry.

160
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,208
Manabu.

161
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:02,375
Captain, I'm having difficulty
analyzing the Cosmo Matrix.

162
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,000
The equipment that we
have onboard Big One

163
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,416
isn't going
to cut it, Sir.

164
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,375
We'll have to get it
back to Headquarters

165
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,375
and put our top
scientists on it.

166
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,458
Thanks, David.

167
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,125
No problem, Sir.

168
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, good. At least
something's going right.

169
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,583
We're in the Sutherland
Planetary System.

170
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:24,958
Talk about your
Warp slingshot.

171
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,458
Sirius Platoon. This is
Galaxy Railways Headquarters.

172
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:31,333
Please come in. Sirius
Platoon. Please respond.

173
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,291
This is the SDF
Sirius Platoon

174
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,500
responding from Big One.
Come in Headquarters.

175
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,333
Thank goodness!
You're alive!

176
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,791
Amen to that.

177
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,291
We crashed on the 4th planet
in the Sutherland System.

178
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,708
We'll send a
rescue team!

179
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,208
Sounds good.

180
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,833
Also, discontinue all Railway
Lines in the Kowloon area.

181
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,791
There's a big Destroyer out
there. And it means business.

182
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,416
Not for long. Vega, Rigel,
and Acrux Platoons

183
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,666
are on their
way there

184
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,750
with a full compliment
of 1st class weapons.

185
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,041
Withdraw!!
Pull them back!!

186
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,750
Take your positions!
Prepare for battle!

187
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,625
If they make
one wrong move,

188
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,750
attack them with
everything we've got!

189
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,791
Yes Sir,
Captain!

190
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,458
Now!! Open fire!!

191
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,583
Stay inside! Let's
go for the bridge!

192
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,583
Got it!

193
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,333
Look out!
Behind you!

194
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,541
I'm hit!

195
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,000
They're everywhere!

196
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,958
Accrux Platoon is no
longer responding!

197
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,375
That does it!

198
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,833
Murase! Get out of
there! Withdraw!

199
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,208
Is that
you, Bulge?!

200
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,791
Yes! Get out of
there, Murase!

201
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,541
We can't beat them
with the weapons we have!

202
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,041
They just shot
down my old platoon!

203
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,458
You know I can't
run away, Bulge!

204
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,166
I'll ram the
Iron Berger

205
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,958
right down their
throat if I have to!

206
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,625
Murase! Get out of there
or you're all dead!

207
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,291
Their ship
is disappearing!

208
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,375
No way!

209
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,958
How the hell
did they do that?

210
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,500
Don't worry. We'll
be there in no time.

211
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,000
This is the
last one.

212
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:20,958
Got it.

213
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,875
What's the matter?
Hey! You're bleeding!

214
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,000
It's nothing.
What are you doing?

215
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,125
Yuuki, you too?

216
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,541
That looks
like a gunshot!

217
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,833
Ivanov!
He got you!

218
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,041
Ricochets only
count in horseshoes.

219
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,041
No wait. That's
not the saying.

220
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,541
Why didn't you
say something?!

221
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,375
Yuki could have
treated you!

222
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,250
Yuki had all that
she could handle...

223
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,541
Louis' wound is much
more serious than mine,

224
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,625
and that's all
there is to it.

225
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,375
You could
die, Bruce!

226
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,166
Don't get all
emotional on me.

227
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,916
You've got to be
tougher than that, Yuuki.

228
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,041
Don't be
an idiot!

229
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,750
Use your brain and
get some treatment!

230
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,125
This is a
hospital after all!

231
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,625
I appreciate all of
your help, Doctor.

232
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,916
Don't be silly.
All I did was watch.

233
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,541
I was very impressed
with your skills, Yuki.

234
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,541
Thank you.

235
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,083
You should go
stay with Louis.

236
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,500
Oh. Yes, Sir.

237
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,583
We just got word that your
friend is doing just fine.

238
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,875
Well that's good news. Thank
you. Louis' a great girl.

239
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,458
My goodness. Look at that
body. Now that's just pitiful.

240
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,708
Why do you say that?
I feel fine.

241
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,708
It's not your conditioning.
You're in great shape.

242
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,458
It's all the scars.

243
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,750
Do they use you for
target practice or what?

244
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,083
I started young.

245
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,500
For as long as I can remember
I did something similar

246
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,750
to mercenary soldier
work to survive.

247
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,166
The only thing these hands
have ever held are guns.

248
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,666
And this.

249
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,041
I see. It looks like it's
seen plenty of action...

250
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,875
Is it your
good luck charm?

251
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,000
I suppose it is.

252
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,875
Bruce. The Doctor prescribed
three days bed rest.

253
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,541
He informed the SDF. Your
friends will be back for you.

254
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,958
Just a second, Nurse.

255
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,041
Sorry for calling
you stupid earlier.

256
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,500
You're very good
at what you do.

257
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,666
Apology accepted, Bruce.

258
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,708
I'm sorry I called
you an idiot.

259
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,500
Big One is connected
and ready for tow...

260
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,500
We're taking-off.

261
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,583
Captain, wait!

262
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,875
Hey, Bruce, the Doctor said
that you would be laid up

263
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,250
for at least
three days.

264
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,541
What's going on
there, partner?

265
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,833
Early discharge.
It's just a scratch.

266
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,375
I'm on my way.
Hang tight...

267
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:25,583
Thought you could leave
without saying goodbye?

268
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:29,458
Painkillers and antibiotics...
Take as prescribed.

269
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,708
Thanks for
your help.

270
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,083
Now we're even.

271
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,666
Can you play your harmonica
for me next time we meet?

272
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,583
It'll cost ya.

273
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,666
I'll let you take
me out. How's that?

274
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,708
Never mind.
I can't. I forgot.

275
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,083
What?!
You're married?!

276
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,916
No... I can't play
it because it's broken.

277
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,083
Huh?

278
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,083
It was killed in
the line of duty.

279
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,416
But not before it
saved my life.

280
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,916
You're right. It is
my good luck charm.

281
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,583
Well, what
do ya know...

282
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,125
See ya later.

283
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:13,875
Oh, well, do you think we'll
see each other again or what?

284
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,333
If you're
a good girl.

285
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,250
Hey! Stop treating me
like a little kid!

286
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,791
I'll be damned.
Tabito Tea.

287
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:15,250
Captain... Yuki... David...
Louis... Manabu...

288
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,708
I don't want to
die! Please...

289
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,000
Manabu... Thank you.

290
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,375
Hey, don't thank me.
We're shipmates, remember?

291
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,625
Right.

292
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,291
Well, I guess we're more
than just shipmates.

293
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,291
It seems like we've all
become family now, you know?

294
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:48,958
[Manabu] Hey, Louis.
Whatever you do,

295
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,250
don't tell Bruce I
said hat. Okay?

296
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,250
Why not? You two
get along great now.

297
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,583
I know. But he'll still
laugh at me about it.

298
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,916
He really admires
you, you know.

299
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,750
Bruce?

300
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,916
Yeah.

301
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,500
Well, it goes both
ways. I admire him, too.

302
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,625
So many times death
comes unexpected...

303
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:22,791
like a thief in the night...
Unwanted and unannounced.

304
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,416
Another soul has
passed into the unknown

305
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,250
with no one to keep him company
and nothing to sooth him...

306
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,458
save the love
of his friends

307
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,041
who seemed like they
were an eternity away.

308
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,916
[David] Losing one of our
good friends hurts more

309
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,416
than I
could've imagined.

310
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,958
But the trouble
doesn't end there.

311
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,375
Captain Bulge has to face the
iron wrath of General Ivanov

312
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,291
while the threat of an alien
invasion looms over our heads.

313
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,041
We're going to
miss you, Bruce.

314
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,625
See ya next time
on the Railways!
