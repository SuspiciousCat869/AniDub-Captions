[Narr] The Universe, home to
all life in the physical plane.

2
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:27,041
Man sets sail and
travels this Grand Ocean

3
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,416
fueled by his
hopes and dreams.

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,583
But sometimes his
dreams are crushed

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,416
and his
anguishing heart

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,500
can only see a dark,
cold and lonely place.

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,916
What are you doing?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,250
Mamoru!
Catch!

9
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:48,083
You were all I had! Why did
you have to die? It's not fair!

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,916
[Wataru] Mamoru.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,416
I'm not scared.
Not anymore.

12
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,666
[Kanna] Manabu Yuuki, you get
in here right this second!

13
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,208
[Manabu] Mom?
What's wrong?

14
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:21,333
Don't give me that, Manabu!
You know exactly what's wrong!

15
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,291
I do?

16
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:29,291
Mom, I really didn't do
anything. Not this time anyway.

17
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:30,958
Don't lie, Manabu.

18
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:31,958
But I'm not lying!

19
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,333
This is my rail-pass!
I've been accepted!

20
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:42,750
Accepted to what?
The SDF cemetery!

21
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,708
What's that, Manabu?
A love letter?

22
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,708
Hey! Who's the
lucky girl?

23
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,583
How could you join the SDF
behind my back, Manabu?

24
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,208
This is unforgivable.

25
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,708
But it's my life.

26
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:56,541
You mean it's your death.
First your father. Then Mamoru.

27
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,708
And now you expect
me to lose you, too!

28
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,333
Well, I won't let
you go! Never!

29
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,666
Come on, Mom.

30
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,500
No, Manabu.
Absolutely not.

31
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,041
If you insist on joining,
you're no longer my son.

32
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,500
Kanna! Let's not
lose our heads now!

33
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,083
Manabu was accepted.
That doesn't mean he's going.

34
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,541
I don't know.

35
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,833
Manabu's going to come and
work with us in the mine!

36
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,208
Aren't you?

37
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,875
No, I'm not. I'm going into
space, and that's that!

38
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,458
She didn't mean it.

39
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:33,708
She doesn't want to lose you
too, Manabu. That's all.

40
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,875
Wataru Yuuki.
What should I do?

41
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:48,583
He's just like you.
He's exactly like you.

42
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,291
Dad.

43
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,375
Please Son, take care
of your mother for me.

44
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,666
She needs you. You're much
stronger than you realize.

45
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,000
Manabu. Take care
of Mom for me, okay?

46
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,708
You can count on me.

47
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:19,375
Dad, Mamoru, I have
taken care of Mom.

48
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,541
But I have to
follow my heart.

49
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,416
I can't give up my dream.
I have to leave her now.

50
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,291
It's time. Off to
the Grand Ocean.

51
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,375
Goodbye, Mom. I'll be
back as soon as I can.

52
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,166
Bye, Shutaro.

53
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,458
[Kanna] Manabu,
wait a second.

54
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,166
Take this. You're going to
get hungry on the train later.

55
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,958
I love you, Mom.

56
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,958
I love you, too.

57
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,000
Goodbye!

58
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,458
[Announcer] The
space-train on track three

59
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,625
will be departing for
Destiny in two minutes.

60
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,625
Huh? You're kidding me.
Well, I'll be damned.

61
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,625
Now I've seen it all.

62
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,750
Looks like I won't
have to be chasing you

63
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,041
out of here
anymore.

64
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,500
Welcome to the Space
Defense Force, Mr. Yuuki.

65
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,166
Thanks. I
appreciate it.

66
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:00,291
Bye, Mom!
Don't worry! I'll be back!

67
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,791
[Robot] Welcome aboard
space-train 550

68
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,708
heading for Planet Destiny
through the Altair Nebula.

69
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,750
We will be stopping at Hope
and Zetsubou on the way.

70
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,875
Please note that our route will
be taking us by the time-knot.

71
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,333
We ask that you keep your
windows closed while we pass it

72
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,500
because we will be experiencing
electro-magnetic interference.

73
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,750
Thank you.

74
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,875
I don't even know what
a time-knot is. Do you?

75
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,875
Sure. It's an anomaly with
a different time-axis.

76
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,208
I've heard that a lot of
trains have wrecked there.

77
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,708
Well, that's comforting.

78
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,250
I didn't mean
to scare you.

79
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,666
I'm not scared.

80
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,791
My name's Louis Fort Drake.
You can call me Louis.

81
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,666
What planet are you from?
Don't you shake hands there?

82
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,416
Sorry. I'm Manabu Yuuki.

83
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,166
Manabu, huh?
Nice to meet you.

84
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,875
Nice to meet
you, too.

85
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,291
Well, it's nice to know

86
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,916
that there's more than one
SDF member on this train.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,750
What do you
mean by that?

88
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,500
I mean that yours truly
is an SDF member, too.

89
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,333
Awesome.

90
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,750
How old are
you anyway?

91
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm almost twenty.

92
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,208
You look much
younger than that.

93
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,666
More like a boy
than a man.

94
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,583
Thanks a lot.

95
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,125
It's not an
insult, silly.

96
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,875
It just means that
you'll age gracefully.

97
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,250
Yeah, whatever. How
old are you anyway?

98
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,750
I just turned eighteen.

99
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,958
What?
You're kidding.

100
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,750
Do I look older
or younger?

101
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,958
Older.

102
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,083
Everyone thinks I'm
older than I really am.

103
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,958
I don't understand why.

104
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,708
It's because you're
a know-it-all.

105
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,083
I'm not a
know-it-all!

106
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,791
Look, I was only
trying to help.

107
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,541
Yeah, well just keep your
opinions to yourself!

108
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,000
All right?

109
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,083
You're the one who asked!
What was I supposed to say?

110
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,375
You don't know much about
girls. Do you, Manabu?

111
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,166
I know enough!

112
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,875
We are approaching
the Time-Knot.

113
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,916
Please close the
cabin window.

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,166
Close that.
Would ya?

115
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,916
I'm too old and
decrepit to reach.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,500
Excuse me. Will one of you
please just close the window?

117
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,458
What are you doing?

118
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,500
I-I didn't do that on purpose!
Are you out of your mind?

119
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,250
Catch it in the
web, not your palm!

120
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,708
You'll give us away.

121
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,208
Uh-oh.

122
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,125
What's the matter?

123
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,208
[Robot]
Ladies and Gentlemen:

124
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,000
we will be experiencing
a brief delay

125
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,708
due to engine trouble.
Please do not be alarmed.

126
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,333
You are not in danger.
This is a minor problem only.

127
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,708
Yeah, minor my foot. I'm gonna
check out the engine room!

128
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,083
I'm coming too!

129
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,416
Please! Return
to your seats!

130
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,166
Look! We want to
know what's going on!

131
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,833
Our train has derailed! We've
slipped into the Time Knot!

132
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,916
[Sayaka] We have an
accident by the Time-Knot!

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,833
It's the
Five-fifty Express!

134
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,250
They're requesting assistance
from the SDF, Commander!

135
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,416
We'll send Big One! Alert the
Sirius Platoon immediately!

136
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,083
[Sayaka] Sirius Platoon
is deploying, Commander!

137
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,125
[Bulge] System check!

138
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,750
[Bruce] Stand by for
System Check!

139
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,750
[David] Orbit Network
Radar ready!

140
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,916
[Kate] Big One is now
in take-off position!

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,958
[Bruce] Magnetic Barrier
Generator is a go!

142
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,083
[David] Cylinder
Valves are open!

143
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,291
Atomic Boiler
Pressure is a go!

144
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,291
[Kate] The Main Circuit
is now online!

145
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,083
[Bruce] All energy levels
ready for take-off!

146
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,625
[David] The warp drive
coupling is now in place!

147
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,083
[Kate] All systems
green, Captain Bulge!

148
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,458
Awaiting your
command, Sir!

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,500
Let's move out!
Ahead full!

150
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,166
He's still alive.
Hey, are you all right?

151
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,333
Can you hear me?
Are you okay, buddy?

152
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,875
Mmm, yeah.

153
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,583
Uh, where are we?

154
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,250
You're on Planet Hakumei.
You're lucky to be alive.

155
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,541
Your train crashed.

156
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,291
[Manabu] No, it can't be.
You're dead.

157
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,833
[Mamoru] You've taken
quite a knock.

158
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,000
I can assure you
I'm not dead.

159
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,625
My name's
Mamoru Yuuki.

160
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,875
I'm here with my SDF unit;
the Space Panzer Grenadiers.

161
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,375
I must be dreaming.

162
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,208
The Space Panzer
Grenadiers? Wow!

163
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,583
That's the most
elite unit

164
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,166
in the Space Defense Force!
That's everyone's dream!

165
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,208
It's an honor to meet you!
My name's Louis.

166
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,541
My friend and I just
joined the SDF.

167
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,458
We were on our way
to headquarters

168
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,291
when our
train crashed.

169
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,083
Huh? Look out!
Get down!

170
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,208
Are you all right?

171
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,250
I'm fine.

172
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,416
Those vultures!
Attacking civilians!

173
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,916
Does this train have
a Stealth Module?

174
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,416
Y-yes, Sir! Of course!

175
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,125
I'll activate the Optical
Camouflage immediately!

176
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,041
[Mamoru] Good. Now if
you want to save

177
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,250
the passengers
and train,

178
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,041
we'll have to
act as decoys.

179
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,291
It'll be a dangerous
first mission,

180
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,666
but welcome
to the SDF!

181
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,958
Follow me!
Stay low!

182
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,208
Whoever hits them gets
a bonus! SDF swine!

183
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,625
Hold on back
there, guys!

184
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,625
You're not Panzers!
You're chickens!

185
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,291
We're safe now.
At least until morning.

186
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,500
[Manabu] Can you
tell me if we slipped

187
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,833
into a different
time-axis

188
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,125
when we passed through
the time-knot?

189
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,333
[Robot] I believe so.

190
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,791
What year
is it now?

191
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,416
I estimate that it
is five years

192
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,333
before the day
that we took off.

193
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,958
I thought so.

194
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,958
What in the world are
you talking about?

195
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,583
Time shifted. We're
in the past now.

196
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,000
Huh?

197
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,791
If we go back through the
Time Hole before it closes

198
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,000
we should be able
to return to our time.

199
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,500
But our train's wrecked!

200
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,625
Our train
has been sending

201
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,125
a distress signal
since the accident.

202
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,083
If the Time Hole hasn't closed,
a rescue team could find us.

203
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,500
But what would happen
to my brother then?

204
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,666
What do you mean
your brother?

205
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,833
Our friend; the one
who saved us earlier.

206
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,875
He's my
big brother.

207
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,958
He was killed
on this planet

208
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,583
five years ago in
the line of duty.

209
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,458
But if he was killed,
then that means...

210
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,583
That he's going to die soon.
It's unavoidable.

211
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,416
Well If a rescue team comes,
why don't we take him with us?

212
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,333
That would not
be advisable!

213
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,583
Please follow the Galaxy
Railways manual in this matter!

214
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,750
What does it say?

215
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,000
Article 33
paragraph 2 states

216
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,916
that passengers who
have time-slipped

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,750
must not intervene in
affairs of the past

218
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,791
or it can permanently
change the future.

219
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,166
Altering your
brother's fate

220
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,916
could have serious
repercussions.

221
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,458
So, how can you
change a man's fate?

222
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,875
You can't!

223
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,166
Under normal circumstances
that would be impossible!

224
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,583
That's for sure.

225
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:59,000
We never know what life
has in store for us.

226
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,750
If we did, could
we accept it?

227
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,875
We'll have to
move out soon.

228
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,375
Staying in one place
too long is dangerous.

229
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,875
Who are these guys?

230
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,875
They're space-pirates.
They're leader is Guy Sander.

231
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,375
Where's the rest
of your platoon?

232
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,083
They're guarding
our base here.

233
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,250
We're planning
on launching

234
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,125
an all-out attack
at the crack of dawn.

235
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,250
They know that.
The enemy, they know.

236
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,500
What?

237
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,833
They know you're coming.
They found out somehow.

238
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,833
They're planning to
set a trap for you.

239
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,083
That can't be.

240
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,791
Yes it can! You're all
going to die! They know!

241
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,083
I don't believe you.

242
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,083
You have to! I'm your brother!

243
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,708
Now I know you're lying.
I do have a brother,

244
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,625
but I'm five years
older than he is.

245
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,833
I know we look
the same age.

246
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:52,708
But that's because I
came from the future.

247
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,625
It's me.
I'm Manabu.

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,541
Is it
really you?

249
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,666
It... it is
you. Manabu.

250
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,291
This is crazy! Meeting my
little brother all grown up,

251
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,208
it's like an
incredible dream.

252
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,791
You look great.
How's Mom doing? Is she okay?

253
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,416
Yeah, she's pretty good.

254
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,541
I can't believe she
let you join the SDF.

255
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,291
That must have
been really tough.

256
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,125
It was.

257
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,833
Don't I know?

258
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:34,458
Look. Mamoru. Come with us.
Just leave this place.

259
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,166
I would. But it's
just not possible.

260
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,375
Why not?

261
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,958
You can't interfere
with the past, Manabu.

262
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,416
It's against
the rules.

263
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,583
Who cares?

264
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,833
I care, Manabu. I
care about the future.

265
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,458
Besides, I have no
intention of dying.

266
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,833
Maybe your warning will
make a difference tomorrow.

267
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,666
I'm a Space Panzer
Grenadier, Manabu.

268
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,750
When the enemy's
at the front door,

269
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,666
I can't slip out
the back door and run.

270
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,125
Dad taught me an
important lesson

271
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,541
all those years
ago on Big One.

272
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,541
He taught me the meaning
of duty, little brother.

273
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,833
[Robot] I estimate
that Sirius Platoon

274
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,416
will be
arriving soon.

275
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,833
[Mamoru] Sirius Platoon.

276
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,541
That means that Captain
Bulge is coming!

277
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,291
Great! We should
be fine then!

278
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,916
You know this
Captain Bulge?

279
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,416
Yeah. You do, too.
He was Dad's first officer.

280
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,083
He gave us Dad's
gun remember?

281
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,791
Dad handpicked Bulge.
He trained him personally.

282
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,541
He's the best
captain in the force.

283
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,750
Awesome.

284
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,500
Hold on,
guys!

285
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,875
Manabu, I need
your help.

286
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,416
They're right behind us.
Here. Take it.

287
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,958
A gun against a
tank! Dream on!

288
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,250
Go! Now! I'll take
it from here!

289
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,041
Get back to the five-fifty
and wait for Big One!

290
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,083
What about you?

291
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,125
Manabu.

292
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,375
[Train whistle]

293
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,583
It's time, Manabu!
Get back to the five-fifty!

294
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:53,500
Louis!
Let's go!

295
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,041
Pull her up a
little closer.

296
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,333
Looks like we've got
ourselves a Panzer Grenadier!

297
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,500
This time
he's mine!

298
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,333
Split-finger
fastball!

299
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,250
The Five-fifty Express
is 70 meters dead ahead!

300
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,833
I am deactivating the
Optical Camouflage now!

301
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,041
Please! Get on
board immediately!

302
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,083
[Louis] Manabu!
What are you doing?

303
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,666
[Manabu]
Mamoru! Run!

304
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,041
Scum! Nobody makes me bleed!
Open fire! Get him!

305
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,708
Manabu! Get
on that train!

306
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,666
Space Panzer Grenadiers, this
is Mamoru. Launch an attack.

307
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,208
Big One is attempting a rescue
operation and needs support.

308
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,000
We copy, Mamoru!
Stand by!

309
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,833
Slow reverse.
Let's hook her up.

310
00:18:58,916 --> 00:18:59,958
Yes, Captain.

311
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,166
We have her, Captain Bulge. The
hitch is connected and locked.

312
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,458
Let's take the
Five-fifty up slow.

313
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,041
We don't want her
to break apart.

314
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,125
Right, Sir!

315
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,666
Let's move out!
Ahead slow!

316
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,500
[Train whistle]

317
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,708
Hey, Manabu!
This is for you!

318
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,708
Mamoru!
Hmm?

319
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,458
Keep working on that
fastball, Brother!

320
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,541
Mamoru, no!
Get on the train!

321
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,041
Not this time.

322
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,708
It's my destiny to stay
on this planet and fight.

323
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,083
I don't
plan to die,

324
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,375
but if I do the Yuuki's
will still live on.

325
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,333
Do you hear me? We
live in you, Manabu!

326
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,125
No! Mamoru!
Behind you! Look out!

327
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,916
Mamoru.
No.

328
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,750
Mamoru!

329
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,250
Stay back!

330
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:08,958
Let go of me! I can't let him
die alone! Let go! Mamoru!

331
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:23,333
Damn it. I couldn't change it.
Destiny... Why are you so cruel?

332
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:27,666
So indifferent?
So this is it.

333
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,500
I prayed that I wouldn't
have to die alone.

334
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,750
I still remember
Dad's face.

335
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,416
But I think I
understand now.

336
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,375
It's not about me.
It's about you.

337
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,166
You're the one,
Manabu. Huh?

338
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,833
Mom.
Manabu.

339
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,625
Who would
have thought?

340
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:02,666
It's okay. I'm not alone.
I have my family.

341
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:37,208
At times, fate can
seem cruel and arbitrary

342
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,250
but no life lived
for others is a waste.

343
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,833
No sacrifice is in vain.

344
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,833
Everydrop of water has
its place in the ocean.

345
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:50,500
Every life is a part of
Destiny's grand design.

346
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,458
Manabu, that woman's
name is Layla Destiny.

347
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,875
She's the supreme commander.

348
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,583
Wow! Awesome!

349
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,708
Cadets! Salute your
supreme commander!

350
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,625
Welcome to the
Space Defense Force.

351
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,666
You are no longer individuals,
but part of a team,

352
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,500
working together to ensure
safety of our galaxy

353
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,875
and the citizens within it.

354
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,958
May all that is good protect you

355
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,208
and guide you on your journey.

356
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,458
Dad. Mamoru. I'm here.

357
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,166
Thanks to both of you
I finally made it.

358
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,583
Huh? Is she looking at me?

359
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,666
She is. She is
looking right at me.

360
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,375
But why?

361
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,333
Manabu, you've come at last.

362
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,166
I've been waiting for you.

363
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,625
When I'm assigned to
my dad's old platoon,

364
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,416
it's a dream come true on
the next Galaxy Railways

365
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,458
but it's far from the heart-
warming experience I expected.

366
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,625
It seems like everyone
is out to get me.

367
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:34,916
If this is how they
treat their friends,

368
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,458
I'd hate to be their enemy.

369
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,750
See ya next time
on the Railways.
