1
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:47,000
Stations... the places that
we greet our loved ones

2
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,458
and the places that
we say goodbye...

3
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,916
The platforms are stained
with tears of elation

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,708
and tears of grief.
The sadness of a departure

5
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,750
soon turns into the
joy of an arrival.

6
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,250
But on occasion,
due to fate,

7
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,916
the promise of a happy
return is shattered

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,250
and an ordinary departure
turns out to be final.

9
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,166
Attention!

10
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,875
Please! Wait!

11
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,041
I brought you your
favorite drink, Bruce.

12
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:03,791
I hope it hits the
spot. Oh, Manabu!

13
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,291
Don't cry. We're here
to honor Bruce's memory

14
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,875
and he didn't like
tears, remember?

15
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,000
Bruce J. Speed of
the Sirius Platoon-

16
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:34,125
we commend your brave
service! We salute you, Bruce!

17
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,791
I don't understand. Why
did this have to happen?

18
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,500
There'll be hell
to pay for this.

19
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,291
Well, Bruce. Until we meet
again someday, my friend.

20
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:45,333
Goodbye.

21
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,166
That was reckless move.
You could have been killed.

22
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,833
If you have a death-wish,
join another platoon!

23
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,125
It's to protect the people.
I don't need a gun for that.

24
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,000
You can gamble your
own life on that ideal

25
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,000
but not the lives
of your platoon members.

26
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,625
Now take this side-arm
or quit the SDF.

27
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,500
All right, then.
I'll take it.

28
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,791
Good call.

29
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,500
I said I'll take it, but
I'm not going to use it.

30
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,625
I told you not to carry
this gun anymore.

31
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,291
But it was
just training!

32
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,041
Training's how we
prepare for real missions.

33
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,541
It's not to be
taken lightly.

34
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,666
That was a reckless move!
You could have been killed!

35
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,208
If you have a death-wish,
join another platoon!

36
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,916
We don't want
you here!

37
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:31,791
Come on! Do i-i-it now!
Bruce! Please! Do it!

38
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,583
This ends now!

39
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,750
Go back
to hell!

40
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,958
I don't think Toxic Bruce
fits you anymore, do you?

41
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,083
Guess not.

42
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,958
Thanks, Yuuki.
I owe you.

43
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:56,541
Why! Why did
Bruce have to die!

44
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,541
All he did was
help people!

45
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,166
He was a good man!
It's not fair!

46
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,875
He was all alone!
It's not fair!

47
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,416
It's all my fault. If
I didn't get injured

48
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,791
Bruce would have never
gone to the hospital.

49
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,416
Louis, don't
blame your self.

50
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,833
Please... That would
make Bruce sad.

51
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:21,291
You had nothing to do with it.
It's just the way things are.

52
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,416
Hey, David... Do you think
that Bruce would mind

53
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,833
if I kept his
harmonica?

54
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,125
Just ask him. You were
his partner, Manabu.

55
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,958
What d'ya say?
Is it okay, Partner?

56
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,166
All right,
then, Bruce.

57
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,458
Bruce...

58
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,708
I don't like
your attitude!

59
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,458
What does a renegade
punk like you

60
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,958
know about the
SDF?! Well?!

61
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,291
Bruce!
That's enough!

62
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,041
Yes,
Captain.

63
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,750
Sorry, Sir... I
took it too far.

64
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,541
You're being too hard
on him, you know...

65
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,291
I know... It's just
that Sirius Platoon

66
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,583
is like a family to me. We
have our way of doing things.

67
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,625
Manabu's like
the adopted son

68
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,625
who comes in and starts
trying to change everything.

69
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:27,750
I see... And what role
do I play in this family?

70
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:31,500
Come on. Isn't that obvious?
You're the Father, Captain.

71
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,750
What about
David?

72
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,416
He's special.
He's our dog.

73
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,666
That's cruel.

74
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,625
[Yuki] Captain,
it's Murase.

75
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,000
Schwanheld. You're
ordered to report to the

76
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,166
Galaxy Railways Constitution
Inquiry Commission.

77
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,375
I see.

78
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,291
What?! Captain, no way!
He can't be serious!

79
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,458
Yeah.
That's crazy.

80
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,125
General Ivanov...
He did this.

81
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,500
Please come
with me.

82
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,666
Of course.

83
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,750
You know this is a
load of crap, Captain!

84
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,458
Why are you going
along with this?!

85
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,541
That's
enough.

86
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,708
But it's
wrong!

87
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,750
It's
my duty.

88
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,083
Ivanov!

89
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,375
[Ivanov] Captain Bulge's
behavior on Big One

90
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,666
in the Sutherland Planetary
System is in violation

91
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,375
of Paragraph 5 in Provision
23 of our Constitution.

92
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,958
I recommend that he
be punished severely.

93
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,958
[Commissioner] Mr. Bulge,
do you have any objections?

94
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,416
[Bulge] No I don't.
However, I'd like to mention

95
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,166
that the Alfort Galactic
Empire and the Cosmo Matrix

96
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,041
were both omitted from
General Ivanov's report.

97
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,666
These issues are vital to
our Galaxy's security.

98
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,708
[Commissioner] General
Ivanov has assured us

99
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,458
that the Secret
Intelligence Division

100
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,708
will conduct an investigation
into both of those matters.

101
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,416
But if we don't take
immediate action,

102
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,208
I'm afraid it'll
be too late.

103
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,500
Enough! Your
opinions are irrelevant

104
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,625
to this inquiry,
Captain Bulge!

105
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,250
[Commissioner] I'll look into
the investigation

106
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,291
of the Alfort
Empire personally.

107
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,291
Let us proceed
with the inquiry.

108
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,666
[Commissioner]
Mr. Bulge,

109
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,291
you have violated the
Galaxy Railways Constitution

110
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,333
and committed an act of
violence against your superior.

111
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,916
You are hereby relieved
of your captaincy

112
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,875
until this commission
reaches a verdict.

113
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,500
Sirius Platoon is
temporarily disbanded.

114
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,958
Understood, Sir.

115
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,500
I advise you to stay clear
of our investigation, Bulge.

116
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,166
Captain...

117
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,833
The word is that the Secret
Intelligence Division

118
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,583
doesn't believe the
alternate Universe exists.

119
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,000
They've dropped
the ball.

120
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,625
They're just ignoring
the Cosmo-Matrix.

121
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,625
It figures.

122
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,791
So What are you
gonna do, Captain?

123
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,625
I'll do whatever's
required of me.

124
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,250
That sounds like
you, Bulge.

125
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,458
How can they
do that?!

126
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,958
They can't just relieve
you of command!

127
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,083
[Louis] You were just trying
to save Big One, Captain!

128
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,458
That's not fair!

129
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,375
[Manabu] This is absurd!
Isn't it?!

130
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,958
I disobeyed orders and
struck a superior officer.

131
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,916
Worse than that, I lost
the life of a crewmember.

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,083
All of this
is true.

133
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,458
Just because it's true doesn't
mean that it was wrong!!

134
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,083
We'd all be dead now if you
didn't disobey Ivanov!

135
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,500
Including him! Are you
just gonna accept this?!

136
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:24,166
I will not resign my post
voluntarily... I can't.

137
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,875
But I'll have to accept
whatever verdict

138
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,375
that the Commission
hands down.

139
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,333
You're wrong!

140
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,208
Manabu!

141
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,583
Don't let them do this!
Fight for what's right!

142
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,166
Hey! Get a hold
of yourself!

143
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,250
Please,
Captain!

144
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,750
Prepare for your
new assignment!

145
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,791
You're now with
Vega Platoon.

146
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,750
Louis you're with
Spica Platoon

147
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,291
and David's with Rigel.

148
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,666
Yuki stays
here for now.

149
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,000
No, Sir! Forget it! I
will not obey that order!

150
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,458
I don't know what
to tell you.

151
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,250
Either report to your new
platoons tomorrow or quit...

152
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,833
It's
your call.

153
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,750
Let's not
underestimate the Captain.

154
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,666
I'm sure he has
some kind of plan.

155
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,625
Okay I want every bolt just
as tight as that one...

156
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,875
[Ivanov]
Hey under there!

157
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,958
Which one of you is
the head mechanic?!

158
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,291
We've got company, men...
I'm the head mechanic.

159
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,458
Then you're the one I need
to talk to. Come up here...

160
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,125
What can I do
for you, Sir?

161
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,875
Well, there was
a small object

162
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,208
that was being analyzed
on board Big One.

163
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,291
Do you happen to
know where it is?

164
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,750
Would you say it about
the size of a ruler?

165
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,583
That's right.

166
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,666
I haven't
seen it.

167
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,833
Where
is it?!

168
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:45,416
Oh! Yeah! Hey!
Now I remember!

169
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,666
This is the Secret
Intelligence Division's.

170
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,875
Glad to be
of service.

171
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,041
To hell
with it.

172
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,833
We're approaching
Planet Hyde, Captain.

173
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,500
Good.
Reduce speed.

174
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,458
Yes, Sir.

175
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,375
Yuuki! You're a Vega
member! Get off your butt!

176
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,625
Stop your
daydreaming, Yuuki!

177
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,666
Bruce!

178
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,000
Hang in
there, Kid.

179
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,333
Ready!!

180
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,416
Right! Let's get
her hooked up.

181
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,416
Yes, Sir.

182
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,250
Bruce...
Don't go.

183
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,250
Wake up,
Yuuki!

184
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,375
Sorry, Sir.

185
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:25,875
Yuuki!!

186
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,958
What was that?! Are you trying
to get yourself killed?!

187
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,833
Look, Kid. I know that
you're shaken up over Bruce.

188
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,875
But that's
no excuse.

189
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,250
You've got to stay focused
on the task at hand...

190
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,375
Right.

191
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,208
We don't want
to lose you.

192
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,916
Sorry, Sir. I swear I'll do
better next time. I promise.

193
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,666
Do you know what's going to
happen to Captain Bulge?

194
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,333
I don't really know at
this point, Manabu...

195
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,875
I can't imagine how
he feels right now.

196
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,666
[Layla] I can't see the
fate of the Galaxy Railways.

197
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,958
[Shula] It's being obscured
from us for the moment.

198
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,041
We'll be able
to see it soon.

199
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,666
What does the Alfort
Galactic Empire want

200
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,333
from our
Universe, Shula?

201
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,416
[Shula] There's no
answer to that yet.

202
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,916
Excuse me!
Please forgive me

203
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,750
for overstepping my
authority, ma'am,

204
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,333
but I'd like to have a word
with you, if you have a moment!

205
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,291
[Ivanov] Hey! What do
you think you're doing?!

206
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,291
How dare you come here
without permission!

207
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,625
We've already briefed
the Supreme Commander!

208
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:55,541
You have no business
here, Bulge!

209
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,083
[Bulge] Forgive the
intrusion, Ma'am!

210
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,250
Hey! Watch where
you're going!

211
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,666
You just splashed water
on my pants, you idiot!

212
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
SDF.

213
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,083
Ha! Look what
I've got!

214
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,333
Your turn. What's
the hold up?

215
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,083
Oh, Bruce...

216
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,375
Watch where you're going
next time, you jerk.

217
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,250
There will be no
stopping them.

218
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,583
The fate of the entire
Universe is in the balance.

219
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,958
This
is it.

220
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,958
Stay loose. We'll take
it one step at a time.

221
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,500
One step. That seems
like an eternity ago.

222
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,958
Where did we go
wrong, Bruce?

223
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,041
Why are all these bad
things happening to us?

224
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,458
Why did you
have to die?

225
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:53,958
Louis?

226
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,333
Manabu.

227
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,541
[Soldier] General,
our advance troops

228
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,000
encountered
resistance.

229
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,833
We lost a Destroyer. But the
Dimension Invector worked!

230
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,958
The Hole was
stable! We did it!

231
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,083
Now there's nothing holding us
back any longer, my General.

232
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,625
This is the day we've
been waiting for.

233
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,958
[General]
Launch the Invectors!

234
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,625
Let the
invasion commence!

235
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,291
[Soldier] Yes,
my General!

236
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,458
Launching all
Dimension Invectors!

237
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,833
The energy is stabilizing.
There are no enemy ships

238
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,000
detected near our
point of entry.

239
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,125
[General] How long
will it take

240
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,625
for the Dimension
Holes to fully open?

241
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,208
[Soldier] They should
be stable and ready

242
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,333
for use in 20
Weaves, General.

243
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,333
[General] That's too long.

244
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,250
I want them ready
in 10 Weaves.

245
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,625
[Soldier] But that
could compromise

246
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,000
the integrity
of the holes!

247
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,458
Any more
objections?

248
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,125
That's the
Captain's coat.

249
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,166
Yeah.

250
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,500
He must have a plan.
Don't you think?

251
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,791
Let's
hope so.

252
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,250
You win
again.

253
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,458
Good morning.

254
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,083
I brought you and the
boys a little breakfast.

255
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,041
You're one of a
kind, Captain.

256
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,958
So how's
it coming?

257
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,166
Well, she was pretty banged
up when you brought her in,

258
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,333
but we're
gettin' there.

259
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,750
She'll be as good
as new soon.

260
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,625
Any progress
on the other?

261
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,125
That one's a bit more
complicated, Captain.

262
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,333
'think I'm going to
need some more time.

263
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,208
There's not
much time left.

264
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,333
Not much time left
until what, Sir?

265
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,583
Doomsday.

266
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,041
[Commissioner]
Mr. Schwanheld Bulge,

267
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,333
the Commission has
reached its decision.

268
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,416
You are hereby relieved
of your command

269
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,208
as Sirius Platoon Captain
and are disqualified

270
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:37,000
from being an SDF member
from this day forth.

271
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,250
[Kinuko] Bruce,
I don't know

272
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,083
what we're going
to do without you.

273
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,916
Hey! Wait!
What's going on?!

274
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,083
What's happening,
you guys?! Is it true?!

275
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,125
Was the Captain
really fired?!

276
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:49,750
Yeah.

277
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,875
That's
insane!

278
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,708
He called us here to
tell us about it.

279
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,250
I'm afraid you
just missed him.

280
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,666
What?

281
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,291
The Captain said to
do what we should do.

282
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,666
What's that mean...?

283
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,708
[Miki] This is an SDF
Battalion Emergency!

284
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,500
All Platoons get
ready for take-off!

285
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,750
[Sayaka] Confirming
the location

286
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,916
of the enemy destroyer

287
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
that disappeared from
the Kowloon area!

288
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,208
[Kate] Location confirmed!
It's in the southern quadrant

289
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,208
of the
Harloom sector!

290
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,916
Launch and deploy all
Platoons immediately!

291
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,916
What are you going
to do, Manabu?

292
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,291
I'm going for it! Louis...
Be careful, okay?

293
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,916
So you two
are... you know.

294
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,208
Yeah.

295
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,458
What?! What am I
missing here, you guys?!

296
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,291
David! You be
careful, too!

297
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:38,250
Bruce. I need you
with me on this one.

298
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,750
Magnetic Barrier
Generator is a go!

299
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,291
Main Circuit
on-line!

300
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,750
Atomic Boiler
Pressure is a go!

301
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,416
All energy levels
ready for take-off!

302
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,041
The Warp Drive Coupling
is now in place!

303
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,791
All systems green and ready
for take-off, Captain!

304
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,083
Put the hammer
down! Let's roll!

305
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,750
Perhaps the brave men and
women on this mission

306
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,083
will help us rediscover
what we have lost...

307
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:19,000
the vision of our own destiny.
I pray that it is so.

308
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,500
Too often people in
positions of power

309
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,125
cannot see the solution
to the problem at hand

310
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,166
because of their own
narrow-mindedness.

311
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,125
Their lack of
vision then causes

312
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,125
the death of
many people.

313
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,000
Next time, the
Alfort Galactic Empire

314
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,125
begins its all-out
assault on our Galaxy!

315
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,791
As the lifelines
of our Universe

316
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,458
are being destroyed by
their radical power,

317
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,333
hope begins to
slip away.

318
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,833
What do these alien
invaders want from us?

319
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,541
See ya next time
on the Railways!
