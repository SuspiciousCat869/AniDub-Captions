1
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,041
The Vandern Meteor Stream
wanders through space

2
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,333
and completes its cycle
around the Galaxy

3
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,458
every several
thousand years.

4
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:51,958
This deadly
Meteor Stream

5
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,541
is also known as
the Wandering Demon

6
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:57,000
because it devours
everything in its path

7
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,708
and leaves untold amounts
of destruction in its wake.

8
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,958
Millions of lives have
already been claimed

9
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:07,666
by this roaming beast and the
death toll continues to rise.

10
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,833
We have the Vandern Meteor
Stream on radar, Captain.

11
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:28,000
We have a fix on its ETA.
780 seconds until impact.

12
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:32,000
Spectrum Optical Analysis has
confirmed 75% of its make-up.

13
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,833
I Forwarding
the data now.

14
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,958
Be careful and don't
forget to account for

15
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,000
the gravitational
field shift.

16
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,666
[Vega Crew] Come on!
Haven't you Spica chicks

17
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,000
taken care of that
Meteor Stream yet?

18
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,916
We're ready to rock! Why
don't you kittens step aside

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,708
and let us lions
take over!

20
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,125
Man! What
jerks!

21
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,958
They wouldn't say
that to our faces!

22
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,666
Ladies! Get a
hold of yourselves!

23
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,041
Our mission is to protect
the space station

24
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,666
from the meteor stream and
we need absolute focus!

25
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,666
Yes Ma'am,
Captain Julia!

26
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,166
[Murase] Loosen
up, Julia!

27
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,833
We haven't worked together in
forever! Let's enjoy this!

28
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,833
Why don't we go some place
cozy and have a drink together

29
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:11,000
when this is over...? What
d'ya say, Captain...?

30
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,041
Sound good?

31
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,916
Not even
close!

32
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,458
Hey, I think she
likes you, Captain!

33
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,083
Yeah, right.

34
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,500
[Julia] The Vandern Meteor
Stream is approaching!

35
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,458
Stand by for instructions,
Vega Platoon.

36
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,000
We're analyzing their
number and trajectory now.

37
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,500
The stream will reach the
station in three minutes,

38
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,458
Captain... The
number of meteors

39
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,500
that we need to destroy
is approximately ten...

40
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,458
Iron Berger is
preparing to attack!

41
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,250
[Murase] Prepare
to intercept!

42
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,875
Lower the shield as soon
as the Main Battery

43
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,791
and the Missile Arrays
are ready to fire!

44
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,750
[Julia] Vega Platoon, the data
analysis isn't finished yet!

45
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,666
Wait until we calculate
the exact point

46
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,333
and method
of attack!

47
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,500
I'll be old and grey by then!
We're doing this my way!

48
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,416
Murase!

49
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,416
Attack!!

50
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,208
Keep firing! Let
it loose, men!

51
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,708
All right!
Hold your fire!

52
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:42,583
Yes, Captain!

53
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,833
The first wave of the meteor
stream has been evaded.

54
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,333
Destruction of the Space
Station has been prevented.

55
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,916
[Murase] Spica Platoon,
hurry! Where's that data?

56
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:18,250
Yeah, baby! We did it! Right
on! Do we rock or what?!

57
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,416
Why did you
do that?!

58
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,541
Do what? Save the space
station from destruction?

59
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,125
Because I could.
That's why.

60
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:33,875
Pity... You haven't changed
a bit. Have you, Murase?

61
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,416
You screwed
up, Captain!

62
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,208
Hahaha! What the heck
is her deal anyway?

63
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,916
It must be that
time of the month.

64
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,750
The main body of the
Vandern Meteor Stream

65
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:58,000
is on a confirmed intersect
course with Central Station!

66
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,958
Projected time of
impact: six hours!

67
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,083
[Buldge] Sirius Platoon,
we've been ordered to replace

68
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,333
Vega Platoon
on the mission

69
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,958
to protect Central
Station! Let's move out!

70
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,333
[Manabu] Subatomic
Warp Generator ready!

71
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,500
[Louis] Orbit Network
Radar is a go!

72
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,125
[Bruce] Big 1 is now
in take-off position!

73
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,500
This is a very
dangerous situation!

74
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,333
Let's look
sharp, platoon!

75
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,541
[David] Atomic Boiler Pressure
is a go! Main Circuit online!

76
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:30,625
All energy levels
ready for take-off!

77
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,125
[Louis] The warp-drive
coupling is now in place!

78
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,791
[Bruce] All systems
green, Captain Bulge!

79
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,291
Awaiting your
command, Sir!

80
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,041
Let's move out!
Ahead full!

81
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,500
I saw this coming
a mile away.

82
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,250
I knew those two
wouldn't get along.

83
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,166
But Captain Murase
and Captain Julia

84
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,083
were in the same
platoon together.

85
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,791
They've known each
other for a long time.

86
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,500
It's not like
they just met.

87
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,666
[Manabu] What? I didn't
know they used to date.

88
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,666
Date? Who said
anything about dating?

89
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,041
That's enough
personal talk.

90
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,166
Sorry,
Captain.

91
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,500
[Julia] The second wave of
the Vandern Meteor Stream

92
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,458
will reach us here
in three hours.

93
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,250
According to
our reports,

94
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,208
this second wave is much
more massive than the first.

95
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,166
We're anticipating that
we'll need to destroy

96
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,791
a wide variety of meteors in
order to save Central Station.

97
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,708
We'll know more when the
stream comes in range

98
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,250
of our Orbit
Network Radar

99
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,125
but I expect that we'll need
to deploy our full compliment

100
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,375
of fighters
to assist

101
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,083
our standard armaments
in the attack.

102
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,666
Let me make one
thing clear:

103
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,708
you'll be following my
orders on this mission.

104
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,791
That means all Sirius
Platoon members

105
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,625
will follow my directions,
not Captain Bulge's.

106
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,250
There will be no exceptions
to this whatsoever.

107
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,875
The name of this mission is
Operation Vandern Sweep,

108
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,791
I want all of you to
finish checking your posts

109
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,000
before this operation
kicks off. That's all.

110
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,916
Excuse me,
Captain.

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,833
What is it?

112
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,583
Well, you said
no exceptions.

113
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,458
But what if it's an
emergency, Ma'am?

114
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,541
Can't we make
our own judgment?

115
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,791
Did I say to follow my orders
or to make your own judgments?

116
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,041
But, Ma'am...

117
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,083
No buts! You'll follow
my orders or go home!

118
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,791
We're doing this
mission my way!

119
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,875
Man, it's no wonder she had
problems with Vega Platoon.

120
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,625
You should try to
take it easy, Captain.

121
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,833
Look who's
talking.

122
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:50,125
You know that I can't
change, Schwanheld.

123
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,458
You mean because
of that day?

124
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,500
That's right.

125
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,291
Captain! The One Sixty
Two's being sucked in

126
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,791
by the
gravitational pull!

127
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,958
It'll burn up if
it gets any closer!

128
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,416
Not even the Southern
Cross can take that heat.

129
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,291
Or maybe
it can!

130
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,500
Julia! Can we get closer if we
divert all power to shields?!

131
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll run a simulation!
Give me thirty seconds!

132
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,291
[Murase] We don't have
thirty seconds! I'm going!

133
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,500
What the hell!!

134
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:26,708
[Murase] This is Eagle
One! ...Taking off!

135
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,333
Murase! I'm analyzing the
data! Just wait a second!

136
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,916
Forget it! I told you! There's
no time to wait! I'm going in!

137
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,000
Come on, baby!
Hold on!

138
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,708
We're losing her!

139
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,375
[Captain] Murase! Get out of
there now! It's too late!

140
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,625
Mayday! Southern Cross this is
Eagle One! I'm out of control!

141
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,583
I've never forgiven
myself for that day.

142
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,791
We might have been able
to save the One-Sixty-Two

143
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:20,708
if I had just acted
a little faster.

144
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,250
And Murase's face wouldn't
look like a jigsaw puzzle...

145
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,000
I promised myself
that I wouldn't let

146
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,666
anything like that
happen ever again.

147
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,625
I appreciate the advice
though, Captain...

148
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,208
Maybe you can give
Murase some too.

149
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:41,458
Tell him to stop acting
like a juvenile hotshot.

150
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,791
I'll mention
that.

151
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,458
Hey, Bartender!
Are you blind?!

152
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,583
We're on E
over here!

153
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,375
Just a moment,
Mr. Jose!

154
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,541
Just a- get your
butt over here!

155
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,708
So they can't work with
Vega Platoon, huh?!

156
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:55,750
Well, screw 'em!

157
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,166
If we didn't
take action,

158
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,250
the situation would
have been worse.

159
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,291
...Isn't that
right, Captain?

160
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,208
We have to be ready to
lay it all on the line...

161
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,833
to take the chances and
be ready for anything.

162
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:13,750
Yeah! Well said, Captain. And
not just on the Iron Berger.

163
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,333
We have to be ready to
perform at all times.

164
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,000
If you know
what I mean!

165
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,375
[Julia] All right,
everyone, this is it!

166
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,291
Prepare to launch
Operation Vandern Sweep!

167
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,625
The meteor stream is
approaching, Captain!

168
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,000
Falcons One and Two
from Spica Platoon!

169
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,416
Deploy to
the left!

170
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,916
Eagles One and Two from Sirius
Platoon take the right!

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,666
[All] Yes,
Captain!

172
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,458
[Julia] Turn the Main Battery
90 degrees East on the X axis;

173
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,500
2 degrees North
on the Y axis!

174
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,958
[Buldge] Prepare all Canons!
Clear the Orbit Shield!

175
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,541
All space
fighters! Attack!!

176
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,250
It's
working...

177
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,666
[Bruce] Manabu! Heads
up! Twelve o'clock!

178
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,041
Right!

179
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,958
That's it. A
little closer.

180
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,041
Whoa!! That's a big
one!! Head's up!!

181
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:09,583
Fire!!

182
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,958
Got it!!

183
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,041
So far the operation is going
according to plan, Captain!

184
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,875
This just might just go
off without a hitch!

185
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,416
Let's
hope so.

186
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,833
Hey, Captain? Are you all
right? Is everything cool?

187
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:39,041
Uhh! Oh, yeah! Everything's
just fine! I was just thinking!

188
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,708
Hm! That's what we
came here to avoid.

189
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,666
Well, it didn't work. I
guess I have no choice

190
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,291
but to go and kill
the bartender.

191
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,250
What's going on?!

192
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,416
Our data
was wrong!

193
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,208
There are more meteors
than we projected!

194
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,416
The gravitational
field shift

195
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,000
must have distorted
our readings!

196
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,833
That's not good! How many
more are we talking about?!

197
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,666
Shouldn't things be getting
better instead of worse?!

198
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,291
It's starting to get a little
too hot to handle here!

199
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,791
Same thing on our
side! This is intense!

200
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,125
AI! The
data's wrong!

201
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,875
I know! Sorry, but the
Gravitational Field Shift

202
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,291
is messing
up our radar!

203
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,791
Severe structural
damage to Coach 4!

204
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,125
If this keeps up,
we'll lose Big One!

205
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,291
Captain!

206
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,583
This is bad!

207
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,458
[Julia] Manabu, what
are you doing?!

208
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,708
How dare you leave your
post during my operation!

209
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,500
Get back where you
belong right now!

210
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,666
We're working
on the data.

211
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,916
Fall back and standby for
further instructions!

212
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,958
No! Negative!

213
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,375
With all due respect I can't
just sit back and watch!

214
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,166
There's no time to
wait! I'm going in!

215
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,666
[Murase] Forget
it! I told you!

216
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,833
There's no time to
wait! I'm going in!

217
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,666
Captain! There's a
comet on the way!

218
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,708
What?!!!

219
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,541
Great skies!

220
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,083
It's unbelievable!

221
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,291
A meteor is approaching from
the port side! We can't evade!

222
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,583
What?!

223
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,875
Hey! You shouldn't let
your guard down like that!

224
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:55,750
Murase!!

225
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,541
You didn't think we were
going to let you guys

226
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,375
have all the
fun, now did you?

227
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,458
Captain Murase!!

228
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,416
I don't know what all
the fuss is about.

229
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,375
It's just a big rock!
Let's smoke it!

230
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,625
Arm Main
Battery!

231
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,750
Right! Let's
rock and roll!

232
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,041
Yeah, baby!
...Hmm?

233
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:19,375
[Julia] Wait!
Hold your fire!

234
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,375
Huh?

235
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,333
[Murase] Uh, I don't want
to rush you, Captain.

236
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,541
But would you mind
telling us why?

237
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,083
Listen up.

238
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,833
The comet is primarily composed
of crystallized Cosmotium;

239
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,083
one of the hardest
substances known.

240
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,416
[Murase] What's
that mean?

241
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,875
It means if you shoot it,
you won't destroy it.

242
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,333
You'll only redirect it, which
could cause far more damage.

243
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,416
I need two
minutes!

244
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
[Murase] What?!

245
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,250
No matter how hard
the substance is,

246
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,875
there must be a place where
its molecular bond is weak.

247
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,375
If we can pinpoint
it and shoot it,

248
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,458
we can probably
destroy it.

249
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,000
What?!
Probably??!

250
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:54,000
You're crazy! We can't wait
for your unreliable analysis!

251
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,250
Listen to me! You
can't afford not to!

252
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,791
Two minutes!
That's all!

253
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,708
But,
Captain!

254
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,416
Thank you,
Captain.

255
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,458
Big One!

256
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,958
[Buldge]
We're ready!

257
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,666
Pull up so we can connect
Big One to the Iron Berger.

258
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,750
Transfer all available energy
to their Main Battery.

259
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,250
Yes, Sir!

260
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,791
AI! Analyze the structure of
the comet using all sensors!

261
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,583
Make sure you don't
miss anything!

262
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,500
Yes,
Ma'am!

263
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,875
Maggie! Forget
about defense!

264
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,250
We need you and Shelley
to help collect data!

265
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,083
Yes,
Captain!

266
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,375
[Manabu] No worries!
We'll pick up the slack!

267
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,125
[Bruce] Go to it!
We've got you covered!

268
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,541
Thank you, guys!

269
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,375
[Buldge] That's far
enough. Full stop.

270
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,708
[David] Yes,
Captain.

271
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,041
Connect and begin
transferring energy!

272
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,416
Energy Level is
at 80% of maximum!

273
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,041
Connect the Sub-atomic
Cannon and standby!

274
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,333
Target and scope are
fully operational!

275
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,750
Energy level is at the
absolute maximum, sir!

276
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:15,708
The comet is at 400
mega-meters and closing!

277
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,541
380 mega-meters!

278
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,708
Come on!
Where is it?

279
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,333
Where is your
weak point?

280
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,708
The transfer of
energy is complete!

281
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,708
Energy level is exceeding
the maximum, Sir!

282
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,875
This is crazy!
Let's go for it!

283
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,708
Stand by! I
gave her my word.

284
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,875
Eagles One and
Two! Emergency!

285
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:45,041
We've got two meteors
about to hit Iron Berger!

286
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,291
Whoo!
Got 'em!

287
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,541
I have visual contact
with the comet.

288
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,041
[Manabu] Man!
It's huge!

289
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,916
[Buldge] Return to
Big One immediately!

290
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yes, Captain!

291
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,375
The comet is at One-hundred
and eighty mega-meters

292
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,458
and
closing!!

293
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,208
The comet has breached
the Final Defense Line!

294
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,333
The situation is critical!
We're out of time, Captain!!

295
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,708
Yes! That's it! I've found
it, Murase! I've got it!

296
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,083
Relay the
coordinates!

297
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:25,125
Right! Target East 35
degrees! North 14 degrees!

298
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,625
Tolerance range plus
or minus .42 percent!

299
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,083
I got it!

300
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,625
Targeting East 35
degrees; North fourteen!

301
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,916
Setting tolerance to plus
or minus .42 percent!

302
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:53,041
Fire!!

303
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,958
Captain! Are you all
right in there?! Captain!!

304
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,416
Did we
get it?

305
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,791
Captain Bulge! This is
Manabu! Is everyone okay?!

306
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,291
Affirmative. We're all fine.
How's it look out there?

307
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,916
Like it's
snowing!

308
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,208
It's gone, Captain!
We did it!

309
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,666
Not bad for
a slow poke.

310
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,166
Hey,
Captain.

311
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,500
Why did you come
and help us, Murase?

312
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,250
Let's see... Oh, yeah.
My scar started itching.

313
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,125
It wouldn't
let me be.

314
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,000
You're
never serious.

315
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,000
Julia...

316
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,541
I came because I didn't
want to see you cry again.

317
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,375
That's why.

318
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,583
Hey. Stop that. I won't be
able to take it if you cry.

319
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,666
You know, I'm awful
thirsty, Captain.

320
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,041
What d'ya say we
go have a drink.

321
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,375
All right, but
you'd better behave.

322
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,916
Don't I
always?

323
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,250
Look. Do you
think they're...

324
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,375
That's none of
your business!

325
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:26,041
Sometimes strong-willed
people love from afar.

326
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,041
They meet and then
part ways again

327
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,458
like two trains
passing in the night.

328
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:34,208
But the bonds tying them
together never disappear.

329
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,083
They travel in luxury and
wear beautiful clothes,

330
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,083
but what's lurking
on the inside?

331
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,541
When a Casino
train is attacked

332
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,000
the passengers have to face
the perils of Planet Guin.

333
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,500
When hard times come it's
easy to tell the beasts

334
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,833
from those who
are truly human.

335
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:35,208
See ya next time
on the Railways!
