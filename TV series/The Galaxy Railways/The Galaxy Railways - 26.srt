1
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:10,041
The infinite Universe...

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:14,583
Each of it's enchanting galaxys
teeming with individual lives.

3
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,583
Each life like a bubble
in a vast ocean.

4
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,750
Here one moment
and gone the next.

5
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,666
But even though
they are impermanent,

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,875
each life is so vital,

7
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,791
each one a thread
in the grand design.

8
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,625
How we live is everything.

9
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,541
It is our contribution,

10
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,541
our brush stroke on
the painting of reality.

11
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,333
Some hold back nothing.

12
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,666
They give back to existence
what it has given them:

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,250
life itself.

14
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:18,000
Silver... Schnader,
Jose... Captain Murase!

15
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,416
So many wasted lives.
I don't get it.

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,666
Manabu.

17
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,916
Sometimes there is no
reason. It's just life.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,750
We did the best that
we possibly could.

19
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:47,583
Multiple spatial distortions
detected at 1,000 mega-meters!

20
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,916
Dimension Holes,
Commander!

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,250
What?!

22
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:15,666
Good God. What
do they want?

23
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,875
Good God. What
do they want?

24
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,125
[Narrator] As for those who
give their very life

25
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,416
to protect the
lives of others...

26
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,833
their examples live on
and give us great strength.

27
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,708
Oh, no!

28
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,458
More enemy ships detected!
About 200 of them, Sir!

29
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,125
[Commander] What?!

30
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,291
They're breaking in!

31
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,666
[Commander] What do
you mean?!

32
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,708
They're hacking into our
Communications System, Sir!

33
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,250
I am Forecis.

34
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,500
Surrender Planet Destiny and the
Galaxy Railways Headquarters

35
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:08,291
to us immediately or you
will all be destroyed.

36
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,458
Your defenses
are no match

37
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,041
for the arsenal of
the Alfort Armada.

38
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,166
Surrender and you
will survive.

39
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,083
Resist and
you will die...

40
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:20,250
I will not ask again.
This is your final warning.

41
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,791
Captain?!

42
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:27,416
Listen up... I want to thank
you for the job you've done...

43
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,916
You have no idea how
proud I am of you...

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,625
All of you.

45
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:40,250
David... Yuki...
Bruce... Louis...

46
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,666
And you, Manabu.

47
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,875
No! Stop!
It's not over!

48
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,625
I won't leave Big One,
Captain! There's no way!

49
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:53,416
Me either. How can I?
It wouldn't be right.

50
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,666
Not after what Murase
did. He died for us.

51
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,166
Captain.

52
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,625
Very well.

53
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,958
Here, Sir.

54
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:08,291
Thank you...
Attention all hands.

55
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,291
We have been ordered to
surrender by the Alfort Fleet.

56
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,916
But Big One refuses to
fall prey to their demands.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,416
The SDF will not hand
the Galaxy Railways over

58
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,916
to invaders. Our duty is
to protect it at all costs

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,166
and that's what
we intend to do.

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,291
Somehow we'll make it
through all of this. Bulge out!

61
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,625
[Yuki] The Magnetic Barrier
Generator is ready!

62
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:33,916
[David] Boiler Pressure
is back to normal!

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
General Forecis!
With all due respect

64
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,666
I beg you to reconsider
your decision.

65
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,583
It's clear that they've
figured out how to use

66
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,083
the Cosmo Matrix! If
we don't withdraw now,

67
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,333
we could suffer immense
losses, Madam. Even defeat!

68
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,625
You disappoint
me, Trille.

69
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,458
Forgive me, General!

70
00:04:56,541 --> 00:05:00,291
How dare you talk of
defeat in my presence!

71
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,916
Your sister gave them the
Cosmo Matrix and you beg me

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,291
to retreat like a coward.
Both of you are a disgrace.

73
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,708
Take her to the lab
for brain-wave therapy

74
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,208
and mental rehab!

75
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,208
Yes, Ma'am!

76
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:23,500
Let us advance
to Destiny.

77
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,916
The Grand Command Ship
is accelerating, Sir!

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,333
They're at 800
mega-meters!

79
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,791
Captain... I think
we should retreat!

80
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,791
What?!

81
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,041
Their fleet's
too big.

82
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,250
We can't beat them even
with the Cosmo-Matrix.

83
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,125
But if we retreat, it'll
give us time to study them

84
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,583
and find their
weak point.

85
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,750
A decisive attack could
cause enough damage

86
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,666
to bring them back to
the bargaining table.

87
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,625
I'm in.

88
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,708
Me too, Sir.

89
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:52,166
Hmm... Very well then...
We'll follow Manabu's plan.

90
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,750
Yuki! Analyze
that ship!

91
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:55,583
Right!

92
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,625
David!

93
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,916
Yes, Captain!
Turning hard about!

94
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,458
This is their nerve
center...

95
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,750
Big One!

96
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:21,208
Captain! David!
Yuki! Manabu!

97
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,375
Big One has turned away
from the Alfort Fleet.

98
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,500
You're not going
to like this.

99
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,000
What do you mean,
Mr. Akatsuki?

100
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,166
I'm relieved to hear
that we've got more time.

101
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,833
We got a problem. The stopgap
bypass device was damaged

102
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,291
during that
full-scale attack.

103
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,916
How much more time
are we talking about?

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,958
I'm not sure. I...

105
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,125
--Are you all right?!
--Mr. Akatsuki?!

106
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,916
Sir, It's
too big...

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,916
We're going to need help
with the structural analysis

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,333
of the
command ship.

109
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,291
Are you okay?!

110
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,750
Yeah. I'm fine.
Besides.

111
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,833
How can I complain
knowing what he did?

112
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,375
You're right! Whitman
never gave up!

113
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:12,750
That train has caused enough
trouble. Destroy it! Now!

114
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,541
Big One needs
assistance!

115
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,208
We must put everything we've
got into analyzing that ship!

116
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,833
We've got to find
their weak point!

117
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,125
Julia.

118
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,291
Captain Julia!

119
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,166
Structural analysis
is right up our alley!

120
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,041
You need to connect that
blue cable there, Manabu!

121
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,125
And Don't forget to
synchronize the two signals!

122
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:50,875
Right.

123
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,791
We've got to protect the
Main Battery at all costs!

124
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:55,541
Right!

125
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,083
I've located the
main power source

126
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,333
and five back-up systems
on the Command Ship!

127
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,458
It's got 3 main engines
and 2 auxiliary engines!

128
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,916
I'm projecting the parameters
of their living quarters

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,333
so we don't target them!

130
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,041
The red dots you see are
their Energy Control Systems!

131
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,833
If we can attack
these with precision,

132
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:16,333
we can paralyze them without
destroying the ship itself!

133
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,208
Identify the target points
and sequence of our attack!

134
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,458
Yes, Ma'am!

135
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,833
Transfer the attack plan
to Big One immediately!

136
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,375
And let's pinpoint the location
of their Command Center!

137
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,166
Uh, oh. Looks like
we've been discovered!

138
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,833
They've blocked us
from their system!

139
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,250
If you ever need a
job, give me a call.

140
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,666
So, will it work?

141
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,250
Hey, we did the best we could.
It'll hold for a while.

142
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,541
What's a while?

143
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,958
One attack.

144
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,125
[Bulge] Turn us about!

145
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,166
[David] Yes, Sir!

146
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,333
The SDF train is
heading straight for us!

147
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,500
What an annoying
little gnat.

148
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,666
[David] What should we aim
at with just one round?

149
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,708
[Bulge] One of their
Energy Control Systems.

150
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,458
One system. That's not
going to do it. Is it?

151
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,666
The Grand Command
Ship just sent us

152
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,916
the location of
their power reactor

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,083
along with ballistic
trajectory calculations!

154
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,875
There's incoming audio!

155
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,666
[Louis] Big One, please
respond and verify

156
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,291
--that you've received the data.
[Bulge] --It must be a trap.

157
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,041
Come in Big One. This
is Louis Fort Drake.

158
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,500
--Please respond.
[David] --Louis!!

159
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,875
[Yuki] Receiving visuals!

160
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,375
Louis!

161
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:26,250
Good to see you, Captain.
Please stand by for more data.

162
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,166
This is the location of the
Control Center

163
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,125
on the Grand Command Ship
where General Forecis directs

164
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,083
the Alfort Fleet. I'm hoping
that you can come on board

165
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,375
for a direct negotiation if
you can disable their ship.

166
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:42,125
Louis... Excellent
work. Be careful.

167
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,375
We don't want
to lose you.

168
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,041
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine. I promise.

169
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,750
Hang in there, we'll
make it through this.

170
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,291
Target those
coordinates!

171
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,250
Yes, Sir!

172
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,250
Captain, Where's Manabu?

173
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,875
Can you look at Mr.
Akatsuki's injury, Yuki?

174
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:57,541
Sure.

175
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,416
Manabu.

176
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:00,916
Manabu.

177
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,791
Louis!

178
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,291
It's good to see you.

179
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,250
I... I thought
you were dead!

180
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:14,125
No, I'm fine... They picked
me up from the wreckage.

181
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,958
I missed you so much.

182
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,333
Look out! Behind you!!

183
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,583
No!

184
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,666
Louis!

185
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:33,166
Louis!!

186
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,458
[Yuki] A massive detachment
of enemy fighters is

187
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,875
approaching, Captain!

188
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,958
All right. We'll
counter with our fighters

189
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:56,166
to protect Big One! This is it,
Sirius Platoon! Let's do it!!

190
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,166
--Yes Sir!
--Yes Sir!

191
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,708
Manabu.

192
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,916
Louis?! Why?!

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,375
Trille! You're hurt!

194
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,750
Are you okay?

195
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,041
Why did you stay?

196
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,166
I had to, to
stop the war.

197
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,666
That's not
possible.

198
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,958
Why?!

199
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:31,625
It's too late... We
can't turn back. Not now.

200
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,125
Why?! I don't
understand!

201
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,375
Why do so many innocent
people have to die, Trille?!

202
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,000
Even your own sister
was killed! My God!

203
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,416
Isn't that enough?!

204
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,875
I know your heart aches
for Liffle. It has to.

205
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,500
She was your
flesh and blood!

206
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,250
If we don't try to stop this
war, she died for nothing!

207
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:55,166
[Trille] Come. Help me.
I'll show you the way.

208
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,291
Well. Time to
place your bets!

209
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,625
[Bulge] All Space
Eagles: launch!

210
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,083
Come. Race
to your death.

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,958
Commander. We're making
our final approach.

212
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,166
I want to thank you all
for the help you've given us

213
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,125
on this mission.

214
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,500
Bulge out.

215
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,291
Go, Big One!

216
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,458
[Bulge] Initiate the
Cosmo-Matrix!

217
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,291
[David] Here we go!

218
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:32,291
[Bulge] Cylinder rotation
exceeding the maximum limit!

219
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,125
[Manabu] Whoa!

220
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,125
[David] Look out!!

221
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,625
[Manabu] Got him!

222
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,750
[Bulge] Compressor Injector
is at twenty-eight hundred!

223
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,583
Pressure is red-lining! The
Valves are about to blow!

224
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:46,625
Rotate the Main Battery!
Lock on target! Fire!!

225
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,083
[Alfort Forces
Screaming]

226
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,958
You worthless worms!

227
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,291
[David] Big One's
completely unarmed!

228
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,250
We've got to protect
it no matter what!!

229
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:19,875
[Pilots] Right!!

230
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,291
[Manabu] Three enemy fighters
coming in at 9 o'clock!

231
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,375
[David] I see 'em! You're
messin' with the wrong train!

232
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,333
[Pilot] They're on my
tail! Augh!

233
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,041
Whoa-

234
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,458
[David] Manabu! Heads up!

235
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,666
[Manabu] David! You're hit!

236
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,000
[David] I'm okay! She
can still fly!

237
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,000
[Bulge] David! Manabu!
Disengage! Get out of here!

238
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,333
[Manabu] Captain! No! We're
staying with Big One!

239
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,583
That's an order!
Pull off!

240
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,916
Ready... Break!!

241
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,208
Yuki. Is everyone
all right?

242
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,708
We're all in one piece,
Sir. How 'bout about you?

243
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:22,583
I'm good.

244
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,333
Dammit! I screwed up.

245
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,333
Come on!

246
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,541
No. I'm staying
here... You go on!

247
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,541
David.

248
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,500
You've got to find
Louis, Manabu!

249
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,041
I'll be just fine

250
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,000
I can take care of
myself! Just Go find her!

251
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,125
Don't you die!

252
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,250
I won't... Go!

253
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,791
Manabu.

254
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,625
[Forecis] I will not tolerate
insurgents on my ship!

255
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,333
I want that train and
everyone in it destroyed!

256
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,083
Prepare to fire!

257
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,833
This is going
to be tricky...

258
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,458
What are you
doing here?

259
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,041
Looking for you!

260
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,958
Thank God
you're here.

261
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,791
You must
be Manabu.

262
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,875
That's right.

263
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,541
This is Trille.
She's Liffle's sister.

264
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,500
She's been helping
me this whole time.

265
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,625
Thank you.

266
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,791
I can't
believe my eyes.

267
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,125
You both seem so kind.
You're not barbaric.

268
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,375
We've heard so
many awful stories.

269
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,708
They're not true.

270
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,583
We're just like you,
Trille. We have hearts, too.

271
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:49,083
I believe you...

272
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,708
So did Liffle.

273
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,625
It's endless!

274
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,791
Why is this
happening?!

275
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,291
They hit our power
reactor when they attacked!

276
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,250
It's got to end,
Forecis! Right now!

277
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,333
You have no power
in this place.

278
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,291
You were doomed
when you walked in.

279
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,958
Why are you
attacking us?!

280
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,625
Don't come
any closer!

281
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,333
Just tell me why?!

282
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,458
First you must
learn respect!

283
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,500
[Louis] Manabu!!

284
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,583
General, please! They mean no
harm! They're trying to help!

285
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:37,291
Enough!

286
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,000
Trille!

287
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,666
The Galaxy Railways that you've
spread throughout your Universe

288
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,208
and the Orbit Pipes that
have been laid out endlessly

289
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,458
like a nervous
system have started

290
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,916
causing disturbances
in our Universe.

291
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,666
This imbalance
must be corrected.

292
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,875
The Railways must
be destroyed.

293
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,916
No! There has to
be another... Augh!

294
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,375
Manabu!!

295
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:06,666
There is no other way! The
Galaxy Railways is a disease

296
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,958
that is corrupting the
equilibrium of our Universe!

297
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,333
It has to be
annihilated!

298
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,083
Manabu.

299
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,875
Manabu... Manabu!

300
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,958
Bruce?

301
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,625
You're going to be
okay. I promise.

302
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,708
Am I dead?

303
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,750
Am I? Know this...

304
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:43,166
What you really are,
Manabu... can never die.

305
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,583
Manabu!!

306
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:52,458
Oh, God... Manabu, can you
hear me? Please don't die.

307
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,291
I'm okay...

308
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,250
Careful!

309
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,583
The Galaxy Railways is
not a disease, General...

310
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,333
You're wrong...

311
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:14,000
My father... my brother...
many of my friends...

312
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:18,250
they've all died... they
gave their lives for it!

313
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,083
The Railways are the ties
that link all life together

314
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,166
in our Universe. They
connect our hearts and minds

315
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,916
and unite us as one.

316
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,250
If the orbit pipes are causing
disturbances in your Universe

317
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,666
then there has to be some
scientific solution...

318
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,833
This war has to
end right now!

319
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,416
Manabu! No!

320
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,000
Our Master sees
what we can not.

321
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,958
He made it clear that
this war is unavoidable.

322
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,750
It is part of our
destiny- it is our Fate!

323
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,458
No!!

324
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,166
Not this time.

325
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,291
It's my destiny to stay
on this planet and fight.

326
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,916
We're in charge
of our destiny.

327
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,958
We shape it with our
actions! Can't you see?!

328
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:01,958
Enough!!

329
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,291
Don't hurt him!!

330
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,041
Manabu!

331
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:17,041
Trille. How could
you? I am your master.

332
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,875
Not any more.

333
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,500
Trille.

334
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,000
It had to be done...
Take this. Go.

335
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:43,666
Your people are waiting for
you... There's not much time.

336
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,041
Thank you, Trille.

337
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,625
[Louis' Voice] Come with
us to Destiny!

338
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:55,166
[Trille's Voice] No. I must go
back to my own Universe.

339
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,250
I have to tell
them what happened.

340
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,250
They must know the
truth about your people.

341
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,000
Will we see
you again?

342
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,458
I hope so.

343
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:17,625
Manabu! Hold on!
I've got you!

344
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,875
Louis! Let go!
You have to!

345
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,291
No! I won't!

346
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,750
If you don't let
go we'll both die.

347
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,875
I don't want that.
I want you to live!

348
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,041
I can't! I won't
let you go!

349
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,250
Louis!!

350
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:35,375
I can't live without
you! I'd rather die!!

351
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,750
I love you.

352
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,416
Manabu.

353
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,041
I think we've got a train to
catch... Come on. Let's go.

354
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,416
Thanks, David.

355
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,708
Captain! They made
it! They're alive!

356
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,416
Hey! Over here,
you guys!

357
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,958
Hi, everyone...
We did it.

358
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,583
[Shutaro Barking]

359
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,041
What are you
so excited about?

360
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,625
What is it, boy? Do you
know something I don't?

361
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm proud of you,
Son... Well done.

362
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,958
Thanks, Dad.

363
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,458
Uh, excuse me.

364
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,375
Huh?

365
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,541
You're crying.
I was wondering why.

366
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,666
You were huh?

367
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,583
Well, some friends died

368
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,625
and I got to see them
all one last time.

369
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,916
Wow! You mean you saw ghosts?

370
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,166
No. No ghosts.
It was really them.

371
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,041
Oh... Hey, are you in the SDF?

372
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:35,875
Mhmm.

373
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,250
Wow! No way! That's so cool!

374
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,833
Have you ever been on Big One?

375
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,083
Mhmm.

376
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,291
Awesome! I wanna ride
on Big One someday.

377
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,000
Here.

378
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,375
Huh?

379
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,333
Keep that. It brought
me good luck.

380
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:52,250
Thank you! See ya later!

381
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:57,041
The dreams of a child
seem like innocent folly

382
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,250
but if carried through

383
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,666
they have the power
to change the Universe.

384
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:04,000
[Narrator]The Galaxy Railways
continues to connect the hearts

385
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,916
of all life in the Universe,
offering endless possibilities

386
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,083
to those who travel
on its lines.

387
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:16,750
As it continues to expand,
so do the dreams of man.

388
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,791
So long as we desire to
embrace the Infinite,

389
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:24,250
the Railways will
always be there.

390
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:28,208
And if there is ever a time
when life takes a troubled face

391
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:32,541
and darkness clouds the mind,
just look up and you'll see

392
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,916
the light of a train
heading to new horizons.

393
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,416
It might even be Big One,

394
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,791
the legendary locomotive
that saved the Universe!
