1
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:43,041
[Narr] Sometimes a person's
beliefs are like the influence

2
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,208
of the Sun's gravity
on a planet;

3
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:49,833
they cause that person to take
a certain unwavering path.

4
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,500
Unable to change the
course of their orbit,

5
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:56,083
when they meet with an opposing
will with different beliefs,

6
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,791
they have no choice
but to collide.

7
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,500
The Wheel of Fate has
begun to turn again.

8
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:13,916
I see conflict.

9
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,541
Sirius Platoon! I was
just assigned to this unit.

10
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,583
I'm Manabu Yuuki. Reporting
for duty as ordered, Sirs.

11
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,583
[Louis] Manabu!

12
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,833
Mmm! Aahh!

13
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:48,791
Shut up!

14
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:50,708
Hush!

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,416
If the cash isn't here
in the next ten minutes

16
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,041
this woman is history!

17
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,416
Do you hear me?!!!
Answer!!

18
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,166
You don't think
I'll do it, do you?!

19
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,625
I'll off
her right now!

20
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,333
No!!!!!

21
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,500
Give me some cash now or
I'll paint this floor red.

22
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,791
So be it.

23
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,875
Ahhhhhh!!!

24
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:15,791
Fool!!

25
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, congratulations.
You're dead.

26
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,291
How many times
does that make?

27
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,666
That's three deaths... Sir.

28
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,708
Well, when you're out in space
you only have one life, Cadet.

29
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,500
How can you do your part to help
your platoon if you're dead?

30
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,750
Did you ever
think of that

31
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,916
or were you too busy
trying to be a hero?

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,291
Look, hotshot, I don't care
what the Captain's orders are,

33
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,958
I am not going
to waste my time

34
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,416
training someone who
refuses to listen.

35
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,958
Now go have Yuki take a
look at those wounds...

36
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,250
You're dismissed.

37
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,541
Hmm? Yes?
...Come in.

38
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,541
Hello? ...Miss Yuki?
...Are you there?

39
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,416
Forgive me.
I was changing.

40
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,791
Controlled
training blasts

41
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,708
may still bruise your
internal organs.

42
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,333
Being reckless may prevent
you from doing your duty.

43
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,708
[Manabu]
I'll try.

44
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,333
Here. This is the
Operations Manual.

45
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,333
You may want to start
memorizing it, Louis.

46
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,250
Right.

47
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,708
Thanks a lot.

48
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,666
Watch where
you're going.

49
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,208
You watch where
you're going!

50
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,541
You're the one
who bumped into me!

51
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,166
Hmm? Ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha!!!

52
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,166
She's a feisty
one, isn't she?

53
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,041
We belong to the
Vega Platoon.

54
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,541
Normally, I would kill a person
for talking to me like that

55
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,208
but I'm actually kind of
impressed. You're all right.

56
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,875
Hmm. I saw you in the Sim
Room with the Sirius Platoon.

57
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,000
Are you kidding? What are
you doing with those hacks?

58
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,958
We're the best platoon in the
SDF. Why don't you join us?

59
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,500
What for? So I can
walk around the halls

60
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,666
knocking girls down.
No thanks.

61
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,208
Man, she's like a
big mouth with legs.

62
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,916
Ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha!!

63
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,291
What a bunch
of jerks.

64
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,833
Huh?

65
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,208
Who would still be training
in the Sim Room at this hour?

66
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,625
[Louis] Are you trying to
kill yourself or what?

67
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,458
Hey.

68
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,125
I didn't know you
were so dedicated.

69
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,041
I can help if you want. I'm done
with my training for today.

70
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,583
Are you crazy, Manabu?
You could get hurt.

71
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:50,083
Huh? ...Oh, yeah.
The training level.

72
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,958
I thought if I cranked it up
I would improve faster.

73
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,708
I guess so. These
results are incredible.

74
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,708
Yeah, but my ranking
still isn't as high

75
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,625
as the top guys from the prep
school because of my academics.

76
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,166
So what? That
doesn't matter...

77
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,708
Hmm?

78
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,666
Grades are important, but they
only get you so far in life.

79
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,666
I'd like to see one of those
guys from the prep school

80
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,000
survive in the simulator at this
level. There's just no way.

81
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,125
Besides, rankings
aren't everything.

82
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,166
It's what's on the inside that
makes a person a good officer.

83
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,166
Right?

84
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,125
Hmm.

85
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,000
Hmm, I guess I'd better
call it a day.

86
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,000
If I overdo it and get injured I
won't be any good for tomorrow.

87
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,625
So you do have a brain.
You had me worried.

88
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,791
Huh?!

89
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:32,833
What's wrong?

90
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,416
Oh, it's nothing.
No worries.

91
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,875
That training level
was dangerous.

92
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,333
I didn't know
it was that high.

93
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,416
Bruce is the one who set it
for me before he left.

94
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,333
What in the world
was he thinking?

95
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,875
He either thought
I could take it

96
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,291
or he was intentionally
trying to hurt me.

97
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,166
[Crewman] Emergency signal
has been received

98
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,791
from the Six-twenty Express
traveling from Kaitos to Sigma.

99
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,333
They're being
hijacked.

100
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,000
Right.
Affirmative on that.

101
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,208
It's a code red
hostage situation.

102
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,666
They're requesting an
immediate SDF dispatch, Sir.

103
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,583
Notify Spica Platoon. Have them
in the air in two minutes.

104
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,041
I want all updates to
come directly to me.

105
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,708
Yes, Commander.
Understood.

106
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,166
[Kinuko] Well, hello
there. Wha's up?!

107
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,458
Hmm?

108
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,500
Over here, dude. Yoo, hoo.
I'm talkin' to you.

109
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,333
Who me?

110
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,833
Here!
Power up!

111
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:46,750
Huh?

112
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,000
You seem kind
of bummed out,

113
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,666
like something's
got you down...

114
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,000
Here, this is loaded with
calcium and protein.

115
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,541
Uh. Thanks.
That's okay.

116
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,375
Now don't be shy. That won't
get you anywhere with me...

117
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,375
Besides, I'm no stranger.
I knew your father.

118
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,541
That Wataru was one hot
space-ship captain.

119
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,250
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

120
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,666
You're not so bad
yourself. You Yuuki's...

121
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,625
really have all
the right stuff!

122
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,333
[Beep, beep, beep...]

123
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,875
Manabu speaking.

124
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,416
Report to the main platform
immediately. We're shipping out!

125
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,125
Yes, Sir!

126
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,125
Oh, yeah...

127
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:21,958
Thanks very much!

128
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:27,625
Go get 'em, Manabu! Remember!
You're a Yuuki! You can do it!

129
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,333
[Crewman]
System check!

130
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,000
Stand by for
System Check!

131
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,000
Sub-atomic Warp
Generator ready!

132
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,000
Orbit Network
Radar ready!

133
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,125
Magnetic Barrier
Generator is a go!

134
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,791
Big One is now in
take-off position!

135
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,000
Cylinder Valves are open!
Atomic Boiler Pressure is a go!

136
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,500
The Main Circuit
is now online!

137
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,125
All energy levels ready for
take-off, Captain Bulge!

138
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,000
The warp drive coupling
is now in place!

139
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,791
All systems green,
Captain Bulge!

140
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,000
Awaiting your
command, Sir!

141
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,625
Let's move out!
Ahead full!

142
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,708
The hijacker has taken control
of the Six-twenty Express

143
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,833
traveling from
Kaitos to Sigma.

144
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,083
Right now he's in the
third passenger car.

145
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,208
He's demanding
that we bring

146
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,333
his ex-girlfriend
to him immediately.

147
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,333
He's considered to be
extremely dangerous.

148
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,333
Bring Catherine or
I'll kill them all!!

149
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,208
No! Please, Sir! Wait a second!
Give them some time!

150
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,250
I'm sure they're
bringing her right now!

151
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,166
Shut up! ...You're
lying! Where is she!

152
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,541
If they don't bring her in five
minutes I'll start shooting!

153
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,208
Man, this guy's bad news.
He's out of his mind...

154
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,000
Get me Captain
Bulge, pronto.

155
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:57,916
Right.

156
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,000
I just spoke with the
Captain of Spica Platoon.

157
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,166
They've been scanning
the Six-twenty Express.

158
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,458
She has offered
little hope

159
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,708
of negotiating a
peaceful resolution.

160
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,041
She thinks the
hijacker's insane.

161
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,291
If he thinks that we're not
going to meet his demands

162
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:20,750
he'll open fire. So we're going
to have to operate carefully.

163
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,333
Louis we're going to fly
you to the Six-twenty.

164
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,833
I want you to act like
this guy's girlfriend.

165
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,000
Right.

166
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,666
Let's see. David,
I want you with Louis.

167
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes, Sir.

168
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,708
I need you two to buy us
as much time as possible.

169
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,500
While you're docking
with the Six-twenty

170
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:38,541
at the front of the train, we'll
come up on the rear in Big One.

171
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:42,166
Bruce, Manabu, I want you
two to board the Six-twenty.

172
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,083
Yes, Sir!

173
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,791
Once you're
both on board

174
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,041
proceed to the hijacked
coach immediately.

175
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,625
The first time
you see a chance

176
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,291
to seize the hijacker without
hurting any of the passengers,

177
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,750
I want you
to take it.

178
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,916
Let's be precise people.
I want a clean operation.

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,333
Yes, Sir!

180
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,416
Captain, I'd rather not go
on this mission with him.

181
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,791
Let me go alone, Sir.

182
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,000
Hey what's your problem, Bruce?
What have I ever done to you?

183
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,583
Why do you treat me like
this, huh?! I don't get it!

184
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,333
There's nothing to get...

185
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,000
I just don't like
you. That's all.

186
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,666
Your Dad was an SDF Captain
and your brother was a Panzer.

187
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,333
Both of them were killed
in the line of duty.

188
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:23,166
And now you've joined up. You've
got a lot to prove don't you?

189
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,416
Is that why you're so
reckless in the Sim Room?

190
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,833
Well, I don't want
to get killed

191
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,250
just because you're
trying to be a hero

192
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,750
to get the monkey
off your back.

193
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,500
I don't plan
to die...

194
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,125
I know what it
takes to survive.

195
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,833
What do you know
about surviving?!

196
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,000
...This is your first
mission! You're a novice!

197
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,666
You don't know anything!

198
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,125
Bruce! That's enough!
Who's in command here?!

199
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,708
You are, Captain.

200
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,500
There will be no changes to my
plan. The mission stands as is.

201
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,666
Prepare to board
the Six-twenty.

202
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,750
Sirius Platoon, suit up!
We're approaching our target!

203
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,333
We have you on visuals Big One.
It's about time you showed up.

204
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,833
We'll take it from here. Thanks
for the reconnaissance, Julia.

205
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,833
It was nothing,
Captain. Anytime.

206
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,291
Spica Platoon is heading
home. We wish you luck.

207
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,916
Scan download from Spica
Platoon is now complete...

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let's move in. Eagle One
you're now clear for take-off.

209
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,083
Opening hangar.

210
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,666
Eagle One is ready
for take-off.

211
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,750
Launch, Eagle One!

212
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,541
Come in, Six-twenty Express.

213
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,000
We're requesting
permission to come aboard.

214
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,500
I have Catherine with me.

215
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,333
Catherine's here. Answer
him, you fool! Say yes!

216
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,625
Please! Don't shoot!

217
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,916
This is the Conductor of
the Six-twenty Express!

218
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,666
Permission to come
aboard granted!

219
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,083
Please dock with
the main engine.

220
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,291
All right, Louis. Move
slowly. Act scared.

221
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,333
We're trying
to buy time.

222
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,208
Right.

223
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,958
What's taking
them so long?

224
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:42,500
What are they doing? Just get on
the freaking train! Hurry up!!

225
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,625
What are you waiting
for? Let's go!

226
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,500
Right!

227
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,916
Man. Thanks, Bruce.
Sorry about that.

228
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,208
You're a hindrance, Yuuki.

229
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,583
You can thank me by going
home! Quit the SDF!

230
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,833
I won't do it!

231
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,208
Don't expect any more favors.

232
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,666
David, Louis,
so far so good.

233
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,666
Bruce and Manabu
have made it on.

234
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,833
Well, did I seem scared? Do I
get an award for my acting?

235
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,083
Don't give me that.

236
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,500
You really were scared
to jump, weren't you?

237
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,166
Hey, give me a little credit.
I'm tougher than that.

238
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,666
Heh... Let's go.

239
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,583
Right.

240
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,666
Captain. We're
in position, Sir.

241
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,000
Standby.

242
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,333
[Hijacker] She boarded the
train two minutes ago.

243
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,541
She should be here by now.
What's taking so long?!

244
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,375
[Conductor] I don't
know. I'll go see.

245
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,583
No! You stay!

246
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,875
[Baby cries]

247
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,583
Shut up! Shut that
thing up now!

248
00:15:56,666 --> 00:16:00,041
I can't! He's scared!
Please don't hurt him!

249
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,041
He's just a baby!
He can't help it!

250
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,750
I'll try to get
him to quiet down!

251
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,708
David, where are
you? Hurry up!

252
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,791
We're almost there!
Hang tight!

253
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:14,500
Stop! I can't take it! Shut
him up now or I'll kill him!

254
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,708
No! Please!! No-ho-ho! Don't
hurt him! Don't hurt my baby!

255
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,333
Get away from him!
Don't touch my baby!

256
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,750
Shut that little
monster up right now!!

257
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,708
Bruce! They're in position!
Attack in thirty seconds!

258
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:33,000
No, ho, ho! Get away!
Leave my baby alone!

259
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,333
Ple-hee-hease! Shoot me!
Not him! Don't hurt my baby!

260
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,083
I can't take it anymore!

261
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,666
I'll kill you all if he
doesn't shut up right now!!

262
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:44,166
No! Give my baby back!
Give him back!

263
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:44,458
No!!

264
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,416
Space Defense Force!
...Liars!

265
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,791
...Get away from me
or I'll kill her!!

266
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,333
Don't do i-i-it!!
No!!!!!!!!

267
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:54,791
Damn him!

268
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,958
Manabu.

269
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,166
Passengers, everything
is safe and secure.

270
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,333
Please move to the rear coach
in a calm and orderly fashion.

271
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,500
Thank you very much.

272
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,333
What have I done?

273
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,750
It's over. We're going
to get you some help.

274
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,500
You are one crazy kid.

275
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,166
Hey, Yuuki.

276
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,750
That was a reckless move!
You could have been killed!

277
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,666
If you have a death-wish
join another platoon!

278
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,916
We don't want you here!

279
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,791
All of the passengers
have been taken care of.

280
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,375
No one was
seriously injured.

281
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,375
Manabu! You've
been hit!

282
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,291
Why didn't you say something!
That needs to be sterilized!

283
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,833
[Bruce] Manabu's gun
doesn't fire?

284
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:32,666
[Bulge] No... It's just a
keepsake of his. It's an FW308;

285
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,166
the model that the SDF used to
use back in the old days...

286
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,833
It belonged to his
father, Wataru Yuuki,

287
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,416
the former captain
of Big One.

288
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,166
To our commander and
friend... Captain Yuuki!

289
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:51,000
Goodbye, my sons... This
universe has been my home

290
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,750
but I must leave it for
the Ocean of Spirit...

291
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,250
Be brave, boys. I will
always be with you.

292
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,125
Father.

293
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,250
Father!!!!

294
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,625
Kanna. It'll be long
this time, my love.

295
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,458
I'm Sorry.

296
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,250
There he is.

297
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,083
Well, well.
Hey there, hero.

298
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,125
Hey.

299
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,083
How's your arm,
Manabu? Is it okay?

300
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,500
Yeah. It actually
feels normal again.

301
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,791
The medical technology here is
amazing. They can do anything.

302
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,791
They can't bring the
dead back to life.

303
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,541
No amount of technology
can do that.

304
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,458
Here, Yuuki.
Take it.

305
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,958
But I have
a gun already.

306
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:05,666
It's broken.

307
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,166
A gun that doesn't fire
is worthless, Yuuki.

308
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,416
Put that old relic on a shelf
where it belongs and take this.

309
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,291
I know my duty.

310
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,875
It's to protect the people and
I don't need a gun for that.

311
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,875
You can gamble your
own life on that ideal

312
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,208
but not the lives of
your platoon members.

313
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,041
Now take this side-arm or quit
the SDF. It's your choice.

314
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,291
All right, then.
I'll take it.

315
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,250
Good call.

316
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,708
I said I'll take it...
but I'm not going to use it.

317
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,291
There... are
you satisfied now?

318
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,000
You'll use it someday,
Yuuki. It's inevitable.

319
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,500
You can't avoid
it in space...

320
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,083
You have to kill if
you want to survive.

321
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,833
[Narr] Their two
opposing wills

322
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,333
are like two trains
on a crash course.

323
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,833
The collision is imminent.
Which one will survive

324
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:11,166
and emerge from the
wreckage is the unknown.

325
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,375
That is a question that
only destiny can answer.

326
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,833
[Operator A] We have an
unidentified train

327
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,208
at Alpha Centauri.

328
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,166
[Operator B] Affirmative.
I'm picking it up, too.

329
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,166
Planet of origin: unknown.
Planet of destination: unknown.

330
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,833
How can this be?

331
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,666
I recommend alerting the
commander immediately.

332
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,666
Roger that. Calling Galaxy
Railway Headquarters.

333
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,291
This is Deep Space Substation 7
reporting an unidentified train.

334
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,416
Come in, headquarters.

335
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,250
On the next
Galaxy Railways

336
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,250
we encounter a train
bound for nowhere

337
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,250
and an unsuspecting
passenger who's in danger

338
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,750
of losing his soul forever.
Can we get him to see the light

339
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:37,083
before his ticket is punched
for a journey that has no end?

340
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,541
See you next time
on the Railways!
