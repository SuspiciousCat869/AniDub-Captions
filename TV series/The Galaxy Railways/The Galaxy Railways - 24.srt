1
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,875
In the great tapestry
of the Universe

2
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,958
there are patterns that
are woven by the desires

3
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,750
of the souls
that inhabit it.

4
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,500
Those few who learn
to see these patterns

5
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:54,041
can also see
into the future.

6
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,666
But when this Universal
tapestry is torn

7
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,375
the natural order
of things is lost

8
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:03,041
and nothing is certain-
especially the future.

9
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,166
This is David
with Rigel Platoon.

10
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,875
Headquarters we
are breaking off

11
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,000
to go guard
Muller Junction.

12
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,166
Roger!

13
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,500
Manabu, Louis, I'll
see you guys later.

14
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,083
Stay out of
trouble, okay?

15
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,541
[Manabu] We will, David.
We'll be fine.

16
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,666
Don't worry.
You can bet on it.

17
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,875
[David] Ten-four.

18
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,041
Now that's what I like
to hear. David out.

19
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,208
This is Louis...

20
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,166
The Flame Swallow's
breaking off, as well.

21
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,666
Spica Platoon is heading
out to the Harloom area

22
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,250
to find the enemy
Destroyer and gather info.

23
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,333
Good luck, you
guys. Be safe.

24
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,875
[Manabu] Roger that,
Spica Platoon.

25
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,750
We will.
You do the same.

26
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,666
Good luck.
And Louis...

27
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,458
I'll see you
soon, okay?

28
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,833
Sure. Sounds good.
See you soon, Manabu.

29
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,250
You could have talked
to him a little longer.

30
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,125
It's going to be a while before
you get to see him again.

31
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:26,416
Oh, wait. I forgot. You
two aren't like that.

32
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Uh, Well...

33
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,958
[Shelley] Captain!

34
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,208
What about you? Don't ya
wanna talk about Murase?

35
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,333
How romantic.
Two Captains in love

36
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,125
talking before
the big battle.

37
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,375
Sorry, girls...

38
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,416
I'll wait and say what I
want to say in private.

39
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,000
When this
is over.

40
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:44,750
Right now we need to be more
focused and sharp than ever!

41
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,291
We'll be entering the Warp
Zone in two minutes, Captain.

42
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,041
[Captain] All right,
Girls! Final Check!

43
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:49,833
[All] Yes,
Ma'am!

44
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,833
[Miki] Commander!
Capella, Alphard,

45
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,291
Deneb, and
Antares Platoons

46
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,166
are on their way to
the Harloom Area!

47
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,333
Their ETA is
ten minutes!

48
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,166
I don't know what all
the fuss is about.

49
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,750
It's just one Destroyer. The
SPG will take care of them.

50
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,000
Just wait
and see.

51
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,416
[Sayaka] The Destroyer
is on the move!

52
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,916
Harloom Junction is
no longer responding!

53
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,416
[SPG Member] Thirty seconds
until warp-out, Captain.

54
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,375
Warp-out point is
6 mega-meters away

55
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,333
from Harloom
Junction, Sir.

56
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,833
All right. Prepare
for battle, Men.

57
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,333
Captain, is it
wise to attack

58
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,166
without fully knowing
the enemy's power?

59
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,666
Can't we wait and join
forces with the SDF?

60
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,666
[Captain] This order is from
the top down. We have to obey.

61
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,958
But, Captain...!

62
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,208
We've been in impossible
situations before

63
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,875
and still come
out on top!

64
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,041
Let's not forget
who we are, Men!

65
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,041
[SPG Member] We're
warping out, Captain!

66
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,666
Scanner results!

67
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,125
We're not picking
up anything.

68
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,166
All systems are down. There
is No human life detected.

69
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,333
They're all
dead, Sir!

70
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,791
[SPG Member] Multiple
Warp-Outs detected!

71
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,333
We've got
company, Captain!

72
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,333
[Captain] Onscreen!

73
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,708
Full power to the
Main Battery!

74
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,333
Synchronize all gun-ports!
Target their main bridge!

75
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,333
Yes, Sir!
Awaiting your command!

76
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,458
Fire!!

77
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,000
Direct hits
from all guns!!

78
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,000
Magnify target image!
How bad are they?

79
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,958
What?! Enemy ship completely
unaffected! Not even a scratch!

80
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,625
Hard to
starboard now!!

81
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,208
Get the Recording
Probe ready!

82
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,041
I'm leaving a
message to the SDF!

83
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,333
The Recording Probe
is ready, Captain!

84
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,791
Launch it! Get it
out of here now!

85
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,958
Set it to activate when it
receives an SDF ID signal.

86
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,583
Captain, we're
completely surrounded!

87
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,791
The Enemy is targeting
our lead coach!

88
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,291
Please. Let them
get that probe.

89
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,333
Don't let our
deaths be in vain.

90
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,458
[Miki] The Six-six-six
is no longer responding!

91
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,375
Their ID Signal
has disappeared!

92
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,875
Their radar image
has vanished!

93
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,333
Captain
Johansson...

94
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:42,000
What?! Damn them! Making
light of our elite platoon?!

95
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,333
What was Johansson
doing out there?!

96
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,666
He didn't take out one
single enemy ship!

97
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,500
[Brad] The Alfort Fleet
is dispersing, Commander!

98
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,833
It looks like
they're heading out

99
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,333
to other Galaxy
Railways Junctions!

100
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,166
[Commander] Inform all
Platoons immediately!

101
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,000
Have them coordinate and
plot intercept courses!

102
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,833
[Rigel Captain] The enemy
hasn't arrived yet?

103
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,583
Not yet, Sir. There's no
sign of them on the radar.

104
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:07,250
Incoming energy blasts
at 9 o'clock, Captain!

105
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,208
[Captain] What?

106
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,791
What fire-power!

107
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,333
Enemy Ship
closing!

108
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,125
All available power
to the Main Battery!

109
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,333
Several Platoons are reporting
that they've engaged the enemy!

110
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,708
It looks like the
battle's begun, Captain.

111
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,041
David...
Manabu...

112
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,750
Louis! Let's
focus on our job

113
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,750
instead of worrying
about our friends!

114
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,333
Right!
Yes, Ma'am!

115
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,791
We've arrived at the
Warp-Out point, Captain!

116
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,416
The Scanner
Report's negative.

117
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,000
There are no life-forms
on Harloom Junction.

118
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,000
They're
all dead.

119
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,666
I'm picking up a
Recording Probe here!

120
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,333
It's from the
Six-sixty-six, Captain!

121
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,000
[Captain] Establish a laser
link. Upload the data.

122
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:56,916
Yes, Ma'am!

123
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,916
Onscreen! Play
back the message!

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is Johansson
with the SPG.

125
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,875
Our situation
here is bleak.

126
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,708
We are deploying this
probe in the hopes

127
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,958
that it will record the
enemy's communications.

128
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,583
Once they destroy us they
should let their guard down

129
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:18,166
and break their
radio silence.

130
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,666
Hopefully, the
recordings on this probe

131
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,500
will reveal their
purpose. Godspeed.

132
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,750
Maggie. Run this through our
advanced decoding program.

133
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,083
Guard the Main
Circuit from viruses.

134
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,041
Yes,
Ma'am!

135
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,708
[Female alien] Alfort
Fleet Invasion Force

136
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,583
begin Phase 2
of the attack!

137
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,250
Proceed to the critical
Galaxy Railways Junction

138
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,291
assigned to your ship
and destroy at will!

139
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,875
Once Phase 2 is
accomplished

140
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,291
proceed to the
rendezvous point

141
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,958
where we will
commence Phase 3-

142
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,833
the destruction
of Planet Destiny

143
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,750
and Galaxy Railways
Headquarters.

144
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,375
I repeat: begin
Phase 2 of the attack.

145
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,541
Maintain radio silence
until it's complete.

146
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,291
Everything that
Liffle said is true.

147
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,916
Ivanov didn't
believe her.

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We've got to let
the council know.

149
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,541
AI! Get me
headquarters immediately!

150
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,666
Yes, Ma'am!

151
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,333
We're under
attack!!

152
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,041
They're pretty
clever, aren't they?

153
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,666
They managed to fool our
Orbit Network Radar somehow.

154
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,750
They want a fight. So let's
give it to them, girls!

155
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,291
Captain!
Several fighters

156
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,041
have just appeared
out of nowhere!

157
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,166
They're
attacking!

158
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,000
Alrakis Junction is
reporting damage!

159
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,000
We're also running low
on ammunition, Captain!

160
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,333
Sir! Spica Platoon
is engaging the enemy!

161
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,791
We've got to
do something!

162
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,458
Men, let's eliminate
the enemy here

163
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,083
and head to the
Harloom Area!

164
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,333
We've got to rescue
Spica Platoon!

165
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,666
[All] Yes, Sir!

166
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,666
[Silver]
No worries, girls!

167
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,500
Vega Platoon
is on the way!

168
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,333
Yeah! Nobody
messes with us!

169
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,166
That's right!

170
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,708
Yeah! Let's
go get 'em!

171
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:02,875
Thanks,
Captain Murase!

172
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,083
All guns
open fire!!

173
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,333
The main engine's
been hit!

174
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,875
We're down to
80% of max power!

175
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,416
We've got to
hold on, Girls!

176
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,875
Johansson's message must be
relayed to Head Quarters

177
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:21,833
at all costs!

178
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,125
I'd rather get
one good shot in

179
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:33,125
than go down without a fight!
Maggie! Ready the cannon!

180
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,875
Yes, Ma'am! Diverting all
power to the main cannon!

181
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,041
Energy level is at
the critical limit!

182
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,750
I'm opening the
front armor plates!

183
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,541
Brace yourselves!
This baby kicks!

184
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,458
Open fire!!

185
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,333
Direct hit!
Starboard side!

186
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,625
Our Main Battery's
out of power!

187
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,375
[Captain] It's over,
girls. This is it.

188
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,708
Captain
Julia!

189
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,083
We put up a good fight but
we're damaged too much.

190
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,125
We've done all
we can here.

191
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,500
Prepare to abandon
the Flame Swallow.

192
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,916
[Computer] Voice
recognition affirmed.

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,625
Security
clearance granted.

194
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,208
The self-destruct
mechanism is now set.

195
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:38,041
All crewmembers please
evacuate immediately.

196
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,708
[Captain] Goodbye,
Flame Swallow.

197
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,208
I'll miss you,
old friend.

198
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:46,666
Captain, please hurry! We've
got to go! There's no time!

199
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,500
Right.

200
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,000
No!!
Captain Julia!!

201
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,625
Oh no.

202
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,916
The Iron
Berger!

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,333
It's Vega Platoon! 
They've come to help us!

204
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:35,041
Murase... always
showing-off.

205
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,166
[Schnader] Hey,
did you miss me?

206
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,416
Let's move!

207
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,250
This won't last for
even five minutes!

208
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,791
[Louis] Iron Berger this
is Flame Swallow Shuttle 2!

209
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,625
We're making our
approach now!

210
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,750
Iron Berger!
We've left the nest!

211
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,000
[Silver] Roger that!
We see you!

212
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,166
Louis! Are you
all right?!

213
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,250
Manabu. I'm okay but
Captain Julia's injured.

214
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,708
Come on!
Let's go!

215
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,916
Everyone's accounted
for, Captain!

216
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,541
[Captain] Affirmative!
Prepare for Emergency Warp!

217
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,083
Come on! Emergency warp!
We've got to hurry!

218
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,791
No! Louis!

219
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,041
Louis!!

220
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,625
Louis!
No! Louis!

221
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,833
Engage Warp
Engines! Let's go!

222
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,458
LOUIIIIIIIS!!!

223
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,083
This is
Iron Berger.

224
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,458
We've succeeded in
rescuing Spica Platoon

225
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,708
from a battle with
the Alfort Fleet.

226
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,666
Flame Swallow
was abandoned

227
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,500
and programmed
to self-destruct.

228
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,208
Three Spica members
sustained minor injuries.

229
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:07,708
They're all okay, but one's
critical... and one's dead...

230
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,458
The Alfort Fleet has broken
the back of our defenses.

231
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,625
We're completely
defeated.

232
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,000
Have you heard
about Louis?

233
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:39,958
We've just
lost contact

234
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,958
with the station
on Planet Decor!

235
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,625
Pleiades Junction
has been destroyed

236
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,125
by the
Alfort Fleet!

237
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,625
Atria Main Line;
completely segmented!

238
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,125
Regulus Main Line; inoperative
due to the destruction

239
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,583
of the Orbit Point!

240
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,958
Alphard and
Deneb Platoons

241
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,458
have completed their
rescue operations

242
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,458
and are withdrawing
from the battle lines!

243
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,958
The Wheel of Fate is
spinning out of control.

244
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,083
Our very future is
spiraling into darkness...

245
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,208
What will
become of us?

246
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,333
What?! Their
goal is to destroy

247
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,041
the Galaxy Railways
and Planet Destiny?

248
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,416
This situation is much
bigger than I imagined!

249
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,041
We're going to
need some help!

250
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,916
Ask the Planet States to
mobilize their armed forces!

251
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,333
The enemy has
changed course!

252
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,000
Their entire fleet is
converging on Destiny!

253
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,500
Damn them!

254
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,291
They're striking fast so we
can't organize our defenses!

255
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,708
They're making us look
like a bunch of amateurs!

256
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,000
Captain Bulge!

257
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,250
Wataru. Allow me
to borrow this.

258
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,958
We're going back up soon!
Fix this right now!

259
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,541
Captain, that's
impossible!

260
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,083
We'd need four days for
body work like that!

261
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,333
Four days?!

262
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,041
This planet might not
be here in four days!

263
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,041
Sir, we're doing the
very best we can!

264
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,458
You're not the only ones
fighting! We are too!

265
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,750
You call this
fighting?!

266
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:24,125
Murase. Keep your
head. We need you.

267
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:36,291
It's not looking good, Bruce.
What are we going to do?

268
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:58,666
Big One!
Am I dreaming?

269
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,125
[David] Fancy
meeting you here.

270
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,541
I guess us old shipmates
still think alike. Aye, Kid?

271
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,208
There's no other place we'd
go at a time like this.

272
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:18,166
We are Sirius Platoon
members after all!

273
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,916
Big One's
waiting for us...

274
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:23,958
Hey! This is a
restricted area!

275
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,916
What's
going on?

276
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,791
There aren't any dispatch
orders for Big One!

277
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,416
To hell with that.
We're the Sirius Platoon.

278
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,916
This train
belongs to us.

279
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,875
Sirius Platoon has
been disbanded.

280
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,791
The official word is that
they no longer exist.

281
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,916
Who said that?!

282
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,958
Step away from
there! Now!

283
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,583
You guys don't even have the
rank to take this train up!

284
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,583
Where's your
Captain?! Huh?!

285
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,500
[Wataru] I'm right here!

286
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,875
[Manabu] Dad!

287
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,666
Guards, if you have anything
to say, say it to me.

288
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,208
Captain!
It's you!

289
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,666
Welcome back!

290
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,833
Thank you, David... 
Now let's move.

291
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,500
We have a mission
to fulfill.

292
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:24,416
Yes, Sir! Don't
mind if I do!

293
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,750
Hey! Wait
a second!

294
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,333
Come on! We gotta
report this!

295
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,416
We've been waiting
for you guys!

296
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,416
You're
on board?!

297
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,208
Yeah, we're in the
fighter coach.

298
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,583
I'm afraid we still haven't
finished analyzing

299
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,291
the Cosmo Matrix.

300
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,666
But we don't have to know
what it is to make it work.

301
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,208
We should have
the modifications

302
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,875
on the Main Battery finished
before you go into battle.

303
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,083
Great. We're 
counting on you...

304
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,708
[Yuki] Captain?
This is for you, Sir.

305
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,666
Yuki.

306
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,166
Thank you.
Thank all of you.

307
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,625
I'm very proud to
be your Captain.

308
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,125
Big One's ready to join
the final line of defense!

309
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,250
Request permission
to take-off!

310
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,750
[Ivanov] That's Bulge!
Is he out of his mind?!

311
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,416
We can't let a decommissioned
officer take a train up!

312
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,333
Stop him! Now! I want
him arrested for this!

313
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,416
Big One has
permission to take-off!

314
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,666
What?!!

315
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,750
Sirius Platoon, you are
cleared for take-off!

316
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,583
What kind of
conspiracy is this?!

317
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,083
I'll report you all to
the Inquiry Commission!

318
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,916
Every last
one of you!

319
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,916
System Check!

320
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,416
Stand by for
System Check!

321
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,916
Sub-atomic Warp
Generator ready!

322
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,583
Magnetic Barrier
Generator is a go!

323
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,583
Orbit Network
Radar ready!

324
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,916
Atomic Boiler
Pressure is a go!

325
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,833
Big One is now in
take-off position.

326
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:02,291
Cylinder Valves
are open!

327
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,291
The Main Circuit
is now on-line!

328
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,958
All energy levels are
ready for take-off!

329
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,625
The Warp Drive coupling
is now in place!

330
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,333
All systems green,
Captain Bulge!

331
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,250
Awaiting your
command, Sir!

332
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,583
Let's move out!!
Ahead full!!

333
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,583
Go get 'em Sirius Platoon.
We're counting on you.

334
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,708
Hmm?

335
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,458
Manabu...

336
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,250
I love
you, Son.

337
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,250
Knowing that this may
be their last voyage,

338
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,208
Sirius Platoon has set
off on their mission,

339
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:23,458
determined to overcome the fear
and doubt that assails them.

340
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,458
With the hope
of the Galaxy

341
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,500
resting squarely
on their shoulders

342
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,458
they have no choice
but to fly bravely on

343
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,708
towards their
destiny.

344
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,208
Even with the threat of the
Alfort Fleet facing us,

345
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:29,166
it seems that our most
dangerous enemy lies within.

346
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,500
With a few unexpected allies
and a souped-up weapons system

347
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:35,500
is it possible to survive
against this Super Armada?!

348
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,375
See ya next time
on the Railways!
