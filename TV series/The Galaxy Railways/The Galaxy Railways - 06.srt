1
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:52,000
In this remarkable journey
called life we hurry about

2
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,875
trying to get everything
done from day to day.

3
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,333
There's little time
for anything else.

4
00:01:57,416 --> 00:02:01,208
But occasionally this rhythm
is broken by unexpected events

5
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,125
that pay no heed
to the timetables

6
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,000
we have set
for ourselves;

7
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,250
events that matter-of-factly
change our lives forever.

8
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,625
Why do tragedies happen?

9
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,250
This question has
puzzled mankind

10
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,541
since the
beginning of time.

11
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,750
Move and
you're dead!

12
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,375
I think he's
had enough.

13
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,208
Crazy
daredevil...

14
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,333
That was the
last variation.

15
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,625
I've beaten all of
the levels now.

16
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,000
Step inside.

17
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:23,458
What is it, Bruce? Do I get
a gold-star or something?

18
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,833
Well, Yuuki. Do you know
where you made your mistake?

19
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,083
You were in serious danger out
there. You couldn't see it.

20
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,500
I told you not to carry this
gun anymore. You disobeyed.

21
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,208
But it was
just training!

22
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,000
Training's how we prepare
for real missions.

23
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,958
It's not to be
taken lightly.

24
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,166
But I wasn't taking it
lightly! You saw me!

25
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,750
Huh? Mommy, look
at all the bubbles!

26
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,875
...Aren't
they pretty?!

27
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,458
What is that
stuff...?

28
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,708
What's
going on?!

29
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,708
I don't know!

30
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,083
All passengers please remain in
your seats. Do not be alarmed.

31
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,041
Please remain
in your seats.

32
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,666
Sarah, honey.

33
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,208
I want you to put on this
space suit. Here you go.

34
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,333
Mom, I'm
really scared.

35
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,500
Don't be, honey.
There's no need to be.

36
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,333
Look, Ralph's not
scared. Hold on to him.

37
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,416
All right! What is it, Bruce?!
It's not just the gun!

38
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,583
You were treating
me like this

39
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,791
before you found out
that it didn't work!

40
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,250
What's the deal?!
Just say it!

41
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,791
Or aren't you man enough to
say what's on your mind?!

42
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,583
You're like these strawberries;
too sweet and naive to take.

43
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,416
And What the heck is
that supposed to mean?

44
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm not sweet!

45
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,541
You want to protect the
Galaxy without firing a shot.

46
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,041
I call that being
naive and sweet.

47
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,708
How can I trust a guy
like you to cover my back?

48
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,333
A guy like me?! You just
stuck a gun to my head

49
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,625
and pulled the trigger! You're
a freakin' lunatic! Huh?

50
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,500
[Announcement] Emergency
Signal received!

51
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,166
An accident has occurred on
the Three-twenty-three Express

52
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,666
bound for Great Magellan.
The cause: unknown.

53
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,458
Scale and details:
unknown. ID Signal lost.

54
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,291
Communication
not possible.

55
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,916
Sirius Platoon,
Spica Platoon,

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and Vega Platoon
dispatch immediately!

57
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,208
I repeat: dispatch
immediately!

58
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,666
All right, Sirius
Platoon! Let's move out!

59
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,291
Yuuki, one word
of advice.

60
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,958
...Don't assume that you can
diffuse a dangerous situation

61
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,458
with your
daredevil moves.

62
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,416
Look, I
know that...

63
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,666
Don't make me out to
be something I'm not.

64
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,291
Full
System check!

65
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,958
Standby for
system check!

66
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:41,625
Sub-atomic Warp
Generator: ready!

67
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:46,000
Flame Swallow is now
in take-off position!

68
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,333
Cylinder Valves open! The
Main Circuit is online!

69
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,875
The warp drive coupling
is now in place!

70
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,041
Ahead full!

71
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,791
Hold your horses, Julia!
We're going first!

72
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,000
Maximum Power! Iron
Berger, take-off!

73
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,500
Negative! We have
clearance, Murase!

74
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,666
You're the ones who have
to wait! Stand down!

75
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,083
Forget it! We don't have
time for this crap!

76
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,291
We're
taking off!

77
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,875
That fool... Murase
will never change.

78
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,708
Flame Swallow,
ready! take-off!

79
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,875
Big One!
Ahead full now!

80
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,666
Hmm? Man! That's
five times in a row.

81
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,375
What does that
mean, David?

82
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:57,250
Five tails. Look, just be
extremely careful today, okay?

83
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,250
Okay.

84
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,500
What's up with
this mission?

85
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,375
Why would it be different
than any other?

86
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,500
You tell me. Three platoons
...dispatched at once;

87
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,375
circumstances unknown.
What do you think it means?

88
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,791
Bad news.

89
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,500
I guess they're preparing
for a worst case scenario.

90
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,333
That's not
good, is it?

91
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,583
No,
it's not...

92
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,333
This is the kind of
rescue mission you go on

93
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,083
and wonder if you're going to
need to be rescued yourself.

94
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,666
Man, what
a mess.

95
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,500
It's
awful.

96
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,291
Now we know why they didn't
answer our communications.

97
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,583
No kidding.
What a nightmare.

98
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,500
We might be next if
we're not careful!

99
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,500
Heads up, men! Whoever did
this might still be out here!

100
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,875
Arm yourselves! I don't want to
be caught sleeping! Silver, you

101
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,791
stay in the Turret Coach! Keep
those guns hot and ready!

102
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,333
You got it,
Captain!

103
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,291
Maggie, take Falcon 1
out and patrol the area.

104
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,458
Stay within a twenty
mega-meter radius. Be careful.

105
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,708
They may have some sort of
optical camouflage.

106
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,458
Will do,
Captain!

107
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,833
Jose! Go with Maggie! I want
another bird out there!

108
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,125
Yes, Sir!

109
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,375
We'll search the immediate
area for survivors.

110
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,541
Spica and Vega Platoons will
help. Let's spread out.

111
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,791
If you
find anyone,

112
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,291
bring them to the
medical coach immediately.

113
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,041
[Both]
Yes, Sir!

114
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:40,208
Huh? ...Where'd you
come from, little guy?

115
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,875
Maaan. This is
like a scrap-yard

116
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,000
and a graveyard all
wrapped in one.

117
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,708
Yeah, this is freaky. I
don't think anyone survived.

118
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,833
They're
all dead.

119
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,041
What a way to die;
all alone in space.

120
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,166
It must've
been horrible.

121
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,958
This was definitely
no accident.

122
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,541
We're they sniped? ...No,
it had to be a bomb.

123
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,833
Luise. Are
you okay?

124
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:22,375
Yeah. Sure.
I'm fine.

125
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,541
Hey! Sirius
Platoon!

126
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,500
Do something about
this guy, would ya?

127
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,333
He's just getting
in the way.

128
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Panic attack. Try to
take deep breaths, Yuuki.

129
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,041
You're
hyperventilating.

130
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,375
Manabu,
breathe.

131
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,875
Bruce. Get Manabu
back to Big One.

132
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,375
Have him wait
for us there.

133
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes,
Captain.

134
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,458
Looks like you had a pretty
rough ride, little fella.

135
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,208
Hey! This one's still alive!
Captain! We have a survivor!

136
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,750
It's a child!
A girl!

137
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,208
David!
Report!

138
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,583
She's wearing a
space suit, Captain!

139
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,458
Breathing is faint
but audible!

140
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,916
Her suit is
leaking oxygen!

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,291
We need to get her
back on the double!

142
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,958
Hello,
Manabu.

143
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,625
Hi, Yuki.
How is she?

144
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,625
She could
be better.

145
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,375
Do you think she has a
chance to make it, Yuki?

146
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,291
A lot of that
depends on her...

147
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,416
Hmm?

148
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,416
Thank you so much,
Sir. You saved him.

149
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,666
Can I hold
him, though?

150
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,666
He doesn't like to be
upside down like that.

151
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh, right.

152
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,291
I knew you would never leave
me, Ralph. Good puppy.

153
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,000
Ralph told me that
you're very brave...

154
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:56,125
You don't scare
him. He likes you.

155
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:07,541
Excuse me... Can you tell
me... where my mother is?

156
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:19,833
Mommy! ...Please!
...I need you!

157
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:27,666
Mommy! Mommy!

158
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,583
No, Dad! Don't leave us!
I can't live without you!

159
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,375
Yuki!
Is she...

160
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,083
I believe so. Her vital
signs aren't registering.

161
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,833
Her body is
shutting down.

162
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:53,375
Do something...
please!

163
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:57,041
You can't just give up!
You've got to try to save her!

164
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,166
There's got to be
something you can do!

165
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,958
Don't walk away
from her, Yuki!

166
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,833
Manabu, her body has
ceased to function!

167
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,750
How do you know?!
You've got to try!

168
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,708
She's not a machine!
She's a person!

169
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,708
What do you think
you're doing?

170
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,750
I was only trying
to help, Captain.

171
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,958
It doesn't look that
way to me, Manabu.

172
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,041
You've gone too
far this time.

173
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,750
You're suspended from duty
until further notice.

174
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,708
Based on our inspection
of the wreckage,

175
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,875
it's clear that this
was not an accident.

176
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,291
The devastation of the
Three-twenty-three Express

177
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,083
was the result of a
deliberate terrorist act.

178
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,083
They obviously
used an explosive.

179
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:47,166
We think the device was a
Dissolving Subatomic Bomb.

180
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,583
As you know, the volatile
gel from this weapon

181
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,666
can spread over the
length of an entire train

182
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,250
before it explodes; so we
have no way of pinpointing

183
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,750
where the bomb was
originally hidden

184
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,083
or how many of them
were actually used.

185
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,791
Has anyone claimed
responsibility for this?

186
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,916
No. We've done a thorough media
check on all of the planets

187
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,250
on the Three-twenty-three's
route. As of yet,

188
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,416
no one has made
any claims.

189
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,416
No motive. I
don't like that.

190
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,666
Yeah, no
kidding.

191
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,375
Some sicko could have
done it for pleasure.

192
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:17,791
That's crazy!! Who would
do something like that?

193
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,708
That's what we
intend to find out.

194
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,500
I suggest that
we tighten security

195
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,041
on all lines and closely
monitor any movements

196
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,375
made by the Space
Mafias or Pirates.

197
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,166
Are we in
agreement, Captains?

198
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,166
[All]
Agreed!

199
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,666
Manabu. What
are you doing?

200
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,791
I thought I made
myself clear, Manabu.

201
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,583
You're suspended
until further notice.

202
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,166
Can you tell me how long
that will be, Captain?

203
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,541
Indefinitely.

204
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,916
I don't want to
see you here again

205
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,208
until you've decided if
this really is the path

206
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,375
you want to
take in life.

207
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,166
Captain!
Please!

208
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,541
Your father and
brother both

209
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,708
lost their lives
on this job, Manabu.

210
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,666
It was courageous of
you even to join.

211
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,833
But now you have to decide if
it was the right choice or not.

212
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,333
You're still
a young man.

213
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:09,166
It's not too late to
begin a whole new career.

214
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,583
Captain Bulge. Aren't you being
a little too tough on him?

215
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,875
I don't blame him.
It's my fault.

216
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,208
Manabu,
wait.

217
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,833
Maybe I really
don't belong here.

218
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,166
I can't seem to
do anything right.

219
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,125
I've got five hundred ables
that say he'll be back.

220
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,583
Hey, Manabu!
What's goin' on?!

221
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,125
Huh?

222
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,166
I can tell by lookin' at ya
that you haven't had breakfast.

223
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,500
Here! Power up! It's got
all the major food groups.

224
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,625
I'm real not
hungry. Thanks.

225
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,541
Will you stop being so
darn polite! Take it!

226
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,916
Space is no place for an
empty stomach, young man!

227
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,916
Let go of me! Leave me alone!
I just want to see the cockpit!

228
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,458
Let go! The Fort Worth
is my favorite train!

229
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,833
I have to
see it!

230
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,708
You're not allowed in here!
I have to take you in!

231
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,250
Eh! But I didn't
do anything wrong!

232
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,208
I just want to look
in the cockpit!

233
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,208
What's so bad about
that? No! Let go!

234
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,458
Uh,
excuse me.

235
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,791
What are
you doing?

236
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,250
Conductor, why don't you
just let him have a look?

237
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,958
Illegal intruders must
be taken into custody.

238
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,916
That's the
rule, Sir. Hmm?!

239
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,916
Forgive me, Sir!
Whatever you say!

240
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,916
Oh, man!
This is awesome!

241
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,041
Please! Don't
touch the controls!

242
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,375
Some one could get hurt if
you push the wrong button.

243
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,791
There was a terrible
accident here years ago...

244
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,291
A kid was trying to get
onboard without a ticket

245
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,000
and he ended up
on the tracks.

246
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,625
That's why the rules
are so strict now.

247
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,041
The kids
don't get it.

248
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,583
They think that the rules
are there to punish them.

249
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,291
But they're really just
there to protect them.

250
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,791
I remember being in his
shoes not too long ago.

251
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:50,666
All I wanted to do was get a
close look at my Dad's train.

252
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,416
My brother thought I was
crazy for breaking the rules.

253
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,000
And the one time he decided to
come with me we got too close.

254
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,291
We saw more than
we wanted to see.

255
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:04,458
Dad. Mamoru. Why can't
I be more like you?

256
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,250
I've made a
mess of things.

257
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,958
Maybe I'm not cut out
for the SDF after all.

258
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,833
What are you doing
out of uniform?!

259
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,750
I saw you cleaning Big One
the other day. Remember?!

260
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh. Yeah.
That's right.

261
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,000
You must be good
to get that gig!

262
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,375
Oh.
Thanks.

263
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,833
Don't mention it. I know
you're one bad-boy janitor.

264
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,583
I've never seen
Big One so clean.

265
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,291
Those SDF guys
never pay attention

266
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,083
to that kind of
stuff but I do.

267
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,916
They're too full of themselves
to notice us little guys.

268
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,250
They think their
crap doesn't stink

269
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,625
because guys like you
keep their toilets clean.

270
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,000
What's your
name anyway?

271
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,166
Manabu.

272
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,916
Nice to meet you,
Manabu. My name's Shaw.

273
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,166
I'm the
drink guy.

274
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,291
If you ever need a drink
you talk to me. Okay?

275
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,333
So you knew I was an SDF
member the whole time?

276
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,791
Yeah, I've seen
you around.

277
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,333
Of course you wouldn't
remember one of us little guys.

278
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,458
Kinuko was worried about you
because you got suspended.

279
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,500
She asked me to talk
to you to cheer you up.

280
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,166
She knew that...? She
needs to get a life.

281
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,083
She just cares about
you, that's all.

282
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,583
Kinuko lost a son of
her own way back when.

283
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,583
He'd be our age if he
was still alive now.

284
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,416
The old gal's
not meddling.

285
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,375
She's just trying to be a
mother. You know what I mean?

286
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,541
Hey! Your highness!
Do you want to help

287
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,958
or are you scared
you'll break a nail?

288
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,041
Oh, uh,
Shaw?

289
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,583
Yeah?

290
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,166
I just remembered. The vending
machine by the Meeting Room

291
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,000
isn't working
very well.

292
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,750
That's weird. That's a
brand new machine...

293
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,041
They usually
don't misbehave

294
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,083
unless they've been in
action for a while.

295
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,375
It was fine until
just the other day.

296
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,000
Hey, I know what happened.
Now tell the truth;

297
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,083
I'll bet you kicked it when
you got suspended! Didn't you?

298
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,416
Ha!
Whatever...

299
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,041
Huh? Hey! We gotta
leak in here!

300
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:04,083
Let me guess. This is
about Manabu, isn't it?

301
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,916
Do you want him to resign
from the SDF, Captain?

302
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,875
That's what it seems
like to me, Sir.

303
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,041
It's Manabu who will decide
if he wants to resign or not.

304
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,916
Well, you certainly didn't make
him feel welcome, Captain.

305
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,916
I did what I thought was
necessary to discipline him.

306
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,750
I would have treated any one
of you the same way, Rui.

307
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,333
He has a problem
following orders.

308
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,083
He follows his heart,
Captain Bulge!

309
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,791
What's wrong with that? It's
obvious that he respects you!

310
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,083
An order is an
order. You know that.

311
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,791
If he followed every order Big
One would be destroyed now!

312
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,375
And David
would be dead!

313
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,125
Can't you see that
he's trying his best?

314
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,375
That all he wants
to do is help!

315
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,458
Look, Louis. I'm not
forcing Manabu to resign.

316
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,291
But you're not exactly
encouraging him to stay either!

317
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,083
Emergency Signals received!

318
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,750
The Altair
Two-twenty-four Express

319
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,916
and the Regulus Eight-eleven
Express are both missing!

320
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,833
Their ID Signals
have disappeared!

321
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,666
Communication links
have been lost.

322
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:01,458
Thanks,
man.

323
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,750
Hmm? Watcha
lookin' at?

324
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,125
This store.

325
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,500
It looks a lot like our
family restaurant back home.

326
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,333
You guys own
a restaurant?

327
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,833
Yeah, my Mom's running
it by herself right now.

328
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,916
Welcome.
Have a seat.

329
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,833
Hey, Shaw?

330
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:16,916
Yeah, buddy?

331
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,125
Does your company
carry Tabito Tea?

332
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,666
Well, we used to... It
didn't sell very well.

333
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,083
It kind of has
a funky taste.

334
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,625
What? It's true. Have you
ever tasted that stuff?

335
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,583
Yeah, all the time. I used
to drink it every morning.

336
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,291
Easy there, man. I didn't
know you liked it so much.

337
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,291
I'm not the one who
took it off the market.

338
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,500
I just stock what
they put in my truck.

339
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,958
Are you from
Tabito or what?

340
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,625
There they go again. Somethin'
serious is goin' on.

341
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,458
Nothing renders a
man more powerless

342
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,625
than when he loses
faith in himself.

343
00:20:55,708 --> 00:21:01,291
Don't give up now, Manabu. Your
heart is innocent and pure.

344
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:07,166
Your soul has no dark cloak
over it... Believe in yourself.

345
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,916
How is it that the same Fate
which seems to smile upon us

346
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and offer us hope can suddenly
enshroud our lives in darkness

347
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,083
and end our dreams
without any warning?

348
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,458
...Does everything in life
truly happen for a reason

349
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,916
or are we simply
experiencing a series

350
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,500
of random,
unconnected events?

351
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,541
On the next Galaxy Railways
Captain Bulge and I

352
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,791
have a heart
to heart

353
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,500
but there are more
pressing matters at hand!

354
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,375
Whether it's with my
new friends or the SDF,

355
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,250
I have to try to figure out
who's behind the bombings!

356
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,500
What kind of
insane madman

357
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,250
would kill all of
those innocent people?

358
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,000
See you next time
on the Railways!
