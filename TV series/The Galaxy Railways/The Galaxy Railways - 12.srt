1
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,583
Despite every
precaution

2
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,541
this planet will
soon cease to exist.

3
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,875
Just like the countless
lives that it has nurtured

4
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,958
from infancy
to old age,

5
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:00,625
it too is about to complete
its cycle of birth and death.

6
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,916
The same Sun that gave
it light and warmth

7
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,375
is about to
claim its life

8
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,750
and nothing can be
done to stop it.

9
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,250
The next train
scheduled to depart

10
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,791
is the 330 Express leaving
at 3:30 from Platform No. 3.

11
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,875
Passengers, please proceed
slowly to the gate

12
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,666
in an orderly
manner. Thank you.

13
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,541
That means no pushing
or cutting in line.

14
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,375
More trains are
leaving soon.

15
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,208
Everyone will get free passage
to their final destination.

16
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,333
So let's be patient and make
this as pleasant as possible.

17
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,500
And please all
of you need

18
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,500
to have your emigration
permits out.

19
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,666
You can not board
without them.

20
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,041
The transfer of
local residents

21
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,833
from Blocks A thru
F is now complete.

22
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,416
I've also sent several search
teams into the suburbs

23
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,208
to see if there are any
residents still out there.

24
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,750
As soon as that's
taken care of,

25
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,250
the evacuation
will be complete.

26
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,791
Thank you
so much sir.

27
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,833
It is an honor and a pleasure
to have so many SDF members

28
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,416
come all this
way to help us.

29
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,916
Thanks. But, it was
no trouble at all.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,250
Galaxy Headquarters has
given the highest priority

31
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,583
to this Emigration Project.
We don't want to lose anyone.

32
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,208
The people of Arbent are the
ones that should be commended.

33
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,583
Thanks to their
cooperation,

34
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,625
the evacuation has gone
off without a single hitch.

35
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:30,541
We'll close this station
tomorrow morning as planned...

36
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,041
Excellent
work.

37
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,166
I thank you
for that, Captain...

38
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,833
We've tried
everything, Sir.

39
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,291
But not even our
best scientists

40
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,916
can reverse the effects
of a dying star.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,125
They said that Arbent will be
swallowed up within a year.

42
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,458
It's hard to believe
that everything here

43
00:03:56,541 --> 00:04:00,500
will be gone soon... It's
eerie just thinking about it.

44
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,250
This is Louis
reporting.

45
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,333
Nobody's left in Block
F. What about Block G?

46
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,583
Nobody's here, either.
It looks pretty bleak.

47
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,333
How's it over in
your sector, Manabu?

48
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,666
Same here in Block H. I'm
heading over to Block I now.

49
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,083
I was in Block I
earlier, Manabu.

50
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,000
You can double check but I
guarantee no one's there.

51
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay then, let's
bet on it!

52
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,000
Ten thousand Ables
if we find someone.

53
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, right. Whose gonna
take that sucker bet?

54
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,708
All right,
David! You're on!

55
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,500
No way... It's
all still alive!

56
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,208
It's perfectly
healthy. But how...?

57
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,708
Huh? These farmlands were
supposed to be abandoned

58
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,208
a long time ago.
I don't get it.

59
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,541
Hey you!! Get your scrawny
butt outta my wheat field!

60
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,250
Take that!! How dare
you come out here

61
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,583
and take advantage of
a defenseless old woman!

62
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,458
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

63
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,875
Take advantage? But I didn't
do anything to you, Ma'am.

64
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,083
Finally!

65
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:51,125
I just knew you'd come home
some day! Ma-Makoto-o-o!

66
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,375
Say what?!

67
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,375
Do you have any idea how
long I've been waiting

68
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,416
for you to come
home?! Oh, Makoto!

69
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,375
Ah, excuse
me but

70
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,791
I think you've mistaken
me for someone else...

71
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,125
I'm sorry but I'm not
who you think I am.

72
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,541
Makoto-o-o!

73
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,666
It's just that you just
came back so suddenly!

74
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,333
I thought I'd have
a heart attack!

75
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,750
Only a bad son would treat
his mother that way!

76
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,333
Shame on
you, Makoto!

77
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,000
Ah, lady, please. I already
told you; I'm not your son!

78
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,166
So! Now you
think I'm blind?

79
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,666
Well let's get one
thing straight, Makoto.

80
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,000
It doesn't matter how
big-for-your-britches you get,

81
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,083
you're always
gonna be

82
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,291
that same little
nose-picker to me, boy!

83
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,458
Please, lady! Listen!
I am not your son!

84
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,833
You're such
a joker!

85
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,208
I hope you brought
your appetite.

86
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,916
You must be hungry
after all that traveling.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,458
I didn't come
here to eat.

88
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,833
The only reason
I'm out here

89
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,333
is to see if there's
anyone left to evacuate.

90
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,000
Do you understand, Ma'am?

91
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,750
That's nice, so tell me
is your work going well?

92
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,833
U-Uhh,
it's fine...

93
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,125
Oh, you can
tell your Momma!

94
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,083
Working for the Planet
Cultivation Project

95
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,541
is too hard! It was
just a matter of time

96
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,625
before you
came home!

97
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,333
Planet
Cultivation?

98
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,625
But see! Your dream of owning
a farm came true, didn't it?

99
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,375
Now then, the only thing
you need is a wife...

100
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,083
Or do you already
have someone in mind?

101
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,500
No! I don't have
anyone in mind!

102
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,000
But you don't understand!
I'm not Makoto!

103
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,666
Now that's enough! There's
no reason to be shy!

104
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,500
Oh, no! What a bad mother
I am! I forgot the tea.

105
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,833
Now don't go anywhere!
I'll be right back!

106
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,541
Why did it
have to be me?

107
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,208
Why couldn't Bruce
have found her?

108
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,583
He could use a little
motherly affection.

109
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:40,500
Well, we do look a lot
alike... So she's not crazy.

110
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,791
Just a little
bit confused.

111
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,750
I guess she's been
all alone out here...

112
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,583
waiting for her son to come
home for who knows how long...

113
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,083
I can't just leave
her here to die.

114
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,250
I'd better report this to the
Captain. Maybe he can help.

115
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,208
Makoto...

116
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,541
Now don't you tell me you've
forgotten what time it is, eh?

117
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,500
I don't know what
you're thinkin' lady!

118
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,625
Oh! Ah...
Uwahhhh!

119
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,125
Sounds like some wild monkeys
are mating... This is strange;

120
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,333
all the farms were supposed to
be abandoned a long time ago.

121
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:37,375
Yeah, I never expected to see
anything like this out here...

122
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,625
I wonder where
Manabu is.

123
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,291
What in the world could
he be doing out here?

124
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:48,458
[Manabu] Hahah, S-Stop
it! Stop it...hahaha! Ow!

125
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,375
Manabu!

126
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,708
Louis!
Hold up!!

127
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,625
Manabu!
Are you oka...

128
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,500
WAIT!
Just a second!

129
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,916
Son, you know good and well
that you can't take a bath

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,166
with all these clothes
on, now can you?

131
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,291
OKAY! I'll do
it, lady!

132
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,416
Just let me keep my
underwear on! Please!

133
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,250
Good grief... Now I think
I've seen everything.

134
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,916
What d'you think you're doing
with that old lady, Manabu?

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,125
Are you blind?! It's not
what I'm doing to her!

136
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,666
It's what she's
doing to me!

137
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,208
And what's
that?!

138
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,750
Oh! I'll bet that she's the
girl we talked about earlier?

139
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,416
Am I right? So she's
your future wife!

140
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,625
And who's this
with your fiancee?

141
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,458
One of your
workers no doubt!

142
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,708
Your
future wife?

143
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,458
What in the world have
you been telling her?!

144
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,958
Wait a minute! Does she
think that I'm your employee?

145
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,875
Well, ah...
I guess...

146
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,125
Yaa!! Got 'em!

147
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,125
Yeow!

148
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,333
So, the old woman thinks that
Manabu is her son Makoto?

149
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,333
Right. And she refuses to
listen to a word we've said.

150
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,541
She's convinced that her son
made a fortune for himself

151
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,208
while working on the
Cultivation Project

152
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,666
on Planet Agri and that
he's come back home

153
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,833
with his his girlfriend
and butler in tow.

154
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,041
He's gonna owe me
for this! Big time!

155
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,000
A-And so you're
his butler, right?

156
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,291
Now that's what I
call perfect casting!

157
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,500
Shut up!

158
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,166
I understand the
situation, David.

159
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,000
But we don't have
much time here.

160
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,333
Let's get this mission
wrapped up. Understood?

161
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,625
Yes, Sir! We'll
do the best we can.

162
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,875
Search and Rescue mission... 
Who would've thought?

163
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:22,083
Just wrap it up, huh...?
Who is he kidding?

164
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,625
Oh, and by the way:
we don't have much time.

165
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,208
I'd watch my tongue if
I were you young man!

166
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,250
You'll never get ahead with
that kind of attitude!

167
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,708
You are sooo
right ma'am...

168
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,375
If I
were you,

169
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,458
I'd fire that ill-mannered
excuse for a butler.

170
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,583
You worry me because
you're too good-natured.

171
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,916
Oh, I wouldn't
worry about him.

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,375
He's actually quite
good at what he does.

173
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,375
Besides, I have something
very important to tell you.

174
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,333
It's this
planet...

175
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,000
I know. It's
changed, hasn't it

176
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,208
So have you. The boy who I
once knew has become a man.

177
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,833
I remember you used to cry
over every little thing

178
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,500
but you never gave up... I
lost count of how many times

179
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,291
I took you to a friend's
house to patch things up...

180
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,750
Do you
remember that?

181
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,125
Manabu,
its okay...

182
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,250
That must have been
hard... I'm sorry.

183
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:30,875
Well, it wasn't easy but I did
manage... You're back home now.

184
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,333
That's all
that matters.

185
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,250
It's natural for a man to go
off and pursue his dreams.

186
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,541
I'm just glad
you're home.

187
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,500
And you've turned into
such a big success,

188
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,416
and you just
look so good!

189
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,416
You don't know
how proud I am.

190
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,625
You are going to stay with
me from now on, aren't you?

191
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,708
It's not right...
I can't.

192
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,916
I can't start playing along
even if it's just to help her.

193
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,833
I have to try to
get through to her.

194
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,458
She needs to know
that I'm not Makoto.

195
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,625
We need to
talk, Ine...

196
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,750
Lower! Lower! There!
Oh, that feels so good!

197
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,250
You have magic
fingers, young man.

198
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,958
You're too kind, Madam
Ine... It's my pleasure.

199
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,291
I'd also like to
thank my son's driver

200
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,500
for getting that
wood chopped.

201
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,375
Well, I'm used to hard work
so it's no trouble at all.

202
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,541
Let me assure
you, madam.

203
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,833
This is a piece of
cake for him. Really.

204
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,875
Ah... isn't that
right, Driver?

205
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:58,833
Shut up.
Will ya?

206
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,375
Goodness. Why are
you still wearing

207
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,916
that dirty
old uniform?

208
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,875
Didn't you see I left some
clean clothes for you?

209
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,291
Um...

210
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,875
And why didn't you tell me
that these other young men

211
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,708
who work for you
were coming as well?

212
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,833
If I knew, I'd have
planned a nice dinner.

213
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,000
Or at least I'd have
cleaned up around the house.

214
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,541
We don't need
special treatment.

215
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,208
We're just hired
hands after all.

216
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:24,291
Nonsense. Hired hands or not,
you're all VIP's in my house.

217
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,625
I'll do my best to
prepare a delicious meal

218
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,125
for you tonight...
Ah, Louis?

219
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:29,666
Ma'am?

220
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,208
Would you help me
in the kitchen?

221
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,916
Sure thing. It'd be
my pleasure, Ma'm!

222
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,916
Ah, you know. I'm convinced
that there's a good reason

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,958
why this is
happening, Captain.

224
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,333
I hope
you're right.

225
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,958
Yes, Sir.

226
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,416
This is all
my fault.

227
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,291
I couldn't convince her
that I wasn't her son

228
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,625
so I let her believe
what she wanted.

229
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,083
Hmm....

230
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,291
You know, Sir, I think Ine's
waited so long for her son

231
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,833
to come back that she
has to believe I'm him.

232
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:03,083
But if she could talk to her
real son I think she'd be okay.

233
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,833
Do you think we could
use the ship's computers

234
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,625
to track
him down?

235
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,083
That's
impossible.

236
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,416
But it would
solve everything!

237
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,416
I know it's not the
SDF's responsibility

238
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,875
but if we force her to
leave she could snap!

239
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,083
It's impossible
because her son's dead.

240
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,916
Now you see, Louis?
First, cut it here like so.

241
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,291
Ohhhh!

242
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,708
If you're that
impressed by this, child.

243
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,708
Then you've got
a lot to learn

244
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:30,458
if you want to be
Makoto's wife.

245
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:34,250
But... You see! I'm not
really his fiancee, Ine!

246
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,625
Oh, I've forgotten
the tomatoes.

247
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,208
Those're his
favorite.

248
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,333
I'll go get some
from the garden.

249
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,500
Uhh...?

250
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,625
Planet Agri...
Destroyed?!

251
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,958
But planets set for
agricultural colonization

252
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,625
are researched
in advance, right?

253
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,791
Well, I think it was
initially sound.

254
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,291
But all the Planetary
Renovations weakened it.

255
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,666
Ten years ago,

256
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,458
Agri's tectonic infrastructure
suddenly collapsed.

257
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,250
No survivors were
found. Not even one.

258
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,791
Then no matter how
long she waits,

259
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,500
Makoto won't ever
come home again.

260
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,583
This is awful.
It'll break her heart.

261
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,958
So any
ideas, Manabu?

262
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,833
Oh, there you
are, Makoto...

263
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,916
I guess the two of you
are having a meeting.

264
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,500
[Buldge] Oh, no. We
were just chatting.

265
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,541
Then I suppose
you won't mind

266
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:34,000
if I borrow my
Makoto for a bit?

267
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,208
What's up,
Ine...? Where to?

268
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,250
Not far at all. There's
something I want you to see

269
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,708
that I think
you'll enjoy.

270
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,916
Oh, darn it! Why
can't I do this?!

271
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,833
I wonder where
they're going.

272
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,083
So, have you been taking
care of this wheat field

273
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,208
all by
your self?

274
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,000
Well, you
know me.

275
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,375
If everything's not perfect I
can't get to sleep at night.

276
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,041
Besides, I couldn't
have you come home

277
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,125
and find that your wheat
field had gone to seed.

278
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,541
First she
loses her son

279
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,833
and now she's about
to lose her home.

280
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,750
I don't know how to
tell someone that.

281
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,416
Ine, you have to leave this
world as soon as possible!

282
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,291
It's not safe here anymore.
You'll die if you stay...

283
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,458
So say
something...

284
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,625
There's nothing to
say. This is my home.

285
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,166
I could never give all this
up. It's like a part of me.

286
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,458
This land has a
soul of its own.

287
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,916
Do you believe
that, my son?

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,125
I do.

289
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,416
I'm glad. Because this
place is our home,

290
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,833
and it could use a
friend right now.

291
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,458
We should go.
I love your fiance

292
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,041
but I don't trust
her in the kitchen.

293
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,833
Well, come on! I'm not
getting' any younger!

294
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,791
Are you okay?

295
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,833
Yes, I'm
fine, dear.

296
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,083
It's
lovely.

297
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,083
It is, but then
before you know it...

298
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,041
this place'll
be long gone.

299
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:37,666
I wish there was
something we could do.

300
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,791
Are you sure I'm
not too heavy?

301
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,833
No, you're fine.

302
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:53,833
You remind me of your
father - strong; kind.

303
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:54,708
You even look
like him to me.

304
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,791
You know, there's
nothing more special

305
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,833
than getting a piggyback
ride from your son.

306
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:06,083
But I'm not your son...
I'm not Makoto...

307
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,958
Do you understand what I'm
saying, Ine? I'm sorry.

308
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:16,458
Wow. I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

309
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,125
It's like
paradise.

310
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,541
Over there! Do you
remember this place now?

311
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,875
You'd often tell me you
liked the view from here...

312
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,708
You said when you saw it
you felt you were home.

313
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,958
I said that?

314
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,375
Many times...

315
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,083
Try one of these.
The funny thing is,

316
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,208
this tree has never
stopped bearing fruit.

317
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,125
And the apples always
taste the same.

318
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,166
The view here hasn't
changed either...

319
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,041
I can't believe that
everything around me

320
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,250
is really going
to disappear...

321
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,791
I'll never see any
of this again...

322
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,208
Just like
my son.

323
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,833
Like your son?

324
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,416
You knew Ine...?

325
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,458
Delicious!

326
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:19,166
Hey, Ine... Would you mind
if I took this with me?

327
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,583
Huh?

328
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,625
This fruit's too delicious.
It wouldn't be right

329
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,250
if no one else
got to taste it.

330
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,291
I'll plant seeds from this
tree on different planets!

331
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,958
It will live
on! I promise!

332
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,791
I'll make sure the first
one'll be on Planet Agri.

333
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,375
And I won't
stop there.

334
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,458
I'll spread the fruit from this
tree throughout the universe.

335
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,625
That sounds like
a lot of work!

336
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,875
Yeah, I know. But
it'll be worth it.

337
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,833
Because wherever
this tree grows,

338
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,250
it'll be like
home to me.

339
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,000
And it won't
ever disappear.

340
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,875
And no matter how
far away it is,

341
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,583
it'll taste just the
same as it does here.

342
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:58,666
The same as it does here?
The same as it does here...

343
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,458
What's going on?! Ine?!
What's happening?!

344
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,000
Are you okay?!

345
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:44,875
What's going on?! Ine!? What's
happening?? Are you okay?

346
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:48,416
I'm more than okay... 
Thank you so much!

347
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,000
Ine!!

348
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,041
Good bye, Ine.

349
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,875
[Buldge] No residents remain
on Planet Arbent now.

350
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,083
The transfer of
the population

351
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,708
has been completed
on schedule.

352
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:38,041
Can somebody please tell
me what that was all about?

353
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,291
Who knows? Maybe
it was an illusion.

354
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,750
Or maybe it was a
mass hallucination.

355
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:47,708
Whatever it was,
it wasn't real.

356
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:52,416
I disagree. It was real;
the tastes, the smells.

357
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,916
And how do you
explain the apple?

358
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,541
I think we were all dealing
with the spirit of a mother.

359
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,791
A mother that wanted to
live... She was scared.

360
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,250
She didn't want to
die and be forgotten.

361
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,416
She wanted to
go on forever.

362
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,666
Hey Shutaro, How have you been?

363
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,125
I'll be right with you.

364
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,250
Huh?!

365
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,125
Well I got the day off.
Is that ok?

366
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,041
It's more than ok, son.

367
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,416
Next time, while
on the 777 Express

368
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,416
I meet Subaru, an
old childhood friend

369
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,708
but he's different than
he was in the old days.

370
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,833
When things get crazy and we're
attacked by hostile aliens,

371
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,041
I'm wishing that I had
the old Subaru back.

372
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,708
See ya next time
on the Railways.
