1
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,041
[Narr] Planet Leo Glando;

2
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,333
its atmosphere is covered
with a thick Plasma Layer.

3
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,583
Famous for its rich
mineral content,

4
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,375
its surface is littered
with mining operations.

5
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,041
At least once a day an
unmanned freight train

6
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,583
carries its valuable
subterranean treasures

7
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,791
to other planets
in the Galaxy.

8
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,708
[Miki] There's been
an explosion

9
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,708
on an ascending
launch on Leo Glando!

10
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,375
The tracks are
severely damaged!

11
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,333
[Kate] Freight train
Number Five-thirty-four

12
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,208
has derailed and crashed on
the planet surface, Commander.

13
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,750
I want Bulge on this!
Dispatch Sirius Platoon!

14
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,833
Two paths will cross again.
It cannot be avoided.

15
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,250
The diagnostic is showing
that we have a small problem

16
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,958
with our Output
Relay, Captain.

17
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,416
It must have
taken some damage

18
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,083
when we broke through
the Plasma Layer.

19
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,541
It shouldn't take that
long to repair, Sir.

20
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,083
All right then, David.

21
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,916
You stay here and
fix the Output Relay

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,208
while we go ahead and recover
the Five-thirty-four.

23
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,083
Manabu, I want you to
stay and assist David.

24
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,041
The rest of you
are with me.

25
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:16,958
[All] Yes, Sir!

26
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,500
You probably wanted
to go with the others.

27
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,250
Well, I do like to be
where the action is.

28
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,416
And I did study train recovery
in school a little bit.

29
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,833
A little bit? No wonder
they didn't take you.

30
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,750
Yuuki! A little bit of school
doesn't make you an expert!

31
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,833
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

32
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,000
Stop loafing, Cadet!
We're on a timetable here!

33
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,916
Ha, ha, ha! Relax!
I'm only kidding!

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,125
Now let's get this
thing patched up

35
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,333
so we can join
the others!

36
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,541
[Manabu] Right!

37
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,666
Go ahead and connect
those two there, Manabu.

38
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,000
Got it!

39
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,583
Hey, David, has Bruce
always been... You know.

40
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,166
Yeah, I know.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,583
That was a reckless move!
You could have been killed!

42
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,875
If you have a death wish
join another platoon!

43
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,250
Yeah, ol' Bruce is
pretty tightly wound.

44
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,000
There's no doubt
about that.

45
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,291
Check B Panel
would ya?

46
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,750
Sure.
Got it.

47
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,625
[David] Yeah, Bruce is a
tough guy to get to know.

48
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,000
It's hard to
talk to him.

49
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,333
He wasn't always
like that though.

50
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,000
We're done!
We did it, Manabu!

51
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,500
[Alarm]

52
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,750
What is it?

53
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,583
Something's interfering
with the Signal Relay

54
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,208
underneath the
second coach.

55
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,541
Ahh, there we go.

56
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,375
It's pinpointing
the trouble.

57
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,000
Can you check out
those areas, Manabu?

58
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:45,875
Yeah! Sure!

59
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,750
[Whack!]

60
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,833
The train Identification Signal
from Big One has disappeared!

61
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:04,916
[Commander] What?

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,041
Big One's not
responding, Commander!

63
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,750
This is unheard of! I want Spica
Platoon in the air immediately!

64
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,000
Big One must be
found at all costs!

65
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,791
[Sayaka] Spica Platoon!
Immediate dispatch requested!

66
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,375
[Miki] Converting Big One's
signal data to Trace Mode!

67
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,333
Transferring it
to No. 34 now!

68
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,750
Manabu? Can
you hear me?

69
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,333
[Bulge] Easy, Manabu. You've
sustained a head injury.

70
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,333
Where am I?
Where's Big One?

71
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,416
[Louis] We
don't know.

72
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,583
[Manabu] What?

73
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,791
[Louis] We lost contact
so we got worried.

74
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,666
When we came to check on you,
Big One was gone.

75
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,083
[Manabu] You're
kidding me!

76
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,333
[Louis] We found you lying
on the ground unconscious.

77
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,208
[Bulge] Manabu.
What happened?

78
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,666
I don't remember.

79
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,125
I was looking under Big One
and everything went black.

80
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,958
[Bruce] Do you remember
seeing anyone, Yuuki?

81
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,250
No. Sorry.

82
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,708
Nice to see
you, Captain.

83
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,333
I wish it were under different
circumstances, Julia.

84
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,625
[AI] Captain, I've never
seen anything like this.

85
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,875
There's so much
interference

86
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,625
from the Plasma Layer
and the soil components

87
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,083
that our radar can't
function normally here.

88
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,500
Since Big One's Train ID
Signal has been disabled,

89
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,708
there's no way for us to
track it electronically.

90
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,750
We'll have to find it
the old fashioned way.

91
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,291
Daylight will be a factor then.
We should start immediately.

92
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,791
Yes. Agreed. But we
have to be careful

93
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,250
communicating with each other
since Big One's been captured.

94
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,333
Before you leave change the
Network Range in your fighters

95
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,958
to Spica's security
wavelength.

96
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,083
[All] Yes, Captain!

97
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,958
Manabu. I want
you to stay here.

98
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,166
But Captain!

99
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,625
You have a head injury, Manabu.

100
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,875
I want you
to rest.

101
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,333
I'm fine, Sir! Please!
Let me help find David!

102
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,125
That's an order, Manabu.

103
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,708
Yuki, take him to
the medical coach

104
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,333
and get a proper look
at that injury.

105
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,541
Yes, Sir.
Let's go, Manabu.

106
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,583
How can I stay behind when
David's life is at stake?

107
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,916
Manabu, wait!

108
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,833
[Maggie] Are you
out of your mind?

109
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,750
Just get this thing
up in the air!

110
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,208
I think that blow to your
head knocked a screw loose!

111
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,833
[Bulge] How much
daylight do we have?

112
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,250
[Julia] A couple hours.

113
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,583
There! This is Manabu!
We've found Big One!

114
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,750
It's heading Northeast
along Line 14 in Sector 32!

115
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,291
Where you goin?

116
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,416
[Louis] It looks
like Line 14

117
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,250
comes to an end
right over there.

118
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,875
Huh? Bruce!
A Plasma Hole!

119
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,208
They must be planning to go
into space through there!

120
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,750
Don't be
ridiculous, Louis.

121
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,541
Not even Big One can take to
the air without using a launch.

122
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,750
[Bruce] Is that what
I think it is?

123
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,666
A Transport Ship!

124
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,666
And the tracks are leading
right to the cargo bay!

125
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,500
[Pirate] We're almost
to the Transport Ship.

126
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,625
Who would have dreamed
that it would be this easy?

127
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,666
They should be more
careful with their toys.

128
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,375
With a Cosmo Generator,
the Death Croites

129
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,291
can make enough weapons
for a thousand armies,

130
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,833
and they practically
gift-wrapped it

131
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,916
and gave it away.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,166
I think we
should all

133
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,375
send a nice thank you
card to Captain Bulge.

134
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,291
[All Laugh]

135
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,291
Pirates!

136
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,250
[Kate] The data check on
the illegal ship is complete.

137
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,208
Registration number
two-eight-two!

138
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,125
It's identified as
a large Transport Ship

139
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,250
belonging to the
Death Croites, Commander.

140
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,833
What? The Death Croites?

141
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,541
Then it was all just a trick!

142
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,125
So, their target

143
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,583
was Big One all along.

144
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,916
How's it going, men?

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,333
All is well, Sir.

146
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,250
I want you to check
the rear coaches.

147
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,166
We're selling the generator
to the Death Croites,

148
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,000
but the rest
belongs to us.

149
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,333
We're pirates after all!
Let's loot this baby!

150
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,250
[All] Yeah!!
[Laughter]

151
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,000
Huh?

152
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,416
What is it,
Manabu?

153
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,833
Someone opened up a coded line,
but didn't speak. David!

154
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,583
David! Captain Bulge here!
Are you okay? What's going on?

155
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,708
[tap, tap...]

156
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:10,166
SDF signal code. David's
tapping out a message.

157
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,458
He must not be
able to talk.

158
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,708
Emergency message from
Galaxy Railway Headquarters.

159
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:16,791
Onscreen!

160
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,833
Captains, in accordance
with Article Three-eighty-seven

161
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,875
of SDF Regulations,

162
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,458
Galaxy Railway Headquarters
has made a decision.

163
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,375
Destroy Big One.

164
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,291
That's an order.

165
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,541
[Julia] Commander! You want
us to Destroy Big One?

166
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,875
That's correct,
Captain.

167
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,375
[Bulge] With all due
respect, Sir.

168
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,875
Does Supreme Commander
know about this?

169
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,833
[Cmdr] This decision is
based on SDF regulations.

170
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,416
There's no need
to consult her.

171
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,291
[Bulge] But one of my
men is on board!

172
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,750
We cannot allow Big One to
fall into enemy hands, Captain.

173
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,833
But why are you ordering me
to destroy my own ship?

174
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,416
Why not blow it
up yourself?

175
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,083
If that were possible,
we would have already done it.

176
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,416
We are unable
to initiate

177
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,083
the self-destruct
sequence at this time.

178
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,250
That's because the train ID
Signal has been disabled, Sirs.

179
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,791
It won't work
without it.

180
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,500
You have your orders, Captains.
I don't care how you do it.

181
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,375
Just make sure you get
the job done. Good luck.

182
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,708
[AI] Eagle 2 has completed
their scan of Big One.

183
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,708
We've got two people
confirmed in the rear coach;

184
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:32,000
two in the main control room;
and one in the engine room.

185
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,416
Looks like
David's signal

186
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,041
is coming from the
main control room.

187
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,333
Captain Bulge, Sir. Permission
to board Big One. I can make it.

188
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,958
I can jump on the roof
and stop it from inside.

189
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,875
Permission denied.

190
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,125
Please, Sir!

191
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,250
Negative. Big One must
be derailed and crashed!

192
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,375
[Louis] Did he
say crashed?

193
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,041
Captain, this is
Bruce. Please explain.

194
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,291
We can't allow Big
One to be taken away.

195
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,833
We have to stop it before
it reaches the Transport.

196
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:01,041
Our orders from headquarters
are to destroy it.

197
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,916
[Louis] Captain Bulge,
there's got to be another way!

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,500
How can you follow an order
like that without protesting?

199
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,416
It's not right!

200
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,291
[Bang]

201
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,833
[Bulge] David. You have
to get off that train.

202
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,208
Don't let me down.
You have to escape.

203
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,291
[Bulge] Sirius Platoon!
Return to the 34 immediately!

204
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,625
We're changing
our plans!

205
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,166
[Manabu] I can't.
I can't leave David.

206
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,666
[Maggie] Hey! What do
you think you're doing?

207
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,166
I can't leave my friend behind!
I'm going after him!

208
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,208
You'd do the same
thing! Wouldn't you?

209
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,166
You're right.

210
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,083
I would.

211
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,500
Let's go for it!

212
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,708
There they are!

213
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,750
10-4!

214
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,000
Boss! We've got a fighter
approaching from the rear!

215
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,375
Ah, don't worry about it.
They won't attack us.

216
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,333
Not while we have
their friend hostage.

217
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,708
Be careful,
Manabu!

218
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,625
I will.

219
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,375
Manabu! You're disobeying
a direct order!

220
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:34,291
I don't have a choice! I can't
leave David, Captain! I'm going!

221
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,833
The scan showed two
in the rear coach.

222
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,958
Somebody cut us loose
from the freakin' engine!

223
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,083
He did it!

224
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:54,875
Hey, guys!

225
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,041
Damn you!

226
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,708
[Manabu] Have a nice trip!

227
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,625
Asshole!

228
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,208
Way to go, kid!

229
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,625
David! Are you
all right?

230
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,333
Yeah, I'm okay.

231
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,000
Damn these things!

232
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,916
Forget me! If you don't stop
this train we're both dead!

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,708
You're right! This'll
just take a minute!

234
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,250
David! It's
not working!

235
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,708
They jammed the
Signal Relay!

236
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,541
Manabu! Use the manual
brake in the engine room!

237
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,500
Right!

238
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,625
Get off that
train, guys.

239
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,500
You'll have a better
chance living if you jump.

240
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,791
You've got guts kid,
I'll give you that.

241
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,625
[Manabu screams]

242
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,708
Stupid kid.

243
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,625
You'd better
be dead.

244
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,375
[Manabu screams]

245
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,583
Now that's impressive.
I'm starting to enjoy this.

246
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,625
Well done, kid!
Now let's finish the game!

247
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,500
What's so shocking
about my face

248
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,708
that you can't defend
yourself, kid? Huh?

249
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,500
You don't remember me,
do you? Bastard!

250
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,208
Five years ago you
killed my brother.

251
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,708
You shot him from
behind, you coward!

252
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,625
Hmm! I wish I remembered
that, but I don't!

253
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,458
[explosion]

254
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,750
[Pow, Pow, Pow]

255
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,541
They'll reach the bridge
that we blew up in 3 minutes.

256
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,625
[David struggles]

257
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,041
[yells in pain]

258
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,375
[Guy Sander laughs]

259
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,750
What's the matter?

260
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:19,791
Let's go!

261
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,500
Ahhh!!

262
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,500
This is for Mamoru!

263
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,791
Manabu.

264
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:48,833
Dad!

265
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,833
Thank you, Dad.

266
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,041
Too late!

267
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,375
[AI] Two thousand meters.

268
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,375
[David] Manabu! Jump off!
We can't stop in time!

269
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,333
No way! We'll stop
or we'll die trying!

270
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,583
Crazy kid!

271
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,791
Ahhhhhh!!!

272
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,041
Manabu.

273
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,291
Ahhh!!

274
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,583
Stupid kid.

275
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,166
Should have killed me
while you had the chance.

276
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,958
[sinister laugh]

277
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,708
Manabu!
Let's go!

278
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,833
I'm staying!
You go ahead!

279
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:48,708
Die!

280
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,625
Need a hand?

281
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,750
[AI] Two hundred
meters to go

282
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,833
until Big One
derails, Captains!

283
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,875
One hundred meters!

284
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,500
Well done, Son!

285
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,875
You did it!

286
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,458
No, I didn't do it.

287
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:42,291
Hmm? What do you mean by that?
Of course you did. Loosen up.

288
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,666
You were incredible. You should
be celebrating right now.

289
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,333
I let him go.

290
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,500
Manabu! Whoa! Hey!

291
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,833
That was incredible!

292
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:56,291
I can't believe you!
Huh? What's the matter?

293
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:03,958
Father! Why did you
stop me? It was him!

294
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,541
Father!

295
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:11,833
Ahhhhhhhh!!!

296
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,708
Man cannot resist
the flow of his own Fate.

297
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,125
How can he, when it
has been predetermined

298
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,791
by his own actions?

299
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,041
[Bulge] All
right, Manabu.

300
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,500
I see that you're
well equipped.

301
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,833
It's time to begin.

302
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,166
Yes, Sir.

303
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,125
There's no excuse for
disobeying a direct order.

304
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,750
I don't want it
to happen again.

305
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,333
It won't, Sir!

306
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,333
Hey!
Catch!

307
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,291
I support our boys in uniform!
Keep up the good work!

308
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,666
He must be a
fan of the SDF.

309
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,208
Wait a second. I'm not
wearing my uniform.

310
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,958
[David] What?

311
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,583
You didn't think I'd let you
have all the fun, did you?

312
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,583
We both took Big
One for a joy ride

313
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,083
so we both clean her up!
It's only fair! Right?

314
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,666
If you say so.

315
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,208
I bet the mechanics 200 ables

316
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,666
that you and I could finish
washing this thing in one hour.

317
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,666
One hour!
That's crazy!

318
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,666
You know what's going to
make it even more difficult?

319
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,875
What?

320
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,875
If you keep watching
instead of mopping!

321
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,041
Oh!
Right!

322
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,875
[Narr] Sometimes even
disobeying an order

323
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,708
is the right thing to do.

324
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,250
A man's conscience
must be his ultimate guide.

325
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,166
On the next
Galaxy Railways

326
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,166
innocent passenger
trains are being bombed,

327
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,916
and all SDF platoons
are deployed

328
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,666
to find out
who's behind it.

329
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,583
I've been on a few
tough assignments

330
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,291
but nothing could
prepare me for this.

331
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,708
See ya next time
on the Railways.
