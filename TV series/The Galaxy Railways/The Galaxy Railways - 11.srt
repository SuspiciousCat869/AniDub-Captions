1
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,375
Stay alert! D'you
wanna get killed!?

2
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,500
Sorry!

3
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,708
It has been said that,
deep in our hearts,

4
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:28,041
a solitary flower blooms. This
flower is a vivid reminder

5
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,541
of someone made up from
the scents and colors

6
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,958
of half-forgotten
memories;

7
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,041
in essence a
portrait of someone

8
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,458
who is
unforgettable to us.

9
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,500
Out of the 11 smugglers, we
took 7 to the Prison Coach.

10
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,625
The rest, who
were injured,

11
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,875
were taken to the
Medical Care Coach.

12
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,958
Mission complete... 
We'll return to Destiny.

13
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,208
Yes, Sir!

14
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,083
Wait a
minute!

15
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,416
There's time... if
you guys hungry?

16
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,916
Sure. We could eat,
Sir... That'd be great.

17
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,708
Then may I suggest we try
this Station's packed lunch?

18
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,541
Big 1 is scheduled to
take off in 30 minutes.

19
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:21,875
U-Um?

20
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:22,875
Ah?

21
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,750
But we have
rations, Sir.

22
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,916
I know, but use this
to buy us all lunch.

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,958
Y-Yes sir.

24
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,791
I can't let you make a
personal call from Big 1.

25
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:40,541
Huh? Oh.
Thanks Captain.

26
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:45,375
No, it's fine. So
how have you been...?

27
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,583
Oh, that's good...
Don't worry about me;

28
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,916
you're the one with
the dangerous job.

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
As long as I know
that you're safe.

30
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,708
That's all that
matters to me.

31
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,166
Well, anyway Catalina;
happy Birthday.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,125
Thank you!

33
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,458
I'll give you your
present next time, okay?

34
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,625
Oh, you don't need
to do that...

35
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:10,000
Hearing your voice is my
present. That's all I need.

36
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,000
Talk to
you soon.

37
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,000
Captain?

38
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,416
I'm glad you like them.
It's too drab in here...

39
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,125
I think they freshen up
the room a bit, don't you?

40
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:32,541
Yes, you're right...
They do add something...

41
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,916
Oh, is
that for me?

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,750
My Vacation Form. It
still needs your signature.

43
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,500
But I guess you
already knew that!

44
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:40,875
Of course.

45
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,958
Well, that was weird. It's not
like him to be absent-minded.

46
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,041
Yeah. Except when he's thinking
about his old girlfriend.

47
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,791
No way... Not our
Captain Bulge...

48
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,208
Wanna bet?

49
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,291
Why not? I've got ten thousand
that says you're wrong.

50
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,416
You're on!

51
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,875
Stop me if
I'm wrong Louis,

52
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,166
but didn't you just
take a vacation?

53
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,250
As a matter of fact Louis
has taken three vacations.

54
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,333
But statistics say that it
isn't unusual for a rookie...

55
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:13,666
Spare us the details, okay?
So, what kind of mischief

56
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,833
are you getting into
this time, Louis?

57
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,791
Just the usual stuff. You
know... cleaning my room;

58
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,541
reading a book,
doing some shopping;

59
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,208
Maybe take a few dance lessons
and watch all the TV shows

60
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,875
I've been recording; and, oh,
did I say cleaning my room?

61
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,125
Well, I guess that
should take about a year.

62
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,125
So Bruce, why don't you ever
bother taking any time off?

63
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,291
What's up
with that?

64
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,166
There's nothing that
I really want to do.

65
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,458
Oh, bologna. It's just
that once you're an officer-

66
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,541
there's never enough time.
You may not realize it

67
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,333
but our own Captain Bulge has
never taken any time off

68
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,083
except for
a single day.

69
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,916
Well, that doesn't
make any sense to me!

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,541
Why wouldn't you
take any time off

71
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,625
when you're entitled to
it? That's ridiculous!

72
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:55,041
Emergency! The 134 Express is
stuck in the Melbiunous Zone

73
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,083
of the Ulysses
Planetary System!

74
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,541
Sirius Platoon dispatch and
head for the scene immediately!

75
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,041
Today's menu was
extraordinary as always.

76
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,416
Simply
delicious.

77
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,541
Why don't you two
take the afternoon off?

78
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,583
Going shopping for more
interesting foods again, aye?

79
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,416
You're right. I'm always
trying to improve our menu.

80
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,416
Oh, no. What you're
serving's just fine.

81
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,208
But it's just that
I'm never satisfied

82
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:32,291
with serving the same
old things. Huh?

83
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:36,625
That's odd- It's too early
for the regular train...

84
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:40,625
You're right. And the whistle
doesn't sound familiar, either.

85
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,333
This is
Manabu.

86
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,291
I've just finished
escorting 45 passengers

87
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,666
to the Cornelia
Royal Hotel.

88
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,041
Bruce here, Captain. I've
completed my final run

89
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,750
to the Garden
Palace Hotel;

90
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,000
that's 90 passengers
in all, Sir.

91
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,416
Good work...

92
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,666
Now I'd like you all to
remain where you are for now.

93
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,000
When the back-up
train arrives

94
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,333
return the passengers
to the station.

95
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,750
Aw, Captain!

96
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,791
You have to take the
easy missions, too!

97
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,625
It's all part
of the job!

98
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,541
Captain?
What?

99
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,375
Couldn't've been... All
because of that flower.

100
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,875
Is something
wrong, Captain?

101
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:38,625
It's nothing, Yuki.
Sorry... Just a mistake.

102
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,333
Huh. Doesn't look
like anyone's here...

103
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,500
Did you find a place
that looked open?

104
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,333
Nope!

105
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,666
Man, I'm
starving...

106
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,875
At least they were nice
enough to leave a note...

107
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:01,916
Be back soon... I say we wait
here. This place looks good.

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,708
Who knows when they'll
really come back?

109
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,541
Look... Maybe we
should just move on?

110
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,041
Thank you so
much for waiting!

111
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,625
Oh, well we're
glad we did!

112
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,541
Your place looks great!
We're really hungry.

113
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,500
Yeah...
It's okay.

114
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,208
It couldn't be helped.
Let me get the door.

115
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,208
See? We didn't have
to wait after all.

116
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,500
Can you believe the
Captain calls this work?

117
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,708
No kidding. No wonder he
doesn't need a vacation.

118
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,333
Oh, well. We might as
well make the most of it.

119
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,625
Look!

120
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,083
Hmm? Well,
wha'd'ya know?

121
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:55,250
Hi, Wataru!

122
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,208
Oh! Sorry
to interrupt!

123
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,541
Couldn't this wait
'til later, Bulge?

124
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,291
Perhaps I overestimated
you, Captain.

125
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,333
Acting like this in a public
place where everyone can see!

126
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,458
And you; a
married man!

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,916
The Procyon Spatiotemporal
Accident? I know it well.

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,375
It's considered to be
the biggest disaster

129
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,250
in Railways
history.

130
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,125
Yes. Miss
Catalina here

131
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,333
is the sole survivor
from that accident.

132
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,458
That's why she still comes
to see me from time to time.

133
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,625
I came here to tell Captain
Yuuki that I graduated.

134
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,291
I-I had
no idea...

135
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,916
I'm sorry that I was
rude to you earlier.

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,125
I understand how it
might've seemed to you.

137
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,375
I think you're
forgiven, Bulge.

138
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,916
I recall reading the official
report on the accident...

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,625
The survivor was
quite young.

140
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,791
Yes, I was 10 years
old when it happened.

141
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,500
What a brave girl...

142
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,625
And you've grown up to be
such a beautiful woman.

143
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,833
I never thought
the day would come

144
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,583
that I'd see you look
a woman in the eye

145
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,416
and give her a
compliment, Bulge.

146
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,833
Well... You see... it's
just that... uh...

147
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,583
It's okay. I
understand. Well done.

148
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,083
Captain! Please!
It's not funny!

149
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,833
Despite the fact that this
fellow's a little rough

150
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:15,666
around the edges, he's still
one of the SDF's finest.

151
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,000
In fact he's quite
serious about his job.

152
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,000
He'll make a good
Captain someday.

153
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,833
I don't think anything scares
First Officer Bulge except,

154
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,875
perhaps, being alone
with a beautiful woman.

155
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,750
Captain. Have
some mercy.

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh... I
almost forgot.

157
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,500
There's something I need to
take care of at Headquarters.

158
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,541
I'm sure you
two understand.

159
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,291
And congratulations!

160
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:43,208
Thank you! It was nice
seeing you again, Captain.

161
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,666
Take care of
things, Bulge.

162
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,958
Ah, right... 
Will do, Captain.

163
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,666
So, Mr. Bulge, tell me:
why did you join the SDF?

164
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,458
Huh...? Oh,
yes... Of course.

165
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,041
Well, ever since
I was a child,

166
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,958
it was my dream
to join up.

167
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,208
Something big
happened back then.

168
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,041
It left an
impression on me.

169
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,458
What was that?

170
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:26,416
It was a terrible
accident; involving you.

171
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,000
The reports said that there
would be no survivors.

172
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,125
But then word came that an
SDF member rescued a girl,

173
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,083
injuring himself
in the process.

174
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,791
His heroism made
an impression on me.

175
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,333
And that's
why you joined.

176
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,958
I never knew who
that SDF member was.

177
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:47,083
I didn't find out
until a few hours ago.

178
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:51,583
That very same day... I lost
both my parents and my brother.

179
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,083
But... if the accident
had never happened...

180
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm not sure if I'd have
discovered my own life's work.

181
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,708
The accident really
did that...? I get it!

182
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,250
It's a medical
related job!

183
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,083
And now you've just
graduated from med school!

184
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,583
No... I'm afraid
that's not it.

185
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,375
Huh?

186
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,208
At first I couldn't overcome
the shock of the accident.

187
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,708
I stopped eating and
became anorexic.

188
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,291
Wataru... I mean,
Captain Yuuki,

189
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,541
helped me to
understand my situation.

190
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:20,791
Do you know that
your mommy and daddy

191
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,583
are watching
you right now,

192
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,458
praying that you'll
get well soon?

193
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,791
They want you to start
eating again, Catalina.

194
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,125
So you'll
get strong.

195
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,875
At first, everything I ate
tasted like the sand...

196
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,458
But gradually I started
to enjoy the taste

197
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,791
of all
sorts of food.

198
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:40,958
That's when
it happened.

199
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,291
That's when I found
my calling in life.

200
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,791
You see, it was food that
gave me my strength back.

201
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,583
It was so clear to me; I
wanted to help other people

202
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,166
gain strength and
health in their lives

203
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,833
by serving wholesome,
delicious food.

204
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,333
That's why I became a
chef... Isn't that strange?

205
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:02,041
No... I don't think
it's strange at all.

206
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,708
So, is that what you wanted
to tell the Captain today?

207
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:06,958
Yes.

208
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,333
Would you like me
to tell him for you?

209
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,291
No. But thanks.

210
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:15,833
But, um...

211
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,583
Yes?

212
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,500
Well... If it's
all right with you...

213
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,625
could I... Could I call
you from time to time?

214
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:40,458
This is great! Dee-lish! Hey,
can I try some of yours?

215
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:44,416
Wait!! Where'd
you get your manners?

216
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,875
You're acting strange,
Manabu... What's up?

217
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,875
It's like you're
nervous or something.

218
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,708
What?! Why would I be
nervous? That's ridiculous!

219
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,125
You're acting
like a teenager

220
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,125
taking his girlfriend out
to eat for the first time.

221
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,583
Forgive me for interrupting.
But I was wondering

222
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,333
if you're somehow
related to Wataru Yuuki.

223
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:06,291
Oh! Yes, ma'am.
I'm Wataru's son.

224
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,750
Yes, I
knew it.

225
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,875
So you must've
known my father...

226
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,791
This is quite
a coincidence.

227
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,458
Your father must
certainly be proud

228
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,916
that you've taken
his old job.

229
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,166
Oh... No...

230
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,250
I haven't made it to
the rank of Captain yet.

231
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,875
Manabu, I think
you're blushing!

232
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,125
Well... If it isn't you,
then who is Captain?

233
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Here
ya go!

234
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,458
Don't worry this one's on
me... for all your hard work.

235
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,458
Much obliged.

236
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:43,666
You don't say? Good ol'
Schwanheld Bulge, huh?

237
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:54,083
I'm so glad that
you're still safe.

238
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,583
You know, you may not
be so lucky next time.

239
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,916
I'll be fine.
Besides, don't forget

240
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,416
all of my duties are
not that dangerous.

241
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,583
I'm sorry, Schwanheld... It's
just that I couldn't bear...

242
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:11,500
Catalina...

243
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,125
Hey... You know
there's a restaurant

244
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,458
I've wanted to
go to with you.

245
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,166
So...
Let's go.

246
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,666
That'll
be great.

247
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,750
Don't
answer it!

248
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,125
But it might
be an emergency.

249
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,791
There's never enough
time, is there?

250
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,375
Sorry,
Catalina.

251
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,916
Thank you.

252
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,416
Listen dear...
That was Catalina.

253
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,750
She said she'd like to
discuss the new catering menu

254
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,041
with us before
we leave.

255
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:44,666
Talk about being
committed to a job!

256
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,541
There's something that
I'd like you to have.

257
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,791
I'm on
Tabito now,

258
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,541
but I'll be leaving soon
to come and see you.

259
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,833
The Express Train bound for
Kleznard will be arriving soon

260
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,250
at Track Number One...
For your safety,

261
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,541
all passengers are required
to wait behind the white line.

262
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,875
Catalina...

263
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,750
So how are things
going back home?

264
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,458
Fine... You know
it's amazing

265
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,958
how fast kids grow
up these days.

266
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,166
It must've been hard
getting called so soon.

267
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,458
You only got to see
them for a few hours.

268
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,125
I'm sure they'll
understand, someday...

269
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,875
But enough about me;
how'd Catalina react?

270
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,375
She had no
choice...

271
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,125
Still, I'm hoping
that she'll understand.

272
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,125
Life's tough
sometimes, isn't it?

273
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,083
Yes, Sir.
It sure is.

274
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,875
Guess that means
I won the bet.

275
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,250
No way, the
bet's mine.

276
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,500
I'm the one who put
money on his old flame.

277
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,958
Yeah! Right! That
means that I win.

278
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,291
How's
that work?

279
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,041
'Cuz what went down wasn't
with his old flame.

280
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,833
How can you
be sure?

281
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,708
He's not
coming back!

282
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,625
I've got one day off. No
matter what happens out there,

283
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,041
I'll be back to see
you. I promise.

284
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,833
Schwanheld, I knew the
next time I saw you,

285
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,833
you'd be coming
to say good-bye.

286
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,750
You've lost Wataru and
you've seen his wife suffer

287
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,416
and you'd tell me that
you don't want me

288
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,083
to experience
that same pain;

289
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,583
the pain that I felt when I
lost my family as a girl.

290
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:05,666
I thought I'd save you the
trouble. Goodbye, my love.

291
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,291
Wait. I thought you should
know; I proposed to her.

292
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,625
Unlike you, I'll always
be there for her.

293
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,625
She deserves that...

294
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:18,125
She needs someone to help
make her dream come true.

295
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,125
Her dream...?

296
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:28,750
I wish you both
the very best.

297
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,041
Come in.
Have a seat.

298
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:17,166
Man, was
she beautiful.

299
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,750
He has a crush on
another man's girl.

300
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,750
You might as well
give it up, Manabu...

301
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,500
You haven't got a chance.
She's already spoken for.

302
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,833
Oh, yeah?
Who is it?

303
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,583
I don't know who
specifically.

304
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,583
I just know that she's
in love with someone;

305
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,250
someone in
outer space.

306
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,708
And how do you
know that, Louis?

307
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,333
Because I'm a
woman. That's how.

308
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,958
Hey! I've got a
vacation to plan for!

309
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,791
And Captain, won't you
please take a vacation soon?

310
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,750
David and Bruce said
they're scared to ask

311
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,791
because you
never take one.

312
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:48,833
Uhhh...

313
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,333
We didn't
say that.

314
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,416
Don't blame it on me... 
If you want one take one.

315
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes, Sir!

316
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,500
Maybe it's time I
take a vacation, too.

317
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,583
[Narrator] It's possible
that the flower

318
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,250
that blooms in our
heart may wither;

319
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,333
but it will
never die...

320
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,000
Nourished by the thousands
of emotions and feelings

321
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,708
which flow thru
our heart,

322
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,791
it lives and
blossoms forever.

323
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,625
Next time we have to
evacuate a planet

324
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,250
that's about to be
destroyed by a nearby star.

325
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,625
But one stubborn old lady
isn't about to leave!

326
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,125
She's so convinced
that I'm her lost son

327
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,125
that even we start to
wonder if she's right.

328
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,500
But there's more to this
old lady that meets the eye.

329
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,833
See ya next time
on The Railways!
