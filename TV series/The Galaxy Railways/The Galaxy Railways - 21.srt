1
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,791
Kowloon-a city
that is infamous

2
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,625
for being one of the most
dangerous places in the Galaxy.

3
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:23,458
No one dares go close to
this lawless metropolis.

4
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:27,500
Kowloon is also known
by another name;

5
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:31,416
it is often called the
Labyrinth of Death.

6
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:09,250
Why? Why can't I see
the flow of time?

7
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,458
Why can't I
see our Fate?

8
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,208
[Sayaka] Receiving a weak
distress signal

9
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,583
from the
City of Kowloon!

10
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,875
It's an SDF signal requesting
an emergency rescue!

11
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,375
But that's impossible,
Commander.

12
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,875
There aren't
any SDF trains

13
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,708
on duty in that area
right now, Sir.

14
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,625
Find out who's
sending that signal!

15
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,375
Dispatch Sirius
Platoon!

16
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,375
System Check!

17
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,708
System Check
standby!

18
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,041
Sub-atomic Warp
Generator ready!

19
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,375
Magnetic Barrier
Generator is a go!

20
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,375
Orbit Network
Radar ready!

21
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,708
Big One is now in
take-off position!

22
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,708
Atomic Boiler
pressure is a go!

23
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,833
The Main Circuit
is now online!

24
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,708
All energy levels
ready for take-off!

25
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,708
The Warp-drive coupling
in now in place!

26
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:54,875
All systems green,
Captain Bulge!

27
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,583
Awaiting your
command, Sir!

28
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,750
Let's move out!
Ahead full!

29
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,750
[Bulge] Listen up,
Sirius Platoon:

30
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,416
General Ivanov from the
Secret Intelligence Division

31
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,250
is coming with us
on this mission.

32
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,250
[Louis] But why
Secret Intelligence?

33
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,208
That info is on a
need to know basis...

34
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:28,833
And none of you on
this train need to know.

35
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,125
Let me be clear. I'm not
asking for your cooperation.

36
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,833
I'm demanding it.

37
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:42,041
Transmission of SDF
Signal confirmed, Sir.

38
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,958
It's definitely
a rescue signal.

39
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,791
It's coming from the Southern
part of Kowloon City.

40
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,791
David. Land by
that signal.

41
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:53,291
Never mind that! Land
away from the signal!

42
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,333
Did you hear
what I said?

43
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,375
Yes, Sir...
Taking her down

44
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,166
in the Southwest
sector of Kowloon.

45
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,875
[Louis] The nerve
of that guy!

46
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,625
Who does he think
he is anyway?!

47
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,000
Did you see the way he
treated the Captain?

48
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,541
I couldn't
believe it!

49
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,541
I wanted to punch
him in the face!

50
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,666
Louis.

51
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,916
What is it?!

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,125
He can hear
what you're saying.

53
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,333
You liar! It's off!
How dare you!

54
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,833
Don't ever do
that to me again.

55
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:36,208
Haha. I know exactly how
you feel, Louis.

56
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,041
That guy's definitely
an S.O.B...

57
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,208
But don't let your
mind be distracted

58
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,333
by your emotions
while you're on duty.

59
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,833
You can get
killed that way.

60
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,833
Right. Thanks, Bruce.

61
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,416
I wonder what Ivanov
is doing here anyway.

62
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,875
What's so special
about this mission?

63
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,500
I don't know...

64
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:57,833
But it must be serious for the
Secret Intelligence Division

65
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,500
to barge in
like this.

66
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:04,416
One thing's for sure...
We're about to find out.

67
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,208
It's definitely
coming from here.

68
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,083
This is SDF
Sirius Platoon!

69
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,916
We've come to help!
Is anyone in here?!

70
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,666
SDF...

71
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,083
Who are you?

72
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,666
I am...

73
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,375
Captain. Come in.

74
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,208
It's her.

75
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,708
Yes, the same alien who
invaded Headquarters...

76
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,208
Search her for
explosives immediately!

77
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,791
They're about the
size of a fist!

78
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,833
They look like
large plant seeds!

79
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,291
Find any?

80
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,125
No. She's all clear.

81
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,125
Hmmm...

82
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,958
If they're trapped,
they'll do anything to escape.

83
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,625
They've killed many
of my subordinates.

84
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,458
So you've had
prior contact.

85
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,458
You two kids,
go outside!

86
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,375
Make sure none of her
buddies are around.

87
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,791
You other two stay
with the alien.

88
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,333
There's no need to show
mercy if she puts up a fight

89
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,041
but don't kill her.
I want her alive.

90
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,208
We can't get
information from a corpse.

91
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,833
Plenty of orders
but no explanations.

92
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,250
Are you
feeling okay?

93
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,916
Please! You must help
us! I beg of you!

94
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,833
[Ivanov] Bring her in.

95
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,500
She can plead her case
to Secret Intelligence.

96
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,208
Listen to me, please!
My name's Liffle!

97
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,541
I came from
Istarion;

98
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,833
the 42nd Planet in
the Alfort Galaxy!

99
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,166
[Ivanov] Shut up!!

100
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,500
Come on now.
If you're gonna lie,

101
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,166
you're going to have to
do a better job than that.

102
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,833
Or maybe you
can tell me why

103
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,750
I've never heard of a
Galaxy named Alfort.

104
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:32,000
It doesn't exist in this
Universe. That's why.

105
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,291
Please...
Let me show you.

106
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:42,500
This is my home...
Planet Istarion.

107
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:46,250
I come from a Universe that
exists outside of your own.

108
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,833
Like your Universe,
ours is very beautiful.

109
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,000
My home
planet, Istarion,

110
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,625
is renowned for its remarkable
scientific technology...

111
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,916
peaceful technology
that was used

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,208
to enhance the
quality of life.

113
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,083
Mother!
Look up in the sky!

114
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,458
What are
they, Liffle?

115
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:12,916
I don't know. They look
like... battleships!

116
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,083
The ships were from the
Alfort Galactic Empire.

117
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,041
They threatened to destroy
our planet and people...

118
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,750
They said the only way
we could stop them

119
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,500
is if our scientists did
exactly what they were told.

120
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,333
We had no choice
but to cooperate.

121
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,250
At this very moment my
colleagues are being forced

122
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,958
to make weapons for their
Empire... If they don't...

123
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,916
their children and everything
they love will be destroyed.

124
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,083
Now, those same weapons that my
colleagues are manufacturing

125
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,458
are about to be
used against you.

126
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,250
This Universe is
facing the same crisis

127
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,166
that our planet did.

128
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,750
You have to try to stop them!
You people have armaments!

129
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,166
We didn't! We had no
choice but to surrender

130
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,083
and do what
we were told!

131
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,458
And now we've made
them great weapons.

132
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,583
There's no way that you
can defeat them in battle.

133
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,083
Unless...

134
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,541
Unless you use this.

135
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,458
This Cosmo Matrix
is my invention.

136
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,333
It can greatly amplify the
strength of your weapons.

137
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,333
[Ivanov] That's a convincing
lie you've concocted.

138
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,083
Don't take us for a
bunch of amateurs.

139
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,916
I know your intentions.
You plan to gain our trust

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,458
by giving us
false information

141
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,416
so you can study
our operation

142
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,750
and leak it back
to your people.

143
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,000
That's not
true! I swear!

144
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,625
Do you mind if I
take a look at that?

145
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,833
Hey, Captain. It does
resemble a storage chip

146
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,333
but I can't tell without using
the ship's computers...

147
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,333
Should I return to
Big One, Sir?

148
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,916
[Ivanov] You fool!
You'll do no such thing!

149
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,333
Did it ever occur to you
that they can gain access

150
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,750
to the SDF's main computer
through Big One's computer?!

151
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,208
Use your brain!

152
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,333
But if we don't
analyze the chip,

153
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,041
how are we gonna know if she's
telling the truth or not?!

154
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,416
[Ivanov] You won't.
That's none of your concern.

155
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,333
The Secret
Intelligence Division

156
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,958
will be the
judge of that.

157
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,000
If you don't believe
me you'll all die!

158
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,083
We only have a
little time left.

159
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,541
Soon a Dimension Hole will
open up between our Universes

160
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,833
and the invasion will begin.
Then it will be too late.

161
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:29,000
We refuse to be manipulated
by your false information.

162
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,583
General Ivanov... Perhaps
we shouldn't automatically

163
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,541
assume that she's
lying to us.

164
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:38,500
When I want your advice,
I'll ask for it. Captain!!

165
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,208
I'm trying to help!

166
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,458
You can help by obeying
my orders, Bulge.

167
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,708
You must
believe me!

168
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,041
There is still a chance
to save your people!

169
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,208
I don't think that the
images she showed us

170
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,125
were manipulated
in any way.

171
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,875
I wasn't able to detect any
tampering or alterations.

172
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,833
[Ivanov] Those images
prove nothing!

173
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:04,416
Why don't you
believe me?!

174
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,666
There are millions
of lives at stake!

175
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,166
Look out!!

176
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,541
Now! Take cover! Go!

177
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,208
Manabu!

178
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,750
Coming!

179
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,458
They're trying to kill
Liffle all right.

180
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,125
Does that mean that
she's telling the truth?

181
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,416
Well, I'd say that
there's two possibilities.

182
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,166
One is that they're
trying to execute Liffle

183
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,958
because she's really
trying to help us.

184
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,875
What's the other one?!

185
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,041
They're staging
this chase

186
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,833
to make us believe she's
telling the truth.

187
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,083
They're freakin'
everywhere!

188
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,916
David! Turn at the
next corner and stop!

189
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,916
Roger that!

190
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,958
I'll buy
some time!

191
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,000
You guys get
back to Big One

192
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,208
and prepare for emergency
take-off! I'll be there!

193
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,708
Whoa! Bruce has his
bazooka! He's serious!

194
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,208
I'm staying
with you!

195
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:04,333
I'll be fine! You go on! Help
them get back to Big One!

196
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,916
Manabu! Hurry up!

197
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,875
This is all my
fault. I'm sorry.

198
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,041
Yuuki! Go!!

199
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,250
Mother!! No!!

200
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,875
Manabu!

201
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,500
Liffle!

202
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,583
Liffle.

203
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:47,500
Please... don't worry.
I'm just glad you're okay.

204
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,875
What's the
situation?

205
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,708
Kowloon's teeming
with aliens!

206
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,041
Bruce was buying us time!
He's still out there!

207
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:13,583
Emergency take-off
green! Initiating now!

208
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,166
Bruce! Get back to Big
One! We're taking off!

209
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,791
Bruce!! Come on!

210
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,666
The coordinates of
the Dimension Hole.

211
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,916
In the Cosmo
Matrix... Please.

212
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,083
No, don't talk! You need
to get your strength back!

213
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:01,833
Promise that you won't lose it.
It's your only hope.

214
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,958
They're still
after us!

215
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,833
Take care of her!
They're attacking!

216
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,458
Arm the Main Battery!
Prepare to intercept!

217
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,875
Captain! The enemy
fighters are retreating!

218
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,375
I don't like this.

219
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,125
Direct hit!
Hangar Coach damaged!

220
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,166
They're the same.

221
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,291
All right!
Now it's your turn!

222
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,958
Direct hit!
N-No effect!

223
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,541
Link all Main Batteries!
Fire simultaneously!

224
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,416
Direct hit,
Captain!

225
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,875
No effect!
Enemy ship undamaged!

226
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:16,500
Unless you use this.
It amplifies weapons strength.

227
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,708
It's your
only hope.

228
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,041
Captain! Liffle's
Cosmo Matrix!

229
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,583
It's the only way
to fight back!

230
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,208
Absolutely not!

231
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,375
You're incompetent. Can't
you see this is all a plot?

232
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,625
They want us to panic
and use that device

233
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,125
so they can
gain access

234
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:38,250
to all our vital information...
She's a terrorist spy.

235
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,041
You're wrong! She's
telling the truth!

236
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,041
She took a
bullet for me!

237
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,208
Hmm! You're out of line!

238
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,208
Direct hit!
Second battery coach!

239
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,250
How far are we from
the Warp Zone?!

240
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,250
Point five
mega-meters, Captain!

241
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,083
Big One is sixty-five
percent damaged, Sir!

242
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,875
We'll never make
it! Please, Captain!

243
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,333
All right then.

244
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,916
How dare you, Bulge! You're
disobeying a direct or...

245
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,416
I'm sorry. But I have
to do what's best

246
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,250
for the welfare of
my crew, General.

247
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,250
They're my
responsibility.

248
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,958
I must go.

249
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:14,916
Go where?

250
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,583
To the bridge...

251
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,416
Help me...
Or we'll die.

252
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,416
Error! Damn! Not again!
What am I doing wrong?!

253
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,958
[Liffle] It's okay.
I can help. I'll show you.

254
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,333
Liffle!

255
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,583
You're mad! We can't let
a prisoner on the bridge!

256
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,333
Get her out!!

257
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,208
[Ivanov] This is treason!

258
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,416
You're jeopardizing the
safety of our Galaxy!

259
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,833
I'll have your
jobs for this!

260
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,833
[Liffle] There.
It's uploading now.

261
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,916
The computer has
accepted the Cosmo Matrix!

262
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,458
Atomic Boiler Pressure
increasing rapidly!

263
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,583
It's in the red
zone, Captain!!

264
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,083
Rotation Speed reaching
critical levels!

265
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,125
Divert All Energy to
the Main Battery!

266
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,833
Lock all gun-ports
on enemy ship!

267
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,708
Turning guns! All Gun Ports
are locked on target!!

268
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,625
All guns! Open fire!!

269
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,875
Liffle! It worked! Yuki!

270
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,208
Lay her down!

271
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,833
Help her!

272
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:52,500
Hello, Mother... And Trille,
my sister, you've come to.

273
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,500
[Manabu] Liffle!
Don't die!

274
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,541
Captain! We're losing
power! I can't stop it!

275
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,083
Weapon Systems down!

276
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,333
The Main Circuit's
off-line! It's fried!

277
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:16,791
They're attacking, Captain!

278
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,041
Energy decreased by 30%!

279
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,541
How far to the Warp Zone?!

280
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,791
At our current
speed; forty seconds!

281
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,250
Divert all available
power to the engine!

282
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,291
Warp Zone in
twenty seconds!

283
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,583
Engage Warp Engines
the instant we enter!

284
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,916
Incoming
seeker missiles!

285
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,416
It's damaged, Sir! I can't
enter the coordinates!

286
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,000
Go ahead! Do it now!

287
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,333
You're mad! Without coordinates
we could hit something and die!

288
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,291
If we don't try
we'll die anyway!

289
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,291
Louis!!

290
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,625
Emergency Warp!!

291
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,583
I can't see anything. I
can't do anything to help.

292
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:12,250
An opportunity will arise.
We must keep trying.

293
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:16,083
All I see is darkness.
The lights are vanishing.

294
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:24,583
No, it can't be...
Shula... we must fight.

295
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,583
It seems that Destiny
itself has derailed

296
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,500
from its
appointed track.

297
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,208
The future of the
Universe is now careening

298
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,000
into the darkness
like a runaway train.

299
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:39,583
What will happen? Where will
it end up? Nobody knows.

300
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,791
After an
emergency warp,

301
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,583
Big One is forced
to crash land

302
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,333
and I'm hanging
on by a thread!

303
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,750
While Bruce and Manabu
race to save my life

304
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,166
some of the
other Platoons

305
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,375
engage the Alfort
Destroyer in battle!

306
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,000
Looks like the
war has begun!

307
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,125
See ya next time
on the Railways!
