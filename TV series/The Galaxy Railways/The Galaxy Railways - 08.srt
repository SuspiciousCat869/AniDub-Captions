1
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:07,875
Are machines alive? Do they
have souls? Of course not.

2
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:11,666
And yet there is an
unmistakable feeling of sadness

3
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,958
when one of our metal
companions meets its end.

4
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,333
They serve us; and
we depend on them.

5
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:23,250
It is this relationship that
creates an inexplicable bond.

6
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,708
Fantastic. The
future of our Galaxy

7
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,291
is in the hands of
a punk like this.

8
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:38,375
Hey, Kid... Battle stations!
We're under attack!!

9
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,625
Where are
they?! ...Huh?

10
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,166
If you were
awake, you'd know.

11
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,125
Uhhm. Sorry.
I was all finished.

12
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,500
I must have
dosed off.

13
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,041
Finished, huh? We'll
see about that.

14
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,916
This, bolt's
loose!

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,125
There's hundreds
of 'em.

16
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,416
And each one
has a purpose;

17
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,250
which is to keep guys
like you alive!!

18
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,875
Now check the
other bolts!!

19
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,416
All of 'em?!

20
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,708
Whitman really loves dressing
down SDF brats! Doesn't he?!

21
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,625
I've seen that kid
down here before.

22
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,333
This isn't his first time.
He must get in trouble a lot.

23
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,125
Well, after taking Train
Maintenance 101 from Whitman

24
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,958
a few more times he'll learn
the value of behaving.

25
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,833
Look! He's already got his
tail between his legs!

26
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:33,375
Guarding a train for rich
people; what an assignment.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,041
It's right
over there.

28
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,333
Thanks.

29
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:45,583
Manabu's lucky he
missed this assignment.

30
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,000
Can I
help you?

31
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,583
You're an SDF! I
see you guys on TV!

32
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:53,000
TV? I see... This is a
big place to be all alone.

33
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,125
Where's your
Mom at? Huh?

34
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,375
Charlie!

35
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,666
Is that
your Mom?

36
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,541
Uh, huh.

37
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,000
You'd better go
protect her.

38
00:03:59,083 --> 00:03:59,958
Right!
See ya!

39
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,208
Alrighty, mate.

40
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,375
Pegasus... you,
the beautiful one

41
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:23,125
that gallops through the air;
your wings will be broken

42
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,333
and you will be
covered with soil.

43
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:36,625
Every bolt? That old codger has
a few screws loose himself...

44
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,333
I heard that! ...You
might want to check,

45
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,708
behind you every
now and then.

46
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,333
Listen, Kid. I'll keep
this simple for you.

47
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,250
Each train has
its own character.

48
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,500
Unless you know which
parts tend to come loose,

49
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,208
you can't work as a mechanic.
And until you know that,

50
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,333
the only way to find out
is to check each bolt.

51
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,125
Look, I'm an officer. I'm
just here for training.

52
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,666
No... You're here because
you lack discipline

53
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,500
like most
kids your age.

54
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,375
All I'm saying that
I'm not a mechanic!

55
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,166
I don't want to know
everything about trains.

56
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,666
I see. You wanna fly 'em. And
you want to do battle in 'em.

57
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,625
But you don't want to know
how they work. Is that it?

58
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,625
Now get busy...
Every bolt.

59
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,083
Go on...

60
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,375
Crazy old coot. I've been
around trains my whole life.

61
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,583
My Dad was
a Captain.

62
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,625
I never saw him with
a wrench in his hand.

63
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,958
Wow. What
a classic.

64
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,333
What's this baby doing
in a scrap yard?

65
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,666
She's in mint condition. Should
be in a museum or something...

66
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,958
There's not a speck of dirt
on it. This is amazing.

67
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,500
Hey! What was
that for?!

68
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,083
Keep your filthy
hands off that train.

69
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,000
I didn't even touch
it! All I did was look!

70
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,750
Well, go look
somewhere else.

71
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,041
Why are you giving me
grief over this thing?!

72
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,500
It's an
old train!

73
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,958
It's just going to
be scrapped anyway!

74
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,916
Are you crazy?!
What are you doing?!

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,750
I didn't do anything
to deserve this!

76
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,750
Tell you what. You can
have a free shot. Go ahead.

77
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:34,916
No. Let go of me! I've
had enough of this!

78
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,000
No, I'm serious! She's
dating a Mongoran!

79
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,166
You look a little worse for
the wear there, young man.

80
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,208
Did a train
hit ya?

81
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,625
You could
say that.

82
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,625
Ha! You must have touched
the Eight-twenty-five!

83
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,666
Whitman's baby!
That's dangerous!

84
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,583
Don't take it personal, Son...
He's obsessed with that train.

85
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,208
The Eight-twenty-five
was the first train

86
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,416
ever assigned to Whitman
as a young mechanic.

87
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,375
If you think it's shiny now
you should have seen it then.

88
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:10,291
He had it so polished you could
see your reflection in it.

89
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,458
He was probably the
happiest man on Rosamund

90
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,958
until he lost his sister
when the asteroid hit.

91
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,625
I brought you lunch!
Can you take a break?

92
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,625
Yeah!
Sure!

93
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,666
At that time the
mines were booming

94
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,916
and Whitman was
going back and forth

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,458
to Destiny Station
carrying magnetic ore.

96
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,458
The asteroid came as
a complete surprise.

97
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,833
It destroyed half
of the planet.

98
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,750
Whitman was on an ore run
when the asteroid hit.

99
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,875
When he got back everything
he knew was gone...

100
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,500
his sister, his
parents, his house,

101
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:50,208
the mine, Rosamund
station-all gone.

102
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,458
The only thing that he
held dear in life

103
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:56,333
that wasn't destroyed was
the Eight-twenty-five.

104
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,333
Now you can see why
Whitman's so sensitive

105
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,583
about that old locomotive.
The Eight-twenty-five is more

106
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,750
than just another
train to Whitman;

107
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:07,958
it's the last link he has to
a life that he once loved.

108
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,125
But now, even that's
about to change.

109
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,083
Time doesn't wait for
anybody, especially the old.

110
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,541
The Eight-twenty-five
is on death row-

111
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,916
it's scheduled to be
scrapped tomorrow.

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,375
So hang in
there, kid!

113
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,458
...Please don't take what
old Whitman does to heart.

114
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,250
He doesn't mean anything
by it. I promise.

115
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,833
[Announcement] Good evening
passengers, we are now entering

116
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,166
the beautiful Magnetic
Caverns of Planet Rosamund.

117
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,166
In the past, these caverns were
mined for rare magnetic ores.

118
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,625
The exquisite colors in the
caverns' rock formations

119
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,750
are from the ore itself.
If you listen closely,

120
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,291
you can hear the mystic,
subterranean rhythms

121
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:09,083
created by the dripping
water and the magnetic ore.

122
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:20,958
Please enjoy
the ride.

123
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,375
That's
unusual.

124
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,458
Damnit!! The Magnetic
Shield has been breached!

125
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,208
Mommy!!

126
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,375
[Announcement]
Attention, passengers.

127
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,000
We have encountered severe
magnetic interference.

128
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,416
We are correcting
the problem

129
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,333
and we should be
underway again shortly.

130
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,333
Man! Thank
goodness!

131
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,916
This is the
Pegasus Express!

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,791
We have encountered
a Magnetic Avalanche

133
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,041
in the caves
of Rosamund!

134
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,000
We are now adrift
without controls.

135
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,916
Please send
some help!

136
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,916
Emergency Transmission
from Pegasus Express!

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,458
Their systems are down!
Communications lost!

138
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,041
Dispatch Sirius Platoon!
Get them in the air now!

139
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,375
Yes,
Commander!

140
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,583
Sirius Platoon! The
Pegasus Express has been hit

141
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,166
by a Magnetic Avalanche!
All systems are down!

142
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,500
Communications
have been lost!

143
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,916
Proceed to
Rosamund immediately!

144
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,625
That's
Whitman's planet.

145
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,958
I repeat! The Pegasus
Express is adrift

146
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,666
in the Magnetic Caves of
Rosumund. All systems are down!

147
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,125
Communications
have been lost!

148
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,666
Sirius Platoon
dispatch immediately!

149
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,666
All systems green,
Captain Bulge!

150
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,000
Awaiting your
command, Sir!

151
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,958
Let's move out!
Ahead full!

152
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,375
Hey! Have you seen
Whitman around?!

153
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,541
He's probably on the
Eight-twenty-five.

154
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,875
Thanks!

155
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,916
Easy now... not as
young as you used to be.

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,208
I'm not either,
old friend.

157
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,666
We're flying one
last time, Audrey.

158
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,250
This mission's for you.
Well, let's do it, old timer!

159
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,833
Mister
Whitman!

160
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,583
No way...

161
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,791
[Announcer] Number
Eight-twenty-five,

162
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,250
you are now on
a direct path

163
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,333
to Destiny's main ascending
launch. Stop immediately.

164
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,250
You do not have
clearance to take-off.

165
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,750
Whitman!
Wait!!

166
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,166
Hey!
What the-

167
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,125
I'll be damned...

168
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,583
[Buldge] The Pegasus
is located here-

169
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,208
about one fourth of the way
into the Magnetic Cavern.

170
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,125
We'll be entering the
cave in just a moment

171
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,166
and taking the same
route as the Pegasus.

172
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,625
Hopefully, the
magnetic surge

173
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,625
that overloaded their
systems has subsided.

174
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,958
I'm not
so sure.

175
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,250
Our electrical system is
already becoming unstable.

176
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,625
Can we
make it?

177
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,125
We will if our shields
hold but they're magnetic.

178
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,458
They may
get disrupted.

179
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,333
If worse comes to worst
we can always blast a hole

180
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,000
in the side of the cavern and
get the Pegasus out that way.

181
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,666
The Pegasus is
just ahead.

182
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,875
Their communications
are still down.

183
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,333
I can see them
from here.

184
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,791
We just need our shields to
hold a little bit longer.

185
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,041
Now this
is odd.

186
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,541
What is
it, Louis?

187
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:06,625
I'm not picking up any sound
in the cavern. Nothing.

188
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm not picking up any sound
in the cavern. Nothing.

189
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:27,041
It's dead quiet... It's like
the calm before the storm.

190
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,916
Captain! The Pegasus!
It's free falling, Sir!

191
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,583
Our Magnetic Shields
have failed, Captain!

192
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,875
The Main Control
System is down!

193
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,833
Get us out of
here! Now!

194
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:47,208
No! It's too late! The Cruising
System is down, Sir! ...Huh?

195
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,916
What's on your
mind, Bruce?

196
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,041
I'm going to try it
manually, Captain.

197
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:58,166
Bruce!
Wait!

198
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,208
Come on!
Please! Respond!

199
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,833
The Pegasus
is on the move

200
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,875
but her Cruising
System is still down!

201
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,166
She's being propelled by severe
electromagnetic activity!

202
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,500
What about
Big One?

203
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,166
We've lost
communication!

204
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,541
[Yuuki] Big One's down!
The Pegasus is in trouble!

205
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:18,791
[Shitman] I heard! I'm
old, but I'm not deaf!

206
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,916
Whoa! Man! This
baby's got some kick!

207
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,250
[Whitman] Not bad, aye? This
engine was designed to run

208
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,708
at marginal speeds with
a full load of ore.

209
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,458
But without the freight
coaches in tow,

210
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,583
she's got more speed and power
than some of the new rigs.

211
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,041
[Yuuki] Wow! But why
destroy a train like that?

212
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,250
Isn't she supposed to
be scrapped tomorrow?

213
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,416
[Whitman]
Who told you that?

214
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,125
Mister
Akatsuki.

215
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,000
That fool; always
talking too much.

216
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,291
Big One!

217
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,541
Another train?
That's impossible.

218
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,291
Back up wouldn't
get here this soon.

219
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:58,375
Yuuki!

220
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:02,125
I give up!

221
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:06,458
Hey. Why did you come
with me anyway, kid?

222
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,583
After you hit
me, you mean?

223
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,458
...I guess because I knew you
were only trying to help...

224
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,166
And that you were
going out on a limb;

225
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,958
risking your job
and your reputation

226
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,541
for something you believed
in. And that you were going

227
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,458
to be in big trouble
whether it worked or not.

228
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,458
You see: you
remind me of me;

229
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:34,250
except for the old
and cranky part.

230
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,333
Hmm? Hahaha... You're
too much, kid!

231
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,666
You are really something
else! Heh, heh!

232
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,666
Look out!!

233
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:49,208
It's okay! The shields are
holding! We're not dead yet!

234
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,875
The manual over-ride
failed, Sir.

235
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,333
Who went by?

236
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,666
It was Whitman's old rig;
the Eight-twenty-five, Sir.

237
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,250
I see... What about
the Cruising System?

238
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,375
Almost
ready, Sir.

239
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,375
Someone,
help us!

240
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:19,333
Don't worry, Mom. The SDF is
going to rescue us. You'll see!

241
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,833
Not good. The magnetic
activity is increasing.

242
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,875
David, What's
our status?

243
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,708
The Cruising System
has been reinstalled,

244
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,875
and the Sub-Control System
has just stabilized.

245
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,875
We're good
to go, Sir!

246
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,750
All right!
...Let's move!

247
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,916
Yes, Sir!

248
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,125
Yuuki...
Listen to Whitman.

249
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,458
If you work together
you have a chance.

250
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:44,875
Man. That was insane. Mister
Whitman! Are you okay?!

251
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,250
I'm
alright.

252
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,125
Let me take over. You can't
fly in your condition.

253
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,625
These caves are
treacherous, kid...

254
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,875
If you don't know them
they'll eat you alive.

255
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,250
You can guide me then!
Just tell me what to do!

256
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,041
Audrey...

257
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,708
[Yuuki] Is that
your Sister?

258
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,291
Yes... He told you,
didn't he? I lost her.

259
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,250
I lost them all. I was too
late... I was too late.

260
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,083
But not this time. We
gotta get to the Pegasus

261
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,666
before the next magnetic
storm hits! Full throttle!

262
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,875
Rosamund's core has
become unstable!

263
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,666
The computer is
projecting an eruption

264
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,916
that would destroy
half the planet!

265
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,666
Then Big One
is too late.

266
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,166
Our only hope is the
Eight-twenty-five.

267
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,250
There it is! I see the
Pegasus, Mister Whitman!

268
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,750
Stay with her, kid!
You'll only have one chance!

269
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,583
We've got to make
that connection!

270
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,125
Right!!

271
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,083
Can't stop... I have to try
letting go of the passengers!

272
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,625
Mom! Look!
Over there!

273
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Pegasus! This is Freight Train
Number Eight-twenty-five!

274
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,625
We are attempting
to connect to you

275
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,875
with our coupler unit
and take you in tow!!

276
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:08,166
Am I dreaming?!
The 825?!

277
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,000
[Whitman]
Yes! That's it!

278
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,791
Now once the arms are
out pull the Foot Lever!

279
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,458
...That will cause the
Control Lever to pop out

280
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,916
and the rest is just
timing! You can do it, kid!

281
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,333
Don't rush it, Kid! Relax!
You've still got a little time!

282
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,000
Listen to the song
of the engine!

283
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,541
Get in sync
with its rhythm!

284
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,750
The song of the
engine? What's that?

285
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,500
It's the song I grew
up with! Just listen!

286
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,250
You'll hear it!
I promise!

287
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,250
We're closing
the gap!

288
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:50,500
We can do it! We're almost
there! Full speed ahead!

289
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,875
Aah!!
Missed!

290
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,083
We've
got it!!

291
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,916
Great!
Hold on!!

292
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
[Whitman] Come back
in! We're reversing!

293
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,375
Let's get this
baby out of here!

294
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,416
[Yuuki]
Right!

295
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,916
Huh?
Mister Whitman!

296
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:28,000
Are you
okay?!

297
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,750
Hey, Kid.
I wasn't late.

298
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:36,208
Good job, old friend.
We were right on time.

299
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,208
Mister Whitman!

300
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,666
This is
Captain Bulge.

301
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,750
Maintain your speed and
prepare to connect.

302
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,250
Rosamund is
unstable.

303
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,208
It is imperative that
we leave immediately.

304
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,708
Captain! Something's
wrong with Whitman!

305
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,041
Manabu?!

306
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,125
Please! Somebody!
...Help Whitman!

307
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,416
...H-He's not breathing!
...Somebody, help us! Please!

308
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,000
Ready!
...Fire!

309
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Mister
Whitman...

310
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,166
Tighten those
bolts, kid!

311
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,250
That's what old Whitman would
have been saying all right!

312
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,125
I wish I could say that
I'm sad, but I'm not...

313
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,583
You see, Whitman was
at the helm of the 825

314
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:56,125
saving lives when he passed...
He was living his dream, Son.

315
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,791
You were right on time.
Like clockwork...

316
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,791
You saved them all,
Mister Whitman;

317
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,916
every one of them...
you and your Old Friend.

318
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:15,583
It's the 825,
Mom! Look!

319
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,000
Sometimes the failures
and disappointments

320
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,916
of our past are but
building blocks-

321
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,916
stepping stones that give us
the drive and determination

322
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,041
we need to succeed
in the future.

323
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:29,208
The heroic rescue on Rosamund
by a man and his old friend

324
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:33,083
will be talked about
for many years to come.

325
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,541
On the next Galaxy Railways
we meet a mythical being

326
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,250
that has the power to
steal memories from people.

327
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,708
And when Bruce has some painful
memories from his past taken,

328
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,750
he becomes a new man. But
can true happiness be found

329
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:39,541
by merely forgetting? ...See
ya next time on the Railways!
