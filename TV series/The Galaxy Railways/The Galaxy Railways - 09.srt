1
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,375
Each and every one of us
have all sorts of memories,

2
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,916
both good and bad,

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,166
that we keep buried deep
inside of our hearts.

4
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,000
We also have
cherished memories

5
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,875
that we want to keep in
our thoughts forever...

6
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,291
Regardless of the
effect they have on us,

7
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,500
these memories are the
record of our lives...

8
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,750
What's more, they may
be the evidence we need

9
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,916
to prove that
we're alive.

10
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,666
I guess the
Electromagnetic Interference

11
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,916
at Ariadne Junction's
good for something.

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,458
I bet we'll get two
days vacation out of it.

13
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:41,000
Bruce, it's not like you to
be happy about missing work.

14
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,166
Whatever. I hear the food's
pretty decent around here.

15
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,041
I hear the wine's
not bad either.

16
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,666
Gosh, it's so
beautiful here.

17
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,583
Yeah, it
really is nice.

18
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,250
This is just
the town center.

19
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,458
Planet Dio is better known
for its historic sights

20
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,250
built by its
aboriginals.

21
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,833
You should explore the natural
beauty while you're here.

22
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,000
It's truly
unforgettable.

23
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,250
Why Thank you, Captain!
I didn't think you

24
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,125
thought about anything
other than work!

25
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:08,416
Hmm? Well, we're at the mercy
of Mother Nature on this one.

26
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,958
So get plenty
of rest

27
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,791
because we'll probably work
even harder to make up for it.

28
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,083
Not only is this
planet beautiful,

29
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,125
it has a magical aura
about it, don't you think?

30
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,750
Well, the local
tribes definitely have

31
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,291
some mysterious stories
about their historical sites.

32
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,500
I'd like to hear some of
them! I love a good mystery!

33
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,000
You won't be able
to see him you know.

34
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:38,291
Excuse me. Were
you talking to me?

35
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,708
I guess not.

36
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,125
Weren't we, supposed to meet
up with David and Bruce?

37
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,791
Hey, you two!
We're over here!

38
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:52,791
He's feeling
no pain.

39
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,083
Empty...

40
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,708
Hey! Did you ever
hear of sharing!

41
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,625
I'm not even
drinking, David!

42
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,666
Oh? Well why not?
You should be.

43
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,541
When are you gonna loosen up,
kid? You're way too serious.

44
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,125
You have to relax and enjoy
life every once in a while.

45
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,666
Would you
please stop that!

46
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,500
Okay, have
it your way.

47
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,000
But if you don't
chill out a little

48
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,458
we're going to need nine lives
just to be able to work

49
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,916
with the likes of you...
Isn't that right, Bruce?

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,791
Yeah, I can't stand
workin' with him.

51
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,000
Not even
for a minute.

52
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,875
Why do you have to
be such a jerk, Bruce?!

53
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,458
I may not be perfect but
I'm doing the best I can!

54
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,833
I envy the way you can
make excuses like that.

55
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,875
You're doing your best so
that makes it all better,

56
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:31,541
is that it?

57
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,833
That's enough now.
Let's enjoy ourselves.

58
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:39,583
Manabu, you should be
ashamed of yourselves.

59
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,375
How's it going? Welcome
to Dio, friends.

60
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,750
I guess you came here to
meet ol' Salye, am I right?

61
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,416
But aren't you guys
a little too young

62
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,708
to have memories that
you wanna get rid of?

63
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,458
Now that sour puss over
there is a different story.

64
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,500
He seems to have some excess
baggage. Ha, ha, ha, ha!

65
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,833
Uh, mister,
who is this Salye?

66
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,750
Wait a while and
Salye will come;

67
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,458
come to steal a memory
you don't want anymore.

68
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,125
He steals
peoples' memories?

69
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,541
Mm-hm. That's right.
But who knows,

70
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,083
this whole thing might
be an elaborate fantasy

71
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,708
some people created 'cause all
of us have a memory or two

72
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,875
that we'd like to have erased.
That's where Salye comes in.

73
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,208
Oh! There you
are, Manabu!

74
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,583
What happened earlier?
You just disappeared.

75
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:29,958
I was worried
about you.

76
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,625
I just came out
here to think.

77
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,750
You're not
still upset

78
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,583
with what Bruce said
earlier, are you?

79
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:40,583
Nah, not really. He's
always like that.

80
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,708
Here!
Have some!

81
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,541
Eating candy always makes
me feel better! Go ahead!

82
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,166
These are my
favorite chocolates!

83
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,708
The best in
the galaxy!

84
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,250
Try one!
They're delicious!

85
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,750
Gotcha!

86
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,583
Hey, Louis... do you have
any memories you wanna lose?

87
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,125
Well, I guess if
I thought about it

88
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,000
I could come
up with a few.

89
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,250
Like?

90
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,625
Oh, like the time I
dropped some ice cream

91
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,250
on my dress
and ruined it.

92
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,708
Or when I got an F on
that big algebra exam.

93
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:11,541
and the time that I got in
a big fight with my Dad.

94
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,625
Hmm?! Why am I telling
you all this?!

95
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,583
Don't worry. I thought they'd
be more important than that.

96
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,083
What's that supposed to
mean?! They are important!

97
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,791
Hm! Sorry...

98
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:25,458
I just asked because I have
good and bad memories...

99
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,625
But none that I would
ever want to part with.

100
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,375
I treasure each and
every one of them-

101
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,083
no matter how
painful they are.

102
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,333
Is this your
treasure, Mister?

103
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,666
Who's there?!

104
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,833
Hmmm... Wow. This thing's
loaded with memories.

105
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:41,958
Give it back!!

106
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,666
Here!

107
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,166
Hmm! It's
stupid anyway!

108
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:46,875
Hey! Come
back here!

109
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,958
Gone... Who the
heck was that guy?

110
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:56,083
Manabu!
It was him!

111
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:08,083
Memories I'd be willing
to lose? Yeah... Owen.

112
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,541
Hey, Bruce, if you're
not gonna drink that!

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,250
Ugh! Nasty! It's
cold! Well, hey!

114
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,875
I've been looking all over for
you! I'm your new partner!

115
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:31,041
Name's Owen! I've heard a lot
about you! How's it goin'!

116
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:35,375
I don't work well
with partners.

117
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,250
You know, Bruce...
Owen's new here

118
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,833
and he's just
trying to fit in...

119
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:44,208
why don't you cut him a
little slack, all right?

120
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,166
Hmm?

121
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,958
Here you go,
partner. It's hot!

122
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,416
I thought I told you that
I don't work with partners.

123
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,583
I get it. Toxic
Bruce, right?

124
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,750
Yeah. I heard you lost
your last two partners.

125
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:02,375
Huh! Is that so!? Well all the
nasty gossip you heard is true.

126
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,875
So I'd suggest that you
leave before it's too late.

127
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,416
Unless of course you
have a death wish.

128
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,541
Stop it, Bruce!

129
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,916
You're the one
whose gonna die!

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,125
What?

131
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,416
'Cause I'm Owen The
Immortal. I can't die.

132
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,625
It's time you faced
the facts Bruce...

133
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,125
I'm your third
and last partner!

134
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,166
Might as well
get used to it.

135
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,625
Yuck! It got cold again! This
is all your fault, partner!

136
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,166
Anyway I plan on changing your
nickname from Toxic Bruce

137
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,708
to just
plain Bruce!

138
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,291
Now what've you got
to say for yourself?

139
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,833
Hey! I'm serious! This
is no laughing matter!

140
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,666
Damn! You
guys're weird!!

141
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,833
Well, now don't tell me you're
playing The Toxic Bruce Blues?

142
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,750
Am I supposed
to feel sad?

143
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,958
It's the blues.
What do you think?

144
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,125
I think it's time to rock
out with Owen, the Immortal!

145
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,166
Go, Owen!
All right!

146
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,958
Come on, Bruce! Don't just
sit there! Let her rip!

147
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:54,500
Bruce?

148
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,625
It's mine now!!

149
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:10,041
Hey you!! Bruce!
Are you all right?!

150
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,916
What happened?!
Are you okay?!

151
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,041
Ah... What was I just
doing? Who is this guy?

152
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:19,750
Bruce?!

153
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,666
Too much
partying...

154
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,333
I guess I'm
getting old...

155
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,791
Well, I'm going to get
some rest. Goodnight.

156
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,666
There's no
way... Is there?

157
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,041
Think, Bruce!

158
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,291
Are you saying you
don't remember

159
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,875
anything about
yesterday?

160
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,208
Not one thing at
all? Come on!

161
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,375
Give me a break. We
had a lot of wine.

162
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,375
Look at this!

163
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,708
Three years
ago, huh?

164
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,208
Forget that for now!
What about Owen?!

165
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,125
Owen?

166
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,583
Hey, good
morning, guys.

167
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,875
Ah, Manabu! You haven't
eaten breakfast yet, right?

168
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,541
Pull up a chair
and join me!

169
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,166
David, what's
going on here?

170
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,125
It's
Salye!

171
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,125
Then that was
him last night!

172
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,666
Did you two have something
stolen last night?!

173
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,791
No. I, uh,
got it back.

174
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,250
Unfortunately, I can't
say the same for Bruce.

175
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,500
He had something
precious stolen;

176
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:18,625
a memory of
a dear friend.

177
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,875
Bruce! What
happened last night?!

178
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,250
You've got to
try to remember!

179
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,708
Who's the friend that
David said you forgot?!

180
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,750
What are you guys talking
about? Who have I forgotten?

181
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,500
Owen, Bruce!
Your old partner!

182
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,458
I can't believe that you can
just forget him like this!

183
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,541
Come on!

184
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,083
Salye's only supposed
to take memories

185
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,625
that people wanna lose! But if
this Owen guy's your friend,

186
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,125
aren't your memories
of him precious?

187
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,833
Bruce! Don't let
him go like this!

188
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,500
You've got to
try to hold on!

189
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,083
Now that's enough! I
haven't lost any memories!!

190
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:57,125
Bruce!

191
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,416
What's wrong with me? What's
this anxiety I'm feeling.

192
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,125
I felt so
good earlier.

193
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,416
Hey, Mister! Wait
a second! Please!

194
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,083
You had a painful
experience, didn't you?

195
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,666
How did you get Salye to
take the memory away?

196
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,375
Look, if this is some
kind of pick up line?

197
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:17,166
So, you really don't
remember do you...?

198
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,833
Please,
forgive me.

199
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,500
Why...? Why don't
you ever come to me?

200
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,500
Are you okay?

201
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,666
'Cause I don't like to be
chased around. That's why.

202
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,916
Salye?!
It's you!

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,208
Salye?

204
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,000
Please, Salye! I beg you!
Take my memory away!

205
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,750
I don't want to remember
him! It's too painful!

206
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,916
H-Hey! What'd you do
to her?! Get away!

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,375
Miss!
Are you okay?!

208
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,083
Well yes... Of course...
Why wouldn't I be?

209
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,708
What a
beautiful day!

210
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,250
All right! What'd
you do to her!?

211
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,083
You're kidding... 
That's her memory?

212
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:12,041
Then it's true... What David
said... It really happened.

213
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,958
So Salye is real
after all. Amazing.

214
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,500
You've actually heard of
Salye before, Captain?

215
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,333
Of course. But I just
assumed that he was a myth;

216
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,791
another legend made up by
the planet's aborigines.

217
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,791
Captain! Have
you seen Bruce?!

218
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,750
He's not in the hotel. David's
out looking for him now.

219
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,041
I heard about what
happened and I thought

220
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,625
that Yuki might be able
to do something for him.

221
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,666
Is it serious,
Sir? Is Bruce okay?

222
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,916
I don't think so. Sounds like
he has a little memory loss.

223
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,250
I hope he's
all right.

224
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,541
Also, Captain, the Ariadne
Junction Observatory

225
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,000
has just reported that the
Electromagnetic Interference

226
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,291
should be over in
about nine hours.

227
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,625
Very good. Make sure we're
ready to take-off by then.

228
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,958
Yes, Sir.
Will do.

229
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,750
Hey, Captain... Do
you think that Bruce

230
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,208
really had his
memory stolen.

231
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,500
Is something like
that even possible?

232
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,416
We could investigate... But
we're leaving in nine hours.

233
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,625
Inform Bruce
and David.

234
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,875
But, Sir! We can't
just leave like this!

235
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,375
There's nothing we
can do about it now!

236
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,500
It's up to Bruce to get
his own memory back.

237
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,916
It's best not
to interfere.

238
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,416
But, Sir!

239
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,416
Let's go,
Louis!

240
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,916
Where to?

241
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We've got nine hours to help
Bruce get his memory back...

242
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,000
I don't think
I can take him

243
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,541
being all sweet to
me like that.

244
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:35,875
What did he steal?
I can't remember.

245
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:55,000
What was it?! It
was something awful!

246
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,000
Let's go
look for him.

247
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:05,750
I really like this
one. It's so beautiful.

248
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,500
Let's suppose we
manage to find him.

249
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,291
How do we know we
can get it back?

250
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,125
We don't. But
we have to try.

251
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,125
Thieves don't like
to give things back.

252
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:26,458
That's true... Oh, by the way.
You owe me an Able, Bruce.

253
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,125
And why's that?

254
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,125
Well, what're you gonna
do if you run into Salye.

255
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:35,666
Memories I want to lose,
eh...? What about you, David?

256
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,000
You went through
some rough times.

257
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,666
You were dumped by
someone you loved.

258
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,791
Wouldn't you want Salye
to steal that one?

259
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,916
Irene, right? Why'd you
have to bring that up?

260
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,875
I'd definitely give
that one away,

261
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,333
but I certainly wouldn't want
someone to steal it from me.

262
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,333
I'll bet you an Able
Salye would steal that one

263
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,541
before he stole
any of mine.

264
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,041
All right, it's a bet. If
I have a memory stolen

265
00:15:56,125 --> 00:16:00,458
I owe you an Able. If you
have one stolen, you owe me.

266
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,166
Sorry, but a
bet's a bet.

267
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,333
I can't believe he
passed up Irene.

268
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,916
I've never wanted to forget
Irene. I loved it all;

269
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,041
the good, the bad,
and the nasty.

270
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:14,250
Not me... I've always wished
that I could forget Owen.

271
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,750
It was exhilarating
at first-

272
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,708
like a weight had been
lifted off my shoulders.

273
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,000
But not not now.
Now I feel empty...

274
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,875
like... like, there's
a void inside me.

275
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:29,208
That's not who I think it
is, is it...? Bruce! Salye!

276
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,708
This is
our chance!

277
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,458
Wait! Don't go! We want
to talk to you, Kid!

278
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,125
There's nothing
to talk about.

279
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,458
I really don't need
to see you anymore.

280
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,625
We've come to
talk to you

281
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,458
about the memory that
you stole from me.

282
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,000
Well, I won't give
it back so forget it!

283
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,916
It's my
very favorite.

284
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,916
Yeah, that wouldn't
be right...

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,416
I wouldn't give
it back either.

286
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,958
Why don't we make a little
bet? I'll flip this coin.

287
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,541
If it's heads, you give
him back his memory.

288
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:17,416
But if it's tails, you keep
the coin and the memory.

289
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,791
A coin?

290
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,958
You haven't seen a
coin before? Here look?

291
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,958
She's beautiful.
Who is she?

292
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,375
That's Queen
Millennia.

293
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,541
Hey! Not so fast! This
coin's very special.

294
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,041
You can't hold it unless
you win the bet...

295
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,833
What d'ya say?
Should I flip it?

296
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,416
Yes! I want
to win it!!

297
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,125
Okay.
Here goes.

298
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,916
Let's look...
It's heads.

299
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,208
Looks like we
won, David.

300
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,291
Yep. It was heads. Now give
the memory back. You promised.

301
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,500
No way!

302
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,166
D'you have any idea
what happens to you

303
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,583
when you break
a promise?

304
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,708
This is
what happens!!

305
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,166
Okay! You win!
Take it! Please!

306
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,458
Hey, David!
Bruce! Sayle...

307
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,375
You got your memory
back! Didn't you?!

308
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,666
So, how do we put
this back in his head?

309
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,541
Just smash it on any
rock around here.

310
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,791
Bruce?!

311
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,791
What's wrong? What are you
waiting for, Bruce?! Do it!

312
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:20,791
What's the
matter?

313
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,666
I can't!

314
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:27,625
Yes you can!
You have to!

315
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:35,166
It will hurt even more
if you lose it Bruce!

316
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,375
Get rid of
his weapon!

317
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,708
Right!!

318
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,208
Well, so much
for that!

319
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,875
Just another walk in the
park. Let's get out of here.

320
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,083
Bruce!!
Look out!!

321
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,416
Owen!

322
00:18:55,666 --> 00:19:00,625
Owen! No! David, quick! Send
Yuki! Owen's been hit!!

323
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,375
Damn... Guess
I screwed up.

324
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,541
Owen!

325
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,750
It's not your fault... I
let my guard down, Bruce...

326
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,791
I knew
better.

327
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,208
Try not to talk!
Yuki's on the way!

328
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,958
I'm all right.

329
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,791
I told you... I'm
immortal, partner.

330
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:21,791
Stop
talking!

331
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,416
You just wait...

332
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:29,333
I'll prove that you're not
Toxic Bruce... anymore. Okay?

333
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:34,416
Owen... Owen! Don't
quit on me now!

334
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:43,125
OWEN!!!!

335
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,750
Bruce?

336
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,416
You're the
strangest guy ever.

337
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,916
I took it so you wouldn't
remember the pain.

338
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,083
Pain is what helps
us to grow, silly.

339
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,666
Here's one guy who feels
uneasy if a scar gets erased.

340
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,291
I thought I was
making everyone happy.

341
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,250
How 'bout I teach you a way to
get memories without stealing?

342
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,375
Just make a bet with
that! If you win,

343
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,958
ask them to share their
memories with you.

344
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,125
What if
I lose?

345
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,791
Well, then you can
share yours with them.

346
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,333
Goodbye,
Salye.

347
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,333
You know, I might just come
back here and see you someday.

348
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,500
Bye bye, now!!

349
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,416
At times, it's true
that certain memories

350
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,625
can seem like they're too
heavy a burden to carry.

351
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,958
But when we're faced
with losing them,

352
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,666
we are forced to recognize
for the first time

353
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,750
how very precious those painful
memories have been to us.

354
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,000
And what was
once a burden

355
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,166
can then become our
greatest treasure.

356
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:47,791
Yuuki!

357
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,333
Stop daydreaming!
The vacation's over!

358
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,375
Time to get
to work!

359
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,833
Right! Maybe having
the nice Bruce

360
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,000
wouldn't have been
so bad after all.

361
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,833
Naa. Things
don't seem right

362
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:02,416
unless Bruce is yelling
at you! Oh, no!!

363
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,833
Louis! What is
it? What's wrong?!

364
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,541
My chocolate!
Someone snatched it!

365
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,666
I had it right here!
I don't believe it!

366
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,458
Mmm! That pretty girl
sure has good chocolate!

367
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,791
Hi, this is Yuki. I'm
not human- I'm artificial.

368
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:27,875
So it's a
bit surprising

369
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,583
when some of our
Sirius Platoon members

370
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,833
go to such great
lengths to protect me;

371
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:34,375
Even placing their own
lives in grave danger...

372
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,041
See you next time
on the Railways!
